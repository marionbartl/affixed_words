The second conference devoted to all things about the D Programming Language
Viacom has backed off a request to gain access to all YouTube user histories after public outcry over privacy concerns , according to a YouTube blog post .
Viacom has backed off a request to gain access to all YouTube user histories after public outcry over privacy concerns , according to a YouTube blog post .
" We are pleased to report that Viacom , MTV and other litigants have backed off their original demand for all users ' viewing histories and we will not be providing that information , " YouTube said in a statement .
Earlier this month , Judge Louis Stanton with the U.S. District Court for Southern New York ruled that Google must provide Viacom with YouTube user histories in Viacom 's ongoing $ 1 billion copyright infringement lawsuit against the video Web site .
That meant that Google had to hand over all the information contained in its logging database , including the login ID of the users who have watched videos , the time they started to watch the video , users ' IP address , and the video identifier .
Privacy advocates were aghast and said the ruling threatened to expose the identities of millions of YouTube users .
Viacom had argued that the information it requested would not contain personally identifiable data .
Whether or not an IP address contains such data has been a point of contention .
Some argue that not much can be garnered from a bunch of numbers , but combine that with someone 's search history or username , and a more industrious Web user might be able to piece some things together about that user 's identity .
Under Monday 's deal between YouTube and Viacom , YouTube will basically mask user IDs , IP addresses and visitor IDs and describe them in some other manner .
The two parties have not yet agreed how that will happen , but under the agreement , YouTube has seven days after the court approves the deal to come up with a workable plan .
Viacom also agreed not to circumvent any encryption techniques YouTube might put in place to protect user identities .
Viacom is apparently still seeking to evaluate the activity of YouTube employees and agents on the site because the masking technique they agreed upon for the average users does not extend to employees and agents , according to the filing .
Viacom and YouTube plan to meet on that issue in the next 14 days , it said .
YouTube said Monday that it remains " committed to protecting your privacy and we 'll continue to fight for your right to share and broadcast your work on YouTube . "
Dwight Gooden , going the distance in the Mets ' 3 - 0 victory over San Francisco at Shea Stadium en route to his 13th consecutive win , whiffs 16 batters to become the first National League pitcher to strike out 200 or more batters in each of his first two seasons .
The 20 year - old sophomore , who has not lost since May 25 , when LA 's Fernando Valenzuela beat him , improves his record to 19 - 3 with his sixth shutout of the year .
No idea how that guy can be taken seriously .
Shorter version : CO2 is not a greenhouse gas because he says so .
I tried to distill the few , um , scientific , arguments in between the spam :
Well , it is simply not happening .
Worldwide there was a significant natural warming trend in the 1980 ’s and 1990 ’s as a Solar cycle peaked with lots of sunspots and solar flares .
That ended in 1998 and now the Sun has gone quiet with fewer and fewer Sun spots , and the global temperatures have gone into decline .
You know you can stop reading as soon as you are told that the earth has cooled since 1998 .
Anyway , the connection with the sun has been debunked multiple times already .
Earth has cooled for almost ten straight years .
No , it has n’t .
Let me illustrate .
I estimate that this square in front of my face contains 100,000 molecules of atmosphere .
Of those 100,000 only 38 are CO2 ; 38 out of a hundred thousand .
That makes it a trace component .
Let me ask a key question : how can this tiny trace upset the entire balance of the climate of Earth ?
It ca n ’t .
That ’s all there is to it ; it can’t .
Not sure what he is trying to say here , all he has demonstrated is his impressive ability to divide by ten .
I guess he thinks that because the mixing ratio is small it cannot have a large effect .
Which is quite silly , because a lot lower mixing ration of cyanide will have a devastating effect on your body for example .
And there a lot more effective toxins .
Well , the point is that CO2 is a triatomic gas , which does absorb infrared radiation , while the much more common gases ( nitrogen , oxygen and argon ) have two or just one atom .
That makes a lot of difference .
And that ’s not just something pulled out of thin air , it can be measured .
( Pun not intended , but tolerated ) .
One point Coleman makes repeatedly is the claim that the only greenhouse gas we are worried would be carbon dioxide , which is n’t quite correct .
There are also methane , nitrous oxide and , to a lesser extent , CFCs .
The rest of the article does n’t contain any scientific arguments .
This one certainly is n’t :
I suspect you have n’t heard it because the mass media did not report it , but I am not alone on the no man -made warming side of this issue .
On May 20th , a list of the names of over thirty - one thousand scientists who refute global warming was released .
Thirty - one thousand of which 9,000 are Ph.ds .
Think about that .
Well , I did think about it and found that there are 22,000 scientists without a PhD on that list .
Anyway , it seems to be quite easy to get onto that list .
And this is not a signature contest in the first place .
Coleman opened his speech with :
You may want to give credit where credit is due to Al Gore and his global warming campaign the next time you fill your car with gasoline , because there is a direct connection between Global Warming and four dollar a gallon gas .
Later he argues :
The battle against fossil fuels has controlled policy in this country for decades .
It was the environmentalist ’s prime force in blocking any drilling for oil in this country and the blocking the building of any new refineries , as well .
So now the shortage they created has sent gasoline prices soaring .
Completely wrong .
For example .
drilling in the ANWR would decrease the price of gasoline by 2 cents .
And the refineries are underutilized .
Who cares , when we can have a cheap shot at the evil environmentalists .
If Al Gore and his global warming scare dictates the future policy of our governments , the current economic downturn could indeed become a recession , drift into a depression and our modern civilization could fall into an abyss .
And it would largely be a direct result of the global warming frenzy .
Sounds alarmist , does n’t it ?
Powerful Stocks Bull Market As US Hyper Power Prepares for Global Hegemony
Back in the late 20th century there were predictions that the 21st century would be characterized by “ resource wars ” where fighting breaks out between countries and aligned groups of countries , as they scramble to secure increasingly scarce commodities for themselves , principally oil and water .
Barely had we entered the new century when a major resource war began , with the big surprise being that it was not some banana republic suddenly deciding to invade and loot its neighbor 's territory , but instead the most powerful country on earth muscling its way around an entire region on the other side of the planet in order to position itself to plunder its oil resources en masse for itself .
I want it all , I want it now - but then what ?
- most projections show Peak
Oil to be occurring about now , or to be imminent .
We have all heard about “ Peak Oil ” , which is oil production peaking and then tailing off gradually , due to finite supplies dwindling and remaining reserves being increasingly difficult and costly to both find and extract .
The timing of the peak depends on who you listen to but is supposed to occur anytime between a couple of years ago and about 2020 - 2030 , but in any event we are historically speaking close to it , and now , with the world population continuing to expand and booming demand from up - and - coming economies with massive populations like China and India , steadily increasing demand for oil is colliding with relatively fixed or even declining supply .
The result of this can only be rising prices , which will continue to rise until demand moderates sufficiently to bring about a rebalancing of supply and demand .
The big problem with oil is that it is so central to everything and still so incredibly cheap in relation to the energy it supplies and its sheer usefulness , that prices will have to rise to much higher levels before demand is choked off sufficiently to bring about an enduring state of balance between supply and demand - only in the case of severe global recession resulting in a big reduction in economic activity would this upward price pressure abate , and that , of course , is exactly what a continued steep rise in the oil price may bring about .
The United States , more than any other country , is an economy dependant on an abundant supply of cheap oil .
The per capita use of oil in the US vastly outstrips that of most countries in the world , the two principal reasons for this being that the infrastructure of the country has been developed on the assumption that cheap oil will continue indefinitely , and the other reason is that taxes on gasoline are held are much lower levels than in many other nations for political reasons .
Back around the middle of the last century the big oil companies in the US , with the collusion of government , set out to intentionally destroy the public transport system in the US , in order to force the population to use automobiles more and thus burn more gas netting more profits for oil companies , and they were largely successful in achieving this objective .
For the same reason they also encouraged massive urban sprawl and the development of suburbia , so that millions of people have to drive huge distances to get to work - a reason why gas taxes have to be held at much lower levels than in other countries such as Great Britain , where they are exorbitantly high .
Clearly , if affordable gasoline disappears , then the countless vast tracts of suburbia in the US will become middle class ghettoes .
Once you grasp the implications of this you will immediately comprehend why the United States is particularly aggressive about access to oil supplies and will stop at nothing to secure them .
The United States is structured geared to the profligate consumption of oil and would collapse without it .
Are n't we lucky to be alive now , instead of in AD1000 or 3000 .
The oil and gas reserves of the planet , which took millions of years to form , have been and are being plundered and burned up recklessly in the space of a mere one to two hundred years .
Like greedy children cramming a sudden bonanza of chocolates and sweets into their faces until they have nothing left , individuals - and corporations and governments - have selfishly and thoughtlessly squandered this precious resource without any regard for the needs of future generations .
You only have to look around you at the vast volumes of largely unnecessary traffic - businessmen flying halfway across the world to sign a paper , holidaymakers taking a four hour flight to lay on a sunbed in a gated compound and read for a week , commuters who drive for an hour or two to get to the office and whose work will be viewed by future historians as being of considerably less value than the energy they consumed in getting to their workplace .
The scale of unnecessary consumption and sheer waste is mind - boggling , and , of course , it cannot and will not continue indefinitely .
Once the energy that took millions of years to form and only two hundred years or so to burn up is gone , it 's gone .
The day of reckoning will be upon us and human beings who have bred like flies on the back of this bonanza will face starvation by the hundreds of millions or billions if substantive measures are not taken in time to make good the energy shortfall by means of other fuels .
This will be hard luck for the victims but great news for the planet which is groaning under the strain of unimaginable hordes of human beings projected to reach about 11 billion by the year 2050 .
Alternative energy sources such as wind and water power , which take a lot of energy initially to create and install , may not be available in sufficient quantity or in time to fill the massive void - it is thought to be only Uranium that has a realistic chance of meeting the enormous energy needs .
We are now starting to feel the first winds of this energy - food maelstrom with sharply rising global food prices , caused in part by rising oil prices , already putting a huge strain on the world 's poor , many of whom are on the verge of starvation , if not actually starving .
Will it come to this ?
- it nearly did in the early 70's , when these vouchers were printed but not used .
As we entered this unique century , the greatest economic and military power in the world , the United States , still basking in the glory of facing down and defeating the Soviet Union , had the choice of getting together with the other nations of the world and arriving at a common and equitable agreement regarding how to apportion and parcel out the world 's dwindling fossil fuel energy supplies in the coming decades .
Instead of taking this enlightened route it has decided instead to adopt the primitive “ me first ” approach and has embarked on an old - fashioned campaign of colonial conquest , with a few sycophants in tow such as Britain hoping to get “ a piece of the action ” .
This is , of course , very bad news for the planet , not just because of the colonial powers ' plans to make off with most of the pie , but because of the vast misuse of resources required to secure a disproportionate share of the pie in the first place , which has involved considerable death and destruction , including a lot of Iraqi civilians and US servicemen .
How you view the invasion of Iraq depends entirely on your perspective - if you are an Iraqi citizen who has lost family members you might fairly view it as a disaster , if you are family of a dead US serviceman you might be very sad , but proud that your young man “ died defending his country from terrorists ” , if you are an ecologist you would likely be dismayed at the destruction and pollution , such as the leveling of the town of Fallujah and the peppering of areas of the country with depleted uranium , if you have any humanitarian inclinations at all you might be upset by the routine ill - treatment of prisoners and the destruction of the society and way of life of the country , if you are Jewish you might be delighted that one more Arab country has been neutered , if you run a company that supplies skilled mercenaries and technical people you will be rubbing your hands together with glee at all the extra profits rolling in , if you are a senior oil company executive you will be popping champagne corks at the prospect of vast new reserves waiting to be exploited .
Perhaps the greatest irony is that the typical suburban commuter in the US who was all for the war a few years back “ to smoke out and kill those goddamned terrorists ” is now against it because of the enormous cost and the material damage suffered by the army , not least the dead and injured soldiers .
Yet , if you were to sit down and calmly explain to these average folk that the invasion of Iraq has secured such vast oil reserves for the United States , that they will be able to continue their long commute for many years to come and quite possibly continue their profligate lifestyle , their faces would suddenly light up and they would exclaim that the invasion probably was n't such a bad idea after all .
If Bush came clean and went on television and explained all this in an open and honest way , millions of voters would suddenly adore him and petition Congress to amend the Constitution to allow him to serve a third term and he would doubtless be voted back in a landslide victory .
Day that changed the world - without the catastrophic events of this day , the “ War on Terror ” would not have been possible - and neither would the invasion of Iraq .
Defining moment : this heavily stage - managed event symbolized the conquest of Iraq .
Mission Accomplished - but invading was the “ easy ” part .
War Hero - George W Bush “ struts his stuff ” on the USS Abraham Lincoln , on the high seas about 30 miles from the coast of San Diego .
We know that the US “ defense ” budget , already enormous as the century started , has ballooned to gargantuan levels , exceeding the military budgets of every other country in the world combined .
The reasons for this are not just the resource wars already underway , but the massive increases are also a preparation for squaring up to China and Russia with the intention of forcing them into submission at some point in the future .
We would also be remiss in not pointing out the inclination by numerous US congressmen to sluice vast sums of government money and contracts in the direction of their numerous cronies in the defense and oil industries as an important factor in escalating the defense budget .
The corn-methanol industry in the US , which apparently uses more fossil fuel energy in its creation than you get back in energy from the finished product , is growing as quickly as it is because members of government are unwilling to say no to the powerful corn lobby in the mid-west , who are in many cases their constituency .
This industry , which diverts food into the production of fuel , is a contributing factor to rising global food prices , and gives a big 2 - fingered salute to the world 's poor .
Oil chess board - no prizes for guessing where they 're headed next .
The major resource war currently underway involves the United States and its acolytes forcibly invading and taking control of those countries in the Mid-East that are not already client states , which the aim of completely controlling the Mid-Eastern oilfields .
The invasion of Afghanistan , which does not have much oil , was a strategic geopolitical move .
The invasion of Iraq was designed to secure a major prize , as Iraq is sat on the world 's second largest oil reserves .
That only leaves Iran , which will prove to be a tougher nut to crack , more about which later , and Syria , which will be a cakewalk , and does n‘t have much oil and so is of limited interest anyway .
A by - product of these military adventures is the elimination or at least neutering of Israel 's enemies .
Should the masses rise up and overthrow their feudal overlords in Saudi Arabia , then it may become necessary to invade that country too .
Of course , it would n't have looked good to the electorate back home if one day George Bush had gone on television and announced “ Hey , the world 's running out of oil , and so you can continue to drive around in your SUV's and zig - zag around the country on airplanes , we are going to invade Iraq and take their oil ” .
So they had to come up with something that would make it more palatable , hence the absurdly named “ War on Terror ” which sounds goofy but is good enough for the masses .
The War on Terror is a crude deception , a fig leaf , designed to provide a façade behind which to conduct a good old - fashioned war of colonial conquest .
The only reason it is not questioned more in the mainstream media is that the government controls the mainstream media and they do as they are told .
You had to have a reason for the War on Terror , something to lend it some credibility , and that reason was provided by the catastrophic events of September 11th 2001 .
Turning now to Iran , this is the only remaining significant country in the Mid-East that is not already either a client state of the United States or big western oil multinationals , like Saudi Arabia or the Gulf states , or already subject to military occupation .
It is not in compliance , and can therefore expect to be forcibly dealt with at some point in the future .
If it had no oil , and was not perceived to be a potential threat to Israel , it would perhaps be left alone , but it does have oil and Israel , at least , perceives it to be a threat .
Now , it is known that Bush and Cheney would like to “ finish the job ” and complete their hat trick of 3 invasions before they leave office - Afghanistan , Iraq and Iran , but unfortunately the US military has been so worn down by the attrition of Iraq that it is presently in no state to mount a sustainable invasion of Iran .
Furthermore , it makes sense to take the time to digest the gains already made before moving on to the next campaign .
This will involve straightening out the security situation in Iraq , at least regarding the protection of US military personnel and the oil company operatives who are waiting in the wings to exploit the territories ' oil wealth .
Then the military can regroup and prepare themselves for pastures new .
In the meantime the “ easy ” option of heavy bombing of Iran , designed to weaken it militarily and neuter it economically , with the aim , sooner or later , of moving in to seize at least the south - western corner of the country , where the vast bulk of Iran 's oil is located , remains on the table .
The eventual aim is thought to be to gain control of the country as part of the long - term strategic goal of surrounding Russia , possibly by subverting the government and installing a US - friendly puppet regime , along the lines of the color coded governments such as the orange one in the Ukraine - a new Shah of Iran perhaps ?
Even though an attempted invasion of Iran before the November elections is considered most unlikely , for logistical reasons , a bombing campaign remains a possibility .
With regard to the timing of this we must look to the mainstream media for clues .
The public mind must be prepared to accept such an operation , with clustered news items to the effect that Iran is responsible for attacks on US troops , on The Green Zone , and for arming the insurgents etc .
The consequences of a bombing campaign by the US , and possibly Britain and Israel on Iran are somewhat unpredictable , to say the least , but one thing we can fairly sure of and that is that the price of oil will spike spectacularly .
The price has already been climbing steadily for weeks , which may even be due in part to anticipation of such an attack , and a major supply disruption will send it through the roof .
Technically , the oil price has arrived at the top of its long - term uptrend channel , and in the absence of military action against Iran in the near future , or a buildup towards the same , it looks set to react back across its trend channel or at least consolidate for a while .
Traders and investors in crude oil and oil stocks should however remain aware of the risk of an attack , which if it does take place can be expected to cause a dramatic spike .
Gold and silver would also spike in consequence .
According to their logic the US elites have good reason to feel pleased with themselves following the successful takeover of Iraq , even if the general public in the United States is unable at this stage to grasp what a “ glorious achievement ” it is .
Iraq is known to have over 100 billion barrels of oil reserves .
In addition to this the country is still relatively unexplored and there are an estimated 200 to 300 billion barrels more waiting to be discovered .
Given that this is largely light crude , the most valuable type of oil , it does n't take much effort of the imagination to figure that US forces have seized control of one of the world 's greatest treasures , whose value dwarfs the cost of the invasion .
The invasion of Iraq would therefore be a strong contender for an entry in the Guinness World Records as the greatest act of piracy in the history of the world .
It makes the exploits of Blackbeard and Captain Jack Sparrow look decidedly tame .
With this being election year in the US , various politicians try to curry favor with the voters by talking about “ bringing the troops home ” .
So let 's be clear about this - the troops are not coming home until the infrastructure has been built to fully exploit Iraq oil resources , and to this end to partition off the local population who might otherwise interfere with production .
In fact , a background level of violence is actually desirable at this time , in order to provide the excuse to keep the troops there .
We should also not overlook the reality that the US elections are pure spin anyway , a charade .
The United States is not a democracy and has not been for a long time .
Its political system is a duopoly of power , with the same plutocratic forces controlling both the Democrat and Republican parties , the election being a 4 - yearly circus to fool the masses into thinking that they live in a democracy .
In one sense democracy is an absurd concept anyway - how can you allow ignorant , uneducated people the same vote as intelligent , discriminating people ?
The answer is that that you can - and then you program them to do what you want them to anyway via their favorite entertainment and media inputs .
If you spend an hour of your time going down to the polling station to vote , you have just wasted an hour of your life , except that it can be amusing to watch the other fools wasting their time lining up - thinking that they are going to make a difference .
Complete control of the Mid-East , which the United States and the major oil companies are now close to having achieved , of course confers massive power over the rest of world , in particular over rising economic powers such as China and India and the immense leverage that this will in time afford can be used to steer these countries in whatever direction is desired .
The US is believed to be involved in a strategic race against time to corner the bulk of the world 's remaining oil reserves , the control of which can then be used to dissuade countries like China from resorting to the wholesale dumping of dollars or US Treasuries , along the lines of “ Try it and we 'll cut off your oil supply ” , which one would expect to be couched in more diplomatic language .
Because of its gargantuan levels of debt the US is acutely vulnerable now , but with time it plans to tip the scales back in its favor partly by sales of its recently acquired plunder .
Anyone who has watched those David Attenborough nature programs about seal colonies on beaches will know that the US is like the “ beach master ” , the huge bull elephant seal , taking possession of all of the females on the beach and jealously guarding them , while China and Russia are the other strong contenders , who do n't quite have the strength or size to try to assert dominance and as a result can only make gains when the beach master suffers some drastic reversal of fortune .
The irony is that China now has the power to stop the US in its tracks , by dumping its vast dollar and Treasury holdings , which would send the US economy straight over a cliff , but it is unlikely it will do this because it can't stomach the consequences to itself or its people of doing so .
There are those who believe that the multinational oil companies and US interests will not be left in peace in Iraq to reap the fruits of their exploits .
What these people do n't understand is that in order to make it possible to develop Iraq 's oil infrastructure and actually ship out the oil in quantity an apartheid system will be created across the country , which is scheduled to be partitioned and balkanized .
The indigenous people will largely be confined to their towns and cities and specific rural areas and ruled over by the US installed puppet government - they wo n't be allowed anywhere near the oil installations , which will be run mainly by imported technicians and service personnel .
The country will essentially be run as an oilfield , with the original inhabitants being marginalized and viewed as incidental .
The infrastructure for this system of control is currently under construction and as it approaches completion the vulnerability of US and coalition military personnel and consequent casualties will decrease significantly .
This is a long article , and it is therefore important to conclude by focusing on the most important points .
1 . The resource wars of the 21st century are now well underway , with the US and Britain leading the charge in the Mid-East , behind the façade of the War on Terror .
The goal is complete control of the Mid-East oilfields , which will be achieved by a combination of the already existing client states such as Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states , and the forcible acquisition of remaining oil rich countries .
Logic dictates that the next country to be appropriated will be Iran , and although they would like to take in addition the oil rich countries around the Caspian Sea , an attempt to do so would result in a direct confrontation with Russia , so instead they will bide their time and likely attempt to subvert these countries politically .
2. Peak Oil is upon us , or very close at hand .
The combination of rising population and strong increase in demand for oil from developing countries such as China and India , coupled with inelasticity in demand for oil , at least on the downside , is likely to force a continuing uptrend in the price of oil , although this may be mitigated once Iraq is brought on stream in a big way .
3 . As the oil price is an underlying component of the price of food , the price of food is likely to continue to rise , a situation that will be exacerbated by the recently fashionable and rather bizarre practice of turning food into fuel .
This can be expected to lead to widespread unrest and possible anarchy in many poorer countries .
4 . The seizure of Iraq is widely perceived to be have been a blunder .
From the strategic standpoint of the US elites it was no such thing .
The oil reserves contained within Iraq are gigantic , and thus its acquisition was a major economic and security leap forward for the United States .
In addition its central position within the region and the earlier acquisition of Afghanistan make the eventual appropriation of oil - rich Iran an almost foregone conclusion .
In comparison with the US strategic planners , those in the European Union are hopelessly naïve and ineffectual - they can't even organize the trash collection in Naples .
5 . The United States is desperately sick economically , with an economy lamed by gargantuan debt , outsourcing and rampant speculation , and yet somehow it manages to spend more on its military machine than every other country in the world combined .
This is only possible because the dollar has been , up until now , the world currency , and because the US is living on the rest of the world 's savings .
The supreme irony is that the rest of the world is financing the US takeover of the Mid-East , and in a few years countries which have had , and have right now , the power to stop the US in its tracks by dumping dollars and Treasuries , but can't face the dire consequences of doing so , will have to kow - tow to the US for oil .
Once that time arrives they wo n't dare dump US paper and face the retribution of having their oil supply cut off and their economies shut down .
At present the US is only militarily the greatest power on earth , but in a few years it looks set to assume comprehensive hegemony of the planet , as the massive oil revenues from the spoils of the Mid-East campaigns flow in and correct the careening deficits .
China will then comply with US demands or the oil tap will be swiveled in the off direction .
Russia , currently blessed by an abundant supply of oil and other natural resources , should do well , but will be surrounded and eventually forced into compliance as its resources dwindle and it becomes increasingly isolated .
Britain , as the 1st officer of the US in its wars of acquisition , will enjoy a privileged place at the table in an increasingly resource starved world .
Israel will look on with quiet satisfaction at all of this .
6 . Now we crystallize the most important point of this article , which is what the whole thing has been leading up to .
As we have already noted , the United States is widely perceived as an economic basket case on account of its astronomic debts and weakened domestic economy , but it is in the process of seizing control of the world 's most important remaining oil reserves and bringing them on line .
Once it has achieved this it will not just be the greatest military power on earth but will assume center stage as the greatest economic power on earth as well and be completely unassailable .
By that time no other country will dare to , or perhaps even want to , dump dollars or US Treasuries .
As we have observed on www.clivemaund.com in the recent past , the US stockmarket has refused to make new lows ( apart from a fleeting intraday new low ) for a couple of months now , despite all the doom and gloom flying around , and the volume internals of the market are bullish .
So it would appear that Smart Money is beginning to get a handle on what 's cooking as set out here .
If our evaluation of the situation is correct , and China continues to play ball by not dumping US dollars or Treasuries , despite the Tibet provocation in the western media , then the US stockmarket is poised for a powerful bull market advance , as the injection of massive amounts of newly created liquidity works its magic and eases the global financial crisis .
This advance would initially take the market back to its highs , but should later continue on to new highs .
The huge global increases in money supply are of course highly inflationary and should continue to fuel a robust bull market in commodities , including gold and silver , even if they get put on the back burner and continue to correct for a while as the focus shifts to the broad stockmarket .
Right now the US stock markets are poised to break out above the crucial 1400 resistance level on the S&P500 index , an event that could easily trigger a 400 - 500 point up day on the Dow Jones Industrials .

The intentions with this blog is to provide Atheists withcontent from various sources .
We can all ramble about religion in a blog , but I think our ramblings become better with more facts .
And also , I need to be inspired to ramble so I 'd rather just present the news !
( I do ramble a lot on forums though ! )
Well , I decided to gather all the good and important stuff I come across here as safekeeping for myself and for everyone else .
What 's important and not important is not always so easy to say , although I tend to like science and the occasional good argument .
I also have a fetish for statistics
Some articles fall outside of what consider most pressing to post here , and since Google reader has a real nice " share " button and a page where my shared items go , I have decided to use it when I see stuff I like .
You can of course subscribe to it .
Being Norwegian , I occasionally come across good articles in Norwegian , Danish and Swedish so I 've set up a Scandinavian blog too at Dagens Ateist .
Get it out there .
Force the confrontation on these frankly absurd issues .
Let ’s talk and rave angrily and laugh about this garbage .
If that ’s in bad taste , so be it .
I ’m with The New Yorker on this one .
Desensitize the unspeakable by exposing it and making it speakable .
Ridicule it .
But Libby Spencer ’s idea for ramming home the point — realized here by yours truly — is really great .
Since Salon's Alex Koppelman caught Fox News characterizing Michelle Obama as " Obama 's Baby Mama , " there 's been an uproar over use of such an offensive term .
“ A producer on the program exercised poor judgment in using this chyron during the segment , ” Fox 's Senior Vice President of Programming Bill Shine said in a statement to Politico .
In addition to being insulting , the phrase " baby mama " is also inaccurate .
The Urban Dictionary defines " baby mama " as " the mother of your child ( ren ) , whom you did not marry and with whom you are not currently involved . "
Although Shine does n't name anyone responsible , the show 's producer is Jessica Herzberg .
A
Fox staffer said that others internally were bothered by describing the potential first lady and very accomplished women — as the senator 's " baby mama . "
Unfortunately for the network , this comes just days after Fox's E.D.
Hill addressed her use of the phrase " terrorist fist jab " on - air in reference to the famous Michelle - Barack fist bump ( or pound ) made just before his celebratory speech in St. Paul .

Where ’s my camera when I need it ?
And why do n’t these girls do their thing at a KFC near me , dang it ?
Topless demonstrators for PETA ( People for Ethical Treatment of Animals ) were spotted hanging outside a KFC joint in central Sydney .
Here birdie , birdie .
Here birdie …
What you hiding there , honey ?
You got something to say ?
Then how about saying it out in the open ?
Other than the ladies that posed nude for the planet , PETA is trying the bare skin approach , too .
Good luck girls .
Can I get your autograph ?
Yo !
Ladies .
We have KFCs here in California .
And , you know , there are no laws against going naked in San Francisco ?
I suppose if you went topless there , nobody would care .
Well , nobody but me .
Police were called in to arrest the girls and detain them .
I suppose there were no shortage of volunteers for that duty at the downtown Sydney police station .

Our Daily Bleg : Has Quality Declined or Is it Just My Old - Fogeyism ?
Our resident quote bleggar Fred Shapiro , editor of the Yale Book of Quotations , is back with another request .
If you have a bleg of your own , send it along here .
Thanks to everyone for the incredible outpouring of comments in response to last week ’s posting about 21st - century song lyrics .
The responses will certainly be of some use for the next edition of The Yale Book of Quotations .
Sirdonic pointed out that my own comments were unnecessarily negative .
His points were well taken .
I apologize for the unnecessary negativism , which was motivated by feeble attempts at humor , a shameless desire to attain a total of 400 comments , and some frustration at the lack of memorable 21st - Century lyrics ( I regret adding to the negativism with that last comment , I ’m just trying to be honest ) .
For this week ’s bleg , let me pose a more theoretical question .
Are there any relatively objective criteria for comparing the quality of artistic or cultural productions from different eras ?
I and many of the posters in recent weeks seem to feel that there has been a substantial qualitative decline in film , popular music , and probably other arts as well .
I like to call this “ the Gladiator phenomenon . ”
I believe that the film Spartacus was not viewed as much different from other epics of the period when it was released .
The film Gladiator was a highly acclaimed Best Picture Oscar winner .
Yet to me Spartacus is far superior , to the point that the worst scene in Spartacus is probably better than the best scene in Gladiator ( which is also a highly derivative blend of Spartacus , Ben- Hur , and Braveheart ) .
All this can be criticized as subjectivity , old - fogeyism , failure to appreciate contemporary culture , or a verdict that will be proven wrong by posterity .
Yet I suspect that many share my opinions on Gladiator specifically and today ’s arts generally .
The only relatively objective criterion I can think of for making inter - era comparisons is citation counting ( how many books and articles on film cite each movie , and does the impact of the film endure in the long term ? ) , but citation counting has many flaws as an index of quality and takes many years to provide meaningful data .
Are there any other ways to make comparisons that are defensible and go beyond inevitable era-ism ?
Another question is :
What is the role of professional critics and reviewers — whose livelihoods depend on their appreciating the art of their time and elevating some of it to a pantheon regardless of the merits — in such comparisons ?
Is The Godfather rated the second greatest American film of all time by the American Film Institute and Raging Bull rated fourth because it would not look good for all the top films to come from the 1939 to 1942 period ?

WOWZERS !
Some say no .
They say unlike the tech and real estate bubbles , there ’s no overabundance of supply .
Others say these high prices are not sustainable .
Oil prices have doubled in the past 12 months , surging nearly $ 8 a barrel in the past four days alone .
Big investment funds are putting money into oil futures as if Saudi Arabia ’s spigots will run dry tomorrow .
At the same time , the supply of oil and the demand for it has n’t changed much in the last year .
So it raises the question : Is $ 135 oil nothing more than one big bubble ?
Some say no .
They say unlike the tech and real estate bubbles , there ’s no overabundance of supply .
Others say these high prices are not sustainable .
The answer depends on who you ask .
A bubble is where supply overwhelms demand , pointing to previous bubbles – like the tech bubble in the late 1990s where companies with zero earnings issued massive amounts of stock , and the real estate market a decade later where home builders went on a frenzy , overshooting the number of homes the market could absorb .
“ But unless I ’m missing something here , I do n’t see any massive increase in the supply of oil ” .

Thursday , the International Energy Agency gave advance warning that its previous forecast for supply and demand remaining in pleasant equilibrium over the next two decades was flawed .
Its new projections , due in November , will say supplies may fall 10 percent short of demand , according to a report in the Wall Street Journal .
Russia was already seeing a drop in production , and there ’s little evidence Saudi Arabia could increase production even if it wanted to .
If the two biggest oil producers in the world can no longer increase production , that ’s a catastrophe , not a bubble .
Others say there ’s no way $ 130 oil is justified .
“ This thing has to turn around , it ’s insanity , ” an oil analyst at the consultancy .
Ultimately we ’ll see a huge collapse in prices . ”
We do n’t know when that collapse would come , but he predicts it will be within weeks or months , not years .
But he does n’t know just what might bring it about – perhaps the Federal Reserve increasing interest rates or a big drop in consumption as people worldwide can no longer afford to fuel their cars or heat their homes .
Many analysts said supply and demand justifies expensive oil – maybe $ 90 or $ 100 a barrel – but $ 130 is just too much .
Demand is slowing in the U.S. , and the Chinese numbers are inflated because they assume the government will continue to subsidize fuel , which he feels they wo n’t do .
Over the next five or ten years , it would be possible to see a return to $ 70 or $ 80 oil by gradually increasing supply – both in OPEC countries and non-OPEC countries like Brazil , as well as aggressive measures to limit demand like increasing fuel efficiency standards .
Current markets are adequately supplied , and traders are pricing in future predictions of surging demand .
“ To me , that ’s a bubble ” .
Oil should be priced at around $ 100 , supplies just are n’t growing , and the only way to bring prices down to the $ 100 range is to reduce consumption .
“ Even when that bubble pops , you ’re not looking at $ 60 , $ 70 oil . ”
Kent County Council in south east England has become one of the first in the UK to ban mosquito gadgets from its buildings .
The devices send out high - pitched sounds which can only be heard by young people .
They 're used to try and stop groups of young people hanging out around shops and town centres .
But lots of people think they 're not a fair way to treat young people , and should be scrapped .
Usually , adults can't hear them , because as you get older your hearing gets worse , meaning you can't hear high - pitched noises as well .
Vote Should mosquitos be banned ?
Yes 63.30 % No 36.70 % 5188 Votes Cast Results are indicative and may not reflect public opinion
Around 3,500 of them are used across England in shopping centres , parks and shops , to try and stop bad behaviour .
Councillors in Kent brought in the ban after talking to young people , and are now planning to ask the government to ban them altogether .
The Children 's Commissioner for England , Professor Sir Al Aynsley - Green , has launched a campaign to get rid of them , called " Buzz Off " .
Meanwhile in Scotland , work to get mosquitoes , sometimes called " teen tormentors " , banned , has been under way since last year .
From Media Matters :
Continuing a pattern of ignoring developments in the ongoing investigation into the firing of several U.S. attorneys , none of the broadcast networks ’
June 24 or 25 evening newscasts reported on the Justice Department Inspector General ’s findings of politicization of hiring practices in several of the department ’s recruiting programs .
…
As Media Matters for America has repeatedly noted , the broadcast networks ’ evening newscasts — ABC ’s World News , NBC ’s Nightly News , and the CBS Evening News — initially were slow to report on the controversy surrounding the dismissal of several U.S. attorneys and have a history of ignoring developments relating to the controversy .
LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
Not so long ago predictions that oil would break the $ 100 barrier seemed fanciful , alarmist even .
But here we are , with the price of a single barrel of oil now into three digits and beyond .
King Abdullah is the driving force behind Saudi Arabia 's massive development projects .
While hearty oil consumers fix an anxious eye on the rising cost of fuel , one country , in particular , is busy raking in the proceeds .
Saudi Arabia has the world 's largest proven oil reserves , some 264 billion barrels .
Last year it 's estimated to have exported $ 165 billion worth of oil , around 90 percent of the Kingdom 's total revenue .
Saudi Arabia 's economy is booming .
The Kingdom 's nominal gross domestic product rose 5.7 percent in 2007 .
It 's not the rate of growth that 's the most impressive -- it 's the sheer scale of Saudi Arabia 's income and its audacious spending plans .
In 2007 , Saudi Arabia predicted its total revenue would rise to $ 106 billion ( SR 400 billion ) .
That figure proved -- as in previous years -- to be wildly conservative .
In fact , the Kingdom was left with a surplus $ 47.6 billion ( SR 178.5 billion ) , and that 's even after spending more money than it had planned .
Saudi Arabia's Economic Cities King Abdullah Economic City ( north of Jeddah , near Rabigh )
Prince Abdulaziz bin Mousaed Economic City ( Hail )
Jizan Economic City
Knowledge Economic City ( Madinah )
Tabuk Economic City
Ras Al Zour Resource City
Sudair City
Forty - odd billion might sound like a staggering surplus , but it 's only the third highest in Saudi Arabia 's history and represents a drop of 62 percent on the previous year .
There are no firm figures yet on how much money Saudi Arabia made from exporting oil in 2007 .
SABB estimates a figure in the region of $ 165 billion ( SR 618 billion ) , a " staggering " figure " more than 118 percent of the UAE 's GDP in 2006 and four times bigger than the size of Qatar 's GDP during the same year . "
Some fear that Saudi Arabia 's reliance on the oil industry leaves it particularly vulnerable to a downturn in the market .
However , Saudi Arabia 's budget forecasts are based on an oil price of $ 45 per barrel -- around half the current market price -- so there 's widely thought to be plenty of slack in the system .
This is not the first oil boom to bring a flood of money to the desert Kingdom .
The 1970s also saw a sharp rise in the price of crude , followed by heavy spending and substantial debt .
This time Kingdom says it 's putting its money to good use , building economic cities and investing in education and healthcare to assure the future of its young population .
The jobs dilemma
Despite its vast wealth , unemployment is still relatively high in Saudi Arabia , and is rising .
Ratings agency Capital Intelligence recently noted that the Kingdom 's challenge to create jobs is exacerbated by demographics -- its population is expected to grow by 40 percent by 2020 .
" Saudi Arabia will need to generate faster , self - sustaining private sector growth to prevent potentially serious social and fiscal strains emerging in the long run , " it says .
Record inflation
Inflation is also a concern .
The cost of living hit a 27 - year high of seven percent in January , and is unlikely to fall any time soon , according to the Vice Governor of Saudi 's central bank .
Muhammed Al - Jasser told Reuters that " present inflationary pressures will likely continue in 2008 until the supply response in the real estate market catches up with demand . "
Dropping the dollar ?
It 's been suggested -- by none less than former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan -- that dropping the dollar - peg would lead to a " significant " fall in inflation in Saudi Arabia , and other Gulf countries .
It 's an option that Saudi Arabia has refused to consider .
Addressing the Shura Council -- a body that advises King Abdullah -- Central Bank governor Hamad al - Sayyari said this week that " easy solutions can be catastrophic in the long term . "
The Saudi central bank is confident that government measures to boost welfare payments and subsidies and to restrict lending will reap rewards in coming months .
Longer term , it 's planning to build a series of economic cities to provide jobs , homes and a future for its expanding population .

Desert cities
The largest of the Kingdom 's seven new economic cities is named after the man behind Saudi Arabia 's grand vision , King Abdullah .
King Abdullah Economic City ( KAEC ) is being built from scratch , a city in the desert north of Jeddah the size of Washington D.C.
The $ 100 billion plan includes a residential zone , an education zone , an industrial zone , central business district , sea port and resort .
Two million residents are expected to live there , with one million of those employed in local jobs .
If all goes to plan , KAEC will be completed by 2016 .
It 's an ambitious task with a relatively short timetable , but in the end , the Kingdom hopes it will stimulate regional growth and employment .

Michelle Obama in for ' Very Ugly Stuff ' Barack Obama 's wife takes on role of woman conservatives love to hate .
June 15 , 2008  -- Like Eleanor Roosevelt and Hillary Clinton before her , Michelle Obama is becoming the would - be first lady conservatives love to hate .
The conservative National Review recently showed a stern - faced Michelle Obama on its cover , under the headline , " Mrs. Grievance . "
The Tennessee Republican Party questioned her patriotism .
Michelle Obama has become a favorite target for critics , drawing many to compare her arrival on the national stage to Hillary Clinton 's after she infuriated conservatives when she said , " I could have stayed home and baked cookies . "
It 's likely to get worse .
" It 's going to be very ugly stuff , " Democratic strategist Tad Devine said .
" They 're going to try to depict her as someone who is angry , outside the mainstream and not proud to be an American . "
How did a 44 - year - old Harvard Law School graduate become so demonized ?
One reason is the increasingly viral quality of the Internet .
" In an environment now that is increasingly polarizing and nasty , charges can be made , often unsubstantiated charges through the Web , " said Stuart Rothenberg , editor of the Rothenberg Political Report .
" We 're in an environment now where being a first lady is a lot tougher job than it used to be . "
Google " Michelle Obama " and the term " whitey " and you 'll find conservative bloggers claiming a video shows her using the racially tinged term at Trinity Church .
No tape has ever surfaced .
But the claim helped prompt the Obama campaign to launch its own Web site , FighttheSmears.com .
Much of the criticism stems from Michelle Obama 's artless statement early in the campaign that , " For the first time in my adult lifetime I 'm really proud of my country . "
The campaign immediately clarified that to say that she meant she was prouder than ever .
And she was defended on " Good Morning America " by first lady Laura Bush , who said , " I think she probably meant ' I 'm more proud , ' you know , is what she really meant . "
But the statement was lampooned in a Tennessee GOP advertisement that juxtaposed her statement with those of supposedly ordinary citizens , one of whom played pool in a room lined with rifles who said , " I 've always been proud to be an American . "
Even John McCain , who was himself the target of a malicious smear campaign in the 2000 primary that claimed he had fathered an illegitimate child , when asked about attacks on her , said , " I 've never met her , Mrs. Obama , she 's a talented and a very effective person . "
On " Good Morning America " recently , candidate Obama offered this warning : " These folks should lay off my wife , all right ? "
The candidate was expected to offer a very different view of his wife , and his family , in a Father 's Day speech in Chicago today , with wife Michelle at his side .
Invasion of the bobby snatchers : Police helicopter has close encounter with a UFO
A police helicopter had a near miss with a UFO in what appears to have been one of the first sightings of its kind .
The helicopter , with a three - man crew , was forced to swerve sharply to avoid being hit by the UFO .
The bizarre incident took place near an RAF base outside Cardiff , South Wales , where the helicopter is based .
The police helicopter swerved to miss a UFO in South Wales
A source said : “ It closed in at great speed , aiming straight at the helicopter .
“ The chopper had to swerve sharply to avoid being hit .
The guys said if they ’d stayed where they were , they ’d be dead – it would ’ve been a direct hit .
“ They are convinced it was a UFO .
It sounds far - fetched , but they know what they saw .
“ These guys are hardened professionals and know people will take the mickey , but they are certain they saw a UFO . ”
The source added to The Sun : “ After the near - collision they decided to follow it to find out what the hell it was .
" They belted across the Bristol Channel in pursuit , but it was too quick .
They got to the North Devon coast and had to turn back because they were running low on fuel . ”
The police Eurocopter , an EC135T21 , was hovering in the sky above RAF St Athan late at night , waiting to land , a police spokeswoman confirmed .
While she went on to confirm the sighting of what is termed as an " unusual aircraft " , she went out of her way to avoid using the term UFO .
However , since the object was flying and has not been identified , it appears to satisfy all the relevant criteria to be referred to as a UFO .
While police took a low - key approach to the whole UFO affair today , they also quietly dismissed more dramatic reports of what had happened .
" South Wales Police can confirm its air support unit sighted an unusual aircraft .
This was reported to the relevant authorities for their investigation , " police said in a brief statement .
" There are a wide variety of aircraft which come in a range of different shapes and sizes and in all probability this sighting has just confirmed that one of these was in the area at the relevant time . "
The extra-terrestrial encounter happened just before 1 am on June 8 .
WASHINGTON 
The leader of the tribal confederation that has fought to expel Al Qaeda from most of Iraq 's Anbar province is offering his men to help gin up a rebellion against Osama bin Laden 's organization along the Afghanistan - Pakistan border .
Click Image to Enlarge LOUIE FAVORITE / AJC Sheik Ahmed Fateh Khan al - Rishawi at his home near Camp Ramadi on April 14 , 2007 .
In an interview , Sheik Ahmad al - Rishawi told The New York Sun that in April he prepared a 47 - page study on Afghanistan and its tribes for the deputy chief of mission at the American embassy in Kabul , Christopher Dell .
When asked if he would send military advisers to Afghanistan to assist American troops fighting there , he said : " I have no problem with this ; if they ask me , I will do it . "
The success of the Anbari tribal rebellion known as the awakening spurred Multinational Forces Iraq to try to emulate the model throughout Iraq , including with the predominately Shiite tribes in the south of the country .
Today , the tribe - based militias formed to protect Anbaris from Al Qaeda are forming a political alliance poised to unseat the confessional Sunni parties currently in parliament in the provincial elections scheduled for the fall and the federal ones scheduled for 2009 .
During his nomination hearing for taking over the regional military post known as Central Command , General David Petraeus said one of the first things he would do would be to travel to Pakistan to discuss the current strategy of the government in dealing with Al Qaeda 's safe haven in the Pashtun border provinces .
A possible strategy for defeating Al Qaeda would be an effort there along the lines of the Anbar awakening to win over the tribes that offer Osama bin Laden 's group protection and safe haven .
" Al Qaeda is an ideology , " Sheik Ahmad said .
" We can defeat them inside Iraq and we can defeat them in any country . "
The tribal leader arrived in Washington last week .
All of his meetings , including an audience with President Bush , have been closed to the public , in part because the Anbari sheiks , while likely to win future electoral contests , are not themselves part of Iraq 's elected government .
Of his meeting with Mr. Bush , Sheik Ahmad said he was impressed .
" He is a brave man .
He is also a wise man .
He is taking care of the country 's future , the United States ' future .
He is also taking care of the Iraqi people , the ordinary people in Iraq .
He wants to accomplish success in Iraq . "
When Sheik Ahmad 's brother , Sheik Sattar , met with Mr. Bush in Anbar last fall , he told the president that he dedicated his victory over Al Qaeda to the victims of the attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
On September 13 , 2007 , Sheik Sattar was assassinated by an improvised explosive device .
Since then , his brother Sheik Ahmad has led the awakening movement .
Sheik Ahmad said he wanted Hollywood to make a movie about the life story of his brother , who was so revered after his murder that Iraq 's interior minister dedicated a statue to him on the road from Baghdad to Anbar .
In his home province in Iraq , Sheik Ahmad 's public addresses are preceded by two bugle players and an announcer proclaiming him as the " conqueror of Al Qaeda , " and " friend of General Petraeus , " among other formal titles .
In Washington , however , he and his entourage stayed at the Hilton Hotel and were driven to meetings in a small bus .
When this reporter first met him he was carrying a dog- eared paperback copy of Bob Woodward 's " Plan of Attack . "
In Washington , Sheik Ahmad also met with some members of Congress .
He said he told them that American soldiers should stay in Iraq for at least as long as it takes to rebuild Iraq 's national army .
The Democratic majority in Congress has tried and failed to mandate deadlines for the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq regardless of conditions on the ground .
" We have to rebuild a national Iraqi army , not built on sects , but the same way they built up the Anbar police , " he said .
" They must be well - armed , so they will be able to protect the country and all the American interests in the area .
We also have to make a friendship treaty based on mutual respect between the two parties , and then the United States will be able to withdraw from Iraq , if they wish , and we will succeed in Iraq the same way America succeeded in Japan and Germany . "
The Anbari sheik offered no comment on the details of the current negotiations on the American troop presence in Iraq between Prime Minister al - Maliki and Ambassador Ryan Crocker , saying he was not involved in the negotiations .
But he also said he favored such a status - of - forces agreement .
" With a diplomatic understanding we will be able to solve all the problems .
We fully trust the Americans .
We know the United States never in its history occupied a country .
On the contrary , they were occupied and they were able to fight the occupier , " he said , referring to the American rebellion against the British in 1776 .
The sheik said he was leaving for Chicago in part to meet with agriculture experts in the hopes of learning new farming techniques for Western Iraq .
He said he would like to meet Senator Obama though he has not asked for a meeting .
He also said he would like to meet Mr. Obama 's rival for the 2008 presidential election , Senator McCain .
" I would love to see both of them , McCain and Obama , " the sheik said .
" I have not asked though .
If there is a possibility or opportunity I would love to see them .
I know that both parties are really busy with the election now .
That is why I have not asked for this . "
Even with gas prices cresting above $ 4 a gallon , large SUVs , pickup trucks and even Toyota Priuses barrel down freeways here in suburban Detroit at more than 75 miles per hour -- well beyond the 55 mph that was the national speed limit during the ' 70s and ' 80s .
If the U.S. Energy Department 's calculations are right , all these lead foots could save the equivalent of 29 cents to 94 cents a gallon if they slowed down just to 60 mph -- and reduce the fuel they burn by about 7 % to 23 % .

日本最古にして最大級の芸能事務所、吉本興業。ジャニーズ事務所と並び、「地上波放送で所属タレントを見かけない日はない」とまで言われるコンテンツの源泉であり、また、近年ではCS系放送局「ヨシモトファンダンゴTV」を運営、自らコンテンツ制作から発信まで携わるなど、コンテンツホルダーとしての範囲を広めている。
放送サービスの優位性を理解し、効果的なプロモーションとして活用する一方、ネット配信にも積極的な姿勢を見せる。2007年8月にはYouTube日本語版の国内パートナーとして名乗りをあげ、同年11月末からはニコニコ動画内に「よしよし動画」を立ち上げた。
地上波放送局にとっては番組制作に欠かせない有力権利者でありながら、その地上放送局が敬遠しているようにも映るコンテンツのネット配信にも意欲を見せる。ただ、コンテンツのネット配信は著作権問題や通信業界および放送業界の構造的問題など、多数の問題点が指摘されている。これについて吉本興業はどのように見ているだろうか――。
いかなる問題があったとしても、権利者としての「人に見て欲しい」という本質を忘れてはならないと訴えかける同社執行役員権利開発統括本部長兼よしもとファンダンゴ代表取締役社長である中井秀範氏の話をまとめた。
「 製造直販」を可能にしたネット
社名にある「興業」が示すとおり、吉本興業はお客様に御代をいただいて芸を提供する、いわばBtoCのビジネスモデルが創業以来の根本にあります。
一方、地上波テレビ放送が国民のエンターテインメントとして定着するにあたり、その影響力や収支モデルは劇場運営のそれとは比べ物にならない規模であることに気がつきました。結果、弊社としても積極的に活用するようになり、出演者を放送局にお貸ししてその対価をいただく、というスタイルで長年運営してきたわけです。
高度なビジネスモデルが構築された地上波テレビにおいても、創業以来の精神を忘れたわけではありません。放送事業者から得られるギャランティは、広告会社、広告主を経ているとはいえ元々はコンシューマーが負担しているものであり、テレビを通じて芸を提供させていただく。これもひとつのBtoCモデルであると考えてきました。
ところが、通信インフラとテクノロジの発展によって、わざわざ人の手を借りずとも、直接お客様に芸を届けることができるようになってきました。そこで、従来の劇場展開同様のダイレクトマーケティングサービスに乗り出したわけです。
中間流通を飛ばすことで余計な手数料をお支払いいだだかなくなったこともさることながら、著作権・肖像権を自由自在に操れるようになったことが大きいのです。地上波番組の場合、いくら弊社所属の芸人が出演していたとしても100％自由に権利を持つわけではありません。いわば「製造直販」が可能になったことで、ようやく自分たちのコンテンツを持てつようになりました。
もっとも、それで地上波テレビから離反する、という話ではありません。テレビはシステムとして完成された高度なビジネスモデルもさることながら、一度に見ていただける視聴者数が決定的に違います。視聴率20％ならば1000万世帯ですから。多くの方に芸を届けるためには、うってつけのメディアです。
同じ放送サービスでも、CS放送「 ヨシモトファンダンゴTV」の場合、「スカパー！」全体でも350万世帯（スカパー！１、直接受信のみ）で、うちファンダンゴ加入者は５万人程度。これでは、折角作ったコンテンツがもったいない。少々古い言葉でいえば「ワンソースマルチユース」ですが、CS放送をご覧になれない方にはインターネット配信で見ていただこう、と考えました。
コンテンツの二次創作能力に注目
YouTubeに関していえば、 「中に入ってこそできることがある」という考えが念頭にあります。弊社所属タレントも関係する違法コンテンツが数多く存在しているわけで、それらを削除してもらうにあたって内側から改善要求した方が効果的と考えたわけです。
また、権利者と運営者の議論を見ていて思うことですが、原則対原則のぶつかりあいを続けていても事態は動かない。特に権利者側の方は、ネットが進化するスピードに置いていかれかねない。だからといって、一権利者として放置していくわけにもいかず、正式にパートナーとなることを選びました。
ニコニコ動画については、音楽でいうリミックス的な、コンテンツの有効な二次創作能力に注目しています。こちらから権利フリーの映像を提供し、それを使ってよりおもしろい作品ができあがれば幸いと。権利侵害映像を利用した二次創作物は評価として日の目を見ないので、あえて権利フリーの映像を提供し、新たな才能の発掘に期待しています。
こうした取り組みができるのは、優れたコンテンツを作るための芸人を多く抱えていることもさることながら、やはり権利関係を自由にできる出口を自ら持ったことが大きい。地上波番組は権利が錯綜していて、いくら弊社がGoサインを出してもネット提供はできません。「ファンダンゴ」そのものの成果はともかく、大枠で捉えた効果は計り知れないものがありますね。

The Olympics are coming !
The Olympics are coming !
On 08/08/08 you will be able to witness the opening ceremony firework extravaganza above the Olympic Forest Park and a portion of the Great Wall .
Thinking ' Green ' , some of the fireworks will have less powder to minimize the smoke and pollution .
For the first time in Olympic history the shape of the Olympic rings will be displayed across the sky during the pyrotechnic spectacular .
The Got Milk ad will be featured in this weeks Sports Illustrated magazine .
We did a story recently featuring other Got Milk ads from around the world .
See them here .
Jessica Hardy , who is not shown in the above photo , has just tested positive for using a banned substance and will not be competing in the swimming competition at the Beijing games , unless she is able to convince testing officials that an error has been made .
She has two weeks to plead her case .

The recent exchange between the McCain and Obama campaigns over the GOP candidate ’s remarks to Matt Lauer have underscored the central issue of this presidential election year and framed the campaign in terms of a single , overriding issue : the future of the American empire .
In an interview with McCain on the Today Show , Lauer lobbed a softball about how " the surge is working , " and McCain readily agreed , whereupon Lauer came back with :
" ’If it ’s working , senator , do you now have a better estimate of when American forces can come home from Iraq ? ’
" McCAIN : No , but that ’s not too important .
What ’s important is the casualties in Iraq .
Americans are in South Korea .
Americans are in Japan .
American troops are in Germany .
That ’s all fine . "
The Obama camp immediately came back with a volley of startlingly ineffective rhetorical cant , wheeling out none other than John Kerry , who was for the war before he was against it .
Kerry scolded McCain for being " out of touch and inconsistent "  because , after all , it matters to the families of the troops when they come home .
" It is important when they can come home .
It is important when we can revitalize our military . "
Potshots from Harry Reid and DCCC chairman Chris Van Hollen were similarly off the mark , with the former echoing Kerry ’s " we do n’t have enough troops " and the latter saying we need to get out of Iraq so we can get busy in Afghanistan .
The McCainiacs  rightly  complained that their candidate ’s words were being taken out of context :
" John McCain was asked if he had a ‘ better estimate ’ for a timeline for withdrawal .
As John McCain has always said , that is not as important as conditions on the ground and the recommendations of commanders in the field .
Any reasonable person who reads the full transcript would see this and reject the Obama campaign ’s attempt to manipulate , twist and distort the truth . ”
This is absolutely correct  it is n’t that McCain is indifferent to the exigencies of serving two or three tours in Iraq .
What he really said , however , was much worse .
He wants to turn Iraq into yet another province of the American empire : like Japan , or South Korea .
Indeed , the Korean model has long been held up by the administration as an ideal solution , albeit cautiously .
Asked if this concept meant an occupation of 50 - plus years , then - White House spokesman Tony Snow averred :
" No , no , I ’m not .
I do n’t know .
It is an unanswerable question , but I ’m not making that suggestion . ”
McCain , it seems , has answered the unanswerable  and to his essential point the Democrats have no effective reply .
After all , from their perspective , what would be wrong with a Korean - style occupation of Iraq ?
No casualties , no muss , no fuss  except for an occasional anti-American demonstration .
The Democrats condone such a policy in Korea and Japan , reflexively voting to fund those occupations  and if we could reduce Iraq to the state of subservience experienced by these two satrapies , then what ’s the problem ?
The great problem with the Iraqis is that , unlike the Japanese and the Koreans , they ’re fighting back .
McCain ’s response is to crush them .
The Democrats would rather cut and run .
Within the imperial paradigm accepted by both parties  a conceptual framework that simply assumes our overweening global military presence  the GOP has the advantage of looking " tougher , " while the Democrats look merely craven .
There is little resistance in Congress to the imperial delusions of our rulers , but in the parliament that convenes in the Green Zone , a storm is brewing .
The object of contention is the " status of forces " agreement the Bush administration is trying to impose on the Iraqis .
The administration has long been moving to formalize the frankly colonial relationship between the U.S. and Iraq , and now those efforts are moving swiftly to a conclusion , with U.S. officials predicting an agreement sometime in July  but I would n’t count on it .
We initially demanded over 200 military facilities across Iraq , but later whittled it down to a mere 58 .
We also wanted the right to detain any Iraqis without turning them over to Iraqi authorities , a free hand to conduct military operations , and immunity from prosecution by U.S. soldiers and private contractors  in effect , a continuation of the occupation .
Word is out that the Americans are now in a compromising mood , agreeing that contractors should be subject to Iraqi law and accepting something less than a completely free hand militarily .
Yet still there are ominous rumbles of protest , coming not just from the opposition but also from the ruling coalition of Shi’ite parties .
Note the words of Jalal al - Din al - Saghir , a leader of the Supreme Islamic Council fraction of the Iraqi parliament ,
“ We rejected the whole thing from the beginning .
In my point of view , it would just be a new occupation with an Iraqi signature .
Maybe the Iraqi government will say : ‘ Hey , the security situation is better .
We do n’t need any more troops in Iraq .
Or we could have a pledge of honor where the American troops leave but come back and protect Iraq if there is any aggression . ”
Haider al - Abadi , a leader of Prime Minister Maliki ’s own Da’wa party , declares :
“ What the U.S. wants is to take the current status quo and try to regulate it in a new agreement .
And what we want is greater respect for Iraqi sovereignty .
Signing the agreement would mean that the Iraqi government had given up its sovereignty by its own consent .
And that will never happen . ”
The Post reports a top aide to Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki as saying :
" The Americans are making demands that would lead to the colonization of Iraq .
If we ca n’t reach a fair agreement , many people think we should say , ‘ Goodbye , U.S. troops .
We do n’t need you here anymore . ’ “
And these are the pro-American parties !
The American people voted in November , 2006 , to bring the troops home  and , instead , all they got was another two years of an increasingly bloody and expensive foreign occupation that threatens to morph into a larger , regional conflict .
The Democrats , given the majority to end the war , elected instead to continue it , consistently voting for war funding whilst insisting on their eagerness to bring the troops home .
It looks like , in the end , it will be Iraqi legislators , not Americans , who will finally accomplish what the Democrats promised .
All of this was predicted by war opponents before a single American boot tread on Iraqi ground : Pat Buchanan , I recall in particular , foresaw this day in all its tragic absurdity .
What we are now witnessing is the revolt of the " liberated " people of Iraq  against their American liberators .
So what will we do when they ask us to leave ?
This is the acid test of Empire , a dry run of the new American Brezhnev Doctrine , which holds that once a country becomes an American vassal , that vassalage is permanent .
When Hungary tried to leave the Warsaw Pact , the 1956 revolt was crushed by Soviet troops .
When Koreans rose up against their American occupiers and the South Korean dictatorship during the 1980 Kwangju Rebellion , they were cut down with the full complicity of our government .
What will the Americans do when the Iraqi forces they trained and armed turn on them ?
The frontiers of empire are being pushed outward , and Iraq  bristling with American bases and weaponry  is slated to become a launching pad for U.S. military adventurism in the region .
This is happening without significant domestic opposition from either party : aside from some very loud grumbling , the top national security mavens in the U.S. Senate have stopped short of taking any actions , aside from writing worrisome letters to Condi Rice .
As the Post points out , " Although they have questioned the status of forces agreement ’s contents , lawmakers have not raised the issue of its congressional ratification . "
Of course not .
When their guy gets in the White House , they ’ll claim the same imperial prerogatives for themselves .
An empire is run by an emperor , not a legislature .
Far from offering an alternative to the vision of America as a hegemon on which the sun never sets , the Democrats have developed their own version of militarism with a " humanitarian " face .
Madeleine Albright bemoans the likelihood that the Iraq war will put the American people off to the sort of interventions she favors .
Yes , this is the great humanitarian and Democratic secretary of state who declared that the sanctions on Iraq  which killed tens of thousands of old people , the sick , and the very young  were " worth it . "
Absent a status of forces agreement between the U.S. and Iraq , the presence of our troops in Iraq will lack any formal legal basis , or even the pretense of one .
The UN mandate is soon to run out , and the Iraqis are threatening to mount a fight over the extension of that , too  a spectacle that could be mighty embarrassing for the U.S .
If and when Obama takes the White House , the Iraq war will immediately become his war , and his party ’s war .
The issue will then be : a negotiated end to the conflict and the occupation , or else a series of " surges " culminating in an open conflict with Iran .
A third scenario  an ignominious helicopters - taking - off - from - rooftops retreat  is a real possibility , too .
Staying the course is no longer an option .

Advertisement A man ended up being arrested and charged - after laughing too much at BBC TV's Have I Got News For You .
Chris Cocker , 36 , from Blackburn , was chuckling so vigorously at a comment by comedy panellist Paul Merton that he fell off the sofa .
A concerned neighbour in the flat below heard the thud and called the police .
But when he refused to co-operate , Cocker was arrested .
He admitted in court to resisting a police officer and was given a conditional discharge .
A charge of assaulting a police officer was withdrawn when Cocker appeared before magistrates in Blackburn , Lancashire .
Mr Cocker said : " I fell off the settee in hysterics and hit the floor and got myself up and started carrying on watching the telly and the next thing I know there was a knock on the door .
" The bit where I lost it the most was when I shut the door and the policeman had stuck his foot in the doorway and was refusing to let me shut my own front door . "
After being sprayed with pepper spray , Mr Cocker was put into a police van and taken to a police station where he said he was stripped naked and spent a night in the cells .
A spokesman for Lancashire Police said officers used a pepper spray as " reasonable force " for their own protection after they feared for their safety when he became aggressive .

What are these ?
Scientists have grown a tree from what may be the oldest seed ever germinated .
The new sapling was sprouted from a 2,000 - year - old date palm excavated in Masada , the site of a cliff - side fortress in Israel where ancient Jews are said to have killed themselves to avoid capture by Roman invaders .
Dubbed the " Methuselah Tree " after the oldest person in the Bible , the new plant has been growing steadily , and after 26 months , the tree was nearly four - feet ( 1.2 meters ) tall .
The species of tree , called the Judean date , ( Phoenix dactylifera L. ) , is now extinct in Israel , but researchers are hoping that by reviving the plant they may be able to study its medicinal uses .
" The medicinal plants from this region are very important because they are historically mentioned in the Bible and the Koran , " said Sarah Sallon , director of the Louis L. Borick Natural Medicine Research Center at the Hadassah Medical Organization in Jerusalem , which initiated the experiment to grow the tree as part of its Middle East Medicinal Plant Project .
" The Judean date was very valuable and very famous , not just as a source of food but as a source of medicine , " Sallon said .
" When I heard there were ancient seeds found in the archeological dig , I thought it would be interesting to see if we could try to grow them . "
Carbon dating of the seeds found at Masada revealed that they date from roughly the time of the ancient fortress ' siege , in A.D. 73 .
The seeds were found in storage rooms , and appear to have been stockpiled for the Jews hiding out against the invading Romans .
" They were buried under mounds of debris on the top of the archaeological site of Masada , " Sallon told LiveScience .
" The Jews all committed suicide rather than give in to the Romans , and the Romans pretty much destroyed the site after that .
It was more or less left for the next 2,000 years . "
The seeds were excavated about 40 years ago , along with skeletons of those who died during the siege .
Since then , the seeds had been languishing in a drawer until Sallon and her team decided to attempt to grow them anew .
They turned the project over to plant specialist Elaine Solowey at the Arava Institute of the Environment in Kibbutz Ketura , Israel .
She pretreated the seeds in fertilizers and hormone - rich solution , and then planted them .
So far , Methuselah is the only one to sprout .
Though a few trees have been planted from seeds that are rumored to be older than the Masada ones , the Methuselah tree holds the record for the oldest directly - dated seed to be germinated .
Scientists determined its age from control seeds taken from the same batch , and from shell fragments from the sprouted seed itself .
Beyond being exciting as a piece of history literally come to life , Sallon said , the new date plant may hold the key to rediscovering ancient healing techniques .
" When we look at ancient sources and Hebrew texts , the dates were used for all kinds of things — pulmonary problems , tuberculosis , dysentery , cancer .
We think of it today as just a food .
But in fact the date was n't just a food . "
Germany 's Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) leader Kurt Beck addresses a news conference following a party board meeting in Berlin April 14 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Fabrizio Bensch
BERLIN ( Reuters ) -
The head of Germany ’s Social Democrats , who has ambitions to be his country ’s next leader , is thinking about donating his beard to charity , but is not quite sure .
Kurt Beck , who as party leader has a strong claim to lead the SPD into next year ’s national election , said in a panel discussion in Mainz that he might shave off his beard to raise 1 million euros ( $ 1.5 million ) for charity , the newspaper Bild am Sonntag reported .
“ It must be serious and not turn into a spectacle , ” he told the paper .
“ The event would have to help the really needy . ”
“ I ’m still thinking about it ” .
Beck ’s beard , like the rest of his hair , is short , grey and bristly .
He recently told reporters his wife Roswitha , a hairdresser , had said he had “ hair like a guinea pig ” .
He currently trails conservative chancellor Angela Merkel by over 50 points in personal opinion poll ratings -- leading to speculation that he may face a challenge with his party for the right to run against her .
CHENGDU , China ( Reuters ) - China raised the number of dead or missing from a devastating earthquake to more than 70,000 on Tuesday , as rescuers found more survivors eight days after the huge tremor hit .
A government statement said the number killed had now topped 40,000 , and state news agency Xinhua reported that a further 32,000 were missing .
Authorities had previously said they expected the final death toll to exceed 50,000 .
More than 247,000 were injured .
Anger was building among bereaved parents in Sichuan over the way many school buildings had collapsed , burying whole classrooms full of children .
In one town , in a rare public protest , hundreds demanded punishment for anyone guilty of shoddy construction .
Xinhua reported a 60 - year - old woman was rescued in Pengzhou , more than 196 hours after the May 12 quake struck .
It said she had survived on rainwater .
In Wenchuan county , epicenter of the quake in mountainous Sichuan province , Ma Yuanjiang , 31 , was found alive .
His body was “ as fragile as that of a newborn baby ” , Chongqing Xinqiao hospital president Wang Weidong said , according to Xinhua .
Rescuers also pulled about 10 people off a mountain near Shifang town where they had been building an electricity generation station when the quake struck .
Li Tengchang , 38 , said 40 of his colleagues had been killed by falling boulders , and that others were still alive on the mountain .
“ When the wait wore on , we thought no one would come save us and we would probably die , ” said Li , who was being treated for kidney damage .
“ I survived purely on my will .
I told myself I had to live and I had to survive .
I have a 60 - year - old mother , a wife and two young children . ”
Meanwhile , nearly 9,000 people were evacuated from the base of Shiziliang Mountain near Guangyuan city over concerns about huge cracks on its slopes .
And Beichuan , one the of the worst hit towns , was closed off after official warnings of fresh tremors .
AFTERSHOCK CONCERN
In the provincial capital of Chengdu , tens of thousands of people were preparing to sleep another night in the open , despite pleas by authorities for calm after a television prediction of another powerful earthquake .
That report , along with fresh aftershocks and forecast heavy rain , compounded the difficulties for military , government and private workers trying to ensure millions of homeless are fed and housed .
Slideshow ( 40 images )
Hundreds of aftershocks have been felt over the past week , bringing down more buildings and causing landslides .
The quake warning also prompted panic in neighboring Chongqing municipality and Guizhou province .
But there was no sign of panic , just quiet resignation that more aftershocks were inevitable as darkness fell over Chengdu .
Slideshow ( 40 images )
“ Last night the predicted aftershock did n’t happen , ” said Wang Jun , as she set up a tent in the city .
“ Anyway it ’s nicer outside , it ’s better for your health . ”
ANGER OVER SCHOOLS
The most lamented victims of the quake have been the thousands of children who died when school buildings collapsed .
In Juyuan town , hundreds of grieving parents demanded an annual memorial day for their children , punishment of officials or builders responsible for shoddy schools and compensation .
“ How come all the houses did n’t fall down , but the school did ?
And how come that happened in so many places ? ” demanded Zhao , whose two daughters were crushed to death .
“ We want a memorial day for the children , but we also want criminal prosecution of those responsible , no matter who they are . ”
As China ’s ruling Communist Party seeks to maintain a staunch front of unity and stability after the quake , the incipient protests by parents could be troublesome , for many of them blame official graft and laxity , more than nature , for the deaths .
State media quoted a military source as saying rescuers had reached all the villages and towns in Sichuan province by Tuesday evening .
Whole towns have been flattened in mountainous areas north and west of Chengdu , and about 5 million people are homeless , prompting the government to seek foreign help in the form of tents .
The quake has prompted a huge outpouring of public sympathy both at home and abroad , with 13.9 billion yuan raised to date .

I Just Traded in My Fuel Efficient Car for a SUV
When it seems that everyone wants to trade in their SUV for a more fuel efficient car , it might come as a surprise that I just purchased a SUV to replace my fuel efficient car .
Although I have been told that I ’m stupid for doing so , I often find that it makes financial sense to go against the crowd .
After running the numbers , that is exactly the conclusion I came to .
While people seem to be focusing exclusively on gas prices , gas is only one factor in the equation for the overall value of a car .
This is why it made sense for me to trade in my Honda Accord in for a SUV
SUVs are dirt cheap
Used SUVs are dirt cheap right now .
When I was making calls to ask about SUVs that were for sale on Craigslist , more often than not before I got off the phone the person selling the SUV would ask , “ what is your best offer ? ”
That ’s how bad it is for people trying to get rid of them .
There just are n’t a lot of takers meaning that there is a wide room for negotiations and you can basically name your price since there are hundreds more SUV owners out there desperately trying to get rid of their SUVs as well .
I was able to negotiate an extra $ 3000 off an already very low price for the SUV I ended up purchasing .
Fuel Efficient cars are selling for a premium
Everyone is looking for a car that gets 30 mpg or higher these days and if you have one , you are in a strong negotiating position when selling the car .
This was especially true for me having a reliable brand ( Honda Accord ) that had very few miles on it for its age ( 2003 — under 18,000 ) .
I was able to sell my car for only several thousand dollars less than what I had paid for it due to the low mileage and the good shape I had kept it in .
I do n’t drive a lot
I do n’t drive very much .
My office is only 5 miles from my home , so the most that I drive is 10 miles round trip , but I do n’t even drive every day .
Rarely do I take long trips in my car with the usual weekend trip ( if there is one ) being to the lake about 20 miles away .
Over the last four years , I ’ve averaged less than 4000 miles a year .
When you do n’t drive a lot , a car ’s mpg has a lot less impact that if you are driving a huge amount each year .
I do n’t drive unless I have to
Although I have n’t always been this way , over the last few years I have adopted a much healthier lifestyle which means biking and exercising when I can .
If the weather is nice and I have plenty of time , I would much rather walk or bike to work than drive and I often do .
I also like to take bike rides on the weekend rather than drive .
I will save money by driving less
The SUV should actually allow me to drive less than I currently do .
The longest regular drive I have is to the nearest Costco which is about 25 miles away one way where I stock up on things about once every 10 days or so .
With the larger SUV , I should be able to reduce my trips to Costco to once a month since I will have the room to carry everything back which will eliminate 2 trips each month .
I also think knowing that the SUV uses more gas will encourage me to make a bigger effort to either walk or bike to work on a more regular basis .
I will save on having to rent / borrow a truck
When I want to go to the lake on weekends , I either had to borrow or rent a truck if I wanted to take our boat with us .
I will no longer incur this cost as the SUV is powerful enough to take the boat .
It ’s better for the environment
Although this may at first appear to be contradictory , me getting an SUV instead is actually beneficial to the environment .
It ’s much better that someone who does n’t drive a lot owns a SUV than someone who does .
It ’s also better that someone put a lot of miles on a car that gets good gas mileage rather than one that does n’t .
If I had kept my Honda , it would have been kind of a waste for how little I was actually driving it .
Better that someone that drives a lot take full advantage of it than have it sit in the garage most of the time .
In the end , I ended up getting a newer SUV ( 2005 ) that cost about $ 5000 less than I sold the 2003 Honda Accord for .
At my current driving rate , even with the 15 mpg gas difference of the two vehicles , I will only be spending just over $ 1000 a year more in gas assuming $ 4 a gallon which means I can drive it for over four years , have all the advantages of more room and better features and still break even .
Buying a SUV is not for everyone , but if you do relatively little driving and you ’re in the market for a new car , there may not be a better deal at the moment .

The Internet is a world penitentially embroiled in a Cold War .
Now , as then , an arms race between factions is constantly ongoing , each working to counter the efforts of the other .
Into this race , comes deep packet inspection , a serious threat to online privacy .
When I say Cold War , it ’s not just an a reference thrown up to thrown up to invoke emotion .
Like the real Cold War , it is mainly fought by proxy , one side using a third party to score hits .
However , unlike the Cold War , it is not a contest between two fairly equal forces .
One side has money and power , and the will to use it .
The other has sheer weight of numbers , but what seems like general apathy .
One of the new weapons in this conflict , is called ‘ Deep Packet Inspection ‘ ( DPI ) .
An innocuous sounding name for a technology that basically means ‘ Internet monitoring ’ .
Deep packet inspection is a technology that some companies are salivating over , including advertisers and entertainment lobby groups like the MPAA .
With it , their dreams can come true , some of them anyway .
There are various uses for deep packet inspection , such as its use by intelligence agencies ( It ’s a wiretap for the Internet ) to intercept email and other web traffic , Â likeÂ inÂ Sweden .
However , there are two more sinister usages being rolled out that are not so good for the everyday Internet user .
With the ability to see the contents of data packets , it ’s no surprise that it ’s a prime candidate for traffic shaping and throttling .
With ISP ’s increasingly overselling their capacity , they are starting to spend money not on infrastructure , but on DPI equipment , to throttle BitTorrent traffic for example .
Until recently , the processing power required to inspect data packets has made this prohibitive , as it required massive computers , and significantly slowed down network traffic .
Now , though , companies like Procera Networks are selling systems capable of DPI on 40 Gbps of traffic , per system .
Think Sandvine , without the telltale RST packets .
The MPAA loves the idea of DPI as well .
It , Â likeÂ otherÂ groups , figure , that if people can see the contents of packets , that it can tell if those packets contain copyrighted data .
Of course , they ’re oblivious to the idea that their material can be used in a non-infringing way , and staunchly against fair use ( and do n’t forget , Fair Use Day is only a week or two away ) .
If this becomes a popular view , though , we may see multi-part rar files in torrents growing in popularity again .
The other , arguably more sinister usage of DPI , is the growing interest by advertising companies to use deep packet inspection to observe what Internet users are doing .
Watching your browsing activity , you can gain all kinds of insights into the user behind the keyboard .
Similar to spyware , but on your line not your system , it ’s not a good thing , and impossible to remove .
Worse , it may be able to tell who is behind the keyboard at the time , by identifying trends in connection behavior .
In the case of a p2p lawsuit , these DPI - based advertising companies may end up being called to testify who their systems believe to be behind the keyboard at the time of the allegations .
With British Telecom in the UK having experimented with DPI based advertising , without telling the subscribers about it , and with Charter in the US looking into trialling it ( or as has just been announced – discouraged from it ) it is a pressing concern .
Fortunately , some people are not exhibiting the apathy mentioned above , and are doing something about it .
Alex Hanff ( you might remember his tangle with the MPAA ) has been studiously working against the likes of Phorm , and indeed , we linked to his dissertation on it last time .
He is holding a protest outside British Telecom ’s AGM next month , to protest this rape of user ’s privacy for commercial gain .
While the protest might be mainly against advertising based systems , it ’s a worry for all net users , and needs to be dealt with by something other than apathy .
At least one torrent site admin has told me he will be there Â and I may be there , but the more that attend , the better .
So , users of the world , it ’s time to start acting for what you believe in , and stop just moaning about it .

It ’s James ’ Lotion Applicator and it supplies what many guys , particular those with an abundance of back hair , have no other hope of obtaining – an actual hand to apply sun screen to those impossible to reach bodily areas .
The fluid of choice is pumped into the applicator and released through openings in the articulating “ hand ” , which is motorized to provide a massaging effect ( in an attempt to retain a shred of professionalism , we wo n’t include the joke here that just popped into our head . )
Brian , Devin and Geoff ’s Beer Dispensing Lawn Chair
Patented 2005
As if in direct answer to the question “ how can I modify my lawn chair so that it will give me an ice cold beer whenever I pull down on a handy lever “ , Brian , Devin and Geoff have developed the long overdue Beer Dispensing Lawn Chair .
And word has it the guys are working on a bratwurst dispensing ottoman as we speak .
Kirby ’s Insulated Beverage Container
Patented 1992
Welcome to the ultimate in non-powered outdoor beverage cooling technology .
The system is pretty much self - explanatory , although Kirby is quick to point out that the “ positioning of the straw ( 30 ) is of particular importance to enable consumption of the beverage while …lying on a person ’s stomach [ Kirby does n’t specify whose ] or sitting in a beach chair . ”
A stripped down , floating version ( see above ) is also available , presumably so you can send one last cool beverage out to a drowning buddy .
Robert ’s Water Lounge
Patented 1976
Robert ’s Water Lounge is the perfect outdoor accessory for the overheated guy who longs for new and exciting ways to spend a little one - on - one time with his rubber ducky .
Simply fill it up with water and hop on in to experience a sensation that can only be described as “ sitting in water ” .
It ’s like having a bathtub in your own backyard – so much like it , in fact , that you ’ll have concerned neighbors filing formal police complaints in no time .
Side tray tables and an adjustable back support offer added comfort and convenience while the fish motif and umbrella fringe lend an air of welcome masculinity .
Neptune himself never had it so good .
Note :
We recommend you drag yourself out of your Water Lounge at least once a week in order to change the water .
Again , this is only a recommendation .

Submitting patches and bug reports for modules via RT is the most important thing you can do , because others will be able to see your bug and patch there , no matter what the future fate of your contribution with the upstream module is .
One possible solution for you is to also maintain a set of Distroprefs for CPAN and offer them for download via CPAN .
That way , people can directly incorporate your modifications to modules into their build of CPAN .
On the social side , please also see that an author does not always have the same priorities as you have , and if there is nothing to currently add to a bug report , a " thank you " note would surely be nice but is not always sent .
A module author will always be a " single point of failure " , but if you do n't want a single point of failure , you hire multiple backups .
If you think you 've found a way around this without paying people to work on code , I 'm sure people will look forward to hearing your idea .
Personally , I doubt that any technical scheme , like requiring " two maintainers " will work .
This will just make people " swap " maintainerships and not be more responsive to your requests .
More CPAN modules need to be hosted on revision - control - system repositories so that it is easier to submit patches and easier to produce releases after patches are applied .
Although it may not seem like a lot of work to apply a patch and release a new version , it is certainly more work than it should be and this leads to authors being more likely to be blockers of new releases .
I wish CPAN would ( place more emphasis on / pay more respect to ) progress and less on / to " ownership " .
Although the shift here would be rather subtle , I still think that it would help a lot to have the default be to allow new versions of modules to be indexed even if they are n't by an " authorized " author , so long as it has been a few months since an " authorized " author released a version .
It should n't require manual intervention to allow somebody to release a new version of an abandoned module .
If the " owner " objects , then they can become active and prevent such releases from being " official " ( and thus prevent them from being fully indexed ) by simply releasing every few months .
If Joe Random Contributor can easily not just write a patch that fixes a bug but actually check in a patch and then check out a new snapshot of a module ( and reconcile any work - in - progress that has not yet been released to CPAN ) , then Joe is more likely to feel like producing the full patch that updates the Changes file and adds appropriate unit tests ( etc. ) .
I 've certainly refrained from producing patches for modules quite a few times because the black box ( hole ? ) of " you have to submit it to the ' author ' and hope they do something with it " often does n't look promising .
I have quite a few small patches to modules in various states at various places .
From time to time I try to produce a new release of a module and usually find that the little details end up soaking up enough time that the release never actually gets finished and on CPAN before I 'm pulled away for other tasks .
Then , when I return , more little details have amassed ( or been misplaced ) and the same failure happens again .
So I 've started down the road of putting my modules into public git repositories .
But , alas , that task is not yet completed either .
It would be cool if CPAN ( or , more likely , PAUSE ) were to acquire such features ( or at least to facilitate them ) , but we are all volunteers , of course ... - tye
I fully agree with all of your points .
( Except that I use svn instead of git , but that really does n't matter ) .
As long as the technical side is n't resolved , it might help to encourage people to hand out co-maintainership freely .
It might help to have a wiki ( or some such ) where you can offer upload privileges , and list TODO items .
For example I 'm happy to help with Unicode handling of pure - perl modules .
I 'd just scan that list once a week , and see if there 's something interesting .
And when I work with a module anyway , I can just as well apply a few simple patches that live in the RT .
Or I could just notice a module I 'm familiar with , and accept co-maintainership to to decrease the response times to bug reports and patches .
My experience with the pugs repository are very encouraging .
We hand out commit bits very freely ( when somebody say " I found a typo in file $ file " , the answer is usually " should I fix it , or do you want a commit bit ? " ) , and so far have n't had any problems with vandalism or very poor commits .
In any case I think it 's important to try to lower the entry barrier for contribution to CPAN modules .
Maybe somebody wants to write a Meditation on that matter ( to increase visibility and to have a better title ) ?

I do n't think hosting more CPAN modules in revision control would matter to most people or most modules .
Although a small group of people will actually make a patch against the repository , most people do n't .
Even if a few people do patch against the repo , I 've only ever had one person also update the tests .
It might be hard for some hard - core contributors to realize that , but most people either do n't have the time or inclination , and even more people do n't have the skills to do it .
You do n't need anyone 's permission to upload a new version of an abandoned module .
PAUSE just does n't index it if you do n't have privileges .
A restive period is not helpful because some modules do n't need updates in that time frame .
There 's no timeframe that you can apply across of all CPAN .
Do n't refrain from patches because you think the author wo n't help .
Make the patch public , such as in RT , and other people can get it even if the author does n't apply it .
Do n't hide from the rest of the world what you know because one person does n't respond to you .
And , making the patch public starts the history of an author not responding to you and makes it easier for the PAUSE admins to see what happened so they can transfer the module when necessary .

This is the point of http://svn.ali.as.
I 've put DBM :: Deep in there and will ( at some point ) get the rest of my distros in there , too .
I 'm also an admin there , if anyone wants a committer bit .
But , yes , it would be nice to have both svn.cpan.org and git.cpan.org available .
I wonder what it would take to get that up and running ?
My criteria for good software : Does it work ?
Can someone else come in , make a change , and be reasonably certain no bugs were introduced ?
My criteria for good software :
You make it sound as if the author owes you something .
CPAN is a volunteer operation , people donate code in the hope that it will be useful .
Yes , it 's rude not to acknowledge a bug report or patch , but there are any number of reasons : people may be too busy , the e-mail forwarding address may be obsolete , the author may have lost interest .
It takes discipline to manage CPAN modules correctly and so it's only natural that there 's a certain amount of attrition over the years .
If you have made a concerted effort to get in touch with the author ( and ranting on Perlmonks does n't count ) , can show that you are able to close out most , if not all , bugs on the RT queue of the distribution , then send a message to module-authors@perl.org documenting this , and you will be granted co-maint status on the module .
This happens all the time .

You make it sound as if the author owes you something .
If so that is completely unintended .
It is quite the opposite - I recognize the huge volunteer efforts put into CPAN .
I 'm just wondering if there are ways to improve how CPAN works so that it is less dependent on people being not busy , email accounts correctly set up , and maintainers still having interest in the modules they once wrote .

This happens all the time .
That 's true .
But not all of us are able to fulfill all those conditions .
Most of us can make reasonable efforts to contact a module owner .
Some of us can submit patches to modules .
Very few of us has what it takes to step up and claim ( co - ) ownership of a widely used and fairly complex module .
I certainly do n't belong in the last category , I 'm simply not that skilled .
But I still want to contribute .
I will try to be more patient from now on .

No matter how great and destructive your problems may seem now , remember , you 've probably only seen the tip of them . [ 1 ]
A few years ago I wrote about this in Responsibilities of a module author .
I think it still holds true today .
It would be ideal if authors were more responsive , even to say that a patch or bugfix is n't a priority .
Unfortunately , not everyone is .
I hope you wo n't let a few bad experiences color your perceptions .
When I 've encountered this in the past , after a few months , if it 's a problem I 'm really motivated about , I send the author an email asking about the status of the patch .
If I do n't get a response , I send a similar email once a month or so .
( Not a long email -- like two sentences with a link to the RT entry . )
In most cases , I 've gotten responses back -- usually an apology for being too distracted to work on it .
In other cases , somewhere between three and six months or so , I 've offered to release the patch as a dev version if the author would give me co-maintainer rights .
And I continue to make that offer every couple months .
( That 's how I wound up inheriting a number of modules , I 'll admit . )
Some people may say that this is too much harassment , but I do n't think a 2 - sentence email once a month is inappropriate .
I 'm a " customer " -- albeit for a free product -- and some responsiveness , even to say " I 'm not going to fix that " is a reasonable expectation , I think .
Obviously , if the author says " go away , I wo n't fix that " then I would n't pursue it , but that has n't been my experience .
Usually authors are just legitimately busy with @life and $ job .
If I get no response to any of these emails , then I 'll try other ways to contact an author and if that fails , then if I 'm still motivitated , that 's when I think it 's appropriate to appeal to the PAUSE maintainers for co-maintainer rights .

As the author of many CPAN modules , I would be thrilled to have this sort of reminder .
Fortunately , if people actually read my module docs and do what they say ( put request in RT ) , I can review them later when I have time and interest .
However , if something is important to you , reminding me once a month or so is definitely not a bad thing .
6 months is not a long time for an open source project me thinks .
For example if your country has a Mandatory Military Service law , then you 'll not be doing anything for at least 6 months ( in Turkey this is upto 15 months if you did not graduate from collage ) .
So , yes you can not know what the module author is dealing with .
He can be ill , can have finance probs , $ work can take all his / her time , he / she may even be dead ( eg : Nick Ing - Simmons )
I think it 's better to ask for co-maintainership if you think that the bugs are really critical and you can even take full control over a specific module if the author is abandoned it ( I abondoned a module and gave the maintainer rights to someone else for example ) .
Another option is asking a co-maintainer permission from PAUSE admins ( you are not Andreas König right ? :) if the bug is causing critical failures .
I think this was done for Template Toolkit some time back ...
If none suits you , you can always fork it and re-create Abc.pm as AbcX.pm and apply the fixes / release to CPAN if the license of the original module permits this .
Please help me restore my faith in CPAN .
Sorry , no can do .
CPAN is just a group of people and there 's no reason you should have faith in all of them !
In fact , some of them are n't going to help you .
( Yes self , I 'm looking at you .
You can be a terrible maintainer ! )
Instead , you should learn to have faith in particular CPAN authors .
Some of them are fantastic - responsive to the most minute and superficial problem .
Some of them are n't .
But do n't worry - CPAN does n't have the single - point of failure you seem to think it does .
If you have an improvement that is n't getting accepted you have an easy remedy - fork the code and release your new version .
If the module is truly abandoned you can even take it over and release under the same name .
Then you 'll be in the position to inspire faith in others by your awesome example !
Open source software did n't get where it is today by letting the inconsistencies of bad maintainers slow it down .

There 's no official channel for bug reports .
I 'm not sure what you submitted or where you submitted it to .
Some authors use RT , some do n't .
It 's not a single system .
Three bug reports is n't a big number considering the size of CPAN and the number of reports that authors do reply to .
All you know is that you got no response .
Email is quickly becoming unreliable because people not only filter their own mail , but upstream portions are filtering mail too .
You do n't know if anyone got the message , if they got the message and ignored it , got the message and forgot about it , and so on .
If you do n't get a response , try another way .
The PAUSE system ( because we 're really not talking about CPAN ) does not have a single point of failure as you describe .
Some modules have only one maintainer , but the system allows for multiple maintainers .
The system can handle multiple maintainers just fine .
This is n't a problem with the system .
Look at Parrot , for instance .
They have a different release manager every month .
You do n't want just anyone to upload any module .
We 'd quickly make CPAN useless as no one would know which version of a module to use .
Do we use your version , or Joe 's version , or Bob 's version ?
Do n't be too quick to change things because there is something you do n't like .
Anything new will have its own set of problems .
You can always make local patches as the PAUSE admins figure things out .
Next time , you might choose a better subject line for your patch .
Instead of " minor improvement " , which means to me as an author that it's not urgent and I can think about it later , actually say why I would apply that patch , " Avoid warning when $ foo is undefined " .
Even then , minor changes like that sometimes do n't warrant a new release each time , so some authors save up everything for the next release .

Some observations , from my limited number of patches / bug reports on CPAN : 1 . modules that are heavily used tend to have fairly good turn - around on bug reports & patches ( which may just be because heavily used modules have more patches and bug reports ) .
Case in point : DBD :: mysql still has some outstanding unicode bugs , but AFAICT that 's mostly because nobody can figure out a good way to solve them , and there is at least some discussion on the RT about them .
( Note that DBD : : mysql also gets a lot of " bogus " bug reports due to its not very robust test suite ) .
The patches I submitted were incorporated in the next release ( which took about a month and a half IIRC ) .
2 . Some modules really only have a few users , and the author might have moved on .
Authors of those modules ( myself included ) may not be very actively maintaining them .
I try to keep Audio : : LADSPA more or less up to date with bugs , but it can take a week or two before I can work up the energy to check out a patch or bug report on it .
My schedule is pretty hectic at the moment and I can't really afford to spend a lot of time working on stuff that is n't directly related to my job during the day .
" What should it profit a man , if he should win a flame war , yet lose his cool ? "
I 'm an unresponsive CPAN author and it's because I do n't have time .
I hit email bankruptcy a year ago and now only check my mail once every few months .
Most things I just discard and never look at .
This includes most messages about modules .
I wish this were n't so but I simply do n't have time to do on - going maintenance for things that are n't actively requiring my attention .
I am nearly always easily found on IRC and I hand out PAUSE permissions freely .
Perhaps next life I can be a good CPAN author .

You ARE a good CPAN author .
You may not be a great maintainer ( for completely understandable reasons ) but if you RECOGNISE you can't maintain your code , and provide an easy to use mechanism for people to take over your work and continue , you 've behaved in a responsible manner as the original author .
Any author that knows to lead , follow , or get out of the way is an excellent author .
... I am nearly always easily found on IRC and I hand out PAUSE permissions freely .
Suggestion : set up your cpan.org email address with an auto - responder that says what you just said above .
That 's at least a step towards being a good CPAN author . :-)

From Conservapedia
The starlight problem , or starlight travel - time problem , concerns the placement of stars at distances so far from Earth that starlight could not traverse that distance , at its current velocity , in less than the age of the universe .
Yet the light has reached Earth anyway .
This raises a question under both atheistic and biblical theories , including the Big Bang theory : how did this starlight reach Earth so quickly ?
This is a major point of interest in the question of an old universe vs. young universe .
The starlight problem is not in any conflict with the description in the Book of Genesis , which says , " let there be light , and there was light . "
It does not say , " let there be stars to generate light that can illuminate darkness , " or " let there be light , and there was darkness that light later reached . "
There is no way to " date " the age of light observed in the sky .
The speed of light may not be constant throughout the universe , but that possibility is disfavored by those who adhere to the theory of relativity .
It is also possible that the universe has expanded at a rate faster than the speed of light , although that too would be contrary to the theory of relativity .
[ 1]
It is further possible that stellar distances inferred from redshifts are incorrect , as theorized by Halton Arp .
The Crab nebula , a supernova remnant
The size of the universe
The maximum distance that can be determined using parallax calculations is about 3300 light years .
[ 2 ]
Indirect measures , correlating the brightness of stars called cepheids with the period of their variability , estimate the Milky Way diameter of approximately 80 - 100,000 light years , although others estimate the size of the entire universe to be as narrow as only 12,000 light years across . [ 3 ]
Calculations based on the observed brightness of supernovae of known energy output can determine the distance to more distant objects .
The most distant object known is a galaxy cluster is estimated to be approximately thirteen billion light - years away from Earth , observed by the Hubble Telescope using gravitational lensing . [ 4 ]
Horizon Problem for the Big Bang Theory
Although atheists simplistically use the starlight problem to argue against a young Earth , the Big Bang theory has had difficulty in explaining its own light travel problem , known as the horizon problem .
The Big Bang model proposes that the temperature of the Cosmic Microwave Background ( CMB ) would have varied considerably from place to place early in the universe , yet because the speed at which this radiation can disperse from hotter to colder parts of the universe is limited by the speed of light , there has not been enough time for the radiation to even out , yet observations today show it to be extremely uniform [ 5 ] ( with fluctuations at the part - per- million level [ 6 ] ) .
The problem is this : even assuming the big bang timescale , there has not been enough time for light to travel between widely separated regions of space .
So , how can the different regions of the current CMB have such precisely uniform temperatures if they have never communicated with each other ?
This is a light - travel–time problem . [ 5 ]
A number of solutions to this problem have been proposed , including several versions of an " inflationary model " , in which space itself expanded faster than the speed of light early in the Big Bang , but after different areas exchanged radiation to even out the temperature .
This model fits the data , as the CMB is only uniform at certain scales ; over large enough areas anisotropies are visible in the field that match what one would expect from a rapidly expanding gas .
However , there is no consensus on which explanation is correct , and each of the proposed solutions has its own problems . [ 5 ]
Flaws in arguing for an old universe based on starlight
The observation that many stars are millions of light years away is one of distance , not time .
Since it takes light one year to travel a distance of one light year , it is possible to view an object as it was in the past , with the number of years in the past equal to the number of light years in distance .
Some scientists argue that the oldest objects visible today are gamma ray bursts over 13 billion light - years away , [ 7 ] but if the universe is expanding then it should be possible to observe stars that are now actually much further away .
Light created in transit
As suggested by the " let there be light " verse in Genesis , God likely created light , not merely light sources .
Accordingly , some observed light did not necessary travel from a distant star .
This concept is generally accepted as an extension of the Omphalos hypothesis , which is the idea that God created the universe with apparent age .
One objection to this idea [ 8 ] is that the light created in transit would make it appear , from an atheistic scientific perspective , that events happened when they really did not .
But this is no different from realizing , for example , that Adam was created as an adult rather than as an embryo .
This particular solution is not falsifiable .
Moon - Spencer theory
Some creationists promoted an idea by Parry Moon and Domina Spencer that light somehow takes a shortcut through " Riemannian Space , " taking no more than 15 years to reach Earth from the outer limits of the universe .
However , this idea never really caught on and appears to no longer have adherents . [ 9 ]
Decrease in the speed of light
Creationist Barry Setterfield has proposed that the speed of light was faster in the past . [ 10 ]
This idea initially found wide acceptance by creationists , but is now widely rejected , although some still hold to the idea .
One criticism of it by anti-creationists was that if the speed of light had changed , we should see the difference in the Fine Structure Constant as measured by nearby stars versus distant stars , but this was not observed .
Yet in 1999 , John Webb , a professor at the University of New South Wales in Sydney , Australia , and his colleagues reported astronomical observations suggesting that the value of the fine - structure constant may indeed have changed .
They subsequently published this in Physical Review Letters . [ 11 ] [ 12 ]
However , although this showed that mainstream scientists are open to new and controversial ideas , the methods Webb used were shown to contain simple flaws , which discredited the results . [ 13 ]
A later study of 23 absorption systems using the ' Very Large Telescope ' found no measurable changes . [ 14 ]
These problems with the theory have led most creationists to drop the idea , although some credit it with stimulating further research . [ 15 ]
Systematic uncertainties are difficult to quantify and so Webb 's results still need to be checked by independent analyses , using quasar spectra from different telescopes .
Their efforts are ongoing , apparently by several different teams of scientists .
Humphreys ' model
In 1994 Dr. Russell Humphreys proposed a new cosmology [ 16 ] that includes a bounded universe with a center and an edge , that God had created 6,000 years ago as a much smaller body than today , then stretched it out , making it much larger .
In Humphreys ' model , because the universe has a center and an edge ( unlike the unbounded model of the Big Bang universe ) , the center of the universe is also the center of a gravity well , meaning that gravity is stronger at the center of the universe than at the edge .
As gravity can affect the rate at which time passes , he calculated that while the six days of creation week were passing on Earth , billions of years ' of time was passing at the edge of the universe .
According to this idea , the Biblical references to time are according to an observer ( real or imaginary ) on Earth , so ages are given in " Earth time " .
However , this theory is not without problems .
The evidence contradicts Humphrey 's assumption that the earth is in a large gravity well .
If the earth were in such a gravity well , light from distant galaxies should be blue - shifted .
Instead , it is red-shifted .
Also , gravitational time dilation , if it existed on such a large scale , should be easily observable .
On the contrary , we observe ( from the periods of Cepheid variable stars , from orbital rates of binary stars , from supernova extinction rates , from light frequencies , etc. ) that such time dilation is minor .
It is thought that here is some time dilation corresponding with Hubble 's law ( i.e. , further objects have greater red shifts ) , but this is due to the well - understood expansion of the universe , and it is not nearly extreme enough to fit more than ten billion years into less than 10,000 . [ 17 ]
Furthermore , in the event the Earth was in the center of an immense gravity well , the core of the planet should be composed of a soup of subatomic particles , like a Neutron fluid . [ 18 ]
This model receives cautious but wide support among creationists .
Humphreys has since revised his model [ 1 ] solving the above problems .
While calculating a metric for his White Hole Cosmology , Humphreys discovered an as of yet unnoticed ( obscured by motion in more complicated metrics ) effect of General Relativity , which causes large timeless zones .
In Humphrey 's model , the Universe is surrounded by a large mass of water , and the Earth is near the center of it , as is evidenced by bigger and bigger spherical shells of galaxies farther away from the Earth .
Humphrey 's theorizes that the expansion and recession of the fabric of time and its contents created a zone of timelessness , or anachronicity , around our solar system while billions of years passed outside .
Because galaxies were formed in shells as the universe expanded , we would be seeing them as they appeared ~6000 years after creation ( if we disregard his suspicion about a 500 million year anachronicity zone during the flood ) , despite them being actually billions of years old .
Time dilation field
Dr. John Hartnett , a creationist physicist , spurred by Humphreys ' model , has proposed an alternative time dilation model , by theorizing the Earth was in a time - dilation field during the first few days of creation , from Earth 's point of view , while billions of years passed for the rest of the universe .
According to the Bible , God " stretched out " [ 19 ] the heavens ( space ) , and this movement during creation week caused time to travel faster for those objects , in accordance with Einstein 's Special Theory of Relativity , adding to the time dilation caused by gravity , per Humphreys , in accordance with Einstein 's General Theory of Relativity . [ 20 ]
Anisotropic synchrony convention
The speed of light was calculated at roughly 300 million meters per second by way of having the light go to a mirror and come back , then dividing the time by two .
It can not be done without the mirror since difference in location may alter timing , and any corrections require the speed of light in the calculations .
Thus , it has been suggested by Dr. Jason Lisle that the speed of light may not be 300 million meters per second in any direction , but rather instantaneous in one direction and 150 million meters per second in the other . [ 21 ]

Would - Be Bomber Caught at Orlando Airport
Oddly enough , I flew into Orlando Airport on Tuesday night , hours after TSA and police caught Kevin Brown — not the baseball player — with bomb - making equipment in his checked luggage .
( Yes , checked luggage .
He was bringing it to Jamaica , not planning on blowing up the plane he was on . )
Seems like someone trained in behavioral profiling singled him out , probably for stuff like this :
“ He was rocking left to right , bouncing up and down … he was there acting crazy , ” passenger Jason Doyle said .
But that was a passenger remembering Brown after the fact , so I would n’t put too much credence in it .
There are a bunch of articles about Brown and potential motives .
Note that he is not an Islamic terrorist ; he ’s a U.S. Army veteran who served in Iraq :
“ This is not him , ” she said in a phone interview .
“ It has to be a mental issue for him .
I know if they looked through his medical records …
I ’m sure they will see …
” He ’s not a terrorist . ”
Brown married
Holt ’s daughter , Kamishia , 25 , about three years ago .
They met while serving in the Army and separated a year later .
Brown was n’t the same after returning from Iraq , her daughter told her .
“ When he does n’t take it [ medication ] , he ’s off the chain , ” Holt said .
“ When you do n’t take it and drink alcohol , it makes it worse . ”
Does n’t sound like a terrorist , but this does :
According to the affidavit , Brown admitted he had the items because he wanted to make pipe bombs in Jamaica .
It also indicated he wanted to show friends how to make pipe bombs like he made while in Iraq .
Federal agents said federal agents found two vodka bottles filled with nitro-methane , a highly explosive liquid , as well as galvanized pipes , end caps with holes , BBs , a model - rocket igniter , AA batteries , a lighter and lighter fluid , plus other items used to make pipe bombs and detailed instructions and diagrams .
He indicated the items were purchased in Gainesville where he lived at one time .
Ignore the hyperbole ; nitromethane is a liquid fuel , not a high explosive .
Here ’s the whole affidavit , if you want to read it .
Even with all this news , the truth is that we just do n’t know what happened .
It looks like a great win for behavioral profiling ( which , when done well , I think is a good idea ) and the TSA .
The TSA is certainly pleased .
But we ’ve seen apparent TSA wins before that turn out to be bogus when the details finally come out .
Right now I ’m cautiously pleased with the TSA ’s performance , and offer them a tentative congratulations , especially for not over - reacting .
I read — but ca n’t find the link now — that only 11 flights were delayed because of the event .
The TSA claims that no flights were delayed , and also says that no security checkpoints were closed .
Either way , it ’s certainly something to congratulate the TSA about .

Hearing that the Nobel laureate and human rights campaigner Shirin Ebadi is launching her latest book in London has reminded me of the pride and hope I felt as an Iranian woman when in 2003 she became the first Iranian woman and , indeed , the first Muslim woman to receive the imprimatur of international moral leadership .
Lately though , hope – like human rights - has become a scarcer commodity for many of Iran 's citizens .
This is particularly true for Iranians who , like myself , are members of the Bahá 'í faith .
Last month six members of the informal leadership committee of Iran 's 300,000 - strong Baha 'i community were arrested .
A seventh colleague has been detained since March .
No word has been heard from them since their arrests .
They are being held incommunicado with no access to lawyers and no contact with relatives .
One of them , Jamaloddin Khanjani , is my uncle .
Recently , when the Friday prayer leader in Mashhad publicly called for the execution of these leaders , I and my co-religionists the world over , could not but recall the early years following the 1979 Iranian revolution when the entire membership of the elected Baha 'is governing council , the National Spiritual Assembly , were abducted and never seen again .
Eight of the nine successors were later also arrested and executed .
The authorities ' violent suppression of the peaceful Baha 'i community moved on to target those individuals who were most active at regional and municipal level .
In June 1980 my own father , Yusuf Subhani was executed .
His only crime was being a Baha'i .
What have my uncle and his colleagues done to provoke such treatment ?
According to Iranian officials they have been detained for " security reasons " yet the history of past persecution of the Bahá 'ís demonstrates that if they are willing to recant their faith and embrace Islam , their so - called crimes against " national security " are instantly forgiven .
There is much scepticism around the ideals of universal human rights and the efficacy of international engagement .
Yet a glance at Iran 's actions in the past three decades demonstrates that the authorities ' willingness to execute Baha 'is coincidentally declined in tandem with greater levels of international condemnation of their human rights record through international diplomacy .
It may be naïve to believe that diplomacy and public pressure can yield instant results or a comprehensive solution in short order , but peaceful and resolute scrutiny has had an impact before : Hamid Pourmand , a Christian convert , originally facing death for apostasy was later acquitted after concerted international action .
The western media 's often ethnocentric vision of Iran as a land of " mad mullahs " belies the sophistication and complexity of a land that is heir to an immense cultural heritage , as well as more open to ideas than its detractors give it credit for .
Dr Ebadi is perhaps the most visible symbol of this cosmopolitan Iran .
Iran is not insensible to issues of rights .
Indeed , its government champions the rights of Muslims who are victims of injustice throughout the world .
The authorities in Tehran were particularly exercised over the issue of cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad when they appeared in a Danish newspaper .
Most of the Muslim world - and indeed , people of all faiths - would not hesitate to object to the defamation of a holy or revered figure .
But the Iranian authorities sadly do not reciprocate with respect for the sanctities of others .
Recently 5,000 copies of a children 's picture - book entitled , The Deceitful Babak was posted as a " gift " to Iranian schoolchildren .
This book is a slanderous , historically - inaccurate and distorted account of the life of the 19th century religious teacher known as the Bab , one of the two highly - revered Prophet - Founders of the Baha 'i faith .
This callous indifference to others sense of reverance extends even beyond death .
Baha'i corpses have been dug up and their bones desecrated as part of a concerted programme to vandalise and destroy a number of Baha 'i cemeteries .
Precisely for what " security reasons " were these long - departed members of the Baha 'i community responsible ?
The tragedy of Iran 's obsessive witch - hunt against its largest non-Muslim religious minority is that the Baha 'is cherish an abiding love for their country and have remained there – despite intense persecution – because they wish to contribute to its progress and prosperity .
Iran is their homeland , and as the cradle of their faith and others , they extol it as a sacred land .
Their steadfastness in the face of oppression , and the evidence of their goodwill towards their countrymen is gaining increasing recognition amongst ever greater numbers of Iranians at home and abroad .
Muslim campaigners are openly calling for the Iranian government to respect the human rights of its Baha 'i population .
In the face of the manifold cruelties that the Iranian government inflicts upon a religious community that it views with suspicion and enmity , more and more Muslims in Iran appear to be saying , " Not in my name ! "
Dozens of teenage boys from Jerusalem received the same ICQ message : “ We ’re putting an end to all the Arabs who hang out in ‘ Pisga ’ [ Pisgat Ze ’ev ] and the mall , whistle at the girls , curse , threaten little kids .
Anyone who is Jewish and wants to put an end to all that should be at Burger Ranch at 10 P.M. , and we ’ll finally show them they ca n’t hang in our area anymore .
Anyone who is willing to do that and has Jewish blood should add his name to this message . ”
It would have been difficult to choose a more cynical date on which to send out such a message : Wednesday , April 30 , the eve of Holocaust Remembrance Day .
Dozens of boys arrived at the meeting place in the Pisgat Ze ’ev shopping mall .
They streamed in from all parts of the capital , some on foot , some by bus and some driven in by parents .
Equipped with knives , sticks and clubs , they all had one purpose : to do harm to Arabs for being Arabs .
At the entrance , the gang encountered two boys from the Shuafat refugee camp , who had come to shop for clothes and did n’t know the mall had closed early for Holocaust Day .
The day ’s end saw the two battered , bleeding and stabbed , and at Hadassah University Hospital in Ein Karem .
A few days ago , an indictment was submitted to the Jerusalem District Court against 11 of the attackers – teenage boys aged 15 - 19 .
Their testimony indicates the attack was perpetrated in a society in which violence against Arabs is seen as a legitimate and necessary means by which to restore Jewish hegemony to the neighborhood .
“ I study in Pisgat Ze ’ev at the Teddy Kollek School , ” Rafael ( his and all the other teens ’ names have been changed ) , 15 , told police .
“ Last Tuesday began as an ordinary day .
School .
I returned from gym and on my way to class , I overheard some guys saying that tomorrow we would be meeting in the mall to fight the Arabs .
I went home and like every day , logged on to the computer and connected to ICQ … After I talked with some people for half an hour , they sent me a message that tomorrow , on the eve of Holocaust Remembrance Day , we would meet at 10 P.M. to fight the Arabs who whistle at the girls and harass little kids .
I sent the message to one person . ”
Another teen , Yaron , said in his testimony : “ I received a message on ICQ on the Thursday before … The day came and at 8:30 P.M.
I went to my barber in Pisgat Ze ’ev , Kobi Ben Haim , for a haircut .
After Kobi finished cutting my hair he said , ‘ Yalla , in another hour and a half we ’ll screw the Arabs . ’ ”
Ill - fated day
At the same time , in the Abu Kamal home in Shuafat in northern Jerusalem , 18 - year - old Ahmed was preparing to go out .
“ He told me he wanted to buy clothes , ” said his father Jemal .
“ I heard that in Pisgat Ze ’ev there ’s a mall , that it ’s like Jaffa Road , inexpensive .
I said to him , ‘ Great , go , why not ? ’ ”
Ahmed is the second of 12 children .
“ He saw that I was having a tough time and that he had to help me , and since then he ’s been working as a janitor in the Shaare Zedek Medical Center .
My child is calm , none of us has a police record .
We have Jewish and Arab friends , we have nothing against anyone and people in the village respect us . ”
Toward evening , Ahmed left his house and when he arrived at Pisgat Ze ’ev he met another teenager from the refugee camp , 16 - year - old Walid .
“ The little Arab , ” as the Jewish boys described him during their interrogation , used to walk around the area looking for jobs .
When he met Ahmed that evening they decided to continue together to the mall .
In his testimony to the police , Walid said : “ We were on the way to the mall to buy clothes .
We arrived at about 7 P.M.
When we wanted to go inside , the guard told us that everything was closed and only the clinic was open .
We left the mall , entered the nearby gas station , bought food and sat in the park near the mall until 9 P.M .
We were planning to return home , and on the way back we saw a big crowd near the mall . ”
When Ahmed and Walid sat down to eat , the Jewish boys began to gather near the local Burger ’s Bar restaurant .
Rafael told police : “ In the evening I took a knife from my room .
I put the knife in my pocket and went out into the street . ”
What did you know was about to happen ?
Rafael : “ A fight with Arabs … I wanted to see what was happening there . ”
Why did you come with a knife ?
“ I go everywhere with a knife .
If someone wants to buy it , I ’ll have it to give to him …
The knife is always with me and it does n’t make any difference if there ’s a violent activity or not .
It was with me from the morning . ”
You go to school with a knife , too ?
“ Yes .
Always one . ”
Rafael arrived at the meeting point with his friend Shlomi , 15 .
“ Like a retard , I argued with him for about an hour to give me the knife .
In the end I took the knife … Its handle is the size of three fingers , even less .
One of those stupid little ones , just a knife , ” he said in his interrogation .
The group waited for a long time at the spot , but nothing happened .
“ We waited for about two hours , everyone with wooden boards , bats , not a single Arab passed by , ” said Shlomi .
At this point , the boys decided to move to a more strategic location , opposite the entrance to the mall .
Unfortunately for the two friends from Shuafat , they had to pass the mall on the way back home .
“ When we passed by , ” Walid said in his testimony , “ a guy came over to us and told us to come over to him .
He called his friend , pointed to me and said to him , ‘ Is this the guy that made trouble ? ’
His friend said no . ”
According to the police , the two young men who spoke to them were Liran Asraf , 18 , and another boy , Shaul , 15 .
Shaul told police : “ We waited for about 15 - 20 minutes and two Arabs arrived .
I approached the big Arab and spoke to him , asked whether he was hitting on the girls .
And then I threw a lit cigarette between the shoulder and neck of the big Arab .
He looked at me , wanted to kill me .
His eyes popped out and then he kept looking , and suddenly all the kids attacked the little one .
They simply pushed him against the railing and stepped on him . ”
Why did you throw the lit cigarette at the Arab ?
Shaul : “ Because he hit on the girls .
Because the Arabs hit on the girls . ”
Did he start fighting with anyone ?
“ No .
The fact is , the first time I saw those Arabs was at the mall . ”
Who was with you and what did each one do ?
“ I ’m asking you not to show them I ’m talking about them , because afterward they ’ll call me an informer .
What I saw was feet and jumping .
The ones who were there were Rafael and his brother Naor .
Yaron , who had a stick , hit him between the ribs or the head , I do n’t remember exactly .
Uzi jumped on his body .
I more or less saw that they all jumped , kicked , stepped on him , on the Arab .
The kid was a trampoline and punching bag .
That ’s it .
I swear to you that I cried a little on the side .
And then the police came and all of them ran away like ants .
If the police had n’t come after five minutes , that boy would have been done for .
I came back after three or four minutes to see what was happening with him and I heard him shouting ‘ Mother , Mother . ’ ”
What happened with the big Arab ?
“ I did n’t look at the big one .
Only at the little one because there were about 80 kids there . ”
“ I saw that everyone was beating the little one severely , ” said Shlomi in his interrogation .
“ I swear to you I do n’t know how he survived it .
He ’s 17 , but he comes up to my stomach .
The way he was pushed against the railing and the blows he got , I do n’t know how the boy is alive .
Anyone who tells you that he did n’t do anything is a liar . ”
Walid only remembers that “ a gang of kids , more than 80 , pounced on us and they had clubs and knives in their hands and they attacked us .
All I remember now is that I passed out and woke up in the hospital . ”
While the boys were beating Walid like a punching bag , Ahmed was stabbed in the back .
According to the indictment , those who stabbed him were Naor and his brother Rafael , who took the knife from his friend Shlomi .
“ I walked toward the mall , ” Ahmed told Haaretz .
“ But I did n’t go inside , I passed by the entrance to the plaza and there was a large group of guys there , they were just standing there and I walked among them at the side of the road .
I heard them talking among themselves and they said something like , ‘ Is it them ?
Is it them ? ’ and then someone stabbed me in the back with a knife , threw me down and continued to beat me .
One guy bit my ear .
I do n’t know how I managed to get up , but I got up and ran away .
They chased me and threw stones .
I continued to run and started to lose my breath because of the injury and the running , until I could n’t go on . ”
Shlomi told police he had tried to stab Ahmed , but he said his “ stupid little ” knife broke .
“ When the Arabs came and they started beating them , like an idiot I got near his leg and the knife broke and nothing happened to the boy , not even a hole .
You can even check his legs . ”
‘ Holes in his back ’
What part did brothers Naor and Rafael play in the incident ?
Shlomi : “ Naor stabbed the big Arab … The Arab was standing , Naor was behind him , the Arab started to advance and Naor came at him with a kitchen knife with a black handle and afterward I saw the Arab running with holes in his back and his whole jacket was full of blood .
I saw it clearly . ”
Naor denied these things in his interrogation and claimed , “ I gave him two kicks and ran away .
That ’s all . ”
Another boy who was present , Ya’akov , 16 , said in his interrogation that “ these were two groups that split up .
Each one attacked a different Arab , but most of the chaos was where I was looking .
At least 20 kids hitting and lots of others , 100 , standing on the side … I saw one heavy one , a fat face with a beard and stubble , he was holding a board like a construction board , 60 centimeters long .
I heard someone , I could n’t tell who , saying ‘ Move for a second , move , ’ and then he came and hit the Arab on the head with the stick .
The Arab held his head after a second and shouted ‘ ay ’… Aside from the stick , I saw that they punched him hard , hit him .
And then he started running toward the gas station . ”
What did you do ?
Ya’akov : “ Nothing .
I wo n’t lie to you .
I did n’t touch them .
I only watched along with others who were hitting . ”
Did any of the minority group members attack anyone ?
“ What do you mean by minority group members ? ”
Arabs .
“ I did n’t see them attacking anyone .
The truth is they could n’t because of the large number of kids who were there . ”
Why did it happen ?
“ Probably because they ’re Arabs .
What else could it be ?
Before it happened they sent me a message on ICQ that anyone who ’s a real Jew should come at 10 P.M. on Holocaust Day to the Burger Ranch at Pisgat Ze’ev .
I saw from a distance there were a lot of people and then I remembered the message and I went to see what had happened . ”
Kobi Ben Haim , the barber who according to Yaron ’s testimony exulted at the opportunity “ to screw Arabs ” said in his interrogation that he “ went down with a friend of mind for a stroll after work … I approached the place where the fight was going on and then he [ Ahmed ] punched me .
I said to him , ‘ What are you doing ?
What are you doing ? ’
And then I punched him in his left arm and kicked him on the left side of his face and arm . ”
Why should the guy punch you if you do n’t know him and have no quarrel with him ?
Ben Haim : “ I do n’t know .
Maybe because the people had jumped on him and he thought that I jumped on him .
Ask him that , not me . ”
The group beating of the two teenage boys ended only when a police van approached the site by chance .
The boys left Walid lying on the road bleeding , and fled .
Ahmed , who managed to escape , says , “ I began to try to ask for help and I could n’t find people I could talk to , because I do n’t speak Hebrew .
Until in the end I saw someone who spoke Arabic and asked him to call an ambulance , and he called and ordered an ambulance that came and took me . ”
The log of Magen David Adom emergency services and the hospital emergency room describe the events laconically : “ Manner of transportation to the incident : urgent , ” “ wounded after a fight , ” “ temple pulse : 104 , ” “ hematoma under right eye , ” “ shortness of breath , ” “ stabbed by a knife in two places on the back part of the chest cavity , ” “ cut in the right ear lobe , ” etc .
Meanwhile , at his home in Shuafat , Jemal Abu Kamal had difficulty falling asleep .
“ I waited for Ahmed to come home , I did n’t really sleep , ” he says .
“ At almost 1 A.M. I heard the phone ring .
I got up and went immediately to look and I saw the boy was n’t in his bed .
I said ‘ God forbid , something happened .
Maybe something happened to the boy . ’
I answered the phone and they said , ‘ Shalom , we ’re speaking from Hadassah Ein Karem .
Your son is such and such . ’
I , in such a situation , my heart fell .
I said , ‘ What happened ? ’
“ They brought an Arab doctor to the phone who told me , ‘ Do n’t be frightened , but you have to come . ’
I asked how the boy was doing .
He said , ‘ Come to us , with God ’s help it will be all right . ’
I went crazy .
I went to the fifth floor and there I saw they were helping him , they had opened places in his stomach in order to take out blood and air . ”
At the same time , the boys suspected of the attack began to return home .
In an examination of the phone records of those involved in the affair the police discovered among other things the following messaging between two of them , from 4:40 A.M. :
“ Bro , did you see what happened yesterday ? ”
“ Yeah , yeah bro , I kicked the Arab .
I stepped on his head . ”
“ Hahaha .
Yes , aha . ”
“ Bro , speak to everyone , we ’ll do another one like that !! ”
“ To make it short , the police came .
Balagan .
Wait for a month , so things will calm down , we ’ll do another one .
Now keep quiet bro , do n’t talk about it , so nothing will be spilled to the police , you know . ”
“ Aha , okay bro . ”
“ Never mind , soon there ’ll be another one . ”
Boredom and violence
To identify the attackers , the police investigators from the juvenile division of the Zion district used footage from security cameras at the mall .
The suspects turned out to be “ ordinary ” boys , without criminal records , who study at well - known schools in the city .
Some said their participation in the incident was a result of peer pressure .
“ Because of that pressure , you either have to join them or fight with them , ” says a boy of 15 , who is friendly with the teens but who was n’t involved in the incident .
“ Nobody wants to be a social outcast and fight with them all the time , so you join them .
Apparently they were bored , because there really is n’t much to do . ”
Only few of the accused expressed sorrow and regret .
“ It ’s strange , because it was n’t planned , ” said Shlomi .
“ I did n’t come to hurt anyone , but things developed .
You see a lot of people there and that ’s it .
I came there like some kind of idiot .
I ’m sorry and I want to continue studying .
That ’s my future . ”
Superintendent Eyal Goren , who is in charge of the investigation , says they soon discovered this was not another case of routine juvenile violence but an unusual incident of racist - nationalist proportions .
“ In Pisga , there are occasionally unpleasant encounters between minority members and Jewish youth .
There are incidents of violence , harassment on both sides , but we have never seen this kind of organized activity , ” says Goren .
“ The incident was very violent and unusual .
The preliminary organization is unusual , the fact that people who do n’t necessarily know each other came there , and that the younger ones were those who committed the more serious crimes . ”
Who was behind the first ICQ incitement ?
Attorney Rafi Merkavi , who represents brothers Rafael and Naor , says the message was sent out on the Web site of an extremist right - wing group associated with the Beitar Jerusalem soccer team .
Goren insists that no connection was found with Beitar members and he refuses to say whether the police succeeded in discovering the source of the message .
During the course of the investigation it turned out that many had received another ICQ message , similar to that received before Holocaust Day , which called on them to gather for the same purpose on the eve of Memorial Day .
During his interrogation , Shaul said , “ I heard a rumor that on the eve of Memorial Day there would be a meeting , the same thing again , to hurt Arabs .
I knew the police would figure it out , but I did n’t think they would get to me and surprise me . ”
Shlomi said , “ There are going to be 200 kids there because they ’re going to fight with Arabs again .
If you do n’t stop it now it will be a regular thing . ”
Goren says that the investigation prevented the additional attack from occurring .
Two days ago , the Supreme Court decided to release all those who remained in custody to house arrest .
Attorney Reuven Hamburger , who is representing Liran Asraf and Shaul , says the suspects have to go back to school .
He says that “ keeping these boys at home with nothing to do is the thing that is liable , God forbid , to lead to another incident . ”
Attorney Yehuda Shushan , who represented three of the accused during the proceedings , said that “ there is no doubt that this incident must be dealt with from an educational point of view , but at the same time each suspect should be judged according to his individual level of involvement . ”
Anat Asraf , Liran Asraf ’s mother , says her son is the victim .
“ My son has no criminal record and happened to be there out of curiosity , like 200 other children .
In two and a half months from now he is supposed to be drafted and to serve the country .
We did not educate our children in ‘ underground racism ’ as the police presented it , but to stick on the straight and narrow .
He was overcome by curiosity .
I think that he was arrested without any wrongdoing on his part . ”
Two Arab boys ended up in the hospital .
Asraf : “ Look , I ’m not in favor of it and we always told the children that if they see something , even between one Jew and another , they should stay out of it .
But my son is a victim of the state .
Why ?
Because they came and pulled him out of the house in a way that I do n’t know how to describe to you .
How does an investigator come and inflict a police record on such a boy ?
A wonderful boy , a good boy .
They ’ve stigmatized him .
To what extent can you incriminate a group of children without proof ? ”
Does n’t it bother you that Liran went to look at Arabs being beaten up ?
“ We did n’t know , and had we known I promise you that I would n’t have let him leave the house .
The judge said : ‘ Where were the parents ? ’
Really , if a child says that he ’s going to a party , do we know where he ’s going ?
One mother told me yesterday that her son told her he was going to see a film about the Holocaust . ”
Rafael and Naor ’s father is concentrating on keeping his family together .
“ It ’s very difficult for us .
I ’m trying to preserve the family unit somehow . ”
Can you understand where it came from ?
“ The incitement to gather some 150 children near the mall was horrifying , and that ’s what convinced them to come there and try to ‘ clean up ’ the neighborhood .
I understand that the police have yet to discover who spread the message .
Had there not been a message , you would n’t have seen a single child in the street .
There are a lot of problems in Pisga and in my opinion they ’re sweeping them under the rug .
There is n’t a week when something does n’t happen here .
To my great regret , it happened on the least suitable day .
Without any relation to the trial , we for our part are trying to find therapists who will treat both the children and us as parents . ”
The Pisgat Ze ’ev mall is in the heart of the Jewish neighborhood that was built in the mid-1980s in northern Jerusalem , beyond the Green Line , and about 50,000 people live there now .
Jews and Arabs , secular and religious sit in cafes and shop at the supermarket and other stores .
One of the store owners said that “ 60 percent of the mall ’s revenue comes from the Arab population . ”
Still , you wo n’t hear many people condemning the attack on the Arab teens here .
“ This is a Palestinian mall , ” says a 15 - year - old sitting with his friends on a stone bench in front of the mall .
“ About 90 percent of those who enter it are Arabs . ”
Under threat
The female security guard at the entrance to the mall says that “ Arab children or teenagers come here , go up to the top floor and spit down .
Sometimes they whistle at the girls , harass them . ”
Next to her sits a man in his twenties .
Until recently , he worked as a security guard in the mall and he is very familiar with the neighborhood .
He heard what happened here on the eve of Holocaust Day and does n’t hide his satisfaction .
“ The police do n’t do anything and the time has come for someone to take the law into his own hands .
It ’s a very good thing . ”
He describes incidents when Arabs beat up Jews and nothing was done .
“ Look , here , ” he says , pointing at a bus stop .
“ About seven kids asked a Jew for a cigarette .
He did n’t give it to them and they beat him up .
Whey are n’t they tried ?
Why are n’t their pictures identified by security cameras ? ”
Attorney Merkavi , formerly the chair of the Pisgat Ze ’ev Community Administration and presently a member of its board of directors , explains : “ It ’s impossible to divorce what happened from the fact that something happened around this plaza .
It bothered them that the Arabs would come and hit on the girls here .
There ’s the fear that these girls will be enticed .
They give them cigarettes and who knows if it does n’t go further than that ? ”
So it ’s a hormonal thing ?
Merkavi : “ Yes .
They do n’t want the Arabs to come and hit on the Jewish girls .
Who knows what else develops there . ”
Do you want to stop them from hitting on the girls ?
“ Yes .
That ’s the point , because that ’s what incites this plaza .
At the same time , we ’re working to explain that it ’s forbidden to take the law into one ’s own hands and to conduct such a pogrom . ”
Ca n’t the girls decide for themselves if they ’re willing to have someone hit on them ?
“ Listen , that ’s dangerous .
These are girls aged 15 - 18 .
I do n’t have to explain to you what temptations there are . ”
Does it bother you ?
“ My personal viewpoint is less important .
It ’s important to me to conceal my viewpoint , especially as a lawyer . ”
Last Monday , 11 P.M.
Three young men sit on a dark staircase in Pisgat Ze ’ev and talk .
The photographer and I ask to speak to them .
It ’s hard to mistake the smell of marijuana wafting from their direction .
I introduce myself as a journalist and they ask to see my ID .
Afterward , one says his sister can’t walk in the street without Arabs whistling at her .
Another says he advises his younger brother not to walk by himself in Pisga , for fear that he ’ll be attacked by Arabs .
The three are well versed in the affair , leaving almost no doubt they are connected to the gang .
They know the names of all the suspects and their lawyers and when exactly each legal proceeding took place .
Suddenly they notice my recording device and become belligerent .
Under threat , I am forced to let them hear the last recording to make sure they were n’t taped .
I erase the recordings , but they are n’t satisfied .
The photographer wants to call the police , and within seconds one starts chasing him .
“ Catch him , ” he shouts to the other two .
They obey , grab me , kick me and throw me onto the stone plaza .
“ Yalla , get out of here , ” they shout at us , adding a hard kick for good measure .
Now all that ’s left is to imagine how Ahmed and Walid felt when they were attacked not far from there by dozens of boys .
Abu Kamal says his son is in very bad shape .
“ He got a blow to the head and now he gets up three or four times a night .
He ’s afraid , sometimes he cries .
He was emotionally damaged and that ’s the worst kind of damage .
Now his condition is not so good and I can’t leave him .
I ’m afraid he ’ll get up and throw himself out of the window at night .
“ I have a lot of Jewish friends , ” he explains .
“ And until now I ’ve been telling my children that a human being is a human being .
This is a small place and we have to live together .
Now I tell him not to be afraid , that it happens , that even among Jews there are such things , that God has written this down .
It ’s little people who did this , maybe they have an illness .
But he ’s afraid and I do n’t know what to do . ”

This is very encouraging news , despite the fact that it 's sad that it 's even necessary .
Guardian :
Barack Obama is recruiting senior staff to a new unit which will combat virulent rumour campaigns on the internet that threaten to cost him votes in the presidential election against John McCain .
The unit is part of a huge expansion of Obama 's campaign team as he shifts from the Democratic nomination race to the campaign for November 's election .
The Obama campaign 's online presence has been absolutely remarkable , so it 's no surprise that they are ahead of the curve on this .
They astutely recognize how effective these despicable smears can be and are gearing themselves up to tackle them head on .
The message this time around is pretty clear : The Democratic nominee will not be swiftboated .

The best time to water outdoors is in the morning , both to reduce water waste and to promote healthy flora .
Morning air is cooler , so less water is lost to evaporation than during the middle of the day .
If you water in the evening , you run the risk of promoting fungi and bacterial diseases .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Retail gas prices hit record highs for the sixth straight day , auto group AAA 's Web site showed Tuesday .
The latest reading from AAA showed that the nationwide average for a gallon of regular unleaded hit $ 3.732 , up from $ 3.718 the previous day .
Gas prices have now increased for seven straight days .
The climb comes ahead of the Memorial Day holiday and start of the summer driving season .
The AAA national average shows gas prices up nearly 11 % over the past month and up 21 % from year - ago levels .
The surge in gas prices comes on the back of climbing crude prices , which have doubled in the last 12 months .
President Bashir says facts have been distorted and exaggerated UN officials fear reports of an imminent indictment against Sudan 's President Omar al - Bashir could endanger the lives of peacekeepers in Darfur .
Prosecutors at the International Criminal Court are expected to present evidence against Mr Bashir on Monday .
The charges could include war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide .
President Bashir has said his country faces a " vicious campaign " .
He denies charges that his government was behind the violence in Darfur .
Over the last five years , more than two million people have fled their villages in Darfur , destroyed by pro-government Janjaweed militia .
The Arab Janjaweed have been accused of ethnic cleansing and genocide against black African civilians , after rebels took up arms in protest at alleged government discrimination in 2003 .
' Playing with fire '
An aide to ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno - Ocampo told the BBC he is to submit evidence to judges on Monday , which could lead to an arrest warrant being issued .
Sudan 's ambassador at the UN says the prosecutor is irresponsible .
" Ocampo is playing with fire , " said Abdalmahmood Abdalhaleem Mohamad , the US Washington Post newspaper reports .
This is laudable in theory , but this would be an initiative fraught with risk for the people of Sudan
Analyst Julie Flint
Viewpoint : Intervention not the answer Send us your comments " If the United Nations is serious about its engagement with Sudan , it should tell this man to suspend what he is doing with this so - called indictment .
There will be grave repercussions . "
The BBC's Laura Trevelyan at UN headquarters says there is considerable alarm about the political consequences of such a move .
Reuters news agency reports that UN staff in Khartoum have been sent an urgent note , urging them to " upgrade their personal security measures " and avoid travel at the weekend and after dark .
" Ensure that you have an adequate supply of food and water in your home for several days , and that your vehicle is fully fuelled .
Keep your personal documents and other essentials available , " it says .
A UN aid worker in Khartoum , who did not want to be identified , told the BBC that issuing an arrest warrant against Mr Bashir would only frustrate peacekeeping efforts .
" The president has sworn to fight to the last man and will not surrender to the ICC , " he said .
Following news of the ICC 's intentions , ambassadors in Khartoum were summoned to the foreign ministry where they were told that an indictment would badly affect the stability of the whole region , state media reports .
Sudan analyst Juliet Flint told the BBC that if Mr Bashir was indicted , it would be at an " inopportune moment " .
She warned that Mr Bashir is unlikely to react " coolly and calmly " and could clamp down on aid workers and peacekeepers in Darfur .
It is estimated that two - thirds of Darfur 's surviving population rely on humanitarian assistance .
On Tuesday , seven Darfur peacekeepers died and 22 others were injured , seven critically , in an ambush - one of the deadliest assaults on UN forces in recent years .

The UN says its peacekeepers fought for over two hours to repulse suspected Janjaweed fighters , who were armed with mortars and rocket - propelled grenades .
The Sudanese government blamed rebel groups for the attack .
The UN estimates that some 300,000 people have died because of the Darfur conflict but Sudan 's government says the scale of the violence has been exaggerated .
The United Nations and African Union have a joint peacekeeping force in Darfur .
But it has just 9,000 of the planned 26,000 troops and has been struggling to contain the violence .
' Wounded animal Ms Flint said an indictment would be " laudable in theory , but this would be an initiative fraught with risk for the people of Sudan " .
" There is no doubt that the war in Darfur was orchestrated at the highest level of government , " she said .
She said Mr Bashir was recently humiliated by Darfuri rebels who attacked a city across the river from the capital in May .
" A wounded animal would strike back , " she said .
The ICC accuses the entire Sudanese government of war crimes in Darfur , although the government denies organising the Janjaweed .
The ICC has already issued arrest warrants for a minister and a militia leader on 51 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
There is concern that the fragile Darfur peace process could be further weakened , along with the shaky peace in South Sudan , where a separate civil war ended in 2005 .
There are also UN peacekeepers in South Sudan .
Sudan does not recognise the ICC and has refused to hand over a government minister and militia leader accused of war crimes last year .
Ali Kushayb , a leader of the Janjaweed militia , and Ahmad Harun , Sudan 's current humanitarian affairs minister have both denied involvement in war crimes .

VIEWPOINT
Gonzalo Oviedo
As representatives of the world 's governments gather to address shortages in major foodstuffs and rising prices , Gonzalo Oviedo counsels them to focus on ecosystems .
The modern business - dominated agricultural industry , he argues , promotes the degradation of nature - and that , in turn , means less and worse food .
Four plant species - wheat , maize , rice and potato - provide over half of the plant - based calories in the human diet
Feeding the world requires healthy ecosystems and equitable governance .
The current model of market - driven food production is leaving people hungry .
It has turned food into a commodity subject to all the market failures that create inequities and negative impacts on the environment .
We have a global food crisis .
A myriad of events are convening the international community to reflect on the urgent situation .
Just in the past month , the UN Commission on Sustainable Development and the UN Convention on Biological Diversity focused considerable attention on agriculture and food security .
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon created a special task force to respond to the crisis and soaring food prices .
And this week , in Rome , the UN Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) is hosting a high - level summit on world food security , climate change and bioenergy .
But this crisis has been long coming .
Unsustainable agricultural policies and technologies , inequitable trade rules , agricultural subsidies that distort the markets , and the systematic marginalisation of small producers lie at the heart of the problem .
In addition , there is chronic under - investment in agriculture in developing countries , and a real neglect of the basic premise that ecosystems have to be in good shape in order to provide good food .
Costs of production
The past 50 years have seen massive expansion of agriculture , with food production more than doubling in order to meet demand .
Neglecting ecosystem concerns has provoked a fisheries crisis too
But it has left us with 60 % of all ecosystem services degraded , accelerated species extinction , and huge loss in genetic diversity .
Currently , four plant species - wheat , maize , rice and potato - provide more than half of the plant - based calories in the human diet , while about a dozen animal species provide 90 % of animal protein consumed globally .
We have already lost three - quarters of the genetic diversity of agricultural crops .
As the agricultural frontier has expanded , those farmers previously dependant on a more diverse source of livelihood have converted to cash crops .
As traditional varieties and breeds die out , so too do the traditional knowledge and practices of local farmers .
Those same practices could now be critical in adapting to climate change .
The focus on agricultural commodities rather than on food production to meet the basic needs of people has undermined diversity and self - reliance , and left farmers vulnerable to volatile markets , political instability and environmental change .
Increased food production in some parts of the world has been at the expense of natural and semi-natural ecosystems that provide us greater long - term security .
In Britain , studies have shown that hay production is higher in meadows with a greater number of species .
Amazingly , there is very little attention being paid to what fundamentally underpins all of our food systems - biodiversity and the services provided by ecosystems
In Australia , crop yields are higher in regions where native biodiversity has been preserved .
In the seas , too , areas with a higher number of conserved species generate more fish for humans to catch and eat .
There are many other examples from land and sea to show that a healthy environment means more food and a greater capacity to survive natural disasters .
The current food crisis , meanwhile , will only be exacerbated by climate change , with southern Africa and South Asia expected to be particularly badly affected .
Market transformation
So what are the solutions to feeding a growing world population in the face of climate change ?
We have been hearing about a Green Revolution for Africa , major irrigation and fertilisation programmes , genetically modified seed varieties , as well as banning the use of crops for biofuel production .
Amazingly , there is very little attention being paid to what fundamentally underpins all of our food systems - biodiversity and the services provided by ecosystems , such as soil , water and resilience to disasters .
We need to attack market failures and change the economic rules of current food production systems .
Developments such as hydroponics can reduce farming 's use of resources
We must eliminate agricultural and fisheries subsidies that support elites in the North , and get rid of protectionist measures in OECD countries for agricultural products .
We have to allow for value - added trade for the benefit of the South , and expand fair trade and labelling processes that create incentives and add benefits to producers in the South .
We must change food production systems , moving from the existing model based on high inputs ( such as fertilisers ) accessible through markets , to systems based on locally available and more environmentally - friendly inputs .
We need to create alternative trade rules and circuits that reduce the payout to middlemen and big agribusinesses .
We must have greater investment , including by bilateral and multilateral development co-operation , to support food production systems that feed the poor and supply local markets .
The governance model related to natural resources has to change .
We must expand small farmers ' and landless peasants ' access to productive assets in countries of the South - lands , water sources and fisheries .
There needs to be a shift away from the prevailing model of concentration of land in small groups of big landowners who are dropping food production for local markets and moving to big industrial production of commodities that produce no local benefits .
Gonzalo Oviedo is senior advisor on social policy with IUCN ( formerly the World Conservation Union ) The Green Room is a series of opinion articles on environmental topics running weekly on the BBC News website Do you agree with Gonzalo Oviedo ?
Is there a global food crisis ?
If so , is it partially down to the farming industry overlooking issues such as biodiversity preservation and traditional knowledge ?
Or has globalisation promoted the availability of food ?
By 2050 world population is projected to increase to 9 Billion and by the same time
It has been estimated that as much as 50 % of the world 's arable land may be unusable .
In order to feed this burgeoning population food production will have to increase by 110 % .
Clearly this is not possible without a radical rethink of production techniques and dietary needs .
The western diet needs to change away from its dependency on high protein meat sources and over consumption .
The West has to address our wanton wastage of food where we are currently throwing away 30 % of the food we buy .
Governments will also have to address the thorny subject of land tenure .
China and the Gulf States are already looking at purchasing land in other countries in order to feed their own populations .
It may well be time for us all to look at the consequences of nationalising productive land in order to ensure an equitable distribution of food .
Peter Griffith , Much Wenlock UK
This opinion piece is completely lacking in any content .
Mr Oviedo presents a lot of rhetoric backed up by a single paragraph of rather flimsy evidence .
So this article makes little or no contribution to any debate .
Chris Rogers , Didcot Can bio diversity actually produce enough food to feed the masses ?
Even if you diversify would you automatically have enough quantity ?
Will small farmers and peasants grow enough to feed the cities ?
Without middlemen , who will find the buyers and transport the food to them ?
How will food production for local markets feed the drought stricken countries of Africa ?
Why do so many people buy the platitudes of these liberal communist commentaries ?
Paul O , Fargo USA
He certainly is right .
No -one is going to change corporations and governments quickly .
Change has to come from all of us as individuals .
In England during the second war war the country had to use all the land to grow food or starve - we 'd better get on with it all again . everywhere .
Water and soil are real essentials to all crops -China knows that with it 's problems as spelt out by Professor Spence in the Reith Lectures on BBC
Alastair Clarke , Stratford on Avon UK Bettina is absolutely right .
All politicians are frightened to address the issue which will preserve resources , bio - diversity and just about any other problem you care to name .
There are too many people and we need to gradually reduce world population .
If we do not then the wars for command of natural resources will increase along with the related horrors of killing and need .
Opposing religions , peoples ' right ' to have children and pursuing reduction instead of growth is not something that squares with the short term cycles of democracy is it ?
I am not suggesting dictatorship , just pointing out that our current systems are not built for long term solutions .
Rob Hollis , Wilmslow Agriculture should be applauded for its achievement in supplying the needs of teh world in the past 30 years .
If the cossetted western commentators would allow this trend to continue - with use of ALL available technologies - the agricultural businesses would continue to feed the world
martin smith , shrewsbury UK Virtually nobody is addressing the fundamental problem of over - population .
Most groups are seriously culpable of ignorance or burying their heads in the sand on this issue - politicions either clueless or dare not speak out , religious leaders peddling anti birth control propaganda , selfish couples with large families - the list is endless .......
A few years ago I heard a Swedish politicion promoting a higher birth rate ' so that the older generation will have enough people to look after them ' !
With logic like that , what hope for the second and third worlds ?
Education is required .
We are well on our way to consuming virtually everything the earth has to offer in a century or two .
Intuitively , I sense that , in the long term , the planet would struggle to support one tenth of the current population yet all the talk is about how much longer it will take to double !
Population growth is the root cause of nearly all our current problems .
Come on politicions , educate yourselves , stand up and be counted on a platform of population reduction !
Colin Hubbard , Altrincham , UK
So where will all we new farmers farm ?
Are we to empty the cities into the rural areas and " re-distribute " the land ?
And while we 're busy doing that , who will be the doctors , artists , philosophers , politicians ( no loss there ! ) and others who depend on exchanging their talents for food ?
I expect the next step to satisfy the anti-business types who have written is to intentionally shorten our lifespans back to what was " normal " at some arbitrary point in time .
Granted , biodiversity and intact ecosystems are valuable , and if there were less hungry mouths in the world , would likely be more prevalent .
The demand for food ( i.e. agricultural commodities ) drives production .
Where does the demand come from ?
People , too many of them .
I 'm no philosopher , but letting them starve to balance the ecosytem is not an acceptable option .
Brent , Calgary , Canada
I work for one of the UN agencies involved heavily in food security and development .
Gonzalo has made an excellent summary of our big problems and the direction we , as a global community need to be heading to solve them .
Unfortunately the solutions to these problems are not widely agreed upon let alone the diplomacy issues in attempting to address them with world powers who just want to throw cash at a problem rather than make difficult changes in their our countries .
For example , a key issue for many countries is as Gonzalo points out , that they have been moved towards high input crops .
All of a sudden , or not so sudden if you 've been paying attention , fuel and fertiliser required for the high yield crops makes the final value of the commodity out of reach for the poor in those countries .
Some GM crops solve this issue , however it puts our local farmers right back in the pockets of multi-national conglomerates .
If only there were generic patent free GM crops ...
This is by far the best piece I have read this week in the whirlwind surrounding the Rome FAO conference .
James , Australia
I suggest returning to the old joint family system which is centered around farming , cattle rearing etc .
Today we live in a individualistic society where people are concerned with only their own well being .
It has given rise to selfishness and narrow mindedness and a tendency to live a self centred luxury life .
People have become more luxury loving these days .
We should return to the joint family system or a community life .
The best example of early community life can be found in the Bible in the acts of the apostles .
It is high time the world turn to the scriptures and start a new life led by the spirit .
Siby Jacob , Kerala what we need is a leader with a vision , and strong grassroots movement of concerned citizens to solve food crisis .
This can be done .
Change start with me and you .
We have to get into politics and we must push for change .
It is much better than standing and doing nothing .
Oleksiy Popovych , Edmonton , Canada
Just because we are capable of producing a gargantuan agricultural output today does n't mean we are able to sustain it for generations to come .
We have to act now if the human race is to survive .
indra , coventry , uk Great piece but I doubt the profit clamoring corporations or the protectionist politicians will pay any attention at all .
Robert NYC , NYC , US
In this area rising fuel costs are differentialy driving down home prices .
Home prices are falling far faster at the end of long commutes .
People cannot afford to drive to furthest suburbia .
Even in this comparatively rich area rising food costs are changing buying habits .
It may well be that farmland eating sprawl will die off even as food from other continents is priced out of existence .
The system may cleanse itself but at great personal cost to many .
Unfortunately here in Washington State agribusiness is provided with almost free water and deeply discounted electricity .
These subsidies that seem never to be mentioned are distorting food and energy policies throughout the Western States of the US .
Gerard Bentryn , Bainbridge Island , WA , USA
It 's true , the corporations are running the world under the guise of governments , and corporations are driven only by bottom - line profit .
They are not compassionate and they will not change tactics unless they are presented with changed incentives .
Since it is government that ( theoretically ) has power to change the incentives through enforced legislation , and since gov is own by corporate , there is little chance of that happening .
We 're on our own , folks .
I suggest reclaiming the lost art of community and learning how to keep old fashioned community gardens .
Morgaine Bergman , Willis , VA
Only subsidy for bio farming .
The same cost for registration for what ever size farm is inspected is far to high for small growers who are now developing their own label .
Drop all other subsidy .
Enforce by law and not monetary bribes the replanting of bio diverse hedges that were destroyed by the careless get rich quick yuppie farmers .
Themosthandsomemanever1 , UK I agree totally .
But the globals and the developed nations will never accept the core premises .
Dr Ian Sedwell , Weymouth , UK Totally .
It 's called sustainability and .. sharing too [ in case you 've forgotten how that happens . ]
Nice piece
has_te , Reed Point , MT , USA A Family Garden - is it too much to expect ?
We 'll have to change our notion of what a ' developed ' society is exactly in order for us to solve the coming food crisis .
The trend for ' developed ' societies has been for the vast majority of the population of a given territory to live in urban centers , in a high - rise flat with a balcony with enough space for a few flower - pots perhaps , or a dormitory with a window sill or two for yet smaller flower pots , or , perhaps , a townhouse with a little plot of earth , or a stand alone home with a little bigger plot of earth - all of which are inadequate enough space for a family garden of significant enough productivity to provide enough nutrition for the average family .
And thus , to compensate for this nutritional deficit in these urban areas , food must be imported in from rural areas .
These rural areas suffer not only environmental and ecological harm from intensive agriculture practiced there which often make the areas undesirable for residential living , but their communities ' economies also suffer the constant inflationary trend associated with intensive agriculture 's unsustainable distribution / transport system .
Chris Vietorisz , Beijing , China
We peruvians are quite concerned about the soaring prices of food as we are a still developing agricultural country .
We agree that food technology and agriculture should go hand by hand and that instead of radical deforestation to supply more farming lands a better government guidance in new agricultural policies should be applied .
Isabella Zolezzi , Lima , Lima , Perú
There are some good ideas here that need to happen .
Unfortunately it requires that politicians agree on what needs to be done and then to implement an effective plan .
The also need to understand it !
If one thing is clear from previous meetings such as the one in Rome , there is a lot of talk but no backbone to implement the changes that need to be done .
They will probably implement a committee to investigate the possibilies and get the report in 5 years , when it is too late and the changes suggested by the report are no longer adequate .
At the end of the day they will only make the necessary changes in the face of complete disaster , and I do n't think they could do it then !
Richard May , France
Yes I do agree .
One of the items that change the system as we know it now is to remove all food sources from committee market .
Food should not be used as poker chips to gamble with , this also applies to crude oil .
Large corporations are indifferent to the needs of the people there only motivating force is how much they can return on investment , there ability to buy large portions of land is harmful to the genial public and this needs to change
D.Ryan , Hyettsville Md. He says " The focus on agricultural commodities rather than on food production to meet the basic needs of people has undermined ... "
Look , it 's the same thing , stupid !
What does he think an agricultural commodity is , if not food production to meet the basic needs of people ( eating ) ?
Thomas Goodey , Cuxton - upon - Medway , Kent , ENGLAND
He 's right .
He 's been right for over the last century .
It 's time to pull everything away from market driven forces .
They only destroy .
Watercloset , Montpelier , Vermont USA
If only more people were talking about " changing the rules . "
What has worked for a century is no longer working , and we are seeing so much evidence , in small and large systems , of a looming collapse -- of our climate , of biodiversity , of natural systems , even of our health .
But people do n't want to read bad news .
At postapocology.com , we 're trying to change that equation , by japing at these trends , while drawing attention to them .
We 're scared silly .
I 'm sure this will be edited out , but you , o editor , might have some fun on the site .
Michael Jensen , Silver Spring , MD , US I agree wholeheartedly .
But who is the ' We ' that will change any of this .
Fukuyama 's essay ' End of History ' should have a sequel ' End of National Democracy ' .
Neither my govt ( UK ) nor any other has the power to impose any of the changes suggested so I have no influence as an individual to force change .
And the real power is now in the hands of the very organisations we should be reigning in .
It 's a dangerous situation .
Maybe that sequel will be called ' End of Civilisation ' .
R Gross , London I completely agree with Gonzalo Oviedo .
Supply of food has been taken over by commercial interests to make money .
This may have increased food availability ( and profits ) in the short term but is not sustainable .
This commercial supply of food is also increasingly leading to health problems amongst the populations subject to commercial supply of food .
Traditional practices are sustainable , mass commercial food production is NOT !
Either for the planet or for human health !
Alan M Crabb , Bristol Biodiversity was found to be increased by organic farming in the UN's Millenium Report on human health and biodiversity .
It 's always been the one reason I buy organic .
For me the real solution to most of the world 's problems is managing our global population at a level lower than it is now by say 2 billion people with greater areas devoted to wilderness to promote diversity .
alex , Huntingdon / UK
The global over - population crisis is the root cause of so many of our problems .
Every year there are millions more mouths to feed .
The planet can only support a finite number of us so is n't about time we addressed the " too many people " problem before we start having wars over what little food and water is left ?

What are these ?
NOVEMBER 21--Meet Deanna Bobo .
The 37 - year - old Arkansas woman is the 3,496th teacher to be arrested this year on charges that she had sex with an underage student ( in this case , a 14 - year - old boy ) .
Bobo , a special ed teacher at Raymond E. Wells Junior High School , is facing a felony sexual assault count for her alleged encounters earlier this year with the student .
Bobo , who was arrested last week and released on a $ 10,000 bond , is pictured below in a Sebastian County Adult Detention Center mug shot .
According to an arrest affidavit , cops found sexually explicit e-mails between Bobo and the boy when they executed a search warrant at her home , which she shares with husband Rusty Bobo , an oilfield mechanic , and the couple 's five children .
As a condition of Bobo 's release , a Circuit Court judge ordered that she avoided any contact with the boy and his family .
While Bobo has been put on a paid suspension , her bio remains online at the Wells Junior High School web site .
It notes that she has a bachelor 's degree in early childhood education and has been certified as an 'early childhood instructional specialist . '
Indeed . ( 3 pages )
Vivian Bowers works in a neighborhood that has gone undercover .
“ Are there still businesses over there ? ” people ask when she mentions her dry- cleaning shop on South Central Avenue near East Adams Boulevard .
Five years ago , the city expunged the name “ South Central ” from its maps and replaced it with the more general “ South Los Angeles . ”
The change was meant to erase the stigma of riots and blight that marred an area south of the 10 Freeway and along Central Avenue , a place renowned in the 1940s for its thriving black culture -- restaurants , jazz clubs and businesses .
But an unintended consequence was to make core neighborhoods around Central Avenue disappear from Angelenos ’ mental map -- arguably none so much as Newton , a patch of nowhere east of the Harbor Freeway .
Advertisement
Now Bowers and others trying to revive this place are finding their first challenge is to explain where it is .
“ I try to make it 50 words or less , ” said Capt .
Dennis Cremins of LAPD ’s Newton station .
“ Namelessness matters , ” said Josh Sides , professor of California history at Cal State Northridge .
“ A nameless place does n’t exist .
. . .
Speculators , developers , want to invest in a place that exists . ”
Government workers say it is more difficult to organize people who are n’t unified by a geographic name .
Advocates say lack of identity makes it more difficult to attract resources and develop services .
A developer said it ’s one reason this area is a kind of last frontier for new construction .
“ Don ’ nobody wanna come this side of town no more , ” said Lloyd Robertson , 71 , who has lived at East 27th Street and Naomi Avenue since 1937 .
“ It ’s just like nothin ’ over here . ”

The words “ South Los Angeles ” are used to refer to anything from the Crenshaw district to Carson and sometimes beyond .
South L.A. sprawls over at least 50 square miles and contains three - quarters of a million people .
Many areas have become lost in this vastness , especially the part bordered by the 10 Freeway , the Harbor Freeway , Alameda Street and East Florence Avenue .
Patrolled by the Newton Station , the area has the highest poverty rate of all Los Angeles Police Department divisions and is typically among LAPD ’s top four divisions in homicides .
The population is about 14 % black and 83 % Latino , largely Spanish - speaking and ethnically Mexican .
The area is home to century - old homes in the Queen Anne style , many of them hidden beneath a slather of stucco .
Advertisement
It feels isolated from the city ’s commercial mainstream .
But it is not empty or blighted , just working - class and jumbled .
Bus stops are crowded at rush hour .
There are panaderias and 99 - cent stores .
People sell CDs , T - shirts and caged pigeons on street corners .
Sidewalk taco stands have folding tables and bright umbrellas .
“ You have streets and alleys here that have n’t been paved since World War II , houses next to plating plants , ” Cremins said .
This same area was once called “ The Avenue . ”
It was L.A. 's Harlem , “ the black main street of Los Angeles , ” said R.J. Smith , author of a history of the area in the 1940s .
“ It was a place where you could see Louis Armstrong . . . Joe Louis . . . Count Basie . ”
“ South Central ” meant something bigger than a place , Sides said .
“ It was synonymous with sense of black progress and accomplishment -- a physical manifestation of blacks ’ progress in the American West . ”
Advertisement
As segregation eased in the 1950s and ‘ 60s , blacks moved out and the population became more transitory .
Malaise set in .
Riots and economic forces battered the area , and youth gangs proliferated .
The name “ South Central ” began being used outside of the black community in Los Angeles -- with a different connotation .
“ It became a loose way of describing everywhere that there were black people , ” Sides said .
As the name fell out of favor among residents , the proud and storied neighborhood became a prepositional phrase .
“ Over there , ” is how it is commonly referred to now , Bowers said .
Few remnants of the area ’s older days remain .
There is the Dunbar Hotel , the childhood home of Nobel Laureate Ralph Bunche and the Lincoln Theater -- which now houses a Spanish - speaking congregation .
“ Iglesia de Jesucristo , Sur Central , ” reads the Lincoln ’s marquee .
Bowers and others are trying to spark a renaissance .
Her 9 - month - old booster group is called the Central Avenue Business Assn .
Three new mixed - use affordable housing projects are in the works , along with a new city services building and a Central Avenue beautification project .

City Councilwoman Jan Perry , who represents the area , has tried to foster a sense of identity in recent years by giving names to three small chunks of Newton .
Signs reading “ Menlo Park ” cover a three - by - seven - block area between Washington and Adams boulevards .
The other two chunks are labeled the Gider and Dow ’s Adams Street Tract and the Nadeau Orange Tract .
Perry , who supported the removal of “ South Central , ” says smaller neighborhood identities are needed .
A name “ has do with access , with whether a community is empowered , ” she said .
It remains to be seen whether the tract names will catch on .
Meanwhile , the area as a whole remains largely anonymous .
Newton “ is very amorphous , ” said Cremins , the police captain .
“ It does not have a distinct geographic feature .
Not even a Watts Towers . ”
People grasp for ways to describe it .
They say “ South Central , ” the “ Eastside ” or sometimes “ La Newton , ” after the police station ( though the station has moved from its former location on Newton Street ) .
Advertisement
“ South Central -- but not the bad South Central , ” said Velissa Williams , 37 , who lives near Central and 25th .
“ The place formerly known as South Central , ” said Kevin Sved , co-director of The Accelerated School , a charter at Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Main Street .
“ Kids here would just say , ‘ the hood . ’ ” said Juan Flecha , principal of Jefferson High School .
Even residents who use “ South Central ” are not sure what it means .
Asked to describe its boundaries , Jesus Flores , who lives on 43rd Street just east of the Harbor Freeway , waved a hand southward .
“ From here , ” he said , “ to San Pedro . ”
Advertisement
“ Eastside ” is similarly problematic .
That name is still used by people all over South L.A. , especially blacks .
It means east of Main Street .
But its use has drifted well south of Florence Avenue .
And to much of the rest of the city , “ Eastside ” suggests East L.A. or Boyle Heights .
So often , people punt ; they use streets and distant landmarks to explain where they are .
They say , “ south of Staples Center , ” or , “ east of the Coliseum . ”
They triangulate and wave their arms .
“ We refer to it as ‘ south of the Santa Monica Freeway , ” said Oscar Ixco , assistant project manager for the Community Redevelopment Agency .
“ And then people think it ’s by USC , and we say , ‘ No , it ’s east of the 110 Freeway . ’ ”
The fate of nameless Newton contrasts sharply with that of another famous seat of black urban culture -- Harlem in New York City .
Through more than 300 years of shifting fortunes , Harlem has kept its identity intact .
Harlem “ has brand equity that is recognized worldwide , ” said Leon Wynter , spokesman for the Harlem Community Development Corp .
Harlem ’s name also has carried “ negative associations ” over the years , Wynter said .
But it still gives the area “ a central and cohesive identity . ”
Advertisement
Harlem ’s boundaries are generally agreed upon -- its name is sanctioned in both official documents and common usage -- and it is contained within a single congressional district .
By contrast , the Newton area “ is very fragmented , ” Cremins said .
It is split between two congressional districts , one of which includes distant Mt. Washington .
The Los Angeles Times calls it “ South Los Angeles . ”
The police department places it within its Central Bureau , not its South Bureau .
The Los Angeles Unified School District puts much of it in its East Los Angeles district , along with Boyle Heights .
The city Planning Department calls Newton “ southeast Los Angeles , ” along with Watts .
People who identify with only a single street or intersection are limited politically , officials say .
Simple questions , such as how to label a flier for a community meeting , become puzzles , said Faisal Roble , a city planner for the South L.A. area .

John Huskey , president of Meta Housing Co. , said namelessness may have subtly stalled development .
His company is about to break ground on a mixed - use affordable housing project with a Fresh & Easy grocery store at Adams and Central .
Huskey said a name makes a place “ easier to talk about , ” which is a key factor because real - estate development often starts with buzz among investors .
Many residents said they feel their area has been forgotten .
But even if they could not say for sure what that area was , they expressed strong feelings about its future .
“ It ’s not that they do n’t want a name , ” said Bowers , the Central Avenue shopkeeper .
“ If you gave them a name , they would wear it with pride . ”

Retirement
I retired early because I realized that I would need at least 20 years of full - time work to complete The Art of Computer Programming ( TAOCP ) , which I have always viewed as the most important project of my life .
Being a retired professor is a lot like being an ordinary professor , except that you do n't have to write research proposals , administer grants , or sit in committee meetings .
Also , you do n't get paid .
My full - time writing schedule means that I have to be pretty much a hermit .
The only way to gain enough efficiency to complete The Art of Computer Programming is to operate in batch mode , concentrating intensively and uninterruptedly on one subject at a time , rather than swapping a number of topics in and out of my head .
I 'm unable to schedule appointments with visitors , travel to conferences or accept speaking engagements , or undertake any new responsibilities of any kind .
I 'm glad that the WWW makes it possible for me to respond to questions that I do n't have to see or hear .
I miss teaching and daily interaction with students , but I get stimulating feedback by giving regular public lectures and speaking to informal Stanford seminars .
I 'm proud of the 28 students for whom I was a dissertation advisor ( see vita ) ; and I know that 28 is a perfect number .
So I wo n't be advising any more students .
But I do say that if somebody solves one of the open problems stated in one of my Computer Musings , within about two or three weeks of the time I stated it , I 'll sign their thesis .
( After two or three weeks , I 'll be working on something else and wo n't have time to read their work . )
I tend to spend about two hours per day in the library , about a half hour in AEORC Rec Pool , and the rest of the time at home reading and writing , sometimes also sleeping and eating .
I like to play piano and organ in the music room of my house , although lately I have n't had nearly as much time for music as I would like .
If you 're good at sightreading four - hands piano music , I have hundreds of pieces I 'd like to try playing with you ; please drop me a note and we can hopefully get together for a jam session .
By the way , I 'm also a big fan of the Stanford Theatre .
Of course I like to read nontechnical books , although I read very slowly .
Here are some that I heartily recommend :
Census of Marine Life - affiliated scientists consolidating world databases of ocean organisms have demoted to alias status almost one - third of all names culled from 34 regional and highly specialized inventories .
The new World Register of Marine Species contains about 122,500 validated marine species names ( experts having recognized and tidied up some 56,400 aliases -- 32 % of all names reviewed ) .
It also contains some 5,600 images , hyperlinks to taxonomic literature and other information .
Marking the World Register 's official inauguration , some 55 researchers from 17 countries met in Belgium to plan its completion by 2010 .
Leading WoRMS experts independently estimate that about 230,000 marine species are known to science .
They also believe there are three times as many unknown ( unnamed ) marine species as known , for a grand total on Earth that could surpass 1 million .
" Convincing warnings about declining fish and other marine species must rest on a valid census , " says Dr. Mark Costello of the University of Auckland , co-founder of WoRMS and a senior Census of Marine Life official .
" This project will improve information vital to researchers investigating fisheries , invasive species , threatened species and marine ecosystem functioning , as well as to educators .
It will eliminate the misinterpretation of names , confusion over Latin spellings , redundancies and a host of other problems that sow confusion and slow scientific progress . "
Some species , such as those reclassified in years past based on new information , were shown to have a handful of names or more .
In such cases , the oldest name trumps later ones to become the valid name ( though all aliases are noted to help researchers interpret centuries of scientific literature ) .

Popularly called Breadcrumb Sponge , Halichondria panicea is the marine world 's reigning champion of Latin aliases , with 56 synonyms appearing in taxonomic literature since its first description in 1766 .
Of no fixed address , it 's known to frequent floats , pilings , and the underside of rocks , smells like exploded gunpowder and takes on many appearances ( as shown in photos ) .
It is also known as ( AKA ) : Alcyonium manusdiaboli ( 1794 ) , Spongia compacta ( 1806 ) , Halichondria albescens ( 1818 ) , Seriatula seriata ( 1826 ) , Hymeniacidon brettii ( 1866 ) , Pellina bibula ( 1870 ) , Amorphina appendiculata ( 1875 ) , Isodictya crassa ( 1882 ) , Microciona tumulosa ( 1882 ) , Menanetia minchini ( 1896 ) , Trachyopsilla glaberrima ( 1931 ) and 44 other names .
No researcher 's work is spared -- not even Carl Linnaeus , who in the 1750s overcame an international scientific Tower of Babel when it came to naming species .
He instituted the two - word Latin name , starting with the ( capitalized ) genus , followed by a ( lowercase ) specific epithet , a system used ever since .
Thanks to his method of binominal nomenclature , what is dubbed a bulot in French fish markets , whelk in New England , buccin in Canada , and the Wellhornschnecke of the North Sea , is known universally to scientists as Buccinum undatum .
However , over time it emerged that Linnaeus assigned four names to the same species of sperm whale , a mistake caught years ago but which still appears in world literature and databases .
The World Register will clarify for all time the valid name for that whale and all other marine species for future researchers , census takers and educators alike .
Says Philippe Bouchet , a Census scientist involved in WoRMS : " Describing species without a universal register in place is like setting up a library without an index catalog . "
Discovery outstrips description capacity
Census of Marine Life and other explorers are finding unknown species at a rate much faster than the capacity to describe them due to a shortage of experts .
Dr. Bouchet calculates that 3,800 taxonomists enter at least 1,400 new marine species into the literature every year .
At this rate , the process of discovering , verifying , describing and naming all remaining unknown marine species would take over five centuries .

The global scale cooperation underway by the Census and the World Register is a prerequisite for the more time and cost - efficient discovery and recording of ocean - dwelling species .
So too are new technologies for sampling , image capture , data management , genetic analyses ( e.g. DNA barcodes ) , new training programs for taxonomists , and online initiatives such as ZooBank , which can assign " official " permanent registration identifications to new animal species .
Hosted by the Flanders Marine Institute , Belgium , the World Register has received early funding from several sources , including the EU's MarBEF ( Marine Biodiversity and Ecosystem Functioning ) research network and PESI ( Pan- European Species - Directories Infrastructures ) project , the European Register of Marine Species , Species2000 Europa , CoML's International Census of Marine Microbes project , the Richard Lounsbery Foundation , and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility .
And it will serve as the taxonomic backbone of another funder -- the Ocean Biogeographic Information System ( OBIS ) , the Census of Marine Life 's portal to vast information on species , including their global distribution and other data , adds Dr. Costello , founding chair of OBIS .
The World Register will also contribute to several related global biodiversity enterprises , including the Encyclopedia of Life ( creating a webpage for every species ) , and Species2000 ( assembling a list of valid names for the 1.8 million or so known animals , plants , and fungi , both marine and terrestrial ) .
" Modern technologies allow unprecedented global collaboration to consolidate , validate and advance more than 250 years of research into the diverse species that live beneath the waves , " says Dr. Edward Vanden Berghe , who heads OBIS at Rutgers University , New Jersey , and who initiated the World Register while working at the Flanders Marine Institute .
" The World Register of Marine Species and the Ocean Biogeographic Information System will be major Census legacies . "
How many species in the sea ?
The Belgium meeting affirmed that the World Register should surpass 200,000 valid names by the end of 2008 and will offer the first complete listing of the estimated 230,000 + marine species known to science when the First Census of Marine Life ( CoML ) is released in October 2010 .
" Decisions about the last few thousand species to be included could be difficult , as some descriptions are inadequate or the specimens missing , " noted CoML Chief Scientist Ron O'Dor .
" Experts may disagree on the scientific validity of an entry when evidence is contentious or scant . "
The database has yet to reflect massive discovery efforts underway by CoML collaborators .
Preliminary CoML estimates show many thousands of suspected new marine life species have been discovered in the first eight years of explorations , 110 of which have completed the formal description process .
The taxonomic analysis and description process means that " newly discovered " species often take years to appear in publications .
The process involves exhaustive comparison , documentation , peer - review , publication , and depositing specimens in museum collections for others to access .
The Census is the largest - ever global marine biology research project , uniting researchers from more than 80 nations with the goal of assessing and explaining the diversity , distribution and abundance of ocean life -- past , present and future .
Started in 2000 , some 17 projects ( including 14 conducting field research ) examining all aspects of sea life the world over are beginning to shift from data collection to analysis as the first Census moves towards a conclusion and synthesis report in 2010 -- an unprecedented baseline of information about ocean biodiversity in a changing environment .
In isolated parts of the world , such as the deep - sea , the tropics , and the Southern Ocean swirling around Antarctica , discovery of previously undescribed species can exceed 80 % of specimens captured , especially for smaller animals like crustaceans , worms and molluscs .
Census plankton project leader Ann Bucklin predicts her collaborators will at least double the number of known zooplankton species in the world , which in 2008 consisted of 7,000 species in 15 different phyla .
" Discovering a species never known to science before is one of the great prizes of marine research , " says Ian Poiner , Australia - based chair of CoML's Scientific Steering Committee .
" The accomplishment earns the researcher the hard - earned right to bestow the species with a name .
" For years to come , as new species discoveries are validated and enter the literature , some individual researchers could earn that right hundreds of times over -- and we look forward to seeing thousands of new species identified through the Census eventually fed to the World Register . "
" What may appear a simple task on the surface is in fact two - fold : the names of every known species have first to be validated , and the register must also simultaneously try to keep pace with new discoveries , " says WoRMS data manager Ward Appeltans of the Flanders Marine Institute ( VLIZ ) , noting that one expert representing each taxonomic group is assigned to control the quality of the databank 's content .
" The fact that every year scientists still find more than 100 new marine fish species in the sea is astonishing , " he adds .
" While we are looking up to search for life on Mars , there is still so much beauty to discover at our feet . "

For nearly 30 years , Wal - Mart Stores Inc. employed a video - production company here to capture footage of its top executives , sometimes in unguarded moments .
Two years ago , the retailing giant stopped using the tiny company .
At first , the decision threw Flagler Productions Inc. into a panic .
Now it 's Wal - Mart that 's squirming .

There is an expectation these days that any famous video clip is but a YouTube search away .
Not so .
Today is the 25th anniversary of the George Brett pine - tar incident .
The tubes are clogged with stories and photographs recounting the event , which as any baseball fan knows captures a display of human anger that may never have been topped and may never be exceeded .
I never tire of watching it ... and wanted to do so again this morning .
Could n't find it on YouTube .
Odd .
A Google search turned up a number of links that promised to have it but visits to maybe a half - dozen sites came up empty .
Very Odd .
Even my first search of Major League Baseball 's official site , MLB.com , was fruitless .
At last , I did find it there ... and by that point I half - expected to see the clip surrounded by armed guards .
There can be no doubt but that an army of copyright lawyers is protecting that baby .
If by some chance you are the last person on the planet who has not seen this video , take a moment and join the club .
And , if you 're in the mood for 25th anniversary coverage of a more technical variety , check out " This Year 's 25 Geekiest 25th Anniversaries . "
Much easier to find .
Much less violent .
( Update : ESPN 's Tim Kurkjian has an interesting interview with Brett about The Nutty here .
Even mighty ESPN had to settle for a photograph , though . )
1 . Give a game a review score without ever actually playing the game
A cursory glance from 20 paces of a grainy postage stamp - sized super lo-res scanned - in screenshot pinned to the ass - feathers of a headless chicken in a sandstorm should be all you need to confidently attribute an authoritative and infallible review score to any game .

You 've got amoebic dysentery and you can feel a hairy - ass spider crawling across your face .
So what ?
When you 're up against a newbie there is no excuse for anything less than comprehensive ownership .
Important note : Reuters has corrected the story .
It now reads :
Home prices may fall 25 percent to 30 percent from their peak in 2006 and not hit bottom until 2010 ...
[ Peter Acciavatti , credit analyst and managing director at JP Morgan Securities Inc , said ]
Home prices may fall another 25 percent to 30 percent over the next four years , with greater drops still in subprime mortgage debt markets , he said .
In a separate interview , the analyst said junk bond spreads will push past 800 basis points and may top 900 basis points as the crisis drags out .
This is much more in line with my thinking .
Note that nominal prices are off 16.1 % according to Case - Shiller , so we are about half way to JPM 's forecast .
Here was the orginal post : From Reuters : US home prices may dip 30 pct , junk bonds weaken - JPM I think we will see price declines for several more years , but this seems a little too bearish to me .
An additional 25 % to 30 % decline in nominal prices over four years would be close to an additional 40 % decline in real prices - and that would put real prices at the lowest level since the Case - Shiller Index started in 1987 .
Note that real prices are already off 21 % according to the Case - Shiller national index .
Wow .
And I thought I was bearish on housing !
Note :
My comments were based on the original article forecasting an additional 30 % decline in prices .
Seated in an armchair , with his white long beard and eyeglasses framing his pale face , Khamenei said the U.S. was baffled by Iran :
The U.S. and its allies are ready to transfer nuclear technology to countries with much less technological competence , but refuse to accept our rights in that regard and all the time they accuse us of pursuing a nuclear bomb .
We have said over and over again that we do not want the bomb .
But because we have managed to have native nuclear technology and we are not depending on them for that , they are accusing us of trying to have nuclear weapon .
For them if you are technologically dependent on them in the nuclear field , they do not mind you having nuclear power .
But they know that the Iranian nation has achieved nuclear technology for peaceful purposes without relying on them .
That is why they are against us .
" Our nation will not back down one moment against bullying of the U.S , " he said in a momentous and politically charged speech :
Supreme leader Ali Khamenei spoke today to thousands of followers as well as politicians , ambassadors and other dignitaries gathered at the south Tehran tomb of revolutionary founder Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on the 19th anniversary of his death .
Iran 's top political , religious and military authority said his country would refuse to back down on its nuclear ambitions , regardless of what the U.S. tried to do .
The American president and his staff in the administration are calling sometimes for psychological warfare , sometimes terrorism and sometimes begging for help from the Iranian nation .
They are confused because of the U.S. failure in Afghanistan and Iraq .
He also thunderously called for a return to the basic values of the Islamic revolution that transformed his country and the world 30 years ago .
That includes spreading the revolution 's values :
Today the anti-imperialist slogans of the Iranian nation are music to the minds and hearts of Islamic nations across the world .
Defending the oppressed nation of Palestine and opposing with the octopus network of Zionism are part and parcel of the revolution .
Though he did n't make the incendiary calls for the destruction of Israel , he said the Jewish state was weak and unable to survive without outside help :
There are two reasons for its standing on its feet .
One is the contemptuous support without any preconditions of the U.S. and the other reason is that Arab and Islamic countries do not support the Palestinian people .
Israel is a forgery and an imposed country in the region , and if the Arab and Islamic countries support the Palestinian nation , the circumstances in the Middle East will change entirely .
Much of Khamenei 's speech focused on Iran 's domestic situation .
He said the turbulent and ideologically first years of the Islamic Republic served as a guide for today 's leadership .
" The political will of the late Imam Khomeini should be the manual for running day - to - day routine of the country now and in the years to come , generation after generation , " he said .
In his speech , he allowed for no possibility of changing the system to keep up with changing times :
The Islamic revolution is like Islam , as the religion is comprehensive .
It is political , social , cultural , religious at the same time and that is the secret of its survival .
No one has the right to ignore or separate one part of the Islamic revolution 's values , simply because circumstances in the world have changed .
Nobody has the right to forget the anti-despotic and anti-alien forces character of the revolution or to ignore religious values of the revolution .
This revolution is alive with all its revolutionary slogans .
This revolution belongs to all walks of society and it is not exclusive to one specific walk or class .
The worshipers and pilgrims at Khomeini 's shrine responded with uproarious praise .
" Oh , free - minded leader , " they chanted , " we are fully ready . "
Khamenei likened Iranians who failed to support the revolution 's values to those who break the Ramadan fast before dusk but also appealed to Iran 's nationalism .
Islam , he said , strengthened the Iranian nation .
Our Islamic revolution is a contribution to the progress of the nation .
Enemies of the nation for years argued that progress is mutually exclusive with religion .
On the contrary ... the spirit of revolution has empowered the nation in all fields .
Islamic revolution has been a short cut between backwardness and West - toxification .
" Death to America ! " the faithful chanted .
" Death to America ! "
" Today , " he continued , " a cold war against the Islamic revolution is taking place and it's waged by the arrogant powers in all aspects of life .
In the cultural field the enemies want to undermine the determination of our nation , especially the youth , by spreading narcotic addiction and promoting debauchery among young generation .
Every single member of society should fight against narcotic addiction and debauchery so that young people channel their energies into innovation and scientific progress . "
— Ramin Mostaghim in Tehran

With the popularity of games like Lego Star Wars and the recent release of Lego Indiana Jones , it ’s a new era in the toy that was everyones favorite toy during my childhood .
Legos !
So now I ’m all grown up – and my modern creative toy , Adobe Suite CS3 is going to become my very own Lego playground !
What would YOU look like if you were a Lego character ?
Well check out what I ’ve done and make your own virtual Lego people !
This is the first tutorial I ’ve ever written and it was n’t even part of my original plan .
I just had so much fun with this little evening project that I wanted to share it .
Enjoy !
Meet the “ Lego Man ” – small , boxy , yellow , shiny , and darn cute !
Ok , now that you ’ve been introduced – open up Illustrator and lets get drawing !
( Disclaimer :
For this tutorial you should have a basic working knowledge of Illustrator – and the screen shots featured in this post are from version CS3 – however you can create the exact same results in older versions without too much more fuss .
Step 1 : The Basic Shapes
It ’s always best to start illustrations simple .
Lay a good foundation , get started , get something to look at and you ’re going to start the process along on a good note .
I ’ve found that jumping head first into details at the start usually makes the job much more complicated than it should be , and you end up discouraged by the slow results .
Use the Arch Tool in your Lines Menu to create Lego Man happy face smile in a snap .
Step 2 : Shape it Up
Now that you have the basic shapes , time to shape them up a little – modify your basic blocks into more dynamic shapes using my favorite tool in the Illustrator box – Pathfinder !
Use the basic block shape we ’ve got for the head and found out that chin without battling with Anchor point !
Overlap your 2 simple shaped and the Click the Combine button on your Pathfinder Panel .
To lock in the new shape hit Expand , and Voila !
– Lego man has an all new chin !
Step 3 : Add some Color
Now to give Legoman that beautiful yellow shinny skin !
Adobe must have had little lego man in mind – cause their extensive library of Gradient swatches are going to help you paint your man with just a few clicks of the mouse .
Use the Bright Gradients color “ Yellow ” straight from the default setting – or do your own tweaks to get it just right .
( it doesnt take much of a tweak . )
You can play with your Stylize Filters to add a Drop Shadow or Inner Glow to the different Lego components — there is really no science to it , i just eyeballed it along the way .
Have fun , experiment !
One you get the look you like down on the head – Fill each the components of your Lego man .
Think about where you ’re light source is located and how the many pieces of your man relate to one another .
Here ’s my lego man in his yellow naked glory !
Step 4 : Create your Character !
Now here ’s where the fun starts – you can make yourself as a Lego Man , your Mom as a Lego Lady !
Now – since I ’ve already got
a Lego Man , I am not going to try and make myself – But who ?
Well after watching this weeks episode of one of my favorite Revision 3 podcast – I got my inspiration !
Totally Rad Show – my weekly dose of all things RAD !
Every Tuesday night I snuggle up with my cat and we enjoy the reviews of movies , TV , games and comics with the TRS boys – Alex Albrecht , Dan Trachtenberg , and Jeff Cannata .
This week the guys reviewed Lego Indiana Jones and kicked off the show in front of a Custom background of the shows logo rendered in Legos !
A Lego Logo –
How rad is that !?
How rad would it be if the guys where part of this Lego World ?
Well …
I got a kick out of the idea , so here you go …
Step 5 : Start with the Hair
Start out with the hair – because all Lego Men have that same black smiley face you really have to play up other defining features .
Lucky for me , Alex ’s hair is so recognizable it has n’t taken much to get this Lego Man looking like him !
Step 6 : Time to Play Lego Stylist
OK – so I loved Legos as a kid – but as all little girls do – I also LOVED Barbie .
She had way cooler clothes than I did – and s many of them !
I loved dressing her up , creating different looks , playing fashion designer and making my own clothes for her !
So while these virtual Lego Men ca n’t run across my coffee table or drive under the kitchen table in their Lego car , they have something real Lego Men do n’t – A completely customizable wardrobe !!!
Let ’s play dress up !
Here it is – pretty darn Rad , would n’t you say ?
This project was a lot of fun !
A great exercise in using Adobe Illustrator and in using your imagination !

Huh ?
They 're going to " make sure it [ a polygraph result ] is Amissible in Court " ?
Uh ... being that amissible means " liable to be lost " that does n't make any sense .
Why would they want to lose polygraph results in court ?
That would be -- oh , wait .
No , they must mean admissible : capable or worthy of being admitted .
Yeah , that would make sense .
Add another [ sic ] there George !
Though , to be fair to the APA , the mistake may have been made by Gordon Vaughan - - but they still should have caught it .
Good grief , two clear error in three sentences .
Way to do go APA !
Now you 're not just crapping up our society , you 're crapping up our language too !
Anyway , no surprise that they 're getting Bailey to come : he 's their sort of scum .
WHAT�S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LEHMAN BROTHERS AND BEAR STEARNS ?
LEHMAN�S CEO SITS ON THE BOARD OF THE NY FED
Post and Read Comments Here
An earlier article by this author ( � The Secret Bailout of JP Morgan� ) summarized evidence presented by John Olagues , an expert in options trading , suggesting that JPMorgan , far from �rescuing �
Bear Stearns , was actually its nemesis .
1
The faltering investment bank was brought down , not by �rumors , � but by insider trading based on a plan drawn up much earlier .
The deal was a lucrative one for JPM , handing the Wall Street megabank $ 55 billion in loans from the Federal Reserve ( meaning ultimately the U.S. taxpayer ) .
So how did JPM get away with it ?
Olagues notes the highly suspicious fact that JPM�s CEO James Dimon sits on the Board of the New York Federal Reserve .
In his latest post , Olagues discusses the fate of Lehman Brothers , the nation�s fourth - largest investment bank and the next faltering bank expected to fail .
2 Unlike Bear Stearns , which got decimated by the JPM buyout using Federal Reserve money , Lehman Brothers is probably in line for a massive bailout from the Fed .
At least , that�s what its CEO Richard Fuld seems to believe .
The June 4 , 2008 Financial Times of London quoted him as stating , � The Federal Reserve�s decision earlier this year to lend directly to investment banks should take questions about Lehman�s liquidity off the table .�
Whether Lehman can come up with the �liquidity � to meet its debts is no longer an issue , because it expects to be feeding at the trough of the Federal Reserve , just as JPM did when it bought Bear Stearns at bargain - basement prices .
The difference between the two �bailouts � is that Lehman Brothers , unlike Bear Stearns , will actually get the money .
Why is Fuld so confident of this rescue operation ?
Olagues notes that Fuld , like Dimon ( and unlike Bear CEO Alan Schwartz ) , sits on the Board of the New York Federal Reserve .
A conflict of interest ?
It certainly looks like it .
Indeed , Olagues points to a statute defining this sort of self - dealing as a criminal offense .
18 U.S.C. Chapter 11 , Section 208 , makes it a felony punishable by up to 5 five years in prison for members of the Board of Directors of a Federal Reserve Bank to make decisions that benefit their own financial interests .
That would undoubtedly apply here :
� Fuld , at last count , owns 1.9 million shares of Lehman , 600,000 restricted stock units and 900,000 executive stock options . . . .
Although Mr. Fuld sold over $ 320,000,000 worth of stock at near all time highs in 2006 and 2007 , received through the premature exercise of his stock options , he still has value in his present holdings of approximately $ 100,000,000 . �
Likewise , says Olagues , � James Dimon holds almost 3 million shares of J.P. Morgan stock worth over $ 120 million with taxes already paid and executive stock options equal in my estimate of another $ 70 million .
His dispositions of stock equaled $ 140 million over the past few years . �
Olagues adds :
� Fuld , like Jamie Dimon , was at the luncheon on March 11 , 2008 with Bernanke , Rubin , CEO of Citigroup , Geithner , President of the New York FED , Thain of Merrill Lynch , and Schwarzman .
Some claim that the meeting was about Bear Stearns and how to handle the situation . �
Needless to say , Bear CEO Schwartz was not invited to the luncheon .
� Lehman Bros. is one of the original stock holders of the New York Federal Reserve Bank , � Olagues observes .
� Bear Stears does not now have any ownership in the FED banks . �
The luncheon was held three days before the March 14 collapse of Bear Stearns stock that led to the bank�s demise .
If the luncheon attendees were indeed discussing the Bear problem on March 11 , testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in which the principals said they first heard of the problem on the evening of the thirteenth , says Olagues , was �less than truthful . �
The evidence at least warrants an investigation , but who is going to hold these self - dealing Federal Reserve Board members to account ?
In a March 27 radio broadcast noted in The New York Post of the same day , Senator Christopher Dodd pointed out the conflict of interest and said it needed to be examined ; but no mention was made of it at the April 4 Senate hearings .
Why not ?
Olagues suggests he had gotten his marching orders by then from a major campaign contributor .
New York Governor Eliot Spitzer , the former thorn in the side of the Wall Street bankers , has been summarily disposed of ; and under the latest proposal of U.S. Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson , the Federal Reserve itself will soon become the chief overseer and regulator of the banks .
The Federal Reserve will regulate the Federal Reserve Boards with their litany of private bank CEOs , a clear case of the fox guarding the henhouse .
So who is left to bring the banks to task ?
That question will be addressed in my next article .
Stay tuned . . . .

An Israeli policeman today shot himself in the head at a farewell ceremony for the French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , sparking brief panic at Tel Aviv 's Ben-Gurion airport .
A police spokesman , Shlomi Sagi , said the officer , part of a contingent detailed to guard the airport , had apparently fired his weapon just as Sarkozy was about to board his plane home .
Another police spokesman stressed there was no evidence of an assassination attempt .
" We are currently investigating the circumstances to see whether it was suicide or if he accidentally discharged his weapon , " Micky Rosenfeld said .
" His mission was to secure an area to prevent people from reaching the ceremony . "
Television pictures showed seeming confusion as the French president 's wife , Carla Bruni-Sarkozy , rushed up the aircraft steps ahead of her husband , with security guards lagging behind the couple .
At the same time the Israeli prime minister , Ehud Olmert , and the president , Shimon Peres , who were seeing Sarkozy off following his three - day trip to Israel and the West Bank , were surrounded by armed security guards and ushered into cars .
The gunshot happened when a military band was playing and it appeared none of the leaders heard anything at the time .
Once the situation became clearer , Olmert boarded the plane to tell Sarkozy what had happened .
During his visit the French president held talks with Olmert and the Palestinian president , Mahmoud Abbas .
In an address to Israel 's parliament , the knesset , yesterday Sarkozy told Israel " there cannot be peace " without the country sharing sovereignty over Jerusalem with the Palestinians and stopping building settlements in the occupied territories .
Sarkozy pledged full support for Israel but urged it to ease travel restrictions to the West Bank , saying : " I told our Israeli friends the injustice done to the Jewish people can't be resolved by creating conditions of injustice for the Palestinian people . "
The price of crude oil has retreated slightly after hitting record highs above $ 142 a barrel , amid concerns that supply will not meet demand .
In London , Brent crude was trading at $ 140.16 , having earlier hit $ 142.13 .
New York light crude had climbed as high as $ 142.26 a barrel , but later fell back to $ 140.34 .
Producers ' group Opec has been under pressure to boost production , though recent reports have shown its members are split over whether to lift output .
Libya has threatened to cut production because the market is well supplied .
Libyan threats Libya 's most senior oil official , Shokri Ghanem , said on Thursday he was looking into the possibility of cutting production in response to US threats against oil producers .
Analysts blame the price of crude on a variety of factors from basic supply and demand to hedge funds .
Opec has said speculators have played a part in the oil spike this year , but others are not convinced .
" We believe the factors driving oil prices higher are fundamental and not speculative , " Deutsche Bank said in a research note .
" Oil needs to rise to $ 150 a barrel for oil as a share of global Goss Domestic Produce to reach the levels that occurred in the early 1980s , " according to the bank .
But tensions between oil consumers and producers are rising .
The US House of Representatives has passed a bill that would allow the Justice Department to sue Opec members for limiting supplies .
But the bill has yet to be backed by the Senate and the White House has already said it would veto the bill .
There was also scepticism about whether there will actually be a cut in Libya , because of soaring prices .
" I doubt that any real effort in cutting output would be forthcoming , considering that pricing continues to hit new records , " said Victor Shum , an analyst at Purvin & Getz .
' Radically new level '
Meanwhile , the chief executive of Gazprom , Alexei Miller , has been talking down the influence of Opec .
Saying that Opec had no real impact on prices , he told the Financial Times : " Not a single decision has been passed of late that would really influence the global oil market . "
He also said that the world was undergoing " a great surge in oil and gas prices , which will end with prices at a radically new level " .
Mr Miller predicted that Gazprom would become the most influential company in the energy business .
On Friday , the firm approved the replacement of former chairman Dmitry Medvedev , who is now Russian president , with former prime minister Viktor Zubkov .

What are these ?
For decades , astronomers have been blind to what our galaxy , the Milky Way , really looks like .
After all , we sit in the midst of it and can't step outside for a bird 's eye view .
Now , new images from NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope are shedding light on the true structure of the Milky Way , revealing that it has just two major arms of stars instead of the four it was previously thought to possess .
" Spitzer has provided us with a starting point for rethinking the structure of the Milky Way , " said Robert Benjamin of the University of Wisconsin , Whitewater , who presented the new results at a press conference today at the 212th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in St. Louis , Mo . " We will keep revising our picture in the same way that early explorers sailing around the globe had to keep revising their maps . "
Since the 1950s , astronomers have produced maps of the Milky Way .
The early models were based on radio observations of gas in the galaxy , and suggested a spiral structure with four major star - forming arms , called Norma , Scutum - Centaurus , Sagittarius and Perseus .
In addition to arms , there are bands of gas and dust in the central part of the galaxy .
Our sun lies near a small , partial arm called the Orion Arm , or Orion Spur , located between the Sagittarius and Perseus arms .
" For years , people created maps of the whole galaxy based on studying just one section of it , or using only one method , " said Benjamin .
" Unfortunately , when the models from various groups were compared , they did n't always agree .
It 's a bit like studying an elephant blind - folded . "
Large infrared sky surveys in the 1990s led to some major revisions of these models , including the discovery of a large bar of stars in the middle of the Milky Way .
Infrared light can penetrate through dust , so telescopes designed to pick up infrared light get better views of our dusty and crowded galactic center .
In 2005 , Benjamin and his colleagues used Spitzer 's infrared detectors to obtain detailed information about our galaxy 's bar , and found that it extends farther out from the center of the galaxy than previously thought .

The team of scientists now has new infrared imagery from Spitzer of an expansive swath of the Milky Way , stretching 130 degrees across the sky and one degree above and below the galaxy 's mid-plane .
This extensive mosaic combines 800,000 snapshots and includes over 110 million stars .
Benjamin developed software that counts the stars , measuring stellar densities .
When he and his teammates counted stars in the direction of the Scutum - Centaurus Arm , they noticed an increase in their numbers , as would be expected for a spiral arm .
But , when they looked in the direction where they expected to see the Sagittarius and Norma arms , there was no jump in the number of stars .
The fourth arm , Perseus , wraps around the outer portion of our galaxy and cannot be seen in the new Spitzer images .
The findings make the case that the Milky Way has two major spiral arms , a common structure for galaxies with bars .
These major arms , the Scutum - Centaurus and Perseus arms , have the greatest densities of both young , bright stars , and older , so - called red - giant stars .
The two minor arms , Sagittarius and Norma , are filled with gas and pockets of young stars .
Benjamin said the two major arms seem to connect up nicely with the near and far ends of the galaxy 's central bar .
" Now , we can fit the arms together with the bar , like pieces of a puzzle , " said Benjamin , " and , we can map the structure , position and width of these arms for the first time . "
Previous infrared observations found hints of a two - armed Milky Way , but those results were unclear because the position and width of the arms were unknown .
Though galaxy arms appear to be intact features , stars are actually constantly moving in and out of them as they orbit the center of the Milky Way , like London commuters in a busy traffic circle .
Our own sun might have once resided in a different arm .
Since it was formed more than 4 billion years ago , it has traveled around the galaxy 16 times .
Co-investigators of this research include Ed Churchwell , Marilyn Meade and Brian Babler of the University of Wisconsin , Madison ; Barbara Whitney of the Space Science Institute , Madison , Wis. ; Rémy Indebetouw of the University of Virginia , Charlottesville ; and Christer Watson of Manchester College , Ind .
NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif. , manages the Spitzer mission for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate , Washington .
Science operations occur at the Spitzer Science Center at the California Institute of Technology , also in Pasadena .

Pay negotiations between the Screen Actors Guild and movie studios broke down Tuesday over payment for performances of video clips on sites such as YouTube .
The movie studios want to pay actors a flat fee for video shown online , where as the actors want payment every time a video is shown .
SAG President Alan Rosenberg told Reuters that “ What they ’re asking us to do is erase 50 years of our customs and practice . ”
The current state of play with online video is that studios and broadcast networks are free to use video clips for promotional purposes , for example a movie trailer .
Reuse of clips as standalone entertainment ( excerpts , outtakes or remixed works ) can only be show with consent from every performer in the clip with a negotiated rate of pay .
Each performer in a clip must receive a minimum of $ 759 , even if the clip is just a few seconds long .
Talks between the SAG and studios are expected to resume later this month , with the current pay agreement expiring June 30 .
If the two parties cant agree on online payments , the SAG is expected to call an actors strike that will immediately cripple all TV and movie production in the United States .

BBC News , Beijing
The US delegation has said it is planning to bring its own food for American athletes .
At a news conference in Beijing , a senior official , Kang Yi , said it was a pity that the US had apparently decided not to trust China 's food .
Ms Kang insisted that the food served to athletes at the Olympics would exceed international health standards .
For China , a good Olympic Games means cheering spectators , record - breaking performances and athletes and fans all sitting down to enjoy some good Chinese - made food .
But the US is not so sure about the food part , and plans to import its own meat and cook its own meals for its athletes when they get to Beijing .
Ms Kang and her colleagues were asked about the allegation that chickens on sale here are so full of hormones that athletes would test positive for steroids if they were to eat them .
There is no scientific evidence for this , insisted Lu Yong , who runs Beijing 's municipal food safety monitoring centre .
Map - reduce - merge : simplified relational data processing on large clusters ( freely - accessible slides ) .
Hung-chih Yang , Ali Dasdan , Ruey - Lung Hsiao , D. Stott Parker .
2007 ACM SIGMOD conference .
Map - Reduce is a programming model that enables easy development of scalable parallel applications to process a vast amount of data on large clusters of commodity machines .
Through a simple interface with two functions , map and reduce , this model facilitates parallel implementation of many real - world tasks such as data processing jobs for search engines and machine learning .
However , this model does not directly support processing multiple related heterogeneous datasets .
While processing relational data is a common need , this limitation causes difficulties and / or inefficiency when Map - Reduce is applied on relational operations like joins .
We improve Map - Reduce into a new model called Map - Reduce - Merge .
It adds to Map - Reduce a Merge phase that can efficiently merge data already partitioned and sorted ( or hashed ) by map and reduce modules .
We also demonstrate that this new model can express relational algebra operators as well as implement several join algorithms .

Youtube phenom “ Hotforwords ” raises the ante on the “ teaching for love ” canard .
In the process , she schools us on how teaching really can realize the administration ’s dream in the form of the ultimate “ quality ” process .
The 27 - year - old Russian philologist is a former Ph.D. aspirant and high - school literature teacher with nearly 30 million views of her videos explaining various linguistic puzzles , such as — in the featured clip — how “ dope ” can mean both stupid and excellent .
One might ask the same about the term “ quality , ” which for administrators means , well , this .
Seriously , there ’s no disputing her metrics .
It ’s teaching as “ vaudeville , ” as The New York Times ’s Virginia Heffernan points out , but her curriculum is customer - defined and market - oriented .
She is a self - funding responsibility center .
She gets great student evaluations .
Her teaching methods are susceptible to straightforward assessment instruments .
There is n’t a “ quality ” complaint to make about her .
Oh yeah , and it ’s totally exploitative , which makes a nice fit with all the outsourcing and permatemping .
Marina ’s teaching for love ( of fame ) is not entirely divorced from the phenomenon that Michelle Masse analyzes as the feminization of the humanities — the reduction of whole fields of faculty work to second - class status by way of the gender economy : part of the cheapening and degradation of the work is the tacit recognition of it as women ’s work , as a service , compensated by something other than wages .
In connection with her forthcoming SUNY collection Ten Million Served with Katie Hogan , she observes how the call to “ service ” is one of the most compelling vectors of exploitation in academic life .
Masse points out that “ secretary ” and “ nurse ” used to name well - remunerated , well - respected positions for men .
Kinda like “ professor of language . ”
Now that it ’s women ’s work , it ’s best done as a kind of lightly - paid volunteerism — for love , or , as in Marina ’s , case , something closely allied to it .

BANGKOK 
While the death toll in Myanmar continues to climb , international aid agencies are warning of a new kind of threat to the most vulnerable survivors , children .
The young suffered disproportionately from the very beginning : relief groups estimate that they made up about one - third of those killed by the devastating cyclone .
Now , they say , children make up about a third of survivors .
Many are orphans or lost , and surrounded by strangers in crowded refugee camps ; some are too young to even know their parents ’ names . .
Since many of Myanmar ’s children are malnourished , their immune systems are weaker , said Kate Conradt , a spokeswoman for Save the Children in Bangkok .
So , with huge rainstorms drenching the often - homeless survivors , food and clean water scarce , and aid slow to arrive , children are likely to lead the next expected wave of death from water - born diseases .
And as time passes , the relief groups say , the children are increasingly at risk of forced recruitment into sexual labor and the armed forces
The following is reprinted from Uncle John 's Ahh - Inspiring Bathroom Reader Every TV show wants one , but few achieve it : a catchphrase .
The best ones not only propel their show into the limelight , but eventually take a life of their own , sometimes getting into the dictionary , sometimes even electing a president .
Here are the stories behind some of TV's most famous catchphrases : D'oh !
From : The Simpsons ( 1989 - ) Here 's the Story : Dan Castellaneta , the voice of Homer Simpson , came up with Homer 's signature line himself .
" It was written into the script as a ' frustrated grunt , ' " he explains , " And I thought of that old Laurel and Hardy character who had a grunt like ' D'owww . '
Matt Groening ( Simpsons creator ) said ' Great , but shorten it .' ...
No one thought it would become a catchphrase . "
But it did - in a big way .
The sitcom is seen by more than 60 million people in more than 60 countries .
In 2001 , " D'oh ! " earned a spot in the Oxford English Dictionary .
Holy ______ , Batman !
From : Batman ( 1966 - 68 )
Here 's the Story : Uttered by Robin ( Burt Ward ) whenever he was dumbfounded , this silly phrase helped make the show a hit ... and also led to its demise .
During the first season , which aired two nights a week , Batman was fresh .
ABC quickly realized that one of the things viewers loved was Robin 's quirky lines , so they milked it for all it was worth .
But by the end of the second season , the plots were all recycled and the " Holy whatever , Batman ! " had lost its impact .
It did n't do much for Burt Ward 's career either ; he was never able to get past the Boy Wonder image .
In the 1995 film Batman Forever , Chris O'Donnell 's Robin gave a nod to this famous catchphrase in the following exchange with Val Kilmer 's Batman : " Holy rusted metal , Batman ! " exclaims Robin .
" Huh ? " asks Batman .
" The island , " explains Robin , " it 's made out of rusted metal ... and holey ... you know . "
" Oh , " says Batman dryly .
What 'chu talkin ' ' bout , Willis ?
The awesomeness that is Gary Coleman : [ YouTube clip ]
From : Diff'rent Strokes ( 1978 - 86 )
Here 's the Story : Gary Coleman 's snub - nosed delivery helped keep Diff 'rent Strokes going for eight years .
After the show 's demise , the struggling Coleman began using it at public appearances and in TV cameos to help keep his career afloat .
But in recent years he 's grown so sick of the line - and the TV business in general - that he 's vowed never to say it again .
Sock it to me !
From the end of the show : [ YouTube Link ] From : Laugh - In ( 1968 - 73 )
Here 's the Story :
The phrase came from pop music ( Aretha Franklin 's Respect ) .
But the popular variety show Rowan and Martin 's Laugh - In turned it into a mindless slapstick sketch ... and repeated it week after week .
Here 's how it worked :
An unsuspecting person ( usually Judy Carne ) would be tricked into saying " Sock it to me ! "
Then he or she was either hit by pies , drenched with water , or dropped through a trap door .
Viewers loved it ; they knew what was coming every time , and they still loved it .
It quickly became an " in " thing to get socked .
This catchphrase was more than popular - it may have altered history :
On September 16 , 1968 , presidential candidate Richard Nixon appeared on the show .
HE was set up in the standard fashion but surprised everyone by changing the command into a question : " Sock it to ME ? "
It did wonders for Nixon 's staid , humorless image , and may have helped propel him into the Oval Office .
Beam me up , Scotty From : Star Trek ( 1966 - 69 )
Here 's the Story : Although Captain Kirk ( William Shatner ) never actually said this exact phrase ( the closest version he came was on the Star Trek animated series : " Beam us up , Scotty " ) , it has somehow been transported everywhere - feature films , advertisements , and even bumper stickers ( " Beam me up , Scotty - there 's no intelligent life down here " )
Sometimes it even finds its way into the news : when 39 members of the Heaven 's Gate cult committed suicide in 1997 , expecting to leave their bodies and join with a spaceship , the press dubbed them the " Beam Me Up Scotty " cult .
Ayyyyy Fonzie " jumping the shark " [ YouTube Link ] From : Happy Days ( 1974 - 84 )
Here 's the Story : Arthur " The Fonz " Fonzarelli ( Henry Winkler ) was not originally intended to be the " cool " character ; Potsie was .
The Fonz was added as a " bad influence " to give the show more of an edge .
But Winkler 's hip - yet - sensitive portrayal , along with his trademark leather jacket , thumbs up , and " Ayyyyy " had such screen presence that ABC started working him into more and more storylines , making sure he got at least one " Ayyyyy " in each episode .
By 1977 Winkler 's billing had gone from closing credits to fifth , and finally to second .
When Ron Howard left the show in 1980 , Winkler was given top billing .
ABC almost retitled the show Fonzie 's Happy Days .
Blast From the Past : Check out the scene in Pulp Fiction where the hit -man Jules ( Samuel L. Jackson ) is trying to calm down the diner robbers he 's terrorizing : " Let 's all be good little Fonzies .
And what was Fonzie like ? " he asks .
One of them sheepishly answers , " Coo-ol . " " Correctamundo ! " says Jackson .
Two thumbs up
How do they get along behind the scenes ?
Here 's Siskel and Ebert uncensored : [ YouTube Link ] From : Sneak Previews ( 1975 - 80 ) , renamed At the Movies ( 1980 - ) Here 's the Story : " Thumbs up " has been a symbol of approval since Roman times .
But " two thumbs up " means a whole lot more to the movie industry .
Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert , film critics for rival Chicago newspapers , worked together for 24 years before Siskel 's death in 1999 .
Their opposite tastes in movies assured moviegoers that if both of these guys liked the movie , chances are you would too .
Filmmakers also took note of the growing popularity of the phrase ; they watched the show each week , hoping their latest project would get two thumbs up .
If so , it was plastered all over movie ads .
Why ?
Because " two thumbs up " means big box office .
If not ... well , have you ever seen a movie advertised that got " one thumb up " ?
De plane !
De plane !
From : Fantasy Island ( 1978 - 84 )
Here 's the Story :
At the beginning of each episode , the vertically - challenged Tattoo ( Herve Villechaize ) shouted this phrase to alert his boss , Mr. Roarke ( Ricardo Montalban ) , that " de plane " was coming .
The phrase did so much for Fantasy Island that in 1983 Villechaize asked for the same salary as Montalban .
Instead , he was fired .
Ratings dropped off dramatically and the show was cancelled after the following season .
In 1992 Villechaize turned up in a Dunkin ' Donuts commercial asking for " De plain !
De plain ! " donuts .
Resistance is futile
We all know the Borg from Star Trek , so here 's Bill Gates as a Borg instead : [ YouTube Link ] From : Star Trek : The Next Generation ( 1987 - 94 )
Here 's the Story : This line actually made its television debut on the British TV serial Dr. Who .
Its more recent use by the Borg , aliens out to assimilate humans , made it a household phrase .
It has even became a response to the growing power of corporations and governments .
A political cartoon in the late 1990s showed a Borged - out Bill Gates declaring , " We are Microsoft .
We will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own .
You will be assimilated .
Resistance is futile . "
And now a new bumper sticker is showing up that says , " Resistance is not futile . "
Book 'em , Danno ! From : Hawaii Five - O ( 1968 - 80 )
Here 's the Story : Even though Hawaii Five - O ran for 12 years , more people today remember this catchphrase than the show itself .
When he caught the bad guy , detective Steve McGarrett ( Jack Lord ) would smugly utter this line to his assistant Danny " Danno " Williams ( James MacArthur ) .
To say the catchphrase is part of pop culture is an understatement : a 2002 Internet search found more than 1,000 entries for " Book 'em , Danno ! " Yadda Yadda Yadda From : Seinfeld ( 1990 - 98 )
Here 's the Story :
The phrase has been around since the 1940s ; but then it showed up on Seinfeld in the 1990s and yadda yadda yadda , now it's in the dictionary .
I 've Fallen and I Can't Get Up !
Here 's the commercial featuring Mrs. Fletcher 's famous catchphrase : [ YouTube Link ]
From : TV commercials selling LifeCall personal emergency response system in the 1980s .
Here 's the Story : Advertisers also try to come up with catchy catchphrases ( remember the " Where 's the beef ? " lady from the Wendy 's ads ? )
The " I 've fallen ... " plea , however , was never intended to be catchy - or funny .
But somehow it outlasted the company that advertised it ( bankrupt ) and the woman who said it ( died ) .
More than a decade after its debut , " I 've fallen and I can't get up ! " is still being used by comedians from Jay Leno to Carrot Top .
Oh my God , They Killed Kenny !
From : South Park ( 1997 - )
Here 's the Story : A bigger part of what made South Park a hit was the tasteless but innovative routine of killing off the same character in nearly every episode .
Asked why , the show 's creator Trey Parker and Matt Stone admitted , " We just like to kill him ...
And we really like the line ' Oh my God , they killed Kenny ! ' "
A few years later , Stone retracted : " We got sick of figuring out ways to kill him ...
It was funny the first 38 or 40 times we did it .
Then it turned into , ' OK , how can we kill him now ? ' "
So in December 2001 they killed Kenny for good ... but the phrase lives on .
Yabba - Dabba - Doo !
From : The Flintstones ( 1960 - 66 )
Here 's the Story : Just like Homer 's " D'oh ! " this one came from the man who voiced the character , Alan Reed .
Flintstones co-creator Joe Barbera tells the story : " In a recording session , Alan said , ' Hey Joe , where it says " yahoo , " can I say " yabba - dabba - doo ? " '
I said yeah .
God knows where he got it , but it was one of those terrific phrases . "
Reed later said that it came from his mother , who used to say , " A little dab'll do ya . "
Just The Facts , Ma'am From : Dragnet ( 1952-59/1967-70 )
Here 's the Story : Sergeant Joe Friday 's ( Jack Webb ) deadpan delivery made this statement famous ... sort of .
He actually never said it .
Friday 's line was " All we want are the facts , Ma'am . "
Satirist Stan Freberg spoofed the popular show on a 1953 record called " St. George and the Dragonet , " which featured the line : " I just want to get the facts , Ma'am . "
The record sold more than two million copies , and Freberg 's line - not Webb's - became synonymous with the show .
According to Freberg : " Jack Webb told me , ' Thanks for pushing us into the number one spot , ' because after my record came out , within three weeks , he was number one . "
Let 's get ready to ... ( something that rhymes with ' mumble ' but starts with an ' R ' ) .
From : Sports announcer Michael Buffer Here 's the Story :
This one wins out over many other famous TV sports sayings because of the controversy it created .
After hearing others imitating his famous battle cry , Michael Buffer and his brother Bruce decided to trademark it , a decision that made them both millionaires .
Michael now charges $ 15,000 to $ 30,000 just to show up , say it , and leave .
But if you feel like yelling the " rumble " phrase out loud , do it quietly ; the Buffer brothers will sue the pants off of you if you say it at an event without paying them .
( They even sued Ollie North . )
Why such big safeguards on such a trite saying ?
" It 's probably the most famous phrase said by a human being in history , " Michael explains .
The 7 Never - to - be- Forgotten Principles of Government by Harry Browne July 1 , 2003
It 's easy to think sometimes that a new government program , law , or regulation could cure a pressing social problem .
Whether it's a desire to end abortions , keep the wrong people out of the country , make your city drug - free , stop corporate frauds , crack down on criminals , or make health care more accessible and less expensive , you can imagine how the right new law could make everything okay .
But when you get that kind of thought , I hope you 'll remember the seven principles that apply to all government programs  not just the ones you oppose .
The Principles 1 . Government is force .
Every government program , law , or regulation is a demand that someone do what he does n't want to do , refrain from doing what he does want to do , or pay for something he does n't want to pay for .
And those demands are backed up by police with guns .
You expect that force to be used only against the guilty .
But we can see how the Drug War , the foreign wars , asset forfeiture , the Patriot Act , and other government activities have used force just as often against the innocent  people who have not intruded on anyone else 's person or property .
In fact , government force is used more often against the innocent than the guilty , because the guilty make it their business to understand the laws that apply to them and stay clear of them .
Meanwhile , the innocent , thinking they 've nothing to fear , suddenly find that they 've innocently violated laws they never heard of .
2 . Government is politics .
Whenever you turn over to the government a financial , social , medical , military , or commercial matter , it 's automatically transformed into a political issue  to be decided by those with the most political influence .
And that will never be you or I .
Politicians do n't weigh their votes on the basis of ideology or social good .
They think in terms of political power .
3 . You do n't control government .
It 's easy to think of the perfect law that will stop the bad guys while leaving the good guys unhindered .
But no law will be written the way you have in mind , it wo n't be administered the way you have in mind , and it wo n't be adjudicated the way you have in mind .
Your ideal law will be written by politicians for political purposes , administered by bureaucrats for political purposes , and adjudicated by judges appointed for political purposes .
So do n't be surprised if the new law turns out to do exactly the opposite of what you thought you were supporting .
4 . Every government program will be more expensive and more expansive than anything you had in mind when you proposed it .
It will be applied in all sorts of ways you never dreamed of .
When Medicare was initially passed in 1965 , the politicians projected its cost in 1992 to be $ 3 billion  which is equivalent to $ 12 billion when adjusted for inflation to 1992 dollars .
The actual cost in 1992 was $ 110 billion  nine times as much .
And when Medicare was enacted , Section 1801 of the original law specifically prohibited any bureaucratic interference with the practice of medicine .
Today not one word of that protection still applies .
The federal government owns the health - care industry lock , stock , and barrel .
The new program you support will eventually include all sorts of powers and privileges you can't even imagine right now .
5 . Power will always be misused .
Give good people the power to do good and that power eventually will be in the hands of bad people to do bad .
As Michael Cloud has pointed out , " The problem is n't the abuse of power ; it 's the power to abuse . "
Give politicians power and it certainly will be abused eventually  if not by today 's politicians , then by their successors .
As P.J. O'Rourke said , " Giving money and power to politicians is like giving whiskey and car keys to teenage boys . "
6 . Government does n't work .
Because government is force , because government programs are designed to enrich the politically powerful , because you can't control government and make it do what 's right , because every new government program soon wanders from its original purpose , and because politicians eventually misuse the power you give them , it is inevitable that no government program will deliver on the promises the politicians make for it .
For years , I 've asked listeners during radio interviews to name a government program that has actually delivered on its promises , and no one has been able to do so .
If you think there 's a successful government program , you probably do n't know how much it actually costs , are n't aware of all its destructive side - effects , have no idea how easily and inexpensively such a thing could be done outside of government , and / or are basing your view of its success on political propaganda .
It does n't matter whether a program is supposed to do something you want or something you do n't want , whether the program is something you consider a proper function of government or something beyond its limits .
It wo n't work .
Government programs always wind up disappointing you .
7 . Government must be subject to absolute limits .
Because politicians have every incentive to expand government , and with it their power , there must be absolute limits on government .
The Constitution provides the obvious limits we must reimpose upon the federal government .
Until the Constitution is enforced , we have no hope of containing the federal government .
The present system of unlimited power is like giving a drunken stranger a set of signed , blank checks on your bank account .
You are reduced to relying on the honesty and integrity of people you do n't even know  and they abuse that trust again and again .
Whether you think government should be bigger or smaller than the limits specified in the Constitution , the first step is to restore absolute limits , and then  if you like  work to change those limits to ones that would be more to your liking .
Questions
So the next time you 're tempted to think that some government program is just what this country needs , ask yourself these questions :
Do I really want to use force to make this happen ?
Do I have any idea how many families may be destroyed by giving the government another tool to be enforced with fines and prison terms ?
Do I really believe that George Bush , Teddy Kennedy , Hillary Clinton , and Trent Lott will have my best interests at heart when they fashion this new program or law ?
Why should I believe supporting this program will lead to exactly the solution I believe is right  when I have no way to control the outcome ?
Do I really think the politicians wo n't expand the scope and cost of this program far beyond what they 're talking about today ?
Do I really want to give politicians this kind of power  knowing that some day the politicians and party I do n't like will have it at their disposal ?
Why in the world should I think this government program will work any better than any government program of the past ?
How can I hope to bring about small , limited government when I 'm suggesting a new government program that will take us further away from the Constitution ?
Conclusion
If you really want to cure a pressing social problem , take steps outside the realm of government .
If you do n't see how you can convince people to help you succeed in a non-governmental endeavor , how can you expect to control politicians who care nothing for your desires ?
And if you really want to make a noticeable difference , if you really want to improve life , do something for yourself or your family today .
That 's where you have real control , that 's where you do n't need to rely on politicians  or anyone else  and you can make sure the results are as you intend .
It ’s official .
According to Mark Hotaling , executive director of the Christian Family Alliance of Colorado , “ Colorado is going to be ground zero for the issue of life in America . ” ( Source : Denver Post )
The reason is that the Colorado non-profit Colorado for Equal Rights has turned in nearly double the number of signatures required to get an amendment to the Colorado constitution onto November ’s ballot .
Here ’s the complete text of said proposed amendment :
Person defined .
As used in sections 3 , 6 , and 25 of Article II of the state constitution , the terms “ person ” or “ persons ” shall include any human being from the moment of fertilization .
Our own Dr. Slammy brought up this issue in a post ( Every sperm is sacred ) three months ago , and the ramifications of this range from the absurd , awful , and terrifying all the way to downright misogynistic .
And yes , you read that right .
Think about it for a moment .
If a zygote ( fertilized egg ) is equivalent to a human being , then anything that happens to the egg afterward is the mother ’s responsibility .
If the prospective mother inadvertently causes a miscarriage because she did n’t realize she was pregnant and drank to excess , that ’s manslaughter – murder if she drinks to excess knowing that she was pregnant .
And it ’s child abuse if the child turns out to be developmentally stunted as a result of fetal alcohol syndrome .
But that ’s not the worst part of this .
The worst part is that declaring a zygote a person means that a everything the potential mother does that could prevent implantation in her uterus is attempted murder .
The pill goes from a contraceptive method to a murder weapon .
Intra-uterine devices are similarly treated .
And let ’s not even talk about an actual abortion .
Actually , lets .
Abortion is murder , at least according to these people .
Well , if 50.0000000000001 % of the “ enlightened ” population of Colorado votes “ yes ” on this amendment , that statement will go from a statement of pious opinion to legal reality .
And abortion providers and patients will become first degree murderers and accessories to the crime .
And what ’s the upshot of all of this ?
The woman and potential mother becomes enslaved to her offspring .
Literally – she can do nothing that will injure the zygote , blastocyst , embryo , or fetus without running the risk of being accused of a felony .
According to the Mirriam - Webster online dictionary , this is the definition of “ slavery ” :
slavery , noun 1 . drudgery , toil 2 . submission to a dominating influence 3 . a : the state of a person who is a chattel of another b : the practice of slaveholding
The dominating influence , the person making the woman its “ chattel ” in this case ?
The “ person ” the woman is being forced to carry to term against her will .
If enslaving a woman to a zygote is n’t misogyny , I do n’t know what is .
I would n’t wish this on any woman , not even the piously brainwashed 20 - year old founder of Colorado for Equal Rights , Kristi Burton .
There ’s a slight chance that this wo n’t make it .
The Secretary of State ( a Republican ) might rule that nearly half of the signatures are invalid .
But I doubt it .
There ’s a chance that it wo n’t be voted in , but since our state legislature steadfastly refuses to be prudent and raise the bar for amending the state Constitution , I do n’t hold out much hope for that either .
I ’d held off publicizing this issue by blogging about it here on S&R in hopes that lack of publicity would make it go away .
It did n’t .
So now it ’s time to let slip the dogs of war on these people .
Some things are so immoral as to be evil .
Legally enshrining women as chattel is one of those things .
I ’ve made little secret here about my feelings toward Christianity and the rest of the world ’s religions .
Religious belief is inherently irrational , and while religion has resulted in considerable good , precious little of it has been unique to religion ( i.e. , much of the good with which religion has been credited can be and has been achieved through non-religious routes ) .
Worse , the adverse consequences of religion have largely been unique to religion .
Plenty of bad things happen would still happen without religion , but the fingerprints of religion are found on many of the most obscene atrocities humanity has committed .
In this post , I ’d like to ask whether it is possible to be a proponent of atheism without being an opponent of religion .
I ’d also like to address what may be even more important , the possibility of being pro-atheist without being anti-Christian .
In the sense that atheism refers to a lack of theistic belief , it may seem nonsensical to talk about promoting it .
One can easily be a proponent of reason , science , philosophical materialism , education , humanism , and the like .
But atheism ?
Can we promote atheism apart from criticizing theism ?
Unless we expand the definition of atheism to include one or more of these related notions , the answer seems to be no .
And yet , I have written here extensively about promoting atheism .
I even have a “ promoting atheism ” label for categorizing these posts .
The posts to which I apply this label tend to be those that have something positive to say about a broad atheistic worldview that extends beyond the definitional boundaries of atheism .
In this sense , they are not really promoting atheism but promoting my particular atheistic worldview , a perspective based on atheism , skepticism , materialism , and other things .
A great many atheists accept many of the tenets of this worldview – it is hardly unique – and yet , these other ingredients take us beyond atheism .
Frankly , I am not sure that it matters whether promoting a narrowly defined atheism is possible without criticizing religion .
I ’ve known few atheists who were n’t also materialists or skeptics .
But I ’m not sure it matters for an entirely different reason too .
It seems to me that the relevant question is whether one can be pro-atheist without being anti-Christian , and to this , I say absolutely yes .
Being pro-atheist is about people .
Specifically , it is about promoting courageous people who are not willing to go along with the popular delusion .
Being pro-atheist is about standing up for the rights of a thoroughly despised minority .
It is about civil rights and social justice .
I am not denying that some atheists are anti-Christian , anti-Muslim , etc .
There are certainly anti-theistic atheists , some of whom consider themselves anti-theists rather than atheists .
But there are a great many more atheists who simply want the religionists to leave them alone , to stop trying to legislate their particular version of morality , and to end the bigotry .
I happily promote these atheists and strive to be one of them .
I am most certainly opposed to Christianity , Islam , Judaism , and the like , but I have hope for the adherents of these faiths .
They can triumph over delusion as countless others have .
At last , some cheering news for downhearted fans of Ron Paul , the libertarian Republican now certain to fail , by some distance , to secure his party 's presidential nomination .
This month has seen the first meeting of the shareholders in a fledgling community development planned in rural Texas , to be comprised exclusively of Paul 's supporters .
It is to be called Paulville .
The gated settlement will house freedom - loving folk , living unbound by the shackles of planning regulations .
Its founders hope that when complete , it will inspire further Paulvilles around America and , in their own words , " literally change the world , one community at a time " .
The Hudspeth County project has attracted derision across the US , though , with the political gossip website Wonkette.com uncharitably dubbing it " Paultard City " .
And even at this early stage , it appears that ideological compromises might have to be made .
Necessity dictates that the community will function on a cooperative basis , albeit with the ability for households to opt out .
The idea is that the option not to access communal utilities , such as electricity , will ensure that its founding individualist principles remain unsullied .
Paulville 's supporters believe that politically like - minded individuals can form a thriving community , detached from a busybody state .
But historical precedents do not augur well .
Some 115 years ago , a group of disillusioned Australians set sail for South America , intent on toiling their way to a new society , in this case , free from avaricious capitalism .
Colonia Nueva Australia was duly established in darkest Paraguay .
Sadly , rows over leadership and booze quickly sealed the cooperative 's fate .
Not all idealistic communities have failed .
The Findhorn Foundation , a settlement in the north - east of Scotland , has flourished .
Built on spiritual principles and ideas of environmental sustainability , it has become a model for eco-villages around the world .
Though they might have little in common philosophically , advocates of Paulville and Findhorn share the desire to create a template for another world .
Jonathan Dawson , an educator based at Findhorn , does n't see much point to inward - facing micro-communities and talks about " providing an example " to others .
" It 's not useful to retreat just for the sake of it , " he says .
At present the online chatter amongst prospective Paulville residents is of septic - tank permits .
But when residents are settled into their new homes , it will surely turn to the right to wield semi-automatic weapons and the abolition of income tax .

The most spectacular compound noun I 've seen this week was in the UK free newspaper Metro , which I pick up on the bus in Edinburgh .
I never read the celebrity gossip pages , of course .
But I did happen to notice this headline on page 25 yesterday :
Amy husband bribery plot landlord cleared
That 's a non-finite passive clause consisting of a subject , in the form of five nouns in a complex nominal construction , and one verb in the past participle form .
Is the clause grammatical ?
One hundred percent , I think .
Is it admirable style ?
Well , for a newspaper given away free on the 29 bus , maybe it 's churlish to quibble about syntactic clunkiness .
Non-clunkiness is not the central issue .
The second most important desideratum for a headline is that it should make you look and perhaps read the story on the South Bridge before you get off at St Patrick Square ; and the most important of all is that it should fit the column width .
For this one they had 20 cm .
Not enough room to add an apostrophe and an s so that Amy could be made into a genitive determiner .
Referring to Fielder - Civil as Amy 's husband would have been much closer to normal style , but they ran out of horizontal space given the prior choice of point size .
The story is about the acquittal of a pub landlord ( James King ) who was charged with participating in a plot to pervert the course of justice by accepting a bribe offered by the husband ( Blake Fielder - Civil ) of the accomplished and hopelessly drug- addicted singer Amy Winehouse .
What kind of landlord ?
A plot landlord .
What kind of plot ?
A bribery plot .
Which bribery plot ?
The Amy husband bribery plot .
You 're meant to know all about this plot already .
It has been in and out of the newspapers for a couple of years .
The odious Fielder - Civil and his friend Michael Brown attacked James King at a pub in Hoxton , in East London , beating him up badly enough to fracture his cheekbone .
Then , when they sobered up , they set about bribing him so they could stay out of jail .
Two hundred thousand quid — and as of today that 's nearly $ 400,000 .
Probably Amy was to be tapped for the money , but it turned out that no evidence on that point was brought , which is part of why King was cleared of accepting a bribe .
He said he was intimidated into dropping the charges .
Well , they 're not dropped now .
Fielder - Civil and Brown face maybe five years in jail .
Amy says she will wait for her beloved husband , though it has to be acknowledged that she spends much of her time in nightclubs , hospitals , clinics , and courtrooms , and very little time on stage or in the recording studio .
The drink and drugs are wrecking her career .
Right now the hot topic in the news is whether the doctors who have just diagnosed her with emphysema , and told her that continuing to smoke crack will kill her , will approve her leaving hospital to perform at the big pop festival at Glastonbury .
But I never read any of this .
Anyway , it 's only the first two words of that headline above that strike me as really unusual and not at all commendable style .
It is really unusual for close and familiar relationships like husbandhood , wifehood , sisterhood , parenthood , being a body part of , and simple possession to be expressed with a modifier + head construction ( Amy husband ) rather than a genitive determiner + head construction ( Amy 's husband ) .
But you can't ban proper nouns like Amy from being attributive modifiers of nouns : you can see proper nouns as noun modifiers in Apple computer , Beatles fan , Cezanne painting , Dilbert strip , Elvis impersonator , Jesus freak , London fog , Paris suburbs , RCA record , Toyota pickup … there are literally more cases than you can count ( because new proper names are being made up all the time ) .
And the semantic range is very wide indeed : put two nouns together and the meaning of the result can be almost ( but not quite ) anything you like .
The Metro simply took that fully grammatical pattern and pushed it a couple of centimeters further than anyone would normally go , to save a centimeter and a half of column width .

Between Grant ’s Pass , a pleasant retirement town in southern Oregon ’s Siskiyou mountains , and the Californian fishing port of Crescent City , chiefly noted for the nightmarish state prison known as Pelican Bay , stretches route 199 .
It runs alongside the spectacularly beautiful Smith River ravine for some 50 miles .
To drive it , particularly on long holiday weekends , can be a teeth - grinding , bumper - to - bumper affair .
This last Memorial Day weekend , on a late Sunday afternoon , I shot through in record time , meeting as little traffic as I normally would at 2 am .
For the first time since the national trauma known as the great gas shortage of 1973 Americans are experiencing a collective shock as they adjust to gasoline prices that are now three times higher than they were four years ago .
Last weekend , on the edge of what used to be a summer ’s worth of driving sprees , many of the families who would normally have been chugging along 199 , looked at the $ 4 a gallon basic price of gasoline in the Pacific north west and stayed home or crept round the corner to the local mall .
Hence my pleasantly rapid drive home from Olympia , Washington to Petrolia , California , the first place oil wells were sunk in California , in the 1860s , though the industry lasted only a couple of years .
The drive comprised a distance of 630 miles , achieved in my 1962 Plymouth station wagon , which gets 15 mpg on the open road , better than the SUVs most Americans can no longer afford .
The round trip cost me $ 336 .
Of course Europeans , paying roughly twice as much to fill their tanks , snigger unfeelingly at American moaning at these prices .
But comparisons are not the issue here .
The median family income in Crescent City ( pop. 4,000 excluding 3,300 prisoners ) is about $ 20,000 a year .
A third of the population lives below the poverty line .
As in thousands of American towns across the country there ’s no slack in the family budgets here to accommodate a fuel bill here that ’s suddenly shot up 300 per cent .
A family of four that decides , as many will this summer , that it ca n’t afford to drive 1,200 miles down Interstate 5 from Seattle to Disneyland is making a decision that spells slim business for motels , roadside restaurants and the tourist industry overall .
Americans routinely drive huge distances , starting with the long distance truckers .
It now costs well over $ 1,000 to fill the tanks of an 18 - wheeler with diesel fuel averaging around $ 4.20 a gallon .
Over 1,000 trucking firms have already gone bankrupt this year and the independent drivers – about a fifth of the industry overall – face imminent ruin .
Roman emperors knew well that political tranquility marched arm in arm with the cost of bread .
As energy costs have soared in his term , Bush ’s popularity ratings have plummeted .
Doug Henwood , editor of Left Business Observer calculated a couple of years ago that an “ uncanny ” 78 per cent of the shifts in Bush ’s ratings mirrored changes in gas prices .
But the political implications are far larger and more long - term than the dismal trendlines of the 41st president .
Across the past generation American incomes , below the very rich , have remained essentially static , or have actually gotten worse .
Year after year Americans work harder , longer , for less money in real terms .
Political tranquility has been maintained by cheap gasoline , cheap food and , in recent years , the seemingly easy credit and tax deduction on home mortgage interest allowing middle - income families the illusion they owned a home .
Gasoline is no longer cheap .
The cost of food is going up .
The subprime crisis has pitchforked thousands of Americans into forfeiture .
There ’s worse to come .
Since the subprime meltdown there ’s been a lull .
But now the so - called “ Alt - A ” loans , made to supposedly more credit - worthy borrowers and amounting to a trillion dollars , are allegedly about to go down the tubes , carrying banks and insurers with them .
And this time Ben Bernanke , chairman the Federal Reserve , has no bail - out strategies left .
He ca n’t lower interest rates to banks below the current 2 per cent , a level partially responsible for oil costing almost $ 130 a barrel .
Round the corner looms hyper-inflation .
The sky is dark with chickens coming home to roost .
America is in a terrible fix .
But you would n’t know it from the politicians .
Obams , Clinton and McCain flourish quick - fix recipes that are as inconsequential as a pop gun aimed at a gunship by an Iraqi child .
Whoever is in charge come January 2000 will have to set as drastic a change in course as did Roosevelt in 1933 , the last time the political economy faced this serious a crisis .
Not that we need another Roosevelt , trying to bail out capitalism and stave off the left .
We need an an active radical mass movement , shoving Congress into action .
There ’s no sign that any of the candidates have advisors at their elbows capable of offering pertinent counsel .
Thirty years of vacuous boosterism about the virtues of neo-liberalism and unfettered markets have exacted a fearsome toll on the intellectual capacity of the policy - making elites .

“ My memory is of Professor Yoo coming over to see the counsel to the president and I was invited in the meeting with the three of us , and he gave us an outline of ‘ here are the subjects I ’m going to address , ’ ” Mr. Addington said .
“ We said , ‘ Good , ’ ” he added .
“ And he goes off and writes the opinion . ”
Mr. Yoo denied assertions by some officials that he had sought to bypass Mr. Ashcroft in writing the 2002 memorandum and other opinions favored by the White House .
Mr. Yoo , who worked in the Office of Legal Counsel , said he had supplied some drafts of the memorandum and its final version , signed by his boss at the time , Assistant Attorney General Jay S. Bybee , to top aides to Mr. Ashcroft and his deputy , Larry Thompson .
In written testimony , he said Mr. Ashcroft ’s staff “ made edits to the opinion ” and worked on it “ up until the very minute it was signed . ”
Image John Yoo , a former Justice Department official , testified about writing several major legal opinions on the subject of torture .
Credit ... Andrew Councill for The New York Times
In the view of some human rights advocates , the 50 - page memorandum set the stage for abusive interrogations by both the Central Intelligence Agency , which had sought the legal opinion , and the Defense Department , by giving a stamp of legality to even extreme interrogation measures .
After Mr. Yoo and Mr. Bybee left the Justice Department , their successors formally withdrew the memorandum .
Many Christians seem so hung up on the idea of worship that they cannot comprehend how anyone could not worship something .
Atheists are routinely accused of worshiping Darwin , science , humanity , and even ourselves .
I 've never encountered an atheist who worshiped any of these things .
That does not necessarily mean they are not out there somewhere , but they must be rare .
Most atheists do not worship anything , and it baffles me why this is so difficult for some Christians to understand .
Worshiping makes no sense to me , and I 'm not sure it ever has .
Even as a Christian , I was curious whether the sort of god that demanded worship could really be deserving of it .
It did not seem like the kind of trait anything that deserved to be characterized as a god would have .
I dealt with this gnawing doubt the same way many Christians do : I tried not to think about it .
Among famous deceased figures from history , Charles Darwin is probably the one atheists are most likely to be accused of worshiping .
And yet , the very notion of worshiping a long - dead person strikes me as absurd .
Darwin was certainly worthy of respect , admiration , and praise for his many contributions .
But worship ?
I think not .
So how about science ?
Frankly , I am not sure what worshiping science even means or what it would look like .
Do I have a high opinion of science ?
In some ways , sure .
Not only am I a scientist by training , but I have been impressed with the countless benefits to humanity conferred by scientific advances .
At the same time , I hardly regard science flawless or worthy of worship .
Science is both a method of acquiring knowledge and a body of knowledge .
Just because it works extremely well does not mean it has been error - free or is deserving of worship .
Claiming that atheists worship humanity is one that always makes me laugh .
It ignores the evidence that a great many atheists have fairly negative attitudes toward humanity .
I can tell you that this is something with which I struggle regularly .
I 've made no secret of my episodic misanthropy , but I think my attitude is usually one of guarded optimism .
I may hope for better days , but I am also realistic in my pessimism regarding the limits of our species .
Humanity , in my opinion , is far from deserving worship .
On some days , I 'm not sure it deserves much more than contempt .
So this must leave me worshiping myself , right ?
This seems to be the common fallback position for Christians when all other avenues are exhausted .
If the Christian cannot identify anything else that we might worship , we end up here .
I am not sure what I can say here except to point out that I barely tolerate myself much of the time .
If worship includes positive feelings , then it is more likely that I worship my friends , my camera , or my dog .
I do n't worship any of these things , but all would be better candidates than myself .
Psychologically , the common tendency of Christians to denigrate atheists by trying to make us seem more like them is fascinating .
We see it with their claims that atheists must worship something and that atheism requires faith .
There are many ways in which atheists and Christians are similar , but these are not among them .
I cannot claim to speak for all atheists , but none that I have encountered worship anyone , including themselves , science , or humanity .
This need to worship something appears to be a religious phenomenon which most of us do not share .

Lesbians ' kiss nearly gets them thumbed from game
SEATTLE --
A lesbian couple says a peck on the lips nearly got them tossed out of a recent Seattle Mariners baseball game at Safeco Field , reports KOMO News in Portland , Ore .
As reported on KATU.com , Sirbrina Guerrero said she gave her date a small kiss , but a mother sitting nearby with her son complained to security .
" And he ( the security guard ) goes , ' There 's a lady whose son says he saw you guys making out , and I did , too .
And you have to stop . '
And I said , ' Well , we were n't making out , but we were kissing , and I 'm not going to stop , ' " Guerrero told KOMO News .
" ( The security guard said ) the mom does n't want to explain to the kids why two girls are kissing .
So I said , ' Well , I 'm not going to stop , so you 'll have to kick me out .
So he said , ' So , I suggest you leave then , ' " she said .
Safeco Field officials sent KOMO
News the ballpark 's code of conduct that reads , " displays of affection are not appropriate in a public family setting . "
However , Guerrero said they observed heterosexual couples kissing at the game , and they were not ordered to cease or exit .

News reported that Safeco officials were questioning all staff members involved .
They said their security guards would never target same - sex couples .
Wgirls
In May of 2001 I took a few images of famous women and put Bush 's head on them .
I was bored and annoyed that Bush was in office .
The images ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 ) sat in a folder on my hard drive collecting dust .
Months passed and the events of September 11th happened .
Bush was in the news more than ever making comments like " wanted dead or alive " .
I wanted to release these images online , but I felt it was still too soon after 9/11 .
When the late night comedians started joking about the president again , I figured it was safe to release them .
I made a little pink page with the title " Wgirls " and put thumbnails of the pictures on it .
Clicking on the thumbnails brought up the startling full - sized images .
I think most people expected just cheesecake images of celebrities .
The shock and awe ( and horror ) came when they saw Bush 's mug .
The pictures struck a chord with people around the world .
As word of the site spread across the Internet , I started to receive tons of email .
The media eventually took notice of the images and they wound up in a couple of magazines ( MAX , [ Esquire ] ) .
The images were mentioned in a Wired article .
The georgewgirls.com was linked from well - known sites including Fark.com , the Stile Project , Weekly World News and Maxim Online .
People have used the images for Halloween costumes and even on protest signs in London before the Iraq war .
The term " wgirls " was so prevelant that porn sites were using the term to attract search engine traffic .

At a global conference in Bonn , Germany , representatives of 191 nations are discussing a revolution in conservation .
By making a highly profitable business out of saving forests , whales and coral reefs , environmentalists hope to put a stop to a dramatic wave of extinctions .
Activists Fight to Have Chimpanzee Declared Human
Animal rights activists in Vienna are fighting to have a 26 - year - old chimpanzee named Matthew declared human .
36 - year - old British teacher Paula Stibbe wants to be appointed Matthew 's legal guardian in case the animal shelter he lives in shuts down , however , under Austrian law , legal guardianship is limited to humans .
Matthew , along with another chimpanzee and a crocodile , is being cared for by an animal shelter that requires $ 8000 a month in donations .
Donors have been trying to support the chimp , but the law also only allows humans to receive personal gifts .
According to Stibbe , “ Everybody who knows him personally will see him as a person . ”
Ummm , yeah , I do n't think so .
I 'm sure Darwin is smiling in his grave .

Honda claims the FCX Clarity will help cut pollution and fuel wastage Japanese car manufacturer Honda has begun the first commercial production of a zero-emission , hydrogen fuel - cell powered vehicle .
The four - seater , called FCX Clarity , runs on electricity produced by combining hydrogen with oxygen , and emits water vapour .
Honda claims the vehicle offers three times better fuel efficiency than a traditional , petrol - powered car .
Honda plans to produce 200 of the cars over the next three years .
One of the biggest obstacles standing in the way of wider adoption of fuel - cell vehicles is the lack of hydrogen fuelling stations .
This is an important day in the history of fuel - cell vehicle technology
John Mendel , executive vice president of American Honda Critics also point out that hydrogen is costly to produce and the most common way to produce hydrogen is still from fossil fuels .
Analysis of the environmental impact of different fuel technologies has shown that the overall carbon dioxide emissions from hydrogen powered cars can be higher than that from petrol or diesel - powered vehicles .
' Monumental step '
The first five customers are all based in southern California because of the proximity of hydrogen fuelling stations , Honda said .

Advertisement US actress Jamie Lee Curtis will be among the first to take delivery of the vehicle , the firm added .
The car will initially be available for lease rather than purchase in California , starting in July , and then in Japan later this year .
It is being built on the world 's first dedicated production line for fuel - cell vehicles in Japan .
" This is an important day in the history of fuel - cell vehicle technology and a monumental step closer to the day when fuel - cell cars will be part of the mainstream , " said John Mendel , executive vice president of American Honda .
How the technology works Honda says it expects to lease a few dozen units in the US and Japan in 2008 , and about 200 units within three years .
It said the cost of the car , on a three - year lease , would be $ 600 ( £ 300 ) a month .
The FCX Clarity is based on Honda 's first - generation hydrogen fuel - cell vehicle , the FCX concept car .
Honda delivered around 34 of these cars , mainly in the US , of which 10 remain in use .
Booming demand Many car makers are developing cleaner , more economical vehicles because of high fuel prices and as consumers become more concerned with the environment .
Toyota said it was struggling to keep up with booming demand for its hybrid vehicles because it was unable to make enough batteries .
Hybrid vehicles , such as Toyota 's top- selling Prius , switch between a petrol engine and electric motor .
Toyota Motor Corp 's executive vice president , Takeshi Uchiyamada , told the Associated Press that new battery production lines could not be added until next year .
" Hybrids are selling so well we are doing all we can to increase production , " he said .
" We need new lines . "
Volkswagen , Europe 's biggest car maker said on Monday it wanted to produce a Golf which consumed three to four litres of petrol per 100 kilometres compared with 4.3 litres currently for the most fuel - efficient model .
" In the next few years , we are not going to do without petrol and diesel motors , but the future belongs to the electric car , " VW chairman Martin Winterkorn told German newspaper Bild - Zeitung .
HOW A HYDROGEN ( PROTON EXCHANGE ) FUEL CELL WORKS 1 Hydrogen : Constantly pumped in at negative terminal 2 Oxygen : Pumped in at opposite positive terminal 3 Catalyst : Helps electrons break free from hydrogen atoms 4 Membrane : Allows hydrogen ions through but blocks electrons 5 Circuit : Electrons flow through circuit to positive terminal 6 Electrons and hydrogen ions combine with oxygen , forming water

Former Governor Jesse Ventura went further in his 9/11 skepticism than ever before today when he told the Howard Stern Show of his fear that elements of the U.S. government carried out the attack , stating , “ I hate to fear …. that we possibly did it to ourselves . ”
“ There ’s a lot of very difficult questions that have not been answered and no one seems to want to provide any answers , ” Ventura told Stern , adding that the most prescient was , “ That a third building could fall into its own footprint five hours later having not been struck by much of anything ….
the 9/11 Commission did n’t even address the issue .
Pressed by Stern as to what he thought had happened , Ventura stated , “ I hate to fear what could have happened that possibly we did it to ourselves , ” to which Stern responded “ you ’re kidding me ” .
Ventura explained that he worked in demolitions when he was in the Navy and questioned how the buildings could fall at the rate of gravity .
The former Governor countered skepticism on behalf of Stern and his co-hosts by pointing out that the WTC towers were built to withstand a jetliner impact .
Stern said it was “ unthinkable ” that our own government could have perpetrated the attack , to which Ventura reasoned , “ Nothing is unthinkable – you ’re talking about power , you ’re talking about foreign policy changing over this event , you ’re talking about getting control over the middle eastern oil . ”
Stern ’s co-host then attempted to throw Ventura by asserting that Bush could not be capable of organizing the attack , to which Ventura responded , “ I do n’t know if he is , but I certainly think there are people capable of doing it . ”
Ventura then pointed out that kerosene does not burn hot enough to melt steel girders and asked why the buildings came down as powder and not in big chunks .
Stern ’s co-host regurgitated the tired old debunker line of claiming the steel weakened and sagged , causing the building to collapse .
“ OK if that ’s the case , if you use that analogy , then when you go camping and use a propane stove , which propane burns hotter than kerosene does , if you leave it on for two hours and you put a big can of beans on your grill , should n’t the grill collapse ? ” asked Ventura .
“ This is crazy ! ” exclaimed Stern , without explaining why Ventura ’s citation of basic physics had Stern and his team so baffled .
“ These two buildings were white elephants , they were losing money , they had asbestos in them , and they were being required by law to do over a billion dollars worth of asbestos removal , ” said Ventura , pointing out that WTC leaseholder Larry Silverstein made $ 7 billion dollars from his insurance claim after the attacks .
Ventura first went public with his questions about 9/11 during an on camera interview with Alex Jones in June 2006 .
He expanded on his thoughts during two subsequent radio interviews in April and May of this year .

Laika was a Russian space dog that was the first earthling to enter orbit in 1957 .
An unspoken hero in the planet ’s space program was honored with a monument recently in Moscow .
Laika was a stray dog found on the streets of Moscow , and was chosen from a group of dogs for resiliency and good nature to be the occupant of the Soviet spacecraft Sputnik 2 to be launched into space on November 3rd , 1957 .
Since there was no way to design a re-entry vehicle in time for the launch , the flight meant a certain death .
Laika died of overheating and panic during the first few hours of flight .
Russia have unvieled a monument for Laika recently , to mark the 50th anniversary of the canine ’s flight .
The monument is located near the Russian Defense Ministry ’s State Military Medicine Scientific Research Institute where the dog was prepared for its historic flight .
There is a loosely factually based graphic novel , Laika , that gives a touching story of the dogs life .
Written by Nick Abadzis , the artistry and flow of the graphic novel breathes life into the noble , yet tragic , life of Laika .
That ’s what the hate speech debate is about .
You must decide whether or not you believe in the rights of the one to speak out against the many – whether you believe in the right of the minority to have a different view , or not .
It is unlikely that you will admire the broader philosophies of both of these men .
But it is possible to admire their bravery – their willingness to stand alone before a crowd and say , you ’re wrong , and I , alone , will tell you why .
But he went down to Wembley anyway .
And he got arrested , anyway .
The first person to speak out in his defence was Peter Tatchell , the gay rights campaigner .
Tatchell said , I find his views repugnant .
But next week , I ’m going down to Wembley .
They ’re holding a massive rally for the most fundamentalist Islamic clerics they can find .
And I want to go down with my sign that says “ Islam kills queers . ”
If they arrest him , they ’re going to arrest me .
There was a man called Harry Hammond once .
He was a Christian Evangelical .
He used to go to Gay Pride marches and hold up a sign saying “ homosexuality is wrong ” .
“ Sodomy is evil ” .
He got arrested for committing a breach of the peace .
As I read the fascinating debate provoked by Peter Cuthbertson 's post about the PCSO who apparently told two Christians that they could n't promote Christianity in a " Muslim area " , it seemed to me that this was n't just a debate about religion , but also about the concept of hate speech .
It is always going to be the minority view , because the majority ’s view will never be classified as hate speech .
I believe that part of the job of democracy is to protect the minority against they tyranny of the majority .
It ’s important to say that , just like the Christians handing out Bible extracts in the so - called " Muslim area , " neither Hammond nor Tatchell presented any kind of threat to those against whom they were protesting .
They were simply presenting ideas that others did n’t like .
And they got shut down .
Is that what you want to happen to ideas ?
As shown by the Hammond and Tatchell examples , that happens under the status quo .
How much worse do you think ideas will be treated with hate speech laws ?
If you think that someone ’s ideas are wrong , if you think they are repugnant and obviously beyond the pale , then you should argue against them .
In the marketplace of ideas , if they really are repugnant and wrong , you ’ll win .
The proper remedy for the delivery of someone ’s speech , which you think or know to be wrong , is the exercise of your own right to free speech – not the limitation of theirs .
Think about what happens if we do n’t take that approach .
If , rather than listen and then confront , you just get to shut down the debate by having the person carted away or silenced , then you may like it – for as long as your views , your ideas , are the ones not being trampled on .
To protect your freedom of speech , it ’s necessary to protect everyone ’s freedom of speech – even those whom you find unsettling or unpleasant .
We need to preserve the right to shock and offend .
Apart from anything else , often it is the shocking and offensive notion that on reflection and debate and struggle emerges as the truth .
Think of those who first said to their scandalised peers , you know , I think that women should have the right to vote .
Shocking .
Offensive .
Published .
Debated .
Vindicated .
So the right to free speech must necessarily protect repugnant speech .
That ’s not to say that people can say anything they like – we already have laws against incitement to violence .
But hate speech laws go further .
They are about stopping the expression of certain ideas per se and that ’s wrong .
What kind of majority system requires special protection from the minority even from saying that they disagree ?
What virtue can be ascribed to a system that ca n’t stand up to minority criticism ?
Every so often an idea will emerge that , through the fire of testing in the battle of ideas , will be of some use to society .
As I picture Peter Tatchell , alone , representing no threat to anyone , being dragged away by the police , away from an enormous group of people , his sign dangling in his hand , I find myself convinced that he had won .
And I prefer to have the potential danger of an extremist , minority fringe with whom we can argue , to the certainty of an over - powerful state with which we cannot .
What Exactly Concerns Us About Gas Prices ?
There ’s no doubt that Americans are currently frustrated by high gas prices .
And certainly many voters believe that “ something oughta be done about it . ”
But why ?
Here ’s a simple taxonomy of concerns :
1. Relative prices :
Are people frustrated that a gallon of gas now requires more foregone “ stuff . ”
Or alternatively phrased , are they concerned about the low relative price of “ stuff ” ?
Stated this way , it sounds a bit odd that we are so upset that the benefit of giving up one more gallon of gas is now a heckuva lot more stuff .
( Indeed , environmentalists should be thrilled . )
2. Absolute prices :
Are people concerned about the change in the absolute average price level ?
The consumer price index is currently 216.632 ; is this too high ?
If so , what is the right average price level ?
3. Real wages :
Is the real concern about the average price level relative to ( nominal ) incomes ?
That is , if the average price level rises but our money incomes stay the same , we tend to cut back on both gas and “ stuff . ”
If so , I have some good news : money income typically rises roughly in tandem with the average price level , keeping the real wage constant .
And if you think the current episode will be an exception to this rule , then are your concerns about the gas market or the labor market — and does this change what “ oughta be done ” ?
4. Inflation :
There are also concerns about the rate of change of gas prices ( # 2 is about the level , not the change ) and how this may impact inflation .
However while gasoline and oil futures markets suggest that current high prices are here to stay , they are n’t expected to continue rising .
5. Reallocative costs of changes in relative prices :
In the long run we will learn that a Pruis does as good a job at getting you to work as a Hummer and at a much lower cost .
But in the short run , it will be expensive to shut down Hummer production and expand Prius production .
6. Redistribution due to changes in relative prices :
It is unsurprising that the loudest gas - price whining is coming from those in the exurbs whose house prices have fallen due to higher commuting costs .
But what is missing here is the urban homeowners who have simply kept quiet about their gains .
In many cases one group ’s losses are roughly offset by another group ’s gains .
# 4 is the focus of discussion by serious macroeconomists , although inflationary concerns should not be overstated ; # 5 is important , but in popular discussions it gets too easily confounded with # 3 and # 6 .
And because we rarely see pictures of workers enjoying their compensatory cost - of - living wage rises or investors in urban housing or green companies rejoicing that their investments have paid off , too often we focus only on the losses but miss the gains .
My favorite is a behavioral variant of # 3 : wages will probably continue to rise in line with the average price level , but when each of us gets our wage rise , we think that this is a reward for our hard work and not something as trivial as a cost - of - living adjustment .
So each year we think that our employer realizes we are ever more brilliant , even as rising gas prices steal more from our paychecks .
But workers should be tipped off that it is n’t just a coincidence that each year these two forces tend to balance out .
( More : see Shafir , Diamond , and Tversky . )
This leads me to think that we are over - emphasizing the importance of high gas prices .
What have I missed ?
And what exactly worries you about current high gas prices ?

Is Web 2.0 headed for Bubble 2.0 ?
That was the subject of debate at the TiECON East Confernece .
Fred Wilson ( Unionsquare Ventures ) , Don Dodge ( Microsoft ) , Nabeel Hyatt ( Conduit Labs ) , and Brian Balfour ( Viximo ) had a lively debate and arrived at very different conclusions .
All booms go bust - Business runs in cycles .
All big booms have been followed by painful busts .
The market is ruled by two things ; fear and greed .
Greed fuels the boom , and fear prolongs the bust .
Fear is very powerful .
Everyone starts to question their own beliefs .
But , fear is temporary , greed is permanent .
We have all pretty much forgotten the Dot Com Bubble .
Greed and optimism always overcome fear and lead a new economic boom .
Hundreds of smaller successes - Fred Wilson believes there will be hundreds of companies with smaller successes , not a few billion dollar successes .
Facebook and MySpace get all the headlines but hundreds of smaller companies with $ 50 M in revenue and $ 20 M in profit will be successful .
But , will VCs invest in these companies ?
Lots of VCs look at Web 2.0 companies and say " I like the concept , and I like the team , I 'm just not convinced it will generate VC level returns at exit . "
Capital efficiency matters - Web 2.0 companies can be launched for far less money than ever before .
Many do n't take VC money at all .
The point is that capital requirements and operating cost structure must be commensurate with the opportunity .
Is advertising the only revenue model ? -
Too many startups point to Google and Facebook as evidence that advertising is the best path to success .
They fail to understand the scale ( users and page views ) required to make it work .
Most social network sites generate CPMs of $ 0.40 or less .
To generate $ 1 M in ad revenue would require 2.5 Billion page views .
Not many sites attain that scale .
Freemium Model -
Free services like Flickr , TypePad , and others provide a free service with premium upgrades for more storage , more features , or other services .
This model works as long as the marginal cost of providing the service is close to zero .
Conversions from free to paid run about 3 % to 5 % , so the revenue from paid subscribers must cover the cost of all the free service plus provide a profit .
Think of the cost of free service as marketing costs ... and make sure it fits your business model .
Virtual or Digital Goods -
The cost of goods and distribution costs of digital / virtual goods is almost zero .
Ringtones , avatars , icons , virtual flowers , widgets , virtual cards , and lots of other products are producing big revenues ( and profits ) for web companies .
Socializing online is similar to real life .
We want the same sorts of fun , impulse items , and entertainment online , and we are willing to pay a few bucks for them .
The gross profit on these impulse items is huge .
New models ?-
Social networks and word of mouth recommendations are powerful .
All the demographic data , ratings , attention data , profiles , and social connections will enable new ways to target advertising and ecommerce .
Advertising is annoying when it is irrelevant , but very helpful when it is timely and relevant .
Facebook 's Beacon attempted to leverage the social network and user intentions into a new advertising and revenue model .
It did n't work , but something like it will emerge that strikes the right balance between privacy and convenience .
Being able to selectively opt - in or out is critically important .
One panelist said " Privacy does n't matter anymore .
If it did , Facebook , MySpace , and YouTube would n't exist .
This is the " Full Monty " generation . "
The trend is certainly in that direction , but the Facebook Beacon experience suggests we are n't there yet .
Conclusions ?-
Web 2.0 and social networks have already changed the way we interact on the Internet .
There have been some successes like Facebook , MySpace , and YouTube , but future successes are likely to be smaller .
Valuations and expectations are reaching " bubble levels " .
New revenue models will emerge that leverage our social interactions .
Most business cycles run for 10 years , and we are in the early stages of this social network cycle .
MacroMyopia , the tendency to overestimate the short term impact , and underestimate the long term results , is evident today .
It is similar to the hype cycle ; a period of early hype , followed by disillusionment , followed by real payoffs and impact .
It happens in every business cycle .
The question is , where are we now in the cycle ?
UPDATE : I got fooled .
This first turned up on April 1st .
Thanks to the many ( gleeful ) comments for pointing out my mistake .
And also thanks to Think Secret for keeping to the spirit of April Fools Day by keeping the post up for three extra days .
The pun-tastically named PTeq is a USB pregnancy testing kit .
And yes , you pee on it and then shove it into a USB port .
If you manage not to short out the computer with this electronic Wet Willy , the dongle starts its analyses , using electrospray ionization and mass spectrometry to tease out the various hormones in the urine .
Why is this better than the standard pee- on - a - stick method ?
Well , it claims to be slightly more accurate , and of course , because it is USB powered , you get glowing lights and software to display the results on your computer screen .
The PTeq is $ 18 and comes with 20 test strips .
The software will work on almost any flavor of Windows , Mac or Linux , which is our cue for some fun Friday stereotyping .
Windows users , unlike Mac users , are used to using protection , so they wo n't need the PTeq .
Mac
Users will buy this because it is cute and white .
And Linux users , as we know , do n't get any .

A group of schoolgirls in the Massachusetts fishing town of Gloucester made a pact to get pregnant and raise their babies together , a report said .
Time magazine reported that 17 girls at Gloucester High School are expecting babies - " more than four times the number of pregnancies the 1200 - student school had last year " .
" Nearly half the expecting students , none older than 16 , confessed to making a pact to get pregnant and raise their babies together , " Joseph Sullivan , principal of the high school in the fishing and beach town told Time .
But Ms Tieger said she had " no idea about the politics " when she bought the scarf at the Tree Of Life store .
" I thought it was a nice scarf , a cowboy scarf .
I thought : ' It 's black and white , no - one will say anything to me because that 's all we can wear [ with our work uniform ] ' .
" A Palestinian customer came up and asked me if I 'm wearing this scarf as a fashion statement or for political reasons .
" I had no idea what he was talking about because I do n't follow politics at all .
I just laughed it off .
" Two days later he called and complained about it . "
Shevonne Hunt , a freelance journalist who has reported on the keffiyeh 's popularity in Australia , said many Palestinians were annoyed the widespread use of the keffiyeh for fashion had watered down its meaning .
Ms Tieger continued : " A few days after that , I wore the scarf again .
A few customers started to complain who were Jewish ; there 's a lot of Jewish people in the area .
" My boss said ' Could you please take it off , we have to be neutral ' . "
After allegedly explaining she was wearing the scarf for style reasons only , Ms Tieger said her manager told her : " You should n't be wearing it , not here . "
" I said : " They 're selling it everywhere , there 's no escape . " '
The incident upset Ms Tieger and she started crying .
Kemeny 's groceries manager Alex Hoffman said Ms Tieger had not been bullied .
" That 's just total nonsense , " he said .
He said Ms Tieger had been asked " politely to take the scarf off " after a regular customer took offence to it .
" They came in and complained to her about the scarf because it had some religious significance to them .
" We approached [ Ms Tieger ] and raised the matter with her and asked her if she was aware [ the scarf could represent a political symbol ] and she said : ' What 's the big deal ? ' .
" She used the argument that it was a fashion item .
" So we did n't know what reason she was wearing it for .
I even asked her if she had a cold because if she did , we might re-consider it .
But she said no . "
Mr Hoffman said Ms Tieger had become emotional about the request very quickly .
" We find the notion quite silly because it evolved from nothing . "
Ms Tieger was working at the store today , but Mr Hoffman said he had not spoken to her about the incident today .
" It 's quite awkward , " Ms Tieger said .
" This is a very stressful job for a casual , " the university biotechnology student said .
She now only wears the contentious scarf indoors , she said .
" It 's in my drawer , I feel very uncomfortable wearing it now , I do n't wear it on the street anymore . "
US commentator Michelle Malkin described the scarf 's use in the Dunkin ' Donuts ad as " clueless sporting of a jihadi chic keffiyeh " .
" Anti-American fashion designers abroad and at home have mainstreamed and adapted the scarves as generic pro-Palestinian jihad or anti-war statements .
" Yet many folks out there remain completely oblivious to the apparel 's violent symbolism and anti-Israel overtones . "
NSW Jewish Board of Deputies CEO Vic Alhadeff said the wearing of the keffiyeh as a fashion item was a " non-issue " .
" It 's a non-issue as far as we are concerned .
If someone chooses to wear such an item for whatever reason that 's their choice . "
" Unless Tom DeLay proves me wrong .... "

The other day , Tom DeLay - you remember him ?
former House Majority Leader , long - time pal of Jack Abramoff , forced to resign when he was indicted for money laundering and conspiracy ?
- had this to say about Barack Obama :
I have said publicly , and I will again , that unless he proves me wrong , he is a Marxist .
Now , I think you 'd probably agree with me that the first question we should ask is - why is somebody under indictment and awaiting trial being given a platform by a national radio show to say anything ?
But that 's because we still believe that probable criminals ( and , to be fair , he has n't been convicted - yet ) should n't be trying to taint the jury pool .
Of course , there 's that old stand - by rule - It 's OK If You 're A Republican .
Let 's set that aside for now , however .
Since Mr. DeLay has set the standard for making claims about Mr. Obama , it must now be acceptable to make similar claims about Republicans .
Have some fun - Aristocrats - style !
" Unless they prove me wrong , Tom DeLay , Rick Santorum and Karl Rove keep a secret love - nest just off K Street in which they engage in goat - blowing sessions while watching the secret videos of George HW Bush in basque and stilletto heels whipping a bound and ball - gagged Ronald Reagan . "
If this information proves to be incorrect , I will be happy to provide a full retraction and apology .

About author
The author is currently under - employed , over - worked and wishing that he could wake up from the national nightmare that is laughingly called the George W. Bush administration .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama on Thursday said he had grown up in less privileged circumstances than his rivals as he fought a perception among some voters that he is “ elitist . ”
In an interview on NBC ’s “ Today Show , ” Obama sought to explain a series of missteps that have dogged his candidacy over the past month and led some voters to conclude that he is out of touch .
“ The irony is , I think it is fair to say that both Michelle and I grew up in much less privileged circumstances than either of my two potential opponents , ” Obama said in an interview with his wife , Michelle , at his side .
Obama ’s Kenyan father was largely absent from his life as a child , and his mother raised him with the help of his grandparents .
His rival for the Democratic nomination , Hillary Clinton , grew up in an affluent suburb of Chicago as the daughter of a small - business owner .
The Republican candidate for the November presidential election , John McCain , is the son and grandson of Navy admirals .
Obama ’s front - runner status for the Democratic nomination has eroded in recent weeks amid a firestorm over racially charged remarks by his former pastor and his own comments at a San Francisco fund - raiser that small - town voters are “ bitter ” and “ cling ” to guns and religion .
“ The comments I made in San Francisco at the end of a very long day were very poorly phrased , ” Obama said .
“ I should have said ‘ angry and frustrated ’ instead of ‘ bitter . ’
I should have said , people ‘ rely on ’ their religious faith during these times of trouble , instead of ‘ cling to . ’”
Obama said he did not immediately denounce his former pastor , Rev. Jeremiah Wright , when his incendiary comments were first made public because of his personal ties to the man who presided over his marriage and the baptism of his two children .
“ I thought it was important to give him the benefit of the doubt because if I had wanted to be politically expedient I would have distanced myself and denounced him right away , ” Obama said .
Obama said the criticism is inevitable , given his international background and status as the first black who has a good chance of winning the White House .
“ Let ’s be honest , here I am an African American named Barack Obama who ’s running for president .
I mean , that ’s a leap for folks , ” he said .

The suicide of a man who was forcibly returned to China by Australian immigration authorities has prompted calls by refugee advocates for better treatment of people seeking protection visas .
The man , known as Mr Zhang , was beaten and tortured when he was deported to China a year ago .
He spent almost a decade arguing his case for asylum , repeatedly telling Australian authorities he was at risk because of his involvement with pro-democracy groups in China .
His last two years were spent in Sydney 's Villawood immigration detention centre .
But immigration advocates say that after being denied asylum on numerous occasions , in the end he lost hope and committed suicide .
When he spoke to the ABC 's AM program just over a year ago Mr Zhang described how he was beaten up and tortured by Chinese police after being deported from Australia .
" And the two PSB ( Public Safety Bureau ) police men , they pushed me down on the ground , One PSB stamped on me and one , my hand , was broken , the left hand my middle finger , " Mr Zhang said at the time through an interpreter .
Refugee advocate Frances Milne worked on Mr Zhang 's case and kept in touch with him after he was deported .
" To find that he has now committed suicide to avoid further persecution and torture is very , very disappointing and upsetting , " Ms Milne said .
She says numerous letters sent on Mr Zhang 's behalf to both the present Immigration Minister , Senator Chris Evans , and his predecessor , Kevin Andrews , seem to have been ignored .
" If there is any decency in our government then having a policy of giving protection to people that we 've wrongly determined not to be refugees is absolutely crucial .
They must do it , " she said .
Evans concerned
Senator Evans says he will be seeking more information on the fate of Mr Zhang .
" It sounds quite tragic , but as to the circumstances as to what occurred on his return I have no information on that , " he said .
" The immigration system relies on us being able to remove people who are not here legally if that 's warranted .
" Clearly when we do that , it 's under international law and on the understanding that they wo n't suffer persecution on their return .
" Any suggestion that someone has suffered persecution would be something that will be looked at quite seriously . "
Stephen Blanks from the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties says Mr Zhang 's case is a tragic example of how the system is flawed .
" He was removed from Australia in breach of Australia 's obligations under the Convention Against Torture , " he said .
" He immediately faced torture on his return to China and evidence of that was presented to the Australian Government and we have been pleading with the Australian Government to find a way to bring him back and there has just been inaction . "
Mr Blanks says there has been improvement with the present Government but some areas need reform .
" Addressing the big issue policy issues like detention centres and TPVs ( temporary protection visas ) is only part of the story , " he said .
" There must be wholesale change to the immigration system to give asylum seekers proper access to justice . "
A spokesman for the Immigration Department says it regrets that Mr Zhang may have committed suicide but that it would not comment on details of his case .

Ex -NYT correspondent : FISA update is ' giant step toward fascism '

For more than 20 years , Chris Hedges reported from around the globe as a foreign correspondent for the New York Times and other outlets , working from countries with little to no respect for a free and independent press , where his phone was bugged and he was trailed by government agents to prevent dissidents and whistle - blowers from speaking to him .
Now , with the adoption of a sweeping new surveillance law , the United States may become one of those countries , Hedges says .
Hedges is one of more than a dozen plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the US government brought by the American Civil Liberties Union that seeks to scuttle an update to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act signed by President Bush Thursday .
The ACLU says the FISA update allows the government to engage in massive , unconstitutional dragnet surveillance of Americans ' phone calls and e-mails with anyone abroad .
During a conference call Thursday , Hedges recounted his work in foreign countries like the former Yugoslavia and El Salvador where his phone was bugged and government agents regularly followed him to prevent critics from speaking out .
Now the same thing is beginning to happen here , he said .
" I have little doubt the passing of this FISA law essentially brings that type of surveillance system and the effectiveness of that system to the United States , " he said .
According to the ACLU , the Democratic - controlled Congress has handed Bush a gift - wrapped grant of new domestic spying authority .
The group says its lawsuit is perhaps the last chance to sustain Americans ' confidence that a government snoop is n't listening in on every one of their international calls .
" This lawsuit is the ACLU at its best , " said journalist and author Naomi Klein , another plaintiff in the suit .
" It 's defending the law even when the lawmakers won 't "
The ACLU is representing journalists , human rights activists , lawyers and others whose jobs are likely to put them in contact with people overseas .
Klein and Hedges said the already - difficult task of gathering information from dissidents and whistle - blowers in the US and abroad would be made even more difficult with the draconian rules and lax oversight governing surveillance inherent in the FISA update .
Wiretap suspicion silenced whistle - blower on alleged Iran showdown Hedges , who now writes books and currently contributes to The Nation and other publications , recalled receiving a tip about an alleged confrontation between a US Navy warship and an Iranian military vessel in Iranian waters that nearly escalated into an act of war .
Hedges said he was given the name of a US Navy source who supposedly had witnessed the event .
When he reached out to the official , Hedges was asked to provide assurances that he was n't being monitored , which he could n't provide , he said , because of his frequent contact with sources overseas .
The source immediately cut off communication , the reporter was never able to confirm the story .
Hedges did n't know for sure that he was being monitored , but he could n't say for sure that he was n't .
The chilling effect of surveillance he had become so familiar with while reporting in foreign countries had now scuttled his work at home .
" With that gone we take a giant step toward fascism , " Hedges said during the call .
What 's the difference between the parameters of the just - passed law and the National Security Agency 's pre-existing ability to listen to foreigners ' phone calls abroad with no oversight ( ie , the NSA was always able to listen to calls , say , between Colombia and Venezuela without warrants ) ?
Hedges explained that the new law made it more easy for Americans to get caught up in the NSA 's dragnet if they make any calls abroad ; for example , he said , his Navy source was based in the US but still could not be assured that their conversations were not being monitored .
" It essentially obliterates what kinds of protections we had working within our own borders , " Hedges said in response to a question from RAW STORY .
The ACLU hopes the US District Court for the Southern District of New York will agree that the FISA update is unconstitutional and throw it out , forcing the nation 's spies , especially those at the National Security Agency , to revert to standards of the pre-update FISA law , which first passed in 1978 and has been modified several times over the years to account for technology changes .
The lawsuit argues that plaintiffs like Hedges and Klein along with organizations like Human Rights Watch , Amnesty International and the Service Employees International Union have suffered irreparable harm from the newest statute , which does not require the NSA to get individual court warrants before intercepting conversations between the US and another country , as long as they are not specifically targeting an American .
 The new law allows the mass acquisition of Americans  international e-mails and telephone calls ,  said Jameel Jaffer , Director of the ACLU 's National Security Project .
 The administration has argued that the law is necessary to address the threat of terrorism , but the truth is that the law sweeps much more broadly and implicates all kinds of communications that have nothing to do with terrorism or criminal activity of any kind . 
The ACLU introduced a similar lawsuit after the NSA 's warrantless wiretapping program became public in December 2005 .
President Bush said he authorized the super - secret agency to eavesdrop without court approval beginning after Sept. 11 , 2001 , in what he dubbed his " Terrorist Surveillance Program . "
The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals threw out that lawsuit on the grounds that the journalists , activists and lawyers the ACLU was representing that time around did not have standing to sue the government because they could not prove their communications were intercepted in the highly classified program .
The Supreme Court refused to hear the ACLU 's appeal in that case , essentially rendering the case moot .
This time around , the ACLU hopes to have a better shot because its suit is based on language within a public law , rather than a secret program whose details only emerged in news reports , Jaffer said during Thursday 's conference call .
Furthermore , the ACLU maintains that the Sixth Circuit was wrong in dismissing its case ; filing their latest case in New York , which is part of the Second Circuit , gives another court an opportunity to consider the FISA issues .
In addition to its District Court lawsuit , the ACLU also asked the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court , the secret body that considers FISA - related matters , to make any of its opinions on the scope , meaning or constitutionality of the new law as open to the public as possible .

A 31 year old file - sharer escaped prison this morning when he received a heavy fine and a suspended sentence for uploading music and movies .
The court refrained from putting the defendant in prison , saying that the music industry needs to take some responsibility for the current situation .
After a retrial , a 31 year old man from LinkÃ¶ping , Sweden , was found guilty this morning in the District Court .
The court decided that for uploading 4,500 music tracks and 30 movies with the filesharing application Direct Connect , the defendant should receive a heavy fine and a suspended prison sentence .
Initially the file - sharer had been accused of uploading around 23,000 music tracks , but Sweden ’s Anti-Piracy Agency ’s ( APB ) use of questionable investigative techniques forced the prosecutor to withdraw some of the charges .
In its verdict , the LinkÃ¶ping District Court decided that due to the large number of files involved in the case , handing out just fines was n’t enough , hence the suspended sentence .
This situation of sharing many thousands of files at once affects the BitTorrent user a lot less than those using other methods of sharing , which is probably why the music industry prefers to target users using ‘ folder sharing ’ clients , such as DirectConnect , LimeWire and KaZaA .
Thankfully , the court denied the prosecutor ’s request to have the man thrown in prison and said that this is “ a task for the government , that by legislative means or in other ways take the necessary actions ” to come to a solution to the problem .
In fact , the court implied that the reason it issued only a suspended sentence was because the copyright industry has to take some responsibility for the situation it finds itself in .
Although escaping prison would ’ve been his number one aim , the fine received by the file - sharer will hurt .
In Sweden there is a system of “ day fines ” that is regulated by how large an income the guilty party has .
In the case of day fines , two figures are given , for example ’ 40 day fines of 50 kronor ’ ( that is to say , 2000 kronor ) .
The first figure shows how seriously the court considers the offense ( culpability ) and the latter figure is determined depending on the accused ’s financial situation .
He was given 40 day fines , amounting to some 10000 kronor ( $ 1650 ) and must also pay the court costs of 44670 kronor ( $ 7360 ) .
Minister of Justice , Beatrice Ask , does n’t want to comment on whether she sees the sentence as positive or negative .
However , she commented on its effects :
“ A consequence of the court having increased the sanctions in this case is that it will be easier to make ISPs give out information on IP addresses [ in the future ] .
This of course affects the possibilities to act against these kinds of crimes . ”
Morgan Gerdin , acting for the defense says the sanctions are too severe : “ The District Court has n’t observed the technical evidence .
It is not possible from that evidence to conclude that my client has been filesharing .
He should have been found not guilty . ”
AntipiratbyrÃ¥n says the case is important : “ It is obvious that the court takes the scope of the infringement seriously , ” says Sara LindbÃ¤ck , a lawyer at Swedish Anti Pirate Bureau .
However , Magnus Eriksson , spokesperson for PiratbyrÃ¥n , does n’t see any significance at all in the verdict :
“ The outcome of the verdict is based on the amount of files shared by this person .
With more modern filesharing software [ BitTorrent ] , it is n’t possible to see all the files that one person is sharing . ”
He went on to say that most filesharers can continue their hobby without risking prosecution .
There were fears that a conviction in this case which resulted in prison time could open up the possibility that in the future , police could be allowed to search file - sharers ’ homes in pursuit of evidence , something forbidden up to now .
It remains unclear if a suspended sentence is enough to change the position .
In September 2007 , the defendant started a fund to cover the fines .
He has raised 7300 kronor so far .
Investigators said the price fixing affected goods worth billions of dollars
Five airlines have agreed to pay fines totalling $ 504 m ( £ 253 m ) for conspiring to fix prices for air cargo rates , the US Justice Department says .
The airlines include Air France and KLM , now operated by a single holding company , which is to pay $ 350m .
The other airlines involved are Cathay Pacific , Dutch airline Martinair and Scandinavia 's SAS .
The payments come after a wide - ranging inquiry into the air cargo industry by the department 's anti-trust division .
A statement by the department said the fine imposed on Air France - KLM was the second - highest levied in a criminal anti-trust prosecution to date .
Blow to consumers
During the period between 15 May 15 2001 and February 2006 , the airlines met and agreed cargo shipment rates and levied rates in accordance with those meetings .
" The airlines each engaged in a conspiracy to suppress and eliminate competition by fixing the cargo rates charged to customers for international air shipments , " the department said .
" The charged conduct affected billions of dollars of consumer and other goods - including produce , clothing , electronics and medicines - shipped by these airlines and their competitors in the air cargo industry . "
Ultimately , consumers paid higher prices as a result , the department said .
" When these companies and their co-conspirators got together and agreed to raise prices for air cargo shipments , American businesses and consumers ended up picking up the tab , " said Scott D Hammond , deputy assistant attorney general in charge of criminal enforcement for the department 's anti-trust division .
Fuel surcharges
The statement added that the airlines had agreed to co-operate with the Department of Justice investigation , which was continuing , and that the plea agreements were subject to approval by the US district court where the charges had been filed .
Of the other three airlines involved , Cathay has agreed to pay $ 60 m , Martinair $ 42 m and SAS $ 52 m .
The penalties are the latest in a series of fines arising from the Justice Department 's investigation into price - fixing in the air industry .
In August 2007 , British Airways was fined $ 300 m after admitting collusion in fixing the price of cargo rates for international air shipments and the rate of passenger fuel surcharges .
Other airlines , including Korean Air Lines , Qantas and JAL , have since suffered similar penalties .

StarCraft has earned extensive critical acclaim , including many " Game of the Year " awards .
Gamespot named it one of the " greatest games of all time . "
StarCraft 's expansion pack , Brood War , has also won multiple awards , proving itself to be one of the best expansion packs ever .
What are e-Sports ?
Electronic sports is a term that describes video games which are played at a competitive / professional level .
E -Sports have been around as long as gaming has , as a result of the competitive spirit that so many gamers possess .
And while e-Sports stayed small during the age of arcade games , technological advances in the last decade has led to a " boom " in competitive gaming .
The most prominent example of e-sports may be the professional StarCraft : Brood War leagues in South Korea .
Just how big is starcraft in South Korea ?

How big is StarCraft outside of South Korea ?
Outside of South Korea , the StarCraft scene has been limited .
While many people still play the game , the only country outside of South Korea that has had regular tournaments is China , and even there the professional scene is small compared to in South Korea .
Other than the World Cyber Games , there have been no regular tournaments or leagues for non-Koreans to compete in .
Without professional leagues to draw players together , there is little reason to devote the time and energy it takes to become a top player .
For this reason , the elite starcraft players have been almost exclusively South Korean .
It is rare to see a top foreign player beat a top South Korean player in a tournament ( though it does sometimes happen ) .
What makes StarCraft such a good spectator sport ?
Once you understand the basic game mechanics , it is very easy to follow what is happening in the game .
Competitive StarCraft games are like chess with more action and the more you learn about the game the more there is to appreciate .
StarCraft has the fast - paced action of FPS type games , but with very deep and intellectually - challenging strategy that comes with good RTS games .
And since it uses 2 - dimensional graphics instead of overly complex 3d graphics , it is much easier for less experienced observers to keep up with the action .
One of the greatest aspects of StarCraft is that it involves a level of strategy where an experienced watcher is able to notice the same great moves and tactics as an experienced player .
How is the game played ?
A multiplayer game of StarCraft can be played with 2 - 8 players , though for competitive purposes most games are one - on - one .
There are three races to pick from , each with different structures , units , and skills .
The variation in the races makes for a wide array of situations and strategies .
In tournaments , maps are decided beforehand , and top players tend to develop strategies that will work best on that map .
The basis of the game is to harvest resources , use the resources to expand your presence through both military type power and economic type power , and then to destroy your enemy .
Who is sponsoring the TSL ?
The TSL is being sponsored by Razer , and organized by TeamLiquid.net .
Cash prizes for the first season of the TSL total $ 10,000 .
What is Teamliquid.net ?

@ Hot_Bid on Twitter - ESPORTS life since 2010 - http://i.imgur.com/U2psw.png
Many Mac users from way back in the legacy era consider the old ADB Apple Extended Keyboard II to be the best keyboard Apple ever made .
Others of us might debate that , but the Extended Keyboard II was certainly the biggest , heaviest keyboard Apple ever made , covering a vast expanse of desktop and weighing in at a hulking 5 pounds .
It was considered a professional alternative to its lesser Apple Keyboard and Apple Keyboard II contemporaries – and to the truly mediocre AppleDesign Keyboard that succeeded them .
This was in turn superseded by the also somewhat mediocre ( but likable , IMHO ) Apple USB ‘ board that debuted with the original iMac and was also supplied even with the Blue & White G3 and early G4 Power Mac towers .
Direct comparison with these less - than - stellar ‘ boards helped reinforce the Apple Extended Keyboard II ’s legendary status .
Unlike the other keyboards mentioned above , which are membrane types , the Apple Extended Keyboard II had mechanical key switches that gave it a smooth and light , albeit hard - bottoming , action .
I like the soft landing and ( usually ) light touch and shorter key travel of membrane ‘ boards and think the current USB Apple Pro Keyboard is the best Apple keyboard ever , both esthetically and in terms of feel .
However , there are many folks who prefer the feel of mechanical key switches and like an IBM - style “ click ” in their keystrokes .
For this constituency , there ’s now a way to have all that , plus the white & crystal esthetics of modern Apple peripherals all in one modern , USB unit .
The Matias Tactile Pro USB Keyboard is hyped as the return of the Apple Extended Keyboard II in contemporary Apple - style livery .
“ The best keyboard Apple ever made rises again , ” it says on the box .
Does the claim have objective substance ?
This ‘ board may be even better in some aspects .
It ’s certainly better looking .
The original Extended Keyboard II presents a dull expanse of boring beige plastic .
The Tactile Pro , on the other hand , is much more compact without sacrificing functionality , and to my eyes it ’s very attractive in opaque white and crystal clear plastic with white keys .
In form factor and size , the Tactile Pro is actually closer in appearance to the Apple Keyboard II that was the entry - level Mac ADB keyboard prior to the introduction of the AppleDesign keyboard , and of course to today ’s Apple Pro USB keyboard .
Here ’s a comparison of dimensions :
Apple Keyboard II : 80 keys , 16 ″ x 6 ″
Matias Tactile Pro : 109 keys , 18 ″ x 6 - 1/2 ″
Apple Extended Keyboard II : 105 keys , 18 - 3/4 ″ x 7 - 3/4 ″
The Tactile Pro resembles the Keyboard II in having notched back corners with ports ( respectively USB and ADB ) for plugging in other peripherals , but it manages to include even more keys than the much larger Extended Keyboard II did – and it makes the key caps larger in the bargain , partly because the Tactile Pro is bigger than it looks .
With standard Eject and Volume control keys , the Tactile Pro keyboard has been designed to match the look and features of Apple ’s Pro Keyboard .
For full access to CD Eject and Power button features , you will need to download the Tactile Pro Driver Software ( Mac OS X only , 407 KB ) .
Num lock and caps lock are indicated by a thin green light when active .
The Tactile Pro’s key caps are labeled with the international characters , accents , punctuation , currency , and other symbols that are available by holding down the Option or Shift + Option keys .
Two fold down legs can elevate the back of the Tactile Pro about 3/4 ″ , and rubber pads back and front keep the keyboard from sliding around on the support surface .
As for the key switches themselves , Matias says that they are the same Alps mechanical units used in the Extended Keyboard II , but the action on my old Apple keyboard that I used for comparison is considerably smoother than that of the Tactile Pro.
Perhaps that ’s because the old keyboard switches are well worn in , but it pertains to the seldom - used keys as well as the heavily used ones .
Maybe
Alps switches are n’t quite the same as they used to be .
The Tactile Pro’s key switches are also significantly noisier than the ones on the Apple ‘ board , but since some people profess to like a clicking sound ( believe it or not , somebody makes a shareware application that simulates the sound of a keyboard clicking for folks to miss it with their quiet membrane ‘ boards ) that may not be a shortcoming , depending upon your noise tolerance .
The Tactile Pro’s key switches have the same relatively long travel as the ones on the Extended Keyboard II , and that is reflected in the thicker section of the Tactile Pro keyboard compared with today ’s slimmer ‘ boards like the Apple Pro or Macally iceKey .
The Matias Tactile Pro gives the impression of being ruggedly constructed out of top-quality materials and is covered by in impressive five - year warranty and 30 - day money - back guarantee .
The Matias Tactile Pro Keyboard for Mac sells for $ 99.95 , which is pricey as keyboards go these days , but if you like that vintage mechanical key switch feel , there are not many alternatives .
For another take on the Matias Tactile Pro , see Kirk Hiner ’s review on Applelinks .

A disgraced former New York hedge - fund manager has sparked a nationwide manhunt after apparently faking his own suicide on the day he was due to report to prison to begin a 20 - year sentence for fraud .
Samuel Israel III , a billionaire co-founder of the Bayou Group , is being sought by police after his car was found abandoned on the Bear Mountain Bridge in upstate New York with the words " suicide is painless " written into the dust on its bonnet .
The authorities said that no body had been found , and that they were keeping an " open mind " .
Mr Israel had been due to report to prison by 2 pm on Monday after being sentenced in April for his role in a scheme to cheat investors of $ 450 m ( £ 230 m ) .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Bruce Cuccia , a police investigator , said that no witnesses had seen anyone leave the vehicle or jump from the bridge , 40 miles north of New York .
CCTV footage was inconclusive .
Mr Israel had pleaded guilty in 2005 to charges of conspiracy and fraud .
The scandal involved announcing non-existent profits and providing fake audits for companies .
Bayou made millions in commission on trades that subsequently lost investors money .
Israel 's girlfriend , Debbie Ryan , told police he had left home at 9.30 am , saying he was going to prison .
The car was discovered three hours later , moments after it had apparently been left .
In 1969 , a large meteorite fell near the town of Murchison in Victoria , Australia .
Scientists collected more than 100 kilograms of rock , making it the largest sample of carbonaceous chondrite ever recovered .
Since then numerous groups have found evidence that the Murchison meteorite contains common amino acids , the building blocks of proteins , as well as nucleobases , the subunits from which nuclei acids such as DNA are formed .
But critics point out that its hardly surprising that a rock which has slammed into the Earth at warp drive velocity should end up covered in muck .
If you ’re going to make the claim that the these building blocks of life came from space , you ’ve got to prove it , they say .
Today , Zita Martins from Imperial College , London and a few pals say they ’ve found the first unambiguous evidence that this gloop really is extraterrestrial .
What they did was collect samples of one and two ring nucleobases called pyramidines and purines respectively and analyse the percentage of the carbon - 13 isotope they contain .
On Earth , carbon - 13 makes up about 1 per cent of naturally occuring carbon .
The compunds in the Murchison meteorite on the other hand contained as much as 44 per cent carbon - 13 .
That ’s about as good a signature of extraterrestrial origin as you can get .
The discovery has important implications for our understanding of how life must have evolved on Earth .
The best evidence is that pre-biotic compounds such as nucleobases could not have formed easily in the conditions that existed on the early Earth .
So where could it have come from ?
Hmmm…at that time ( about 4 billion years ago ) , the Earth was bombarded by about a billion tonnes of carbonaceous chondrite meteorite .
Does that look like a smoking gun or what ?

The world 's biggest cruise liner is to have a New York - style " Central Park " on the ship , its owners have revealed .
Royal Caribbean is building the 220,000 - tonne liner with the working name Project Genesis and the announcement is the latest salvo in the intensely competitive global cruise market .
The company said the park would be " a revolutionary design in which the centre of the ship opens to the sky and features lush , tropical grounds spanning the length of a football field " .

New York style :
The liner will have an outdoor area onboard supposedly modelled on Central Park
The 1,180ft long luxury liner is under construction in Finland at a cost of £ 700 million and dwarfs the current biggest ships - also owned by Royal Caribbean - which are 160,000 tonnes .
The builders said the space will be like a town square for al fresco dining and entertainment .
The park will be located on Deck 8 of the 16 deck ship and open to the sky , with dimensions of 62ft ( 19 m ) wide and 328ft ( 100 m ) long .
Trees in the park will tower more than two - and - a - half decks tall and the area is to have micro-climate control techniques to make sure the plants thrive .

World 's biggest :
The 220,000 - tonne cruise liner is being built by Royal Caribbean in Finland
Richard Fain , chairman and chief executive of Royal Caribbean , said : " This ship is a quantum leap in architecture and design and will deliver an unparalleled vacation experience to all who sail with us . "
Figures from the Passenger Shipping Association predict 1.55 million Britons are expected to take a cruise holiday in 2008 - up from 1.35 million last year .
Royal Caribbean will base one of its current biggest liners , Independence of the Seas , in Southampton from next month for its inaugural season .

Al fresco :
The outdoor area will have trees and plants and a special microclimate so that they thrive
P&O Cruises has responded with a new ship - the Ventura , which is named in Southampton tonight by Dame Helen Mirren , and Cunard recently launched the Queen Victoria - also based in Southampton .
The recent credit crunch does not seem to be affecting the industry as Royal Caribbean alone is pumping £ 1.4 billion into two Genesis class liners over the next few years .
When finished , Genesis will be able to carry 5,400 passengers and stood on its stern it would dwarf Britain 's tallest building - the 800ft One Canada Square in Canary Wharf .
It will be longer than four football pitches and 40 per cent bigger than the existing biggest liners .
It is scheduled to enter service in autumn 2009 and its home port will be Fort Lauderdale in Florida .

If you were to take the Earth ’s current age and represent it on a 24 - hour scale , the existence of humans would be indicated by roughly 30 - seconds of time .
That ’s it .
For all our hubris in celebrating our species rise above all others , we ’re certainly an anomaly in the scheme of things .
As indicated in the History Channel ’s fantastic new documentary , Life After People , those 30 - seconds of achievement can quickly be wiped away in less than half that time .
Last June , I wrote about a new book by Alan Weisman titled The World Without Us .
In it , Weisman breaks down step by step what would happen to civilization if we simply vanished from the face of the planet tomorrow .
For example , within about two days , New York City ’s subway system would be completely flooded .
Without power to keep the pumps running , the various tunnels and shafts would quickly fill by the region ’s displaced underground rivers .
What the History Channel has done is basically used Weisman ’s work as a script for a computer - generated look at the remaining vestiges of our society .
We go all the way from one day to 10,000 years into the future .
The visual effects used to represent the decay of our world and nature ’s reclamation is stunning .
As in the book , the film focuses in particular on New York City ( as all good disaster flicks might ) and does a great job of brining to life the various conceptual images that Scientific American presented to coincide with World Without Us .
What ’s pretty amazing is how far the show takes you — from the eventual collapse of the Eiffel Tower to NYC ’s skyscrapers being turned into vertical habitats , with some creatures never touching the ground in their lifetimes .
Finally , here ’s the most interesting / disturbing thought :
No matter what power humans may exert upon the Earth in terms of climate change / global warming , NYC will one day be covered once more in massive two - mile thick glaciers .
What force we do have in terms of affecting temperatures will only delay the inevitable that one day a good portion of our cities will be wiped by crushing ice .

Some people have a mutation that makes them amazingly resistant to HIV – and now , scientists may have found a way to give that immunity to anyone .
Viruses enter cells and take them over , but to get inside , they need a handhold .
HIV pulls itself in by grabbing onto a protein called CCR5 , which decorates the surface of T - cells , which are one of the two major types of white blood cells and play an important role in helping the body fight infections .
Back in the 1990's , researchers took interest in a handful of promiscuous gay men who were able to engage in sexual relations with their HIV - positive partners with impunity .
Most of them had a mutation that kept their cells from producing normal CCR5 protein .
Armed with that knowledge , scientists have developed several tactics to block the production of CCR5 or perturb its shape so that the HIV virus can't grab onto it during the first step of its hijacking attempt .
The strategy is much akin to cutting your hair before a wrestling match :
It gives your opponent one less thing to grab onto .
In the latest version of this defense , Carl June and his colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania used a highly engineered protein , called a zinc finger nuclease , to clip the CCR5 gene out of some T - cells .
Left without the recipe for that protein , the cells are nearly impenetrable .
His report appeared on the Nature Biotechnology website yesterday .
June tested the procedure on cultured T - cells and mice – not humans – so it should be a source of guarded optimism , because it 's not certain the technique would work in humans .
In theory , AIDS doctors could take some T - cells out of an infected person , edit their genomes , and stick them back into their patient .
Once they have returned to the body , each resistant cell will thrive and multiply in spite of the disease .
This trick would not eliminate the virus , but it might be able to permanently raise the T - cell counts of AIDS patients , increasing their ability to resist secondary infections and remain healthy .

The father of a toddler found wandering in Glendale on Sunday evening said he had left his daughter with a baby - sitter found on a popular Web site .
Shane Englehart , 25 , told Glendale police he had hired the baby - sitter on Craigslist , an online listing for a variety of services .
But Englehart told police that when he returned home , he found his apartment empty with no sign of the baby - sitter or his 2 1/2 - year - old daughter , police spokesman Jim Toomey said .
Toomey said police found Englehart 's statement credible .
He is not expected to face criminal charges .
A passer - by had found the child wandering unattended at an apartment complex near 63rd and Northern avenues , police said .
The girl was placed in custody of Child Protective Services as authorities continued to sort out the matter , Toomey said .
The case is a reminder that parents should ask for references of potential baby - sitters and check those references before hiring anyone , he said .
This is n’t a hypothetical worry .
From 2005 through 2007 alone  that is , at the peak of the housing bubble  more than 22 million Americans bought either new or existing houses .
Now that the bubble has burst , many of those homebuyers have lost heavily on their investment .
At this point there are probably around 10 million households with negative home equity  that is , with mortgages that exceed the value of their houses .
Owning a home also ties workers down .
Even in the best of times , the costs and hassle of selling one home and buying another  one estimate put the average cost of a house move at more than $ 60,000  tend to make workers reluctant to go where the jobs are .
And these are not the best of times .
Right now , economic distress is concentrated in the states with the biggest housing busts : Florida and California have experienced much steeper rises in unemployment than the nation as a whole .
Yet homeowners in these states are constrained from seeking opportunities elsewhere , because it ’s very hard to sell their houses .
Finally , there ’s the cost of commuting .
Buying a home usually though not always means buying a single - family house in the suburbs , often a long way out , where land is cheap .
In an age of $ 4 gas and concerns about climate change , that ’s an increasingly problematic choice .
There are , of course , advantages to homeownership  and yes , my wife and I do own our home .
But homeownership is n’t for everyone .
In fact , given the way U.S. policy favors owning over renting , you can make a good case that America already has too many homeowners .
O.K. , I know how some people will respond : anyone who questions the ideal of homeownership must want the population “ confined to Soviet - style concrete - block high - rises ” ( as a Bloomberg columnist recently put it ) .
Um , no .
All I ’m suggesting is that we drop the obsession with ownership , and try to level the playing field that , at the moment , is hugely tilted against renting .
And while we ’re at it , let ’s try to open our minds to the possibility that those who choose to rent rather than buy can still share in the American dream  and still have a stake in the nation ’s future .

Anatomy of Linux journaling file systems
Journaling today and tomorrow
You can define journaling file systems in many ways , but let 's get right to the point .
Journaling file systems are for people who tire of watching the boot - time fsck , or file system consistency check process .
( Journaling file systems are also for anyone who likes the idea of a fault - resilient file system . )
When a system using a traditional , non-journaling file system is improperly shut down , the operating system detects this and performs a consistency check using the fsck utility .
This utility scans the file system ( which can take a considerable amount of time ) and fixes any issues that can be safely corrected .
In some cases , the file system can be in such bad shape that the operating system boots into single user mode to allow the user to further the repair process .
Pronouncing fsck
To add insult to injury , the fsck process can be initiated automatically by the operating system at mount time to ensure that the file system metadata is correct ( even if no corruption is detected ) .
Therefore , removing the need for file system consistency checks is an obvious area for improvement .
So , now you know for whom journaling file systems were created , but how do they obviate the need for fsck ?
In general , journaling file systems avoid file system corruption by maintaining a journal .
The journal is a special file that logs the changes destined for the file system in a circular buffer .
At periodic intervals , the journal is committed to the file system .
If a crash occurs , the journal can be used as a checkpoint to recover unsaved information and avoid corrupting file system metadata .
To sum up , journaling file systems are fault - resilient file systems that use a journal to log changes before they 're committed to the file system to avoid metadata corruption ( see Figure 1 ) .
But like many Linux solutions , more than one option is available to you .
Let 's take a short walk through journaling file system history , and then review the file systems available and how they differ .
What is metadata ?
Metadata refers to the managing structures for data on a disk .
Metadata represents file creation and removal , directory creation and removal , growing a file , truncating a file , and so on .
Figure 1 .
A typical journaling file system
Linux journaling file system history
The first journaled file system was the IBM ® Journaled File System ( JFS ) .
JFS was first released in 1990 , but the current version supported in Linux is the later - developed JFS2 .
In 1994 , Silicon Graphics introduced the high - performance XFS for the IRIX operating system .
XFS was ported into Linux in 2001 .
The Smart File System ( SFS ) was developed for the Amiga in 1998 , but then released under the GNU Lesser General Public License ( LGPL ) and supported under Linux in 2005 .
The most commonly used journaling file system , ext3fs ( or third extended file system ) is an extension of ext2 with journaling capabilities .
The ext3fs has been supported in Linux since 2001 .
Finally , the ReiserFS journaling file system blazed many new trails when it was introduced and found wide adoption .
Its evolution is now diminished because of the legal issues of its original author .
Variations on journaling
Journaling file systems use a journal to buffer changes to the file system ( which is also used in crash recovery ) but can use different strategies for when and what is journaled .
Three of the most common strategies are writeback , ordered , and data .
In writeback mode , only the metadata is journaled , and the data blocks are written directly to their location on the disk .
This preserves the file system structure and avoids corruption , but data corruption can occur ( for example , if the system crashes after the metadata is journaled but before the data block is written ) .
To solve this problem , you can use ordered mode .
Ordered mode is metadata journaling only but writes the data before journaling the metadata .
In this way , data and file system are guaranteed consistent after a recovery .
Finally , data journaling can also be supported .
In data mode , both metadata and data are journaled .
This mode offers the greatest protection against file system corruption and data loss but can suffer from performance degradation , as all data is written twice ( first to the journal , then to the disk ) .
The journal commit policy can also differ in the various approaches .
For example , is the journal committed when it nears full , or through a timeout ?
Journaling file systems today
Today , several journaling file systems are actively used .
Each has its own benefits and disadvantages .
Here are the four most popular journaling file systems available today .
JFS2
JFS2 ( also called the enhanced journaled file system ) was the first journaled file system and has many years of use in the IBM AIX ® operating system before being ported to Linux .
JFS2 is a 64 - bit file system that , although based on the original JFS , was enhanced to be more scalable and support multi-processor architectures .
JFS2 supports ordered journaling for high performance with sub-second file system recovery .
JFS2 also provides extent - based file allocation for performance .
Extent - based allocation means that instead of allocating a single block , a contiguous set of blocks is allocated .
Because these blocks are contiguous on the disk , there 's better read and write performance for them .
An additional advantage to extent - based allocation is minimization of metadata management .
Allocating space by block means metadata updates per block .
Using an extent , metadata is only updated for the extent ( which can represent many blocks ) .
JFS2 also makes use of B + trees for fast directory lookups as well as managing extent descriptors .
JFS2 has no internal journal commit policy but instead relies on the timeout of the kupdate daemon .
XFS
XFS is one of the other early journaling file systems that was originally developed by Silicon Graphics for the IRIX operating system in 1995 .
XFS was ported to Linux in 2001 and , therefore , was already mature and reliable .
XFS supports full 64 - bit addressing and provides very high performance using B+ trees both for directories and for file allocation .
XFS also uses extent - based allocation with variable block size support ( from 512 bytes to 64KB ) .
Along with extents , XFS uses delayed allocation , in which allocation of disk blocks is delayed until the blocks are to be written to disk .
This functionality improves the chances that sequential disk blocks are allocated , because the total number needed will be known .
Other interesting properties of XFS are guaranteed rate input / output ( I / O — through bandwidth reservation for file system users ) and direct I/O , where data is copied directly between the disk and the user space buffer ( rather than being staged through multiple buffers ) .
XFS uses the writeback journaling policy .
Third extended file system ( ext3fs )
The third extended file system ( ext3fs ) is the most popular journaling file system and is the evolution of the popular ext2 file system .
Ext3fs is actually compatible with ext2fs , because ext3fs uses the same structure from ext2fs and simply adds a journal .
It 's even possible to mount an ext3fs partition as an ext2 file system or convert an ext2 file system to an ext3 file system ( using the tune2 fs utility ) .
Ext3fs permits three types of journaling ( writeback , ordered , and data ) but uses ordered as the default mode .
The journal commit policy is configurable but by default is based on filling 1/4 of the journal or through timeout of one of the commit timers .
One of the primary disadvantages of ext3fs is that it was not designed from the ground up as a journaling file system .
Being based on ext2fs , it lacks some of the more recent advanced features found in other journaling file systems ( such as extents ) .
It also typically scores worse in performance when compared to ReiserFS , JFS , and XFS but requires less CPU and memory than competing solutions .
ReiserFS
What is tail packing ?
In many cases , files exist whose size is less than the size of a logical block .
Rather than waste space allocating a logical block for each small file ( called a tail ) , multiple files are packed within a single logical block .
This has been found to increase disk space by 5 % over competing file systems ( with a performance penalty ) .
ReiserFS is a journaling file system that was developed from the ground up with journaling in mind .
ReiserFS was introduced in 2001 in the mainline 2.4 kernel ( the first journaling file system to be adopted by Linux ) .
The default method for journaling is ordered and supports online resizing to grow the file system .
ReiserFS also included tail packing to dynamically reduce fragmentation .
For smaller files , ReiserFS tends to be much faster than ext3fs ( when tail packing is enabled ) .
ReiserFS ( also called ReiserFS v3 ) includes many modern features , such as B+ trees .
The fundamental format of the file system is based on a single B+ tree , which makes search operations efficient and very scalable .
The commit policy depends on the journal size but is based on the number of blocks to commit .
ReiserFS was plagued by several issues — most recently , by the legal troubles of its author ( see Related topics for details ) .
Journaling file systems tomorrow
Now that you 've seen the journaling file systems of today ( and yesterday ) , let 's look at what 's ahead ( and what 's not ) .
Reiser4
After successfully getting ReiserFS merged into the Linux kernel and adopted by many Linux distributions , Namesys ( the company behind ReiserFS ) began work on a new journaling file system .
Reiser4 was designed from scratch as a new journaling file system with many advanced features .
Resier4 was designed for better journaling through the use of wandering logs and delayed allocation of blocks until the journal is committed ( as was done in XFS ) .
Reiser4 was also designed with a flexible plug - in architecture ( to support capabilities such as compression and encryption ) but was rejected by the Linux community , as these capabilities were viewed best in the virtual file system ( VFS ) .
Since the conviction of the owner of Namesys , all commercial activity on Reiser4 has stopped .
Fourth extended file system
The fourth extended journaling file system ( ext4fs ) is the evolution of ext3fs .
The ext4 file system is designed as a backward - and forward - compliant replacement for ext3fs but with many new advanced features ( some of which break the compatibility ) .
This means that you can mount an ext4fs partition as ext3fs or vice versa .
First , ext4fs is a 64 - bit file system and is designed to support very large volumes ( 1 exabyte ) .
It has also been designed to use extents , but if this is used , then compatibility with ext3fs is lost .
Like XFS and Reiser4 , ext4fs includes delayed allocation to allocate blocks on the disk only when needed ( which reduces fragmentation ) .
The contents of the journal are also checksummed to make the journal more reliable .
Instead of the standard B+ or B * tree , ext4fs uses a variation of the B tree , called the H tree , which allows much larger subdirectories ( ext3 was limited to 32KB ) .
Although the delayed allocation method reduces fragmentation , over time , a large file system can become fragmented .
An online defragmentation tool ( e4defrag ) has been developed to address this .
You can use the tool to defragment individual files or an entire file system .
Another interesting difference between ext3fs and ext4fs is the date resolution for files .
In ext3 , the minimum resolution for timestamp was one second .
Ext4fs is looking toward the future :
Where processor and interface speeds continue to increase , better resolution is needed .
For this reason , the minimum timestamp resolution in ext4 is 1 nanosecond .
Ext4fs has been in the Linux kernel since 2.6.19 but is yet to be called stable .
Development continues on this next generation ; given its heritage , it will be the next generation in Linux journaling file systems .
Going further
Journaling file systems provide reliability and protect against corruption in the face of system crash or power loss .
Additionally , the crash recovery time for journaling file systems is dramatically reduced compared to more traditional file system methods ( such as those that rely on fsck ) .
Development of new journaling capabilities continues to look to the future at new algorithms and structures as well as to the past , where features of JFS and XFS are incorporated .
How journaling file systems will evolve in the future is unclear , but their usefulness is clear , and they are the new file system standard .

When discussing the many adverse effects of religion with a Christian , one statement almost inevitably seems to enter the conversation : " But most Christians are good people . "
The Christian will surely acknowledge that many people have committed awful acts in the name of religion .
Perhaps they were n't " real Christians . "
Perhaps they were simply misguided in their actions .
Regardless of the reason , they are the exception and certainly not the norm .
You might expect that I , as an atheist , would disagree with this statement .
I do not .
I think that most Christians are indeed good people .
The point of this post is not to convince you that most Christians are good people .
My point here is to explain why reaching this conclusion presents no problems for atheists and to examine why the reverse does not seem to be the case .
That is , Christians seem to have real difficulty acknowledging the fact that most atheists are good people , something most atheists are able to acknowledge about Christians .
Saying that most Christians are good people poses no problem for the atheist .
As an atheist , there is no reason why I can't agree that most Christians are good people .
Atheism contains no dogma and certainly none that tells me I must condemn Christians for not being atheists .
Most Christians
I have met in my life have been kind , trustworthy , honorable individuals who treat others as they would like to be treated .
They have been my family , intimate partners , close friends , bosses , co-workers , neighbors , and so on .
These Christians do their best to live productive lives , and many are genuinely concerned about the plight of their neighbors .
Even though they may hold some beliefs I find strange , many care deeply about improving the world in which they live .
Of course , everything I just said applies equally to atheists and persons who are believers in other religious traditions .
Most atheists are good people .
Most Jews are good people .
Most Muslims are good people .
You get the idea .
Most people are good people , regardless of which religious tradition ( or lack thereof ) they accept .
Yes , I do recognize that what I said in the previous paragraph is not something with which all atheists will agree and that it is not part of atheism .
It fits much better with humanism .
While it is true that not all atheists are humanists , the point here is simply that neither atheism nor humanism presents the sort of obstacles that would prevent an atheist or a humanist from acknowledging that most Christians are good people .
Saying that most atheists are good people poses a problem for the Christian .
Unfortunately , many Christians cannot seem to agree that most atheists are good people without adding an important qualifier , at least implicitly .
The qualifier is comparative in nature , placing Christians on a pedestal above non-Christians .
The atheist may be a decent person , but he / she can not possibly be as good as the Christian .
The atheist or the person from a different religion may be good in some respects , but he / she is still going to hell to be punished for all eternity .
The Christian bible is quite clear that those of us who do not believe in the Christian god are not equivalent to those who do in many ways .
Their fate in the afterlife they imagine will be very different from ours .
This is an example of what I mean when I say that religion is inherently divisive .
Believers in any religious tradition are indoctrinated from an early age to believe that theirs is the one true faith .
That means that everybody else is necessarily wrong .
Their god beats all others .
Their morality trumps all others .
Their fellow believers are more worthy , deserving , etc. than everyone else .
Those who do not agree with them are deserving of severe and everlasting punishment .
As an atheist , I am not encumbered with this particular prejudice ( although I am certainly susceptible to others ) .
I am not sure there is any way around this for the Christian .
How might a Christian acknowledge that most atheists ( or other non-Christians ) are of equal moral worth without adding any qualifiers ?
Could one do so and still be considered a Christian ?
Could one do so without needing to walk away from much of what is contained in their " holy " book ?
While I recognize that many Christians manage to treat atheists and other non-Christians appropriately , it is not clear that they can truly view us as their moral equals without discarding much of their doctrine .
Claims about most Christians being good people have little relevance to the larger question about the costs of religion .
What some Christians fail to grasp is that claims that most Christians are good people have little relevance to the larger question about the dark side of religion .
The atheist can acknowledge that most Christians are good people while believing that Christianity itself is both irrational and harmful to humanity .
Religion does not make people good ( or bad ) .
It may at times inspire people to do great things ; it may at times bring out the worst sort of atrocities and foster irrationality .
As Steven Weinberg reminds us :
( Religion )
With or without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things .
But for good people to do evil things , that takes religion .
To understand why this is the case , one simply needs to consider the earlier point about religion being inherently divisive .
If I am taught to believe that people who do not share my beliefs are inferior , there is little to stop me from treating them accordingly .
If I am indoctrinated from birth to believe that persons with different beliefs are morally inferior , condemned to hell , diabolical , etc. , the door to atrocities opens wide .
If this indoctrination has also diminished my ability to apply reason by convincing me that faith is superior , look out .
Even if most Christians ( and other religious believers ) are good people , Christianity ( and other religions ) are still irrational .
They peddle falsehoods as profound truths .
Even if most Christians ( and other religious believers ) are good people , Christianity ( and other religions ) still cause irreparable harm .
And so , we can acknowledge that most religious believers are good people even as we work against organized religions .

Ambac and MBIA are world leaders in providing financial guarantees and credit enhancements for bond issuers ( e.g. , municipalities ) , asset managers , financial institutions , and insurance companies .
Both companies are traded on the New York Stock Exchange .
Holders of bonds and securities , " insured " by Ambac and MBIA , are provided irrevocable guarantees of timely payment of interest and principal should there be a default or other triggering event .
Between the two companies , they guarantee more than $ 1 trillion in municipal , corporate , and mortgage debt .
A critical aspect of such guarantees pertains to the fact that Ambac ’s and MBIA ’s triple - A credit ratings are bestowed upon the bonds and securities they are insuring .
This highest credit rating , correspondingly , signals to the market that such insured bonds and securities are of the highest quality and safety .
Underpinning this uppermost credit rating , enjoyed by both Ambac and MBIA , is each company ’s capital strength .
Consequently , it would be reasonable to assume that directors and officers , of both companies , would view financial strength as sacrosanct .
The dirty - little - secret , you wo n’t hear from Wall Street analysts , is that Ambac ’s and MBIA ’s top managements were knowingly weakening their respective company ’s balance sheets just as they were aggressively expanding into structured finance .
It is a fundamental tenet for insurers , sureties , and financial guarantors to put the interests of policyowners , beneficiaries , and obligees ( i.e. , customers ) before shareholders .
At Ambac and MBIA , this tenet was grossly violated .
These previously obscure companies are dominating the financial headlines as their names are now forever linked to the subprime - mortgage meltdown .
These once staid municipal bond insurers aggressively expanded into guaranteeing collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) , which repackage assets such as mortgage bonds and buyout loans into new securities with varying risk .
For these specialists , in risk assessment , to bestow triple - A ratings on what has turned out to be toxic junk simply defies all credit - underwriting principles .
When the mortgage - lending industry was openly flaunting " liars loans , " low - doc loans , Alt - A loans , etc. , how could n’t it have been clear , to the executives at Ambac and MBIA , that mortgage underwriting standards had gone into the gutter ?
To turn around and place triple - A ratings on this financial debris is nothing short of financial alchemy ; in which these two companies believed they had discovered a means of turning lead into gold .
To be so cavalier indicates corporate cultures imbued with arrogance and selfishness .
Standard & Poor ’s is reviewing $ 534 billion worth of subprime - mortgage securities and CDOs for possible ratings downgrades .
This is a staggering figure .
For Ambac , MBIA , and other mono - line insurers to be so wildly off the mark is mind - numbing .
Of course , this begs the question as to why anyone would ever again trust a triple - A- rated security insured by Ambac or MBIA ?
When a financial guarantor proves to be untrustworthy , it loses its franchise and cannot remain a viable business concern .
To date , both Ambac and MBIA have experienced horrific financial results in structured finance .
For fiscal - year 2007 , Ambac suffered a net loss of a little over $ 3.2 billion while MBIA suffered a net loss of slightly over $ 1.9 billion .
When combining enormous losses with significant stock buybacks , in fiscal - year 2007 , Ambac ’s net worth declined by a whopping 63 % ( down to $ 2,275,826,000 ) while MBIA ’s declined by 49 % ( down to $ 3,649,305,000 ) .
Thus , it is no wonder that Standard & Poor ’s and Moody ’s are reviewing these weakened companies for possible ratings downgrades .
Fitch Ratings has already dropped Ambac to double - A and may do the same to MBIA .
To be sure , there are those who will argue that the aforementioned financial losses were not foreseeable .
No management team willfully makes such flagrant strategic errors .
In turn , the financial losses suffered by both companies most certainly should get the attention of shareholders but should not translate to a loss of trust in the marketplace .
I have little doubt that Ambac ’s and MBIA ’s top executives are saying just that .
Perhaps there is a smidgen of legitimacy to this argument .
When it comes to a breach of trust , however , both Ambac ’s and MBIA ’s executives have been caught red-handed .
First let ’s discuss the sacrosanct nature of protecting an insurer ’s / financial guarantor ’s capital strength .
Here is what A.M. Best Company — the world leader in providing financial - strength ratings for insurance companies — has to say about capital strength :
The company ’s capital and surplus are measured by the difference between its assets minus its liabilities .
This value protects the interests of the company ’s policyowners in the event it develops financial problems ; the policyowners ’ benefits are thus protected by the insurance company ’s capital .
Shareholders ’ interest is second to that of policyowners .
Beyond a shadow of a doubt , Ambac ’s and MBIA ’s executives subordinated the interests of the beneficiaries — who depend upon each respective company ’s financial guarantees — to those of the shareholders .
This is an outright breach of trust , a dereliction of duty , and here ’s how they did it .
From fiscal - year 2001 through the third quarter of 2007 , Ambac and MBIA have been engaged in what can only be described now as reckless stock - buyback programs .
Over this period of time , Ambac has repurchased $ 1,015,036,000 worth of its common stock while MBIA has repurchased $ 1,843,044,000 of its common stock .
Wall Street , of course , always cheers on a stock buyback because it reduces the number of shares outstanding ; which analysts foolishly believe enhances shareholder value ( as explained here ) .
The opposite , in fact , is true .
A stock buyback weakens a company ’s balance sheet and I have never understood why a weaker financial condition is better for a company and its shareholders .
So let ’s put this into context for Ambac and MBIA .
When a publicly - held company buys back its stock , such transactions can be easily tracked in the company ’s financial statement .
The first place to look , in the financial statement , is in the statement of cash flows .
There you will see it as a use of cash categorized as a purchase of treasury stock .
The next place to look is in the statement of changes in shareholders ’ equity .
There you will see treasury stock recorded as causing a decrease in total shareholders ’ equity .
So , in the name of enhancing shareholder value , Ambac and MBIA respectively spent $ 1,015,036,000 and $ 1,843,044,000 worth of cash for stock buybacks ( over the past seven years ) .
But , and now you know this , such cash expenditures reduced liquidity and net worth by those exact amounts .
How can this be deemed responsible behavior when both companies are expressly in the business of insuring bonds and providing financial guarantees ?
To add some more fuel to the fire , let ’s fantasize for a moment and assume that both companies had responsible management teams who never would engage in stock buybacks .
Well , Ambac ’s net worth would be fully 44 % higher than it is today while MBIA ’s would be fully 50 % higher .
Accordingly , both companies would stand a better chance , of surviving the subprime meltdown , had their top executives been prudent financial managers .
Shareholders , moreover , would certainly sleep better at night had such additional financial cushions existed in order to help their companies ride out these rough times .
And now , the New York state insurance superintendent is begging money - center banks to rescue these two train - wrecked companies .
In a separate article , it is stated that " A group of eight banks is already considering a plan to inject capital into Ambac , which needs at least $ 1bn .
Several banks are also believed to be talking to MBIA , which needs at least $ 500 m .
" What a mess .
Ambac and MBIA , to say the least , are sorely missing the cash they used to repurchase their own shares .
Indeed , this is the blowback management did n’t foresee when they put shareholders ahead of " policyowners . "
Such negligent behavior most certainly has opened the door for municipalities , regulators , and shareholders to file civil lawsuits against the directors and officers of Ambac and MBIA .
Hence , we have the ultimate irony here .
You can bet that Ambac ’s and MBIA ’s directors and officers are praying that their directors & officers liability insurance carriers have been prudently managed so as to put policyowners ahead of shareholders .
What a novel idea .
The Best of Eric Englund
The accused was a close ally of beleaguered PM Ehud Olmert
Former Israeli Finance Minister Avraham Hirchson has been charged with embezzlement in Tel Aviv .
The allegations - which Mr Hirchson denies - relate to his period as head of a trade union organisation , the National Workers ' Federation .
Mr Hirchson resigned from office a year ago to fight the accusations .
He was a leading figure in the Kadima party of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , who is also under criminal investigation for alleged corruption .
Mr Hirchson is charged with stealing about $ 765,000 ( £ 380,000 ) from his union , which he is suspected of using to fund an election campaign and foreign holidays .
Mr Olmert has not been charged with any offence over his dealings with US fundraiser Morris Talanski - and he firmly denies any wrongdoing .
Mr Talanski said he had given large sums of cash in envelopes to the future prime minister during his trips to the US in the 1990s and early 2000s .
Prosecutors say the cash was hidden in the shed
Tax officials say the sisters hid almost 6 bn yen ( £ 29 m ; $ 58 m ) in cardboard boxes and paper bags at their home in the city of Osaka .
They are accused of failing to declare most of the money they inherited from their wealthy father , who died almost four years ago .
The National Tax Agency say it is the biggest ever case of its kind in Japan .
Prosecutors say Hatsue Shimizu and Yoshiko Ishii inherited about 7.5 bn yen when their father , who owned a property and finance company , died in 2004 .
Cash in the shed
However they declared a fraction of that amount to the authorities , allegedly stashing the rest away , and thereby avoiding 2.86 bn yen in inheritance tax .
Prosecutors and officials from the Osaka taxation bureau raided 10 locations in connection with the case , including Hatsue Shimizu 's home .
A tax official said they had concealed most of the money in cash in a shed attached to the house .
" We have confiscated 50 cardboard boxes , " he said .
Hatsue Shimizu has denied the cash was part of her inheritance , saying she had earned it herself .

A firefighter in Berlin in a file photo .
Firefighters called to a blaze at an apartment building in a southern German town were astonished to discover a fully equipped extremely drunk imposter in their ranks , police said on Thursday .
REUTERS / Arnd Wiegmann
BERLIN ( Reuters ) - Firefighters called to a blaze at an apartment building in a southern German town were astonished to discover a fully equipped extremely drunk imposter in their ranks , police said on Thursday .
On hearing the alarm , the 38 - year - old man had rushed to the fire station , was helped into protective clothing and helmet by unsuspecting firefighters and boarded the fire engine , a spokesman for Suedhessen police said .
After arriving at the apartments , firefighters quickly realized the man was an imposter and called the police , he added .
“ When fire breaks out , it ’s all hands on deck ! ” the man told officers when questioned about his motives .
He was released without charge after sobering up overnight in a police cell .
Last Update : For archival reasons , I ’m removing direct links to releases , etc. from here .
All the info you need is at the official paperclip project page .
For some reason , file attachment is annoying .
I do n’t know why , and I know a lot of people have attempted to solve the problem in the past , myself included .
Yet it still is .
Having gotten fed up with gotchas and design decisions that we did n’t agree with , I went and wrote Paperclip on the plane to RailsConf last year .
We ’ve been using it here in various forms since and IMHO it ’s the way to handle uploads , and finally decided that it should be released .
class User < ActiveRecord :: Base has_attached_file :avatar , : styles => { : square => [ " 64x64 # " , : png ] , : small => " 150x150 > " } end
A file is treated like any other attribute .
It ’s assigned like any other attribute , and it ’s not saved until you call #save .
It does n’t have its own model .
You can say where it ’s saved on the filesystem , and what URL it ’s referred to by ( which means you can let Apache / nginx handle it or you can route it through the app for permissions / security ) .
You can say what thumbnails are made , what resolution and format they are , and you can actually save cropped square thumbnails without any hassle .
class AddAvatarToUser < ActiveRecord :: Migration def self . up add_column :users , :avatar_file_name , : string add_column :users , :avatar_content_type , : string add_column :users , :avatar_file_size , : integer end def self .
down ; ... ; end end
You do n’t need mini_magick ( which we ’ve found may have been causing issues ) , you do n’t need ImageScience ( which , on the first image we tried to upload , failed to decode it , and it was a simple GIF ) , you do n’t need RMagick ( which has memory issues that were the impetus for mini_magick in the first place ) .
You just need ImageMagick installed somewhere , which is as easy as yum , apt - get , or port on any system worth hosting on .
And this is n’t just for avatars and images .
You can upload anything .
No thumbnails are made by default , so it wo n’t automagically choke on your Excel docs .
In your model :
class User < ActiveRecord :: Base has_attached_file :avatar , : styles => { : medium => " 300x300 > " , : thumb => " 100x100 > " } end
In your edit and new views :
<% form_for : user , : html => { : multipart => true } do | form | %> <%= form .
file_field :avatar %> <% end %>
In your controller :
def create @user = User .
create ( params [ : user ] )
end
In your show view :
< %= image_tag @user .
avatar . url %> <%= image_tag @user .
avatar . url ( : medium ) %> <%= image_tag @user .
avatar . url ( : thumb ) %>

It ca n’t be everything for everyone , but for the vast majority of cases we ’ve come across , this is the right fit .
Really , once you use this you ’ll wonder why managing files was such a hassle .

THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM
In the end , the biggest , most ambitious and widely reported studies of diet and health leave more or less undisturbed the main features of the Western diet : lots of meat and processed foods , lots of added fat and sugar , lots of everything — except fruits , vegetables and whole grains .
In keeping with the nutritionism paradigm and the limits of reductionist science , the researchers fiddle with single nutrients as best they can , but the populations they recruit and study are typical American eaters doing what typical American eaters do : trying to eat a little less of this nutrient , a little more of that , depending on the latest thinking .
( One problem with the control groups in these studies is that they too are exposed to nutritional fads in the culture , so over time their eating habits come to more closely resemble the habits of the intervention group . )
It should not surprise us that the findings of such research would be so equivocal and confusing .
But what about the elephant in the room — the Western diet ?
It might be useful , in the midst of our deepening confusion about nutrition , to review what we do know about diet and health .
What we know is that people who eat the way we do in America today suffer much higher rates of cancer , heart disease , diabetes and obesity than people eating more traditional diets .
( Four of the 10 leading killers in America are linked to diet . )
Further , we know that simply by moving to America , people from nations with low rates of these “ diseases of affluence ” will quickly acquire them .
Nutritionism by and large takes the Western diet as a given , seeking to moderate its most deleterious effects by isolating the bad nutrients in it — things like fat , sugar , salt — and encouraging the public and the food industry to limit them .
But after several decades of nutrient - based health advice , rates of cancer and heart disease in the U.S. have declined only slightly ( mortality from heart disease is down since the ’ 50s , but this is mainly because of improved treatment ) , and rates of obesity and diabetes have soared .
No one likes to admit that his or her best efforts at understanding and solving a problem have actually made the problem worse , but that ’s exactly what has happened in the case of nutritionism .
Scientists operating with the best of intentions , using the best tools at their disposal , have taught us to look at food in a way that has diminished our pleasure in eating it while doing little or nothing to improve our health .
Perhaps what we need now is a broader , less reductive view of what food is , one that is at once more ecological and cultural .
What would happen , for example , if we were to start thinking about food as less of a thing and more of a relationship ?
In nature , that is of course precisely what eating has always been : relationships among species in what we call food chains , or webs , that reach all the way down to the soil .
Species co-evolve with the other species they eat , and very often a relationship of interdependence develops : I ’ll feed you if you spread around my genes .
A gradual process of mutual adaptation transforms something like an apple or a squash into a nutritious and tasty food for a hungry animal .
Over time and through trial and error , the plant becomes tastier ( and often more conspicuous ) in order to gratify the animal ’s needs and desires , while the animal gradually acquires whatever digestive tools ( enzymes , etc. ) are needed to make optimal use of the plant .
Similarly , cow ’s milk did not start out as a nutritious food for humans ; in fact , it made them sick until humans who lived around cows evolved the ability to digest lactose as adults .
This development proved much to the advantage of both the milk drinkers and the cows .
“ Health ” is , among other things , the byproduct of being involved in these sorts of relationships in a food chain — involved in a great many of them , in the case of an omnivorous creature like us .
Further , when the health of one link of the food chain is disturbed , it can affect all the creatures in it .
When the soil is sick or in some way deficient , so will be the grasses that grow in that soil and the cattle that eat the grasses and the people who drink the milk .
Or , as the English agronomist Sir Albert Howard put it in 1945 in “ The Soil and Health ” ( a founding text of organic agriculture ) , we would do well to regard “ the whole problem of health in soil , plant , animal and man as one great subject . ”
Our personal health is inextricably bound up with the health of the entire food web .
In many cases , long familiarity between foods and their eaters leads to elaborate systems of communications up and down the food chain , so that a creature ’s senses come to recognize foods as suitable by taste and smell and color , and our bodies learn what to do with these foods after they pass the test of the senses , producing in anticipation the chemicals necessary to break them down .
Health depends on knowing how to read these biological signals : this smells spoiled ; this looks ripe ; that ’s one good - looking cow .
This is easier to do when a creature has long experience of a food , and much harder when a food has been designed expressly to deceive its senses — with artificial flavors , say , or synthetic sweeteners .
Note that these ecological relationships are between eaters and whole foods , not nutrients .
Even though the foods in question eventually get broken down in our bodies into simple nutrients , as corn is reduced to simple sugars , the qualities of the whole food are not unimportant — they govern such things as the speed at which the sugars will be released and absorbed , which we ’re coming to see as critical to insulin metabolism .
Put another way , our bodies have a longstanding and sustainable relationship to corn that we do not have to high - fructose corn syrup .
Such a relationship with corn syrup might develop someday ( as people evolve superhuman insulin systems to cope with regular floods of fructose and glucose ) , but for now the relationship leads to ill health because our bodies do n’t know how to handle these biological novelties .
In much the same way , human bodies that can cope with chewing coca leaves — a longstanding relationship between native people and the coca plant in South America — cannot cope with cocaine or crack , even though the same “ active ingredients ” are present in all three .
Reductionism as a way of understanding food or drugs may be harmless , even necessary , but reductionism in practice can lead to problems .

What ’s the secret to focus ?
I ’ve been asked this question more than once .
And I ’ve been hesitant to answer because , well , I ’ve never been sure of the answer .
I ’ve always just done what comes naturally !
But I ’ve been thinking and thinking about this , and have come up with a list .
I hope it is helpful to you .
This is what I know , in my own experience , about achieving sharpness in photos :
1 . Your camera must be still .
2 . If your subject is not still , your shutter speed needs to be faster .
3 . If it is dark , you will need a tripod .
4 . It helps a lot to have a good lens .
( Good glass , bay - bee ! )
5 . Prime lenses have a reputation of being sharper .
6. Lenses usually have a sweet spot .
7 . Do n’t hand hold a shot at a speed lower than your lens length .
8 . Make sure you know where your camera is focusing .
9 . Take a lot of pictures and shoot on continuous .
10 .
Poor focus could be your camera ’s fault .
Here ’s some further detail on each of my points :
# 1 – Your camera must be still .
Be aware of it .
Sometimes I learn against a wall or a tree to steady myself .
And I hold my breath a lot .
Is n’t that funny ?
I ’ll bet no one has told you to hold your breath before .
But I actually think it helps .
Hold still and gently press the shutter release .
# 2 – If your subject is not still , your shutter speed needs to be faster .
Wiggly children , blowing flowers , and speedy athletes all call for fast shutter speeds .
I have noticed that larger numbered f / stops do n’t need super fast shutter speeds .
( Less blur due to smaller hole . )
Chew on that one for a minute or two .
# 3 – If it is dark , you need a tripod .
This is Scott Kelby ’s # 1 advice .
Use a tripod for tack sharp photographs .
But it just does n’t suit my shooting style at all .
Though there have been shots I ’ve taken where I wish I ’d had a tripod .
For those of you who ask how you can get a nice picture inside without the flash , ; ike at a concert or ballet recital or wedding , a tripod really is the best answer .
A tripod is also essential for sharp night time shooting .
# 4 – All lenses are not created equal .
Buy the best glass you can .
Do you homework .
Ask a lot of questions .
Rent the lens first if you can .
# 5 – Prime lenses have a reputation of being sharper .
A prime lens is a fixed lens .
That means it is only one length .
A lens that can go from 55 - 200 is not a fixed lens .
It would be called a zoom lens .
Now , I do have a 17 - 55 wide angle zoom lens .
It is a good lens and I think it ’s really sharp , especially at 4.0 .
But who am I to argue with the pros ?
# 6 – Lenses have a sweet spot .
Find it .
Do n’t you just want to know what your lens ’s sweet spot is ?
I did .
I found it on my wide angle lens .
I was totally delighted to see
such sharp photos come from my zoom .
The 50 mm 1.8 is a super sweet little lens and I happen to like it wide open .
Again , the pros would tell you not to shoot wide open as the shutter blades do n’t function best wide open .
But , um … I like to shoot at 1.8 .
Sometimes I close it down to 2.0 but only when I am being an obedient little photographer .
Knowing your lens ’s sweet spot helps you make decisions about your set up .
It ’s good to know .
# 7 – Do n’t take a handheld shot with your shutter speed lower than the number on your lens .
For instance , if I am shooting with my 50 mm lens then I know I will get into trouble ( blur ) if my shutter speed goes below 1/50 .
This is a rule of thumb , but I think it ’s pretty accurate .
# 8 – Make sure you know where your camera is focusing .
When you look in your camera , do you see the focusing brackets ?
Are they smack dab in the middle ?
Well , sometimes , mine move .
I think in my frantic attempt to adjust my settings quickly … .
I move it .
Twice since I have had my camera the brackets have moved over to the left .
Both times , I have had to pull out my manual to set those brackets back in the center where I like them .
If I tried to focus using the center of the screen while the brackets were over to the right or the left , I would be taking out - of - focus pictures .
This off - set focus thing really set me into a tizzy !
But I pulled out the manual and set to work correcting it .
I found the settings in my manual under “ Focus Area Selection . ”
Has this ever happened to anyone else ?
If you want your focus area to be in the center of your screen , make sure your focus brackets are right there where you want them .
# 9 – By shooting lots and lots and lots of pictures consecutively , you are increasing your chances of getting a good shot .
Most camera have a continuous shot mode .
Give this a try .
With a moving subject this might just be the method that works really well for you .
# 10 – If , no matter what you do , you still think your pictures are blurry , it could be your camera .
This is not an uncommon problem .
I have a friend who just could not get crisp pictures with her new D300 .
She took it back to the store where she purchased it and they replaced it for her .
( This service is exceptional .
I did not have such willing vendors when I had a problem with my camera they told me to send it to Nikon . )
So , within the first year of owning my camera I sent it to Nikon for repairs .
( It was under warranty . )
They cleaned it up , fixed two hot pixels and I think they actually improved the focus in the process .
It is a pain in the neck to send your camera away but the manufacturers really have the best technicians to
evaluate your camera .
* If your camera is under warranty , take advantage of their free “ check up ” .
I hope these ideas are helpful !
If you have a tip or two , please feel free to share them in the comments .

London police have announced a ban on anti-war campaigners hoping to protest against President George Bush 's visit to Downing Street this Sunday .
The Whitehall ban has been immediately condemned as a " totalitarian act " by the playwright Harold Pinter , while Stop the War organisers are urging people to defy it and to demonstrate nearby in Parliament Square .
" In what is supposed to be a free country the Stop the War Coalition has every right to express its views peacefully and openly .
This ban is outrageous and makes the term ' democracy ' laughable , " Pinter said today .
Lindsey German , a leader of the Stop the War Coalition , said : " It seems that when George W Bush visits this country traditional rights of assembly are to be removed from the people .
We are calling on those who care for our democratic rights to come to Parliament Square at 5 pm on Sunday 15 June .
Some of those who signed statements accusing Bush of war crimes will be leading this protest .
" George Bush has been dictating British foreign policy for many years .
Now it appears his security services are determining our rights of protest .
This is a disgrace and we will challenge the ban . "
The anti-nuclear campaign CND said it believed the British government was allowing security operations to be directed by White House officials .
Previous demonstrations have been allowed along Whitehall , but Bush 's presence in Downing Street - he is due to have dinner with Gordon Brown - means protesters are to be banned from a police ' exclusion zone ' .
Kate Hudson , CND chair , warned that protesters might ignore the police .
She said : " Previous attempts to deprive us of our rights to protest have come to nothing .
In February 2003 we were told we could n't go on the grass in Hyde Park and what happened ?
Two million people joined us in Hyde Park to oppose the war on Iraq .
" Last October we were told we could n't protest in Parliament Square to demand the withdrawal of British troops .
What happened then ?
The morning of the protest we were given the go - ahead .
We have a proud record of peaceful democratic protest and we mean to continue - lift the ban now . "

Pat Tillman was against the war and evidence points to the probability he was whacked for this opposition .
Bush ’s brain and former dirty trickster Karl Rove may be on the run , but the House Oversight Committee is digging into his dealings .
Most revealing , although hardly surprising , is an account of Rove ’s buddy - buddy relationship with Ron Fournier , characterized as an “ AP scribe ” by Nick Juliano over at Raw Story .
In fact , Fournier acted as a script reader for the White House ’s communications team , more accurately its propaganda team .
“ In its investigation of the misleading accounts that initially surrounded Pat Tillman ’s death and Jessica Lynch ’s rescue the House Oversight Committee on Monday shed some light on the White House ’s press- management apparatus and the chummy relationship between Karl Rove and AP scribe Ron Fournier , ” writes Juliano .
“ The report details the Bush administration ’s exploitation of Tillman ’s death and suppression of evidence that the former football pro who joined the Army Rangers after 9/11 was killed by friendly fire .
In the day ’s after Tillman ’s death , on April 22 , 2004 , the committee examined e-mails from the White House ’s communications team , including some exchanges with reporters . ”
Fournier , Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan , and others coordinated closely with the neocons in order to tell the big lies and create myths .
Karl Rove exchanged e-mails about Pat Tillman with Associated Press reporter Ron Fournier , under the subject line “ H - E - R - O . ”
In response to Mr. Fournier ’s e-mail , Mr. Rove asked , “ How does our country continue to produce men and women like this , ” to which Mr. Fournier replied , “ The Lord creates men and women like this all over the world .
But only the great and free countries allow them to flourish .
Keep up the fight . ”
In fact , as it turns out , Tillman was against the war and evidence points to the probability he was whacked for this opposition .
“ The dark shadow of ‘ black ops ’ has fallen over the Tillman story , and it reaches all the way to the White House .
Conspiracy theories are multiplying , ” Charles Laurence wrote for the Daily Mail on August 3 , 2007 .
“ New evidence shows that he was turning out to be a very troubled ‘ hero ’ , a poster boy for the Army and the War on Terror who may have been about to speak out against the war he had come to symbolize . ”
In July of 2007 , Army medical examiners concluded Tillman was shot three times in the head from just 10 yards away and there was no “ friendly fire , ” as initially suggested by the corporate media , following the government script .
“ Astounding new details surrounding the death of Pat Tillman clearly indicate that top brass decided to execute the former pro football star in cold blood to prevent him from returning home and becoming an anti-war icon , ” Paul Joseph Watson wrote at the time .
“ These same criminals then engaged in a sophisticated conspiracy to create a phony ‘ friendly fire ’ cover story , ” part and parcel of a larger and more insidious effort to create a “ cover story ” for the entire “ war on terror , ” including war crimes committed against Afghanistan and Iraq , the latter resulting in the premeditated murder of over a million people , a crime approaching Nuremberg proportion .
In order to set the bogus Tillman cover story in stone and obscure the truth , “ White House staff exchanged more than 200 e-mails concerning Tillman ’s death , according to the Oversight Committee report , ” notes Juliano .
In other words , the corporate media and the neocons were not only busy at work reshaping reality , but engaged in a criminal conspiracy and suppressing evidence , not only in regard to Tillman but the manufactured “ hero ” Jessica Lynch as well .
Fournier , now acting bureau chief Associated Press , should be arrested and brought up on charges , as should Karl Rove , now at large after his refusal to appear before the House Oversight Committee .
Of course , this will not happen because Congress does not have the cajones to sincerely investigate and hold responsible the neocons and the corporate media , not only for the Big Lie in regard to the Tillman and Lynch fairy tales , but the larger and far more portentous lies spread in order to invade small and defenseless countries and kill millions of people .

Subcutaneous fat often collects on the buttocks and legs Body fat found under the skin - and particularly on the buttocks - may help reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes , research suggests .
The study contrasts this subcutaneous fat with visceral fat , which is wrapped around the organs , and raises the risk of ill health .
It is thought subcutaneous fat may produce hormones known as adipokines which boost the metabolism .
The Harvard Medical School study appears in the journal Cell Metabolism .
The surprising thing was that it was n't where the fat was located , it was the kind of fat that was the most important variable .
Professor Ronald Khan
Harvard Medical School
The researchers , who worked on mice , transplanted fat from one part of the animals ' body to the other .
When subcutaneous fat was moved to the abdominal area , there was a decrease in body weight , fat mass , and blood sugar levels .
The animals also became more responsive to the hormone insulin , which controls the way the body uses sugar .
A lack of response to insulin is often the first stage on the path to type 2 diabetes .
In contrast , moving abdominal visceral fat to other parts of the body had no effect .
Lead researcher Professor Ronald Khan said : " The surprising thing was that it was n't where the fat was located , it was the kind of fat that was the most important variable .
" Even more surprising , it was n't that abdominal fat was exerting negative effects , but that subcutaneous fat was producing a good effect . "
Previous research has suggested that obese people with high levels of both abdominal and subcutaneous fat are more insulin- sensitive than those with only high levels of abdominal fat .
Professor Khan said it was possible that subcutaneous fat offset the effects of visceral fat .
Dr David Haslam , of the National Obesity Forum , said the finding cast new doubt on the merits of Body Mass Index ( BMI ) as a way to assess whether somebody was unhealthily overweight , as it did not differentiate between different types of fat .
He said it was still important that people tried to control their weight , as healthy lifestyle choices like a balanced diet and taking exercise would overwhelmingly impact on visceral , and not subcutaneous fat levels .
Women have a tendency to lay down more subcutaneous fat , particularly on their legs and buttocks than men .
Dr Ian Campbell , medical director of the charity Weight Concern , said : " If there is something about subcutaneous fat which is protective , and actually decreases insulin resistance , this could help open up a whole new debate on the precise role fat has on our metabolism . "

A top aide to a former Republican congressman from Oklahoma has pleaded guilty to a conspiracy to defraud the House as part of the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal .
The aide , John Albaugh , who was chief of staff to Representative Ernest Istook , told a federal judge that he was guilty of accepting gifts in return for official favors .
Mr. Albaugh faces up to 24 months in prison but the sentence could be reduced if he cooperates with the government ’s investigation .
The war on terror is easily the most litigated war in history , and on the evidence so far the lawyers are winning .
They may yet succeed in killing military commissions , despite their long U.S. history and a law duly passed by Congress and signed by the President .
The latest legal battle concerns the Pentagon 's attempt to try the perpetrators of 9/11 .
You'd think this would be easy compared , say , to trying the eight Nazis who secretly landed on Long Island and Florida in June 1942 .
Those Nazis did n't kill any Americans .
Yet ...
The Bolivian government has continued its nationalisation of key industries by taking controlling stakes in oil , gas and telecoms companies .
It took back control of telephone company Entel from its foreign owners along with a gas and oil exploration firm and an oil pipeline company .
A deal was done with one company , and decrees imposed in other cases .
President Evo Morales wants to increase the revenue his country receives from its industries .
Parts of Bolivia 's energy industry was privatised in the 1990s , with foreign companies taking 50 % stakes .
In an announcement on the 1 May workers ' holiday , President Morales said :
" Basic services - call them energy , water or communications - cannot be in the hands of private business , " he said .
" They are public services . "
Bolivia 's state energy company paid $ 6.3 m for a majority stake in Spanish - owned Andina , one of the country 's biggest energy companies which exploits oil and gas fields and owns a 50 % stake in two giant gas fields .
It has also taken over , by state decree , the control of Chaco from BP and Pan American Energy and the Transredes pipeline company from Ashmore Energy International .
Mr Morales is an ally of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez , who has also taken back control of a number of industries from foreign control , including oil , electricity and cement .

This is the sort of bizarrely whimsical thing that ’s just strange enough for people to say “ why not ? ” and roll with it .
It reminds me of Kyle McDonald ’s One Red Paper Clip , where he documented online how in 14 consecutive trades he went from owning one red paper clip to owning a house .
That ’s right … a house .
On Things For Sale
That I Will Mail
You , artist David Horvitz lists all of the various tasks he will perform and then mail you proof of … if you pay him .
The list is so randomly romantic and his descriptions of exactly what he will and will not do for you are so earnest that the whole thing becomes very appealing .
Plus , he ’s conscientious enough to make sure there ’s something to fit everyone ’s budget .
He ’s got a variety of sublimely ridiculous things he ’ll do for you for only $ 1 .
For just a buck he will look at the Pacific Ocean for you for one minute .
As he so mathematically points out , if you send him $ 345 he will look at the Pacific Ocean for you for 345 minutes .
For $ 1 he will also “ sit in silence and think about you for one minute ” .
For proof , he ’ll email you when he starts and then email you again when he ’s done .
There ’s something about the assumption of trust here that I love – what more proof do you need ?
Some of his offers are also a little more legitimately practical .
Having been accepted to Bard University for his MFA , Horvitz posted up all of his tuition expenses and promises that all the artwork he creates during the amount of his schooling you pay for will become yours .
His explanation is simple and universally understandable to anybody who went to college : “ It is expensive .
I am poor ” .
How much do I love this guy ?
We need to get him on Oprah … this is totally the kind of thing she ’ll pay for , and then give the art to South Africa or something .
He gets more exploratory and treasure - hunty as it goes on .
For $ 1,626 he ’ll go to a small Okinawan island called Taketomi and send you an enveloped filled with this ( admittedly quite pretty ) star sand .
If that ’s a bit rich for your budget , for $ 20 he ’ll send you an envelope filled with sand from Coney Island .
Again , in what is either a feat of brilliantly laid - back copywriting or just his own intrinsic whatever - ness , Hurvitz says “ It ’s not star sand , but it ’s still Coney Island ” .
He ’s a little bit genius .
A lot of the offers consist of going to the edges of continents and taking a picture of the sea for you .
For $ 1,335 he ’ll go to Tiera del Fuego , for $ 917 he ’ll go to the eastern most point of Newfoundland , and for $ 3,143 he ’ll go to Perth , Australia .
The down under trip is clearly his preference , saying “ I ’m a little sad right now and I would kind of like to escape , so if you are thinking about getting one of these and not sure what you want , please take in consideration my emotions and pick this one . ”
Amongst his many other offers are baking cookies and handing them out on the street , buying food for homeless people , reading “ The Little Prince ” aloud in front of the New York Stock Exchange , and writing down a memory and mailing it to you .
He ’s got a concisely compiled list of everything he ’s sold .
Reading through it is almost disturbingly fascinating …
There is one offer that really appeals to my idealist , emotional side .
For $ 10 he ’ll take a picture of the sky , laster print it , and mail it to you .
Then he ’ll delete it , meaning you will have the one and only picture of that exact patch of sky at that exact moment .
This might fit into the whole “ get a star named after you ” category of atmospheric and celestial ownership that ’s actually impossible , but there ’s something I just love about the idea of it .
If you find this sky thing as appealing as I do , then Horvitz also has an on - going photo project called I Will Send You A Photograph Of The Sky For Everyday In 2008 .
There is something so carefree and whimsical and lovely about this that I just appreciate that he thought to put it out there into the universe .
His offering is so matter of fact and direct that he comes across as some sort of random - photographic prophet :
“ I will mail you the prints intermittently depending on how I feel .
I may mail you one at a time as a post -card .
I may mail you a whole weeks worth in one envelope .
By the beginning of 2009 you will have 366 skies .
Each print will be stamped with the date on the back .
A list of locations with their correlating dates will be printed at the end of the year .
I want you to keep them in a pile so that they become a slowly growing sculpture , which I think would look nice . ”
I ’m seriously thinking of getting in on this .
There ’s also a free - email only version , where for no charge Horvitz will email you the sky picture every day , and his site claims this is part of a larger project he ’s working on where he ’ll take a photograph of the sky every day for the rest of his life .

What ’s Happening to Boys ?
Young Women These Days Are Driven — but Guys Lack Direction
By Leonard Sax
Friday , March 31 , 2006
The romantic comedy “ Failure to Launch , ” which opened as the No. 1 movie in the nation this month , has substantially exceeded pre-launch predictions , taking in more than $ 64 million in its first three weeks .
Matthew McConaughey plays a young man who is affable , intelligent , good - looking — and completely unmotivated .
He ’s still living at home and seems to have no ambitions beyond playing video games , hanging out with his buddies ( two young men who are also still living with their parents ) and having sex .
In desperation , his parents hire a professional motivation consultant , played by Sarah Jessica Parker , who pretends to fall in love with McConaughey ’s character in the hope that a romantic relationship will motivate him to move out of his parents ’ home and get a life .
The movie has received mixed reviews , though The Post ’s Stephen Hunter praised it as “ the best comedy since I do n’t know when . ”
But putting aside the movie ’s artistic merits or lack thereof , I was struck by how well its central idea resonates with what I ’m seeing in my office with greater and greater frequency .
Justin goes off to college for a year or two , wastes thousands of dollars of his parents ’ money , then gets bored and comes home to take up residence in his old room , the same bedroom where he lived when he was in high school .
Now he ’s working 16 hours a week at Kinko ’s or part time at Starbucks .
His parents are pulling their hair out .
“ For God ’s sake , Justin , you ’re 26 years old .
You ’re not in school .
You do n’t have a career .
You do n’t even have a girlfriend .
What ’s the plan ?
When are you going to get a life ? ”
“ What ’s the problem ? ” Justin asks .
“ I have n’t gotten arrested for anything , I have n’t asked you guys for money .
Why ca n’t you just chill ? ”
This phenomenon cuts across all demographics .
You ’ll find it in families both rich and poor ; black , white , Asian and Hispanic ; urban , suburban and rural .
According to the Census Bureau , fully one - third of young men ages 22 to 34 are still living at home with their parents — a roughly 100 percent increase in the past 20 years .
No such change has occurred with regard to young women .
Why ?
My friend and colleague Judy Kleinfeld , a professor at the University of Alaska , has spent many years studying this growing phenomenon .
She points out that many young women are living at home nowadays as well .
But those young women usually have a definite plan .
They ’re working toward a college degree , or they ’re saving money to open their own business .
And when you come back three or four years later , you ’ll find that in most cases those young women have achieved their goal , or something like it .
They ’ve earned that degree .
They ’ve opened their business .
But not the boys .
“ The girls are driven ; the boys have no direction , ” is the way Kleinfeld summarizes her findings .
Kleinfeld is organizing a national Boys Project , with a board composed of leading researchers and writers such as Sandra Stotsky , Michael Thompson and Richard Whitmire , to figure out what ’s going wrong with boys .
The project is only a few weeks old , it has called no news conferences and its Web site ( http://www.boysproject.net ) has just been launched .
So far we ’ve just been asking one another the question :
What ’s happening to boys ?
We ’ve batted around lots of ideas .
Maybe the problem has to do with the way the school curriculum has changed .
Maybe it has to do with environmental toxins that affect boys differently than girls ( not as crazy an idea as it sounds ) .
Maybe it has to do with changes in the workforce , with fewer blue - collar jobs and more emphasis on the service industry .
Maybe it ’s some combination of all of the above , or other factors we have n’t yet identified .
In Ayn Rand ’s humorless apocalyptic novel “ Atlas Shrugged , ” the central characters ask :
What would happen if someone turned off the motor that drives the world ?
We may be living in such a time , a time when the motor that drives the world is running down or stuck in neutral — but only for boys .
Leonard Sax , a family physician and psychologist in Montgomery County , is the author of “ Boys Adrift : What ’s Really Behind the Growing Epidemic of Unmotivated Boys , ” to be published next year .
He will take questions at noon today .

Women born after about 1975 to 1980 are in for one hell of a rough life .
When they are ready to settle down and raise a family , all the men they had to step on just to “ be equal ” ( fucking morons ) are going to be too far down to be good enough for them .
Stupid fucking cunts .

First off , I really take issue when an article starts off by citing a marginal box office success to try to prove a point .
Remember , at a generous $ 8 per ticket , a $ 64 mil gross only amounts to 8 million people– a tiny percentage of the total American population .
Aside from that , wow , what can I say ?
Boys suck , obviously .
That ’s the only conclusion I can draw from the article .
The good news is that girls are highly dynamic go - getters .
Funny that if boys were acting more proactive , the writer would have no choice but to write about how girls are n’t getting enough opportunities .

Well , that ’s actually very interesting .
If the policy these days is to go your own way …would n’t they be doing everything humanly possible to be financially independent enough to travel and enrich themselves free of womenfolk ?
Or is it another form of going your own way–in which the idea that you ’re only a potential rapist and women are better at this and that girls are much more encouraged that somewhere along the line it translated into “ well fine , if you do n’t expect anything of me , I guess that means I do n’t have to do anything . ”
I think it ’s disappointing that the article does n’t throw more theories out there .

Here we go again .
The elitists are panicking .
“ Why are boys not playing the game ?
How can we turn them into proper worker drones for the benefit of Womankind ? ”
They see it coming , gentlemen , and they do n’t like it .
MGTOW .
Why should boys bother playing a rigged game ?
Why should they volunteer as fodder for the ravenous Feminist Machine ?
Boys have been told that they ’re not necessary , not important , girls are better , boys are stupid and violent .
And on and on .
So now comes the feigned concern for boys .
they ’re concerned alright , concerned that skanks will no longer be able to “ marry up ” .
Concerned that their parasitic system will starve and collapse under it ’s own ponderous weight .
Concerned they will be unable to indoctrinate sufficient numbers of manginas if boys do n’t go to college .
I can only laugh .
The day of reckoning is fast approaching .

It truly is coming , and it is going to be ugly .
I hear so many stories at work , about parents just frustrated with their sons .
Their sons will not do their school work , no matter what they try .
I dont ’ stick my nose in their business , but I know the reason .
I too would rather just sit in my room , than deal with this backwards feminist minded bullshit school system .
It is going to get REAL damn ugly , REAL damn fast .
If they try a military draft , and do not draft 50 % women , I think the country might self destruct right then and there .

I was born in 1973 .
My entire generation has been decimated by the abortion industry and polluted by feminist and new age teaching .
I will stay single , thank you very much .
Nobody has clearly explained what the benefits of marriage to me are anyway .
One older guy tried , but all he could come up with was to have a relationship and not be alone .
Sorry , I like being alone .
If I want a relationship I will hangout with my siblings or family members during family reunions .
Otherwise , I prefer the peace and quit .

No doubt .
And if I have time to be lonely , and yet am not financially secure , I am being a lazy piece of shit .
No man in the USA should EVER get involved with a woman , and no man in the USA should EVER feel “ lonely ” .
If you are lonely , you are being lazy .
Find a way to improve your life , making money ( best choice ) , working out , learning another language , educating yourself , or just relaxing and being thankful to not be bothered .

It is very simple .
The girls have been told from birth that :
“ You can do anything , Grrl !
The world is your oyster ! ” and social attitudes , school and social programs reinforce this every second of the day .
Go into a school and read the posters on the wall .
All are either for girls or gender neutral .
Thing is , everyone assumed that the boys would inculcate the same attitude as the girls , except that no one is telling the boys that they can do anything , they just assume that they can .
Well any idiot knows that telling one group one thing while giving the silent treatment to the other is not how to randomize your control groups .
So the boys say : “ Fuck it .
I am going to master Ghost Recon on my XBox 360 ” .

The lack of fathers as examples and positive role models is also a contributing factor .
I would also venture to say that many boys see their fathers getting a raw deal and are opting out .
I agree , the elitists are panicking and the best part is they continue to ignore the obvious and focus on the peripheral issues so as to go on getting paid for “ seeking solution ” to the problem .
I would only home school in this environment today .
Schools are nothing but indoctrination centers and far too many teachers are stupid as piss .

Well here is my personal experience .
I am 23 and just finished up my degree ( business major ) .
I also just moved back in with my parents 6 months ago .
Why ?
Well first of all I want to make sure I have a steady job with a decent income before I move out .
Secondly I live in Silicon Valley ( CA ) and there is no way in hell I can afford a house , let alone a condo around here .
$ 600 k + for the shittiest condo imaginable is insane , not only that but in my opinion the real estate market has peaked so why would I want to buy now when everything is at its most expensive ?
I could rent a place but renting is just like throwing money down the drain , might as well make my money work for me and use my house as an investment .
So my only real option would be to advance up the corporate latter at light speed to a six - figure income within the year .
Or find a woman to split the costs of a house / condo with me ( hahahahahaha that was a joke ) .
Every single one of my friends in this area still live with their parents , with the exception of one who rents an apartment with his high school sweetheart ( who only pays 1 / 4 of the rent because she only works about 15 - 20 hrs a week ) .
Naturally , they are in debt .
So really , what is the other option ?
Run up huge debts ?
Not be able to pay a massive mortgage ?
This is the best possible thing I could do , I ’m establishing my career , saving up money so i can EVENTUALLY move out to a place of my own …even though thats still a long way off .
Oh and all of the women around here that are my age are desperately trying to find a man to latch onto so he will take care of them because all of the LOATHE working for a living .

You are 23 .
You are not supposed to be able to afford a house at that age .

I could rent a place but renting is just like throwing money down the drain ,
Well , most adults up to this point in history in the U.S. would move out of the house at 18 or after college , and they would either rent an apartment with roommates , or rent a room in a house with house mates .
This is normal .
I am curious .
Why do you think you should own a house before you rent ( or never rent at all ) ?
Most people rent for 5 - 15 years before they buy their own place .
This is normal .
Quote : might as well make my money work for me and use my house as an investment .
You are too young to buy a house .
Move out , get your own place , save money for a down payment , and then buy your own place .
That ’s how it was done for decades , and how most people do it .
Quote :
So my only real option would be to advance up the corporate latter at light speed to a six - figure income within the year .
What is this huge rush to buy a $ 600 condo ?
People do n’t buy a $ 600 k house as their first home ; you start small and work up .
You need to start where you can afford to enter the equity markets , and if you cannot do that in San Jose , well guess what bud , you need to move to somewhere where your income level will buy you an entry level home or condo .

No , you go without .
You rent an apartment , get a roommate , and save your money for a down payment .
Expecting to move from mom & dad ’s right into your own home that you own is extremely unrealistic .

I ’m not sure why these researchers are surprised .
Deny and suppress the spirit of Masculinity , and then wonder why boys lack that gung ho spirit of generations past .
I ’m thinking that guys today are unconsciously withdrawing from this corrupt society , to husband their strength .
MGTOW .
And its not such a bad deal for us …
I mean these guys are still knocking boots , playing ( warlike and masculine ) games , hanging out with the guys , and living a stress free lifestyle .
We ’re just riding the pine , waiting to be called back into the game .
No worries .
For women OTOH , their lives are going to truly suck .
Not only will they be the sole caretakers of rug rats , they will also have to put in the ten to twelve hour days that Men used to work .
I doubt that the female sex is prepared for this harsh reality .
But , what are ya gonna do ?? 🙂
Also , a lack of Male spirit will , in the long term , cripple the economy , and the social well being of the country .
I wonder just how long gay marriage , polygamy , and other weird shit would be tolerated with real warriors running the show ?
But hey , you reap what you sow .
Crack open a beer , pass the controller , and let these selfish women experience “ freedom ” .
Good luck to ya ladies .

My oldest Son got married at 19 .
Bought his first home then .
And became a Father at 22 .
He became an EMT and Fireman .
And was also a Manager of a Banquet Facility at a Casino .
Making $ 60,000 a year .
His second son is due on my Birthday this year .
He is an overachiever .
I wish I could take all the credit .
When he was 10 I gave him Rush Limbaugh ’s book “ The Way Things Ought To Be ” .
His older Sister also got a copy .
She is the mother of 3 boys and is studying to become a Dental Hygienist .

What an interesting way to put it .
First of all , there is no “ policy ” at work here .
It is simply the individual decisions of millions and millions of men which add up to a trend .
Men on the average are not nearly as materialistic as women .
The reason they used to work so hard and be so concerned with making money was because they were locked into the old provider / breadwinner role .
Every cultural institution and value pushed them into that role , supported them in it , and gave them no alternatives .
Every bit of that has been destroyed in the past 40 years .
I had a really bizarre and terrifying exchange with a woman a couple of years ago .
She actually made the statement that she had never given any thought to how men made money , she had always just thought of it as something men just did .
I guess she thought we just sit around and grow it like we do hair .
That conversation alone explained so much of what I have observed during this whole social / cultural / economic “ deconstruction ” process .
It was both enraging and terrifying .
There was a perfect example of the magical mode of thinking which is the foundation of women thinking they were “ oppressed ” because they simply did not understand how things work .
That woman never gave any thought to the long hours , hard work , high stress , risks , and major unpleasantness which are required to make much money .
There used to be cartoon of a girl baby and a boy baby looking inside their diapers with the caption “ Oh , that explains the difference in our salaries . ”
It was one of the most offensive things to men I have ever seen .
I wanted to make up a cartoon ( except I have no artistic talent and ca n’t even draw flies ) of a woman breezing out of the office while the clock on the wall shows 4:30 saying “ gotta pick up the kids ” , next to a man still at his desk when the clock shows 8:30 with him saying “ No , THAT explains the difference in our salaries . ”
“ Or is it another form of going your own way–in which the idea that you ’re only a potential rapist and women are better at this and that girls are much more encouraged that somewhere along the line it translated into “ well fine , if you do n’t expect anything of me , I guess that means I do n’t have to do anything . ”
That ’s part of it , but it ’s only the tip of the iceberg .
Any man who is successful will still be considered to be victimizing all women because “ Women still only make 76 cents for every dollar a man makes ! ”
No matter what a man does it gets twisted into women being the victims of it somehow .
The only way a man can really avoid victimizing women in some way is to leave them completely the hell alone and avoid them as much as possible .
What is the point of succeeding these days ?
All it does is make a man into a target for the looters who want to confiscate the fruits of his success in the name of “ diversity . ”
Besides , no matter how hard he works or how successful he is , they will keep changing the rules until he loses .
Look at what they do with the marathon races .
If a guy works hard to become a great marathon runner , they will rig the game and give women a 15 minute head start .
If a woman “ wins ” , then women everywhere will regard it as a victory of the entire female sex over the entire male sex and start chanting “ girls rule , boys drool . ”
If 15 minutes is n’t enough to rig the game so a woman wins , the next race will give them a 16 minute head start .
If a woman still does n’t win , they will up it to 17 minutes , and keep giving them a head start until some woman finally does win – then they will trumpet to the world how superior all women are to all men .
The roots of this go back more than 30 years .
Women have been getting more college degrees than men since the early 1980s .
Schools beat down boys as much as they are allowed to get away with , and when the rigged educational system still was n’t crippling boys enough to let girls win , they started medicating all the little guys who showed any promise at all .
A 10 y/o boy on Ritalin in 1990 is today ’s 26 y/o who knows through bitter experience that if he shows any promise at all , it will simply make him a target .
The nail that sticks up is the one which gets hammered down .
Boys are not nearly as big fools as people have believed .
There has been a war against them for more than 30 years , and they have learned to make themselves the smallest possible targets .
They have also learned to not feed the system which has as its major priority to destroy them any way it can .
Why make money when any woman can simply trap a sperm and lay claim to most of what they make ?
It does n’t even have to be his sperm – any old sperm will do .
Women have been “ daddy shopping ” for ages – “ hm , his wallet looks nice and fat , HE ’S THE DADDY OF MY BABY !!! ”
The H - bomb of the demotivation of males is this insane and evil concept called “ imputed income . ”
Financial success is little more than an excuse to turn a man into complete and total slave of some woman and her new husband “ the government . ”
If a guy is theoretically “ capable ” of making $ 100,000 / year , it becomes a crime to not make that much .
Why show the world that you have ability when all that will result from it is that the looters will attach themselves to you like parasites , chanting “ from each according to his ability , to each according to her need ” ?
It is fascinating and surreal that the writer would mention “ Atlas Shrugged ” because all one has to do is read that book and they will understand everything which has happened for the past 40 years and exactly what is going on .
Men with ability are going on strike and have been since the 1970s .
They are simply refusing to use their “ abilities ” to support a system which operates under the ideology of a cancer .
Why function as a heart or lungs when the tumors suck all the blood anyway ?
No matter how much blood the heart pumps , the tumors will suck it all up and demand more , and keep demanding that the heart pump more until it bursts from overload .
“ I think it ’s disappointing that the article does n’t throw more theories out there . ”
The article is not about theories or finding answers , it is nothing but a propaganda piece continuing the policy of “ blame men ” that Khank pointed out .
It is inconceivable to me that so many people could be so stupid as to not be able to see what is happening right in front of their eyes , so my conclusion is that it must be driven by malicious intent .
What no one seemed to count on , or the mediocre and stupid were just too stupid to figure out , is that men did n’t achieve at the levels they did because of some inherent characteristic of men that everyone else lacked .
Just like the woman who thought men grew money like we grow hair , they just assumed men would keep doing it no matter how difficult they made it for men to do so .
Well , as Gomer Pyle would say – “ Surprise , surprise , surprise ! ”
Women wanted to be trapped in our old roles as wage slaves , so they enthusiastically jumped in to pushing us out of them .
The Powers That Be wanted docile little wage slaves to be the drones of their economic consumerist engine .
Simply because men are not as materialistic as women , the engineers of the velocity economy of goods and services made women their primary targets .
And , also because men are not as materialistic and consumption oriented , getting the man out of the middle and preventing him from practicing fiscal responsibility and trying to hold on to some of the wealth he generated , was the best way to drive the velocity economy .
So , they concentrated on putting women into the workforce and the $ $$ directly into their hands , and coming up with laws which allowed for the confiscation of whatever wealth men were still able to accumulate on their own .
So , it ’s pretty much a no - brainer to make the decision between working 60 hours per week at a job you hate , or working zero , or maybe 10 - 15 hours at something which is n’t too unpleasant , and fucking off the rest of the time – if both decisions give the guy the same results .
And , speaking of no -brainers , this article was written by one of them .

I am curious .
Why do you think you should own a house before you rent ( or never rent at all ) ?
Most people rent for 5 - 15 years before they buy their own place .
This is normal .
Because if you have another option , it ’s pissing away money when you rent .
My parents love having me around the house .
I fix things , I pay rent , I help cook and clean .
I live in the New England housing market where renting costs more than buying a house in most other places .
I do n’t know anyone who ’s both renting , and putting money in savings for a house .

I just want to say that I ’ve always wondered what the big deal is about living at home as long as everyone involved — that means parents and child , NOT society at large — are cool with the arrangement .
I know plenty of people who find the situation acceptable for them personally .
Further , to be multi-culti about this topic , it seems that in other cultures , it ’s very common for the children ( or maybe just the daughters ) to stay at home until they ’re married .

LOS ANGELES ( February 22 , 2006 )
After a thrilling men versus women battle to the finish in 2005 , defending champions Mark Saina from Kenya and Lyubov Denisova from Russia are returning for the 2006 City of Los Angeles Marathon presented by Honda .
The Sunday , March 19 event will once again include the newly - named Banco Popular Challenge , in which the professional women will be given a head start over the professional men , with $ 100,000 awarded to the first athlete to cross the finish line .
As proof of the excitement that the Banco Popular Challenge brings to the race , in 2005 Saina passed Denisova in the 26th mile after she was awarded a 15 minute and 50 second head start .

Very good post Grand .
Here ’s a thought I ’d like you ’re opinion on ( and anyone else who feels like joining in , of course ) … how many of the young men that still live at home live with both ( biological ) parents ?
Somehow , I do n’t see a lot of live - ins with their single moms or the proverbial “ evil stepmother ” .
If the parents are still making it work after 20 - odd years , they clearly must have more traditional values and practices than the average liberal - feminist - politically correct “ unit . ”
I ’d have to wonder if that environment is simply much more appealing and a major factor in that lifestyle .
Of course , I could be totally off - base with the above , but …if THAT ’s true , I doubt very many of them were drugged out of their minds as kids .
Their parents just would n’t buy into it .
Personally , I think drugging kids actually makes them stupid , rather than helping them improve on their focus .
None of the kids I knew made better grades after Ritalin–it keeps them at a solid average at best .
Only one told me it had good effects , and she ’s my youngest cousin .
I ’m still waiting out on the results for her .
So , do the motivated boys get drugged into being docile sheep that do as they ’re told end up being the ones that continue to feed into the system because they were too stoned for rational thought ?
Is that the Fematrix fabrication method ?
It would be a win - win situation … the boys are kept at a quiet average and turn into steady drones , allowing the girls to take the opportunities , and the ones that are n’t drugged weed themselves out of the system .

Now that I am done , I have moved back in with my parents due to the insane prices of houses , condo’s , and renting .
Why would I willingly flush at least $ 1,200 down the toilet each month for a shitty little apartment ?
Whats wrong with staying with my parents in their $ 1.75 million home while having a job ?
I have no debts , and $ 50 k saved up , yes I COULD be pissing that money away to rent an apartment , but that does n’t make much sense now does it .
Why not save until I can buy a condo / house ?

It ’s not a perfect arrangement , but it works while I save up .
I ’m not opposed to moving out to a house or apartment with roommates , as long as I knew the people and we had no problems .
I view renting as a way to work on credit , maintain some dignity in independence , and inherent flexibility .

From the main page of the above mentioned site –
Raceday Start Times :
7:57 A.M. Elite Women
Only !
8:17 A.M. Elite Men & Full Field .
From the results page linked off that page -
“ Official Start Time : 8:14:45 PST ”
From a news item on sfgate.com
Rack up another victory for the women in the Los Angeles Marathon .
Russian Lidiya Grigoryeva staved off a late effort by men’s champion Benson Cherono to win Sunday ’s race , marking the second time in three years that a woman has won “ The Challenge , ” a battle - ofthe- sexes format that allows women to start ahead of their male counterparts .
Grigoryeva , who set a course record in the women ’s division , earned a $ 100,000 bonus for the winning time of 2 hours , 25 minutes and 10 seconds . ”
The winning time for the fastest man was 2:08:40 , 16 minutes and 30 seconds faster than the fastest woman .
http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=trackandfield&id=2376365
“ This year , race organizers gave the top women runners a 16:46 head start in hopes of creating a close finish with the top men .
Last year ’s time differential was 15:50 . ”
Obviously the 15 minute 50 second head start given last year was not enough to insure that a woman won , so it was upped by almost a minute – just enough to let a woman “ win ” by 16 seconds .
If one had n’t , next year they would have probably been given almost 18 minutes , and so on until women were guaranteed a “ win . ”

I ’d have to wonder if that environment is simply much more appealing and a major factor in that lifestyle . ”
I could only think of 5 or 6 examples that I have seen personally of men still living at home in their late 20s or early 30s .
Unlike our trolls , I would not leap to the conclusion that my own experiences are the only way things could be , but of the ones I do know personally , all but one lived with single moms .
And , there was a lot more going on as well .
The relationships tended to be very emotionally incestuous , with the mother looking to the son to meet the emotional needs a husband is normally expected to provide .
Complicating matters even further , the boys tended to have the same view of their fathers that the mothers did , and to suffer from a guilty need to “ make it up to mom ” for the failures of all the men in her life – his father being the worst example .
The definition of manhood these boys formed both consciously and unconsciously was to be as unlike their fathers as possible , because their identification with their mothers made them need to place all the blame for the failure of the marriage ( or pairing ) on their father and hold their mother blameless – much like how we see women treated by the legal system today .
Their goal was to be “ better men ” than their fathers , which meant to be pretty much whatever mom wanted them to be because she was the only adult that they could look to for guidance in forming their male identity .
In addition , they suffered major guilt and anxiety if they contemplated abandoning her , as their “ no good ” fathers did , and the mother was also threatened by the potential loss of her substitute “ mate ” , so they tended not to form bonds which might lead to partnerships with women their own age .
The mothers would often reinforce this by being extremely critical of any woman their sons dated , either unconsciously projecting or explicitly stating that her rival was not good enough for “ my boy . ”
It is far from a new phenomenon .
It used to be much more common among widows who were afraid to be alone if their sons left , so they kept them bound emotionally to them .
In the very small town where I grew up , I can think of at least 3 middle - aged or older men who had never left home and never married who still lived with their mothers , and this was back in the 1950s and 60s .
In a town of 300 , that was one percent of the total population , which if it held true for the population as whole today would amount to 3 million men in that situation .
There even used to be a phrase for the role of the father in pushing the boy out of the nest and breaking the emotional codependency between mother and son .
It was called “ cutting the apron strings . ”
Relationships between teen aged boys and their fathers have always been strained , and it was virtually always the fathers who put a boot up the boys ’ butts and said “ Get out and find a job , you lazy bum ! ”
As far as the “ wicked stepmother ” goes , that is a female archetype , not a male one .
I do n’t follow your thinking that a more traditional upbringing would be more likely to make a boy live in an untraditional manner .
If his parents have a working traditional marriage , he is actually more likely to go out and try to find the same sort of arrangement for himself .
It seems like you are discounting the role of the parents beyond being furnishings in his life and thinking that all the decision - making power rests with him .
A traditional family would have been preparing him for the role of husband since he was an infant , and would be pressuring him to leave home and start his own family – particularly the father .
Do n’t confuse that stupid movie that is out now with reality .
In that movie , both of the parents are too weak to just tell the boy to grow up and get out .
The entire comedic premise is based on an inversion of reality .
Take a look at the instinctive reaction Lee has to boys who live at home past their young adulthood – that is the traditional male attitude .

I ca n’t speak for Lee , but I ’m guessing it was a gut reaction which came from being raised under the old style of masculinity which believed that the worst thing in the world which could be done to a boy is to “ mollycoddle ” him .
Guys like he and I grew up in an entirely different world than the one that you and guys of your generation grew up in .
It is often very difficult to bridge the gap between the two .

Romantic comedies have degenerated so badly that I avoid them altogether these days , unless there ’s absolutely nothing else to rent .
It all just went downhill after How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days .
I still find it hard to believe that I let myself be coerced into watching that garbage .
* shudder *
I suppose then that I approached it from the wrong angle .
The people that I know fill the opposite demographic of the people that you know , but the fathers are usually somewhat …absent .
All functional , more traditional families to be sure but no one ever tried to cut anyone ’s apron strings .
The mother / father relationship that I know the most about is basically this : dad lets mom do whatever she wants .
Thinking about the others , I suppose that ’s true in the other 3 cases that I know directly although since I had less interaction with the parents than with the child , I ca n’t be totally sure .
In that regard you could be right .
OTOH , there is n’t guilt so much as being pretty damn comfy .
In their own words , they ’ll leave the nest when / if they find a suitable girl and not before .
It ’s possible that they ’re on the extremist side of traditional , but since they never portrayed it to me in a way other than “ why should I waste my money on a bachelor pad when I have everything I need basically for free ” , it ’s doubtful .
The one person that I know that lives with his single mom is desperately looking for a way out –mostly the cost of living is just too prohibitive for him to do so .

Crack open a beer , pass the controller , and let these selfish women experience “ freedom ” .
Good luck to ya ladies .
Sometimes I read an article and it clarifies the terrific position I am in .
No debt , hefty positive net worth , I work a demanding job because I want to , like the challenge to my abilities , and look forward to the career growth .
I can earn as much as I want , within reason , and should I want to scale back and work half the year and spend the other 6 months traveling , I can do that .
I can do contract work , save up for 4 months at a time , then take 2 months off out of country .
Or decide to move down market and take a position well under my abilities , that offers low stress , low bs and good hours and benefits .
I can do all of these things because I do n’t have a cavernous mortgage , any car debt or leases , or kids , support payments , alimony , a wife , an ex wife or any of those financial burdens .
When I want my fill of kids , I fly to visit my nieces and nephews , and when I tire , I leave and go home to my own place .
Ideal .

Lurker , I ca n’t speak for Lee , but I ’m guessing it was a gut reaction which came from being raised under the old style of masculinity which believed that the worst thing in the world which could be done to a boy is to “ mollycoddle ” him .
Guys like he and I grew up in an entirely different world than the one that you and guys of your generation grew up in .
It is often very difficult to bridge the gap between the two .
Some of the men I remember most fondly for teaching me some hard lessons which have served me well throughout my life would no doubt seem like total assholes to you .
That ’s the place I was coming from GC .
When I was 18 , I moved out , was given $ 50 and went off to school .
Had to get my appetite out of the house and free up a bedroom .
I ca n’t think of a worse thing than to hold a young man ’s hand and let him live at home for years and years and years .
Young adults , men and women , need to strike out into the world , make their own way , earn and maintain their independence both financially and emotionally .
Usually that means eating lots of pasta while starting out , and that is normal .
Going without builds character , and it seems that Lurker does n’t want to go without when he can move back home and have it easy .

Saving money is great , but adults get out and make it on their own .
This is n’t guilt tripping , this is old school , mid-20th century masculinity offering its opinion .
You can afford to live on your own , in your own apartment .
So do it .
Your parents lifestyle is n’t yours , which is what any adult who moves out learns very quickly .
You want to live in a $ 1.75 million dollar home ?
Then go out and save and work for 25 years , and just like your parents , you too will have that big home .
But not now .
You have n’t earned it yet .
This entails NOT living with mom and dad .
It is a basic of human development , and not moving on when one is 18 - 22 just thwarts development .
That ’s how guys my age were raised :
Get the fuck out of the house , grow up , earn a living and pay your own way .
And if you do n’t , you ’re just not willing to cut the apron strings .
You are taking the easy way out .
So , yeah , I view living at home past age 23 to be a sign that most have n’t learned to support themselves ( because someone who lives at home is n’t ) , because they are playing it safe .

“ The people that I know fill the opposite demographic of the people that you know , but the fathers are usually somewhat …absent .
All functional , more traditional families to be sure but no one ever tried to cut anyone ’s apron strings .
The mother / father relationship that I know the most about is basically this : dad lets mom do whatever she wants . ”
In addition , the last one I could remember was probably about 10 years ago .
Much has changed in that time .
I also have a totally different perspective than you would – you are looking at your contemporaries and their parents , I ’m looking at my contemporaries and their children .
You know a great many more people your age than I do , and thus your observations are more likely to reflect the current situation .
I ca n’t actually think of any families I know that fit my definition of “ traditional . ”
It ’s very difficult to describe to a young person of today just how much the social context has changed .
There simply is not the same kind of social pressure on boys and men to get out there and earn enough to support a family that there was when I was their age .
I ca n’t think of even one of the guys I grew up with who did n’t leave home shortly after graduation from HS and never returned .
I ’m sure that if any of us had even asked that our fathers would have said “ WHAT ?!?!
Are you crazy ?!?!!! ”
I do n’t know if you even know about the phenomenon among birds of the parents literally pushing the young out of the nest , but that was pretty much the norm up until about 20 years ago .
Returning home would have been admitting defeat , failure , and would be the ultimate humiliation .
RealMen( tm ) handled their own problems and took responsibility for their own lives .
Two things you said stood out for me – actually three .
The fact that the fathers were absent , that they “ let ” the mothers do whatever they want , and that life for the boys was “ comfy . ”
The picture I got was that the fathers were a sort of shadow presence , or non-presence , leaving the wife to run the home and not forcing the boys to make the transition from dependency to independence .
That fits in with what I have heard from a lot of young women over the past 15 years or so – that their potential mates are looking for someone to take up where their mother leaves off , without missing a meal .
But , to return to your original question .
Boys today are simply not under the same pressure to succeed as they were when I was growing up .
Much of that pressure has now been transferred to the girls , and the boys left to just drift along .
The multiple social institutions which used to exist – many in the form of all - male organizations – have been destroyed and boys are left with absent fathers and mass media to look to for clues about their role in life ( god help them ) .
For example , every one of my circle of friends in HS had some sort of job during at least their last 2 years of HS if not before .
If we wanted cars , we got jobs and bought them and the gas to run them , and the tires , and the insurance .
Like Lee mentioned , we put ourselves through college however we could .
We did n’t have a safety net .
Failure was not an option .
But , in those days it was possible .
I know that it is n’t any more .
Real wages have become so depressed and prices so inflated that most young people are locked out of the relative self - sufficiency that my generation enjoyed .
I could easily earn enough in a summer to buy a new Volkswagen Beetle ( the original model , $ 1,666 brand new ) , and could make enough working for a couple of bucks an hour to pay my rent and food while I was going to college .
Kids ca n’t do that any more , and so they extend indolent adolescence for at least 10 years longer than they used to .
They do n’t just spontaneously wake up one day and decide to completely change their lives , they tend to keep drifting along in the same groove ( or rut ) that they are used to .

Re : What ’s Happening to Boys ?
Post by guy lurking about on Mar 31 , 2006 , 11:38 pm
Lee ,
I have no disagreement with your view .
It ’s perfectly respectable that a man should head out into the world on his own at a young age .
OTOH , there is nothing particularly wrong with living with your folks either , especially if you ’ve lost your job , or are trying to save , or any number of reasons that make living on your own tough at the moment .
And if your parents are willing to take you in , I see no reason why not .
I ’m not going to lie and say I do n’t prefer to live on my own – I do .
I like my privacy , and yes , sometimes having parents around can be a pain .
For some , living with the parents may not be a good idea , and I do n’t recommend this choice to everyone .
But for those who are comfortable with it , or have to do it , they have valid reasons and their choice to stay with their parents is perfectly fine too , as long as they are responsible , help out , and work towards eventually living on their own .
Personalities are different , and some are able to spread their wings early on and head out on their own .
Others are n’t .
I say , to each his own , and ultimately , it ’s more important to keep the focus on the main goal , which is saving , living responsibly , and being a good , useful person in one ’s own community .
That is n’t compromised by where you choose to live , either on your own or with your folks .

What the hell do you expect , Lee ?
They were raised in the age of the nanny state .
Their mommies probably never let them ride their bikes without a helmet and knee pads .
If their old man backhanded them for talking back , they were taught they could call the cops on him .
Guys do n’t learn the old way because it arises spontaneously from their testicles .
Their dads were probably so marginalized out of their lives by mom that he could never teach it to them , and most of the adult men they have run into have probably been corporate back - stabbing assholes like Ken Lay .
The fem -nags have been trying to “ deconstruct ” the kind of masculinity that you and I know since long before these boys were born , let ’s not take the fact that the bitches have succeeded , out on the boys who are the result of it .

Boys are wising up to the Fact that Men have been turned into an exploitable resource .
Only Gays and Women matter in the media .
We are going to see many More “ Bareback Mountings ” as Michael Savage calls it .
Our culture sees Men only in what they can provide for Women .
And Men are bailing on Women .
So now the Women folk are starting to panic .
You say Marriage Strike and Women immediately show up to defend the benefits ( really for themselves ) and why we should willingly put our heads in the noose .
No Thanks honey .
The Elite now realize the fruits of decades of predation of Males and the imbalance provided to Women is catching up with them .
And they are frightened about our future .
The Conservatives LIARS have paid lip service to Family Life and Faith .
Meanwhile they too have pandered to the Lesbians who despise Men , Families , Children , & Marriage .
Islam a very masculine dominated Faith will not capitulate to Feminism .
Check out the Woman being buried alive for Adultery on the website .
TheReligionofPeace.com and ask yourself if they will cave into the FemNags .
Here is a surprise for you .
I met a really hot Blonde a few years ago .
A former Stripper who turned Moslem .
She is 28 and Married to a Moslem Man who is 41 .
She told me she loves a Strong Man who dominates , protects , and cherishes her .
Ali does all of those things but is also very sweet to her .
With Decent Men , Moslem Women are very happy .
Abusive Men are enabled but most Men want a happy family life .

I share those values , Lee , but bear in mind that those very values have been the most devastating weapons that the feminidiots have used against us .
If women had respected those old values , we would not be in the mess we are in .
Boys are adapting .
They are finding ways to beat the system which has enslaving them as its main purpose .
The upcoming crop of 30 something women are going to left out in the cold as no group has ever been before .
I ’m glad to see it .
I actually think guys like us should be supporting young men who make this decision , because the culture sure as hell is going to try to shame them into letting BranMuffin attach herself to their wallets .
As long as another guy joins the marriage strike , I really do n’t care how he goes about it .

The only sudden reason for the concern for young boys is that women now realize that their daughters will not have a “ suitable ” wallet to rape in the future .
They are only concerned about the loss of potential victims and nothing more !!!

The Pool of Quality high earner Males is shrinking .
And Women are coming to the realization that Butch the Biker is not a reliable Husband .
Maybe a good Fuck Buddy but not a decent selection for a mate .
Oops maybe there are choices in life and consequences to those choices .
Maybe ???
This is the crux of the problem .
Unrealistic expectations that AW have with a self reinforcing delusion fed by the Idiot Box and the Dream Factory in Hollyweird .

This post is a little unusual compared to the normal NI fare .
Instead of reporting on a cool new development in science , I 'm here to solicit your opinions on a project I was recently made aware of , one that aims to take a page out of the creationist playbook in order to help educate the public on matters regarding evolution .
The project is the Evolution Musuem , and the plan is to build a museum dedicated to evolution in Petersburg , KY , opposite the Creation Museum that I had the opportunity to wander round last year .
According to their mission statement :
The Evolution Museum believes that all people must be educated on the theory of evolution .
The world needs balance and the Evolution Museum aims to create balance in the Midwestern states of the U.S.
The proposed location for the Evolution Museum is right across the highway from the Creation Museum .
The Evolution Museum will be a non-profit and funded through online donations .
The pillars of the non-profit will hold the values of transparency and social direction .
All activities will be published online and members will be able to give guidance to the non-profit .
The creator of the project approached me in order to gauge interest in his idea , and to see if there exists the sort of support that would make it worthwhile to begin to get the project off the ground .
They will be looking to raise donations and attract volunteers from web designers all the way to lawyers and accountants .

Couple Arrested In Baltimore Asking For Directions
Posted on by fjsva
Baltimore City police arrested a Virginia couple over the weekend after they asked an officer for directions .
WBAL -TV 11 News I - Team reporter David Collins said Joshua Kelly and Llara Brook , of Chantilly , Va. , got lost leaving an Orioles game on Saturday .
Collins reported a city officer arrested them for trespassing on a public street while they were asking for directions .
" In jail for eight hours -- sleeping on a concrete floor next to a toilet , " Kelly said .
" It was a nightmare , " Brook said .
" I was in there thinking I was just dreaming and waiting to wake up . "
Collins reported it was a nightmare ending to a nearly perfect day .
He said the couple went to a company picnic and watched the Orioles beat Kansas City .
It was their first trip to Camden Yards and asked two people for directions to Interstate 95 South when they left .
Collins said somehow they ended up in the Cherry Hill section of south Baltimore .
Hopelessly lost , relief melted away concerns after they spotted a police vehicle .
" I said , ' Thank goodness , could you please get us to 95 ? " Kelly said .
" The first thing that she said to us was no -- you just ran that stop sign , pull over , " Brook said .
" It was n't a big deal .
We 'll pay the stop sign violation , but can we have directions ? "
" What she said was ' You found your own way in here , you can find your own way out . ' "
Kelly said .
Collins said the couple spotted another police vehicle and flagged that officer down for directions .
But Officer Natalie Preston , a six - year veteran of the force , intervened .
" That really threw us for a loop when she stepped in between our cars , " Kelly said .
" ( She ) said my partner is not going to step in front of me and tell you directions if I 'm not . "
Collins reported the circumstances got worse .
Kelly pulled 40 feet forward parking next to a curb and put his flashers on while Brook was on the phone to her father hoping he could help her with directions .
Both her parents are police officers in the Harrisburg , Pa. , area .
" ( Brook 's father ) was in the middle of giving us directions when the officer screeched up behind us and got out of the car and asked me to step out .
I obeyed , " Kelly said .
" I obeyed everything -- stepped out of the car , put my hands behind my back , and the next thing I know , I was getting arrested for trespassing . "
" By this time , I was completely in tears , " Brook said .
" I said , ' Ma'am , you know , we just need your help .
We are not trying to cause you any trouble .
I 'm not leaving him here . '
What she did was walk over to my side of the car and said , ' Ok , we are taking you downtown , too . ' "
Collins said the couple was released from jail without being charged with anything .
Brook is now concerned the arrest may complicate a criminal background check she 's going through in her job as a child care worker .
Collins said police left Kelly 's car unlocked and the windows down at the impound lot .
He reported a cell phone charger , pair of sunglasses and 20 CDs were stolen .
Baltimore City police said they are looking into the incident .

Our recent piece on the terrorist paedophile bus -spotter driven off the UK 's streets by public and police hostility prompted a certain amount of speculation as to what exactly are your rights when you whip off the lens cap .
The answer ?
You do n't have any rights , as this shock CCTV image proves :
Yup , this particular omniboligist made the mistake of taking too close an interest in a " sensitive " vintage Routemaster and in his enthusiasm to get the money shot strayed within 20 yards of a defenceless kiddie while wielding a highly suspect telephoto lens .
Mercifully , the Met has moved with lightning speed to supress the threat to national security , with armed officers offering the perp the choice of deleting the images from his SD card , or facing arrest , detention and eventual half - hearted apology under the Prevention of Terrorism Act .
However , while fully occupied with defending the realm , the Met 's finest have failed to notice that a Staffordshire bull terrier is " sharing " cheese and onion crisps with the aforementioned nipper while the devil dog's owner - down from Leeds for the day to attend the " ASBO of the Year " awards - is using the opportunity to steal the cops ' car radio in the belief that it contains a magic chip offering free Sky TV .
Officers are also completely oblivious to the presence of Boris Johnson , seen here with an official from Tory Party Central Office bearing a chest of gold acquired from the smouldering rubble of Tariq Aziz 's Baghdad residence in " morally ambiguous " circumstances .
The female firearms operative on the right , meanwhile , is about to enjoy a ride in an ambulance after being hit by a Volvo S70 packed to the gunwales with a record - breaking 12 passengers .
And finally , the whole scene is played out to a backdrop of Optimus Prime - fresh from his destruction of Croydon - who 's been chasing the Volvo for 20 miles in the hope there might be room for one more in the back and the driver can drop him off at his Tottenham bedsit . ®

Fewer caribou calves are being born and more are dying as a result of a warming climate .
The problem is timing .
Peak food availability in West Greenland no longer corresponds to the peak time of caribou births , according to a study by Eric Post of Penn State .
Throughout the Arctic winter , when there is no plant growth , caribou dig through snow to find lichens .
In spring they switch to grazing on newly growing willows , sedges , and flowering herbs .
As the birth season approaches , cued by increasing day length , they migrate to areas where newly - emergent food is plentiful .
But the routine that ’s worked for millennia is faltering because caribou are unable to keep up with accelerated plant cycles tied to global warming .
Now when pregnant females arrive at the calving grounds they find plants that have already reached peak productivity and are declining in nutritional value .
The plants initiate growth in response to temperature , not day length ( unlike the caribou ) , and are peaking dramatically earlier in response to rising temperatures .
“ Spring temperatures at our study site in West Greenland have risen by more than 4 degrees Celsius ( 7.2 degrees F ) over the past few years , ” said Post .
“ As a result , the timing of plant growth has advanced , but calving has not . ”
The phenomenon is called trophic mismatch and is a predicted consequence of climate change .
Trophic mismatches have been documented in birds .
The most famous example being the study on Dutch birds and their caterpillar prey highlighted in Al Gore ’s film An Inconvenient Truth .
“ Our work is the first documentation of a developing trophic mismatch in a terrestrial mammal as a result of climatic warming , ” said Post .
“ And the rapidity with which this mismatch has developed is eye - opening , to say the least . ”

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - An Internet analyst for a major Wall Street firm argues in a new report that Google Inc and Amazon.com Inc will be long - term winners , while Yahoo and IAC InterActiveCorp fall by the wayside and eBay Inc becomes a merger target .
Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Jeffrey Lindsay argues in a 310 - page report entitled “ U.S. Internet : The End of the Beginning ” to be published on Tuesday that Google and Amazon are best placed to withstand the current economic downturn .
“ We expect two players to continue to perform strongly , Google and Amazon , ” Lindsay writes .
“ Both Google and Amazon.com are still racking up annual growth rates in the 30 - 40 percent range , with only a relatively modest slowdown in sight . ”
Lindsay reiterates his previous positions that Yahoo eventually will be sold to Microsoft Corp and that Barry Diller ’s IAC e-commerce conglomerate will go ahead in August with its five - way split - up , as planned .
“ Arguably the weakest players have strayed furthest from their original competences and have been operating largely as conglomerates , ” the Bernstein analyst says of Yahoo and IAC .
In the short - run , however , Lindsay believes Yahoo will see gains if it reaches a deal to turn over some part of its search advertising sales to Google to run or if Microsoft resumes acquisition negotiations .
He argues that eBay “ could potentially attract a Microsoft - like suitor in the future , ” especially if growth in its core auctions business fails to resume and because eBay could spin off its PayPal or Skype units to make a deal work .
Even the strongest companies have weakness , Lindsay argues .
Google has yet to articulate a compelling strategy to achieve the same level of strength on the emerging mobile Internet that it has on the computer - based Web .
Amazon and eBay are likely to be forced eventually to pay state sales taxes .
Ironically , he notes , this may work to their advantage as large companies , because they have more resources than smaller e-commerce players to collect such taxes .
Hans Reiser , the Linux programmer facing a mandatory 25 - to life term for killing his wife , might disclose the location of Nina Reiser 's body in exchange for a reduced term , Alameda County District Attorney Thomas Orloff told Threat Level on Friday .
" There 's been some overtures , " he said .
" But everything is in its preliminary stage . "
Another source familiar with the proposal , speaking on condition of anonymity because no deal has been struck , said Reiser , the prosecution and Alameda County Superior Court Judge Larry Goodman would have to sign off on the proposed deal .
Under the plan , Reiser 's cooperation could reduce his April conviction from first - degree murder to second degree .
A second - degree conviction in California carries a mandatory 15 - to - life sentence .
" The only real leverage he has is if he can provide a body , " the source said .
" He really does n't have any options left .
Even if he won a retrial somehow , he 'd likely be convicted . "
Reiser , 44 , was convicted by an Alameda County Superior Court jury of killing his wife , who was last seen at his Oakland hills house on Sept. 3 , 2006 .
She dropped off the divorcing couple 's two kids to stay with their father for part of the Labor Day weekend .
During his 11 appearances on the witness stand , the defendant claimed his 31 - year - old wife abandoned the estranged couple 's two young children and moved back to Russia .
The couple met there in 1998 , when he was overseas hiring programmers for his Namesys software company that produced the ReiserFS filesystem .
He testified that , before she vanished , he accused her of bilking the company out of tens of thousands of dollars .
The deal , as it stands in its early stages , would be off if an autopsy of the body somehow demonstrated that it was first - degree , premeditated murder with , for example , " two bullet holes to the back of the head . "
The source also cautioned that it remains to be seen whether Reiser would follow through with the proposal .
Reiser remains jailed without bail .
His sentencing is scheduled for July 9 .
" There are ongoing discussions , " the source said .
Reiser stands a greater chance of seeing the light of day under a second - degree conviction .
He would be eligible for parole in 15 years and would stand a better chance at receiving it if he disclosed a body .
Under California law , the governor possesses the power to veto a parole board 's decision .
Denying culpability is a strong mark against winning parole .
Before trial began in November , Reiser declined a deal with prosecutors in which he would have received an 11 - year term in exchange to pleading guilty to manslaughter and disclosing the location of Nina Reiser 's body .
On a side note , for Reiser to disclose the body might bring some element of closure to his two children , a boy now 8 and a girl 6 .
They live with Nina 's parents in St. Petersburg , Russia .
The boy , in letters to his father last year , asked his dad why he " hid " his mother .

Over the weekend , The Pirate Bay " celebrated " its second anniversary of being raided by the Swedish police .
On May 31 , 2006 , law enforcement seized all of the popular torrent tracker 's servers and backups , and arrested two of the site 's operators .
The site did n't stay down for long , though — just a few days later , everything was business as usual for The Pirate Bay .
A court date in Sweden has yet to be set , and support for the site appears to be stronger than ever .
Since the raids , the predictable has happened : the site 's popularity has exploded .
The Pirate Bay says that its number of Bit Torrent peers has grown from 2.5 million to over 12 million , and that registered users have grown from 1 million to 2.7 million .
The tracker is more popular than ever , and continues to grow every day .
" It 's awesome to see the support the community show us .
Even in our bad moments , we get your support , " said the Pirate Bay 's admins in the posting .
The general reaction across the Internet is quite positive — and largely pro Pirate Bay .
Commenters on the Pirate Bay 's blog post , Digg , and swaths of other blog entries are almost unanimous in their support of the site and its goal of remaining online and operational .
TorrentFreak even named the anniversary " Happy Pirates independence day . "
Many believe that the Swedish police acted inappropriately when they seized the Pirate Bay 's servers , that the police had it in for Pirate Bay before the raid even happened , and that the reason things are taking so long to go to court is because law enforcement can't find any useful evidence .
Of course , not everyone is a friend of the Pirate Bay .
The motion picture and movie industries are at war with the site and want it taken down for good .
The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry is one of its most determined foes , battling the pirates last year over a domain issue and then suing the four main backers for 15 million kroner ( $ 2.5 million ) for violating the copyrights on a number of films , PC games , and music .
The Motion Picture Association of America has also slapped the site with a claim for $ 15.4 million in damages for facilitating copyright infringement .
The Pirate Bay is n't exactly known for taking these threats seriously , however , and recently declared that " the record companies can go screw themselves . "
So , will The Pirate Bay continue to be a safe haven for illicit content in the months and years ahead ?
It certainly appears so at this point .
Industry trade groups trumpeted the 2006 raids as a major victory and claimed that the site had been permanently dismantled , but subsequent events have demonstrated that those celebrations were extremely premature .
Even if the Pirate Bay were eventually taken down , it would live on in the thousands of other torrent trackers that users would divert their attention to .
In fact , the Internet 's reaction just highlights the futility of Big Content 's efforts to take down sites like the Pirate Bay in the first place and why the focus has turned towards deep packet inspection , throttling , and filtering .
People love their BitTorrent and will continue to use it — with or without the Pirate Bay .
Now that neocon ideology has utterly failed , its proponents do n’t seem to know when to shut up and go home .
Take Bill Kristol , who appeared on Fox News Sunday this morning and suddenly started acting like Hillary Clinton ’s best friend :
I think Hillary Clinton was gracious .
She ’s put behind her the horrible sexism and misogyny the Democratic primary voters demonstrated , which I ’m appalled by personally , never would have happened in the Republican Party .
Aha !
So it was the Democratic voters who were misogynous !
You mean like the person who said this ?
The only people for Hillary Clinton are the Democratic establishment and white women … it would be crazy for the Democratic party to follow the establishment that ’s led them to defeat year after year …
White Women are a problem – but , you know … we all live with that …
Oh wait , that was Kristol himself , also speaking on Fox News .
But that would never happen in the Republican party .
Hmmm , what about Republican operative Alex Castellanos , who said that it is OK to call some women bitches , and in Hillary ’s case “ it ’s accurate ” .
Or Marc Rudov ( also on Fox News ! ) saying that Clinton ’s “ nagging voice ” was the reason she lost .

Check out this installment in the infamous series of religious anti-evolution videos starring former TV star Kirk Cameron .
In this one , Kirk looks on in amazement as some weenie explains that the banana is " the atheist 's nightmare , " because it is so perfectly suited to the human hand that God must have created it expressly for our benefit .
As Kottke sez , " Not that this guy cares or whatever , but the modern banana is a cultivated fruit … i.e. pressured by humans to , oh what 's the word … evolve into its present form .
And other varieties of bananas are smaller or larger and differently shaped .
Some wild bananas have large hard seeds .

The long - awaited teaser trailer for Iron Sky , the science fiction comedy from the Finnish makers of Star Trek parody Star Wreck , is finally out .
And unlike Wreck , which always seemed a bit pointless , Sky looks like it could be really twisted and awesome .
For one thing , the script is by Johanna Sinisalo , author of the award - winning Troll : A Love Story .
For another , it 's about Nazis on the Moon .
And finally , it 's the first - ever open - source science fiction epic .
Iron
Sky 's tagline pretty much sums it up :
In 1945 the Nazis went to the Moon .
In 2018 , they are coming back .
It 's a dark science fiction comedy that plays with Finland 's history of being oppressed by Sweden , Russia , and most of all the Nazis , and continues Star Wreck 's trend of mocking totalitarian regimes .
Director Timo Vuorensola explains :
Iron
Sky is a story about conformity : those who want to conform , those who want to make others conform , and those who refuse to conform .

And to make this new film possible , the Finns have developed a new web site to facilitate collaborative filmmaking .
Unlike the " chaotic " process in which 3,000 people worked on Star Wreck , the producers hope to harness a more orderly effort involving 10,000 creators this time around , thanks to a new site called WreckAMovie.com .
The site is also being used to create Finnish horror movie Sauna .

Mary Tillman has a message for the National Football League :
Help me find out what happened to my son .
Tillman 's death was mourned coast to coast , and the public and his family were told by the Pentagon that he died a " warrior 's death " charging up a hill , urging on his fellow Rangers .
His funeral was nationally televised , and Arizona Sen .
John McCain , now the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , was among those delivering eulogies .
Yet the circumstances of his death turned out to be an obscene hoax .
Tillman was , in fact , killed by friendly fire .
The NFL has seized on Pat Tillman as another way to connect with the red , white and blue sports fan .
Earlier this year , former Commissioner Paul Tagliabue brought together the NFL and the United Service Organizations to build the Pat Tillman USO Center at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan .
And the league just opened an exhibit dedicated to Tillman at its Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton , Ohio .
Central Park is closed from 1 a.m. to 6 a.m. Mr. Quest was arrested about 3:40 a.m. near 64th Street and West Drive , according to a criminal complaint .

Mr. Quest was initially stopped for loitering , and the officer , following standard procedure , searched him , a law enforcement official said .
The officer found a small zip - lock bag in Mr. Quest ’s left jacket pocket , the complaint said .
Mr. Quest confirmed the contents of the bag by saying , “ I ’ve got some meth in my pocket , ” according to the complaint .
At Friday ’s arraignment , Judge Anthony J. Ferrara told Mr. Quest that the case would be dismissed and sealed if he reported back in October and demonstrated sufficient progress in his therapy .
The judge also agreed that there would be no restrictions placed on Mr. Quest ’s ability to travel .
Mr. Quest , 46 , looking haggard and stressed after 12 hours in custody , still dressed in blue jeans , sneakers and a navy - blue zippered jacket , declined to comment as he left the courtroom .
His lawyer , Alan Abramson , said only , “ Mr. Quest did not realize that the park had a curfew , and was returning to his hotel with friends . ”
Mr. Quest , who is British , is a familiar face to viewers of late - night international programming on CNN .
He has his own hourlong feature program , called “ Quest , ” according to his biography on the CNN Web site .
The biography says that he has reported on topics including the Iraq war and attends the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , every year .
The next podcast is up .
Today we talked about why we ’re doing a podcast in the first place , took some questions / suggestions from listeners , and got into a fight over whether programmers should learn C. Guess which side I took .
There are some improvements , already .
First , there ’s an RSS feed , so you can subscribe and get each weekly podcast pushed to you .
Here ’s how you would subscribe using Apple iTunes , for example :
Run iTunes Choose Advanced | Subscribe to Podcast Paste in this URL : http://blog.stackoverflow.com/index.php?feed=podcast
There is no step 4 .
Now , depending on your settings ( under Podcasts in Preferences ) , iTunes will download the latest podcasts and put them on your iPod when you dock it .
You do n’t have to do anything special .
I ’m not going to post here every time there ’s a new podcast ; you ’ll have to subscribe .
A couple of people volunteered to help by typing up transcripts for the hearing - impaired , the pressed - for - time , and search engines .
That ’s a great idea !
I opened up a wiki where anyone can contribute to the weekly transcript .
If you can spare a few minutes to transcribe even a part of the podcast , that would be greatly appreciated by the many readers for whom an audio podcast is inaccessible .
Jeff has a new blog for the podcast at http://blog.stackoverflow.com/

It 's just about all you could ask for in a hardcore SF adventure . " -- Paul di Fillippo , SCI - FI.COM

This is Science Fiction . " -- David Brin
Outside the Ghetto and the Ghastly Example of Michael Crichton
There are a number of writers of SF — I ’ll briefly consider “ speculative fiction ” in general before turning to science fiction specifically — who have never written genre fiction .
That is , at least as far as the publishers and bookstores are concerned .
Some of these fall into the nebulous area of “ literature ” in which snooty professors in college creative writing classes automatically flunk a story that is about robots .
Some fall into the less nebulous but poorly defined category of “ best seller . ”
Some of the literary writers who have dodged the sf label include Salman Rushdie and Margret Atwood , either through their own means or their own publishers ’ insistence as described by Bryan Appleyard .
Similarly , although for very different reasons , some writers like Stephen King and Michael Crichton have never been marketed as genre writers .
Stephen King ’s first novel Carrie was about a girl with telekinesis , but was not marketed like a genre novel .
I ’ve been thinking about this topic as I ’d like to reach wider audiences , and the new example of Final Theory : A Novel by Mark Alpert hangs in my head .
Non-fiction science manages to reach out effectively , with books like Cosmos and The Elegant Universe : Superstrings , Hidden Dimensions , and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory regularly hitting bestseller lists without having to disguise them as non-science .
Not so for fiction .
The science fiction that escapes from the ghetto seems to have a few things in common , the primary one being accessibility .
It ’s usually set in the present , or the very near future .
The genre elements can be significant , but fewer seems to be better , so the readers have less to assimilate .
True fans of science fiction , on the other hand , are happy to see “ FTL ” unexplained , and would be bored to read a page of explanation , no matter how well written , about the concept .
I recall reading the first few chapters of Encounter With Tiber by Buzz Aldrin and Stephen Barnes and having difficulty continuing because every term and concept was laboriously explained .
The SF fan will even happily grok made - up words and technologies without immediate explanation as long as their role is clear in context .
For the last several decades the king of bestselling science fiction , not called science fiction of course , has been Michael Crichton .
He knows how to write a page turner .
His characters , while not very deep , are sympathetic .
His work survives the translation to film and has been very popular , reaching billions of viewers worldwide .
I ’ve read a number of his books and have seen many of the movies , mostly enjoying them .
In my opinion , however , he has three fatal flaws and my intellectual integrity prevents me from using him as a model for how to get science fiction to the wider public .
His themes are consistently anti-science , he makes large and consistent errors in getting the science right , and he consistently insists he ’s not just a writer but that his M.D. and his research gives him expertise on the science he gets wrong .
Oh , and he ’s a dick , too , writing one critic into a book of his as a child rapist .
The theme of much of Crichton ’s work is that of Frankenstein : playing god brings destruction .
This is the message of Jurassic Park and Prey , for starters .
There are related themes in books like Sphere , which indicates that there are things that humankind is better off not knowing .
Now , I would n’t say that there ’s anything wrong with a cautionary tale .
They have their place and their strengths .
When a writer devotes so much time to pointing out the great arrogance and hubris of scientists and how it always brings doom , well , I think that sucks .
We do n’t have enough positive examples of scientists in books and movies .
What we get is that they may be smart , but that they ’re rarely wise .
Part of me fears that this message resonates with the public in much the same way that people vote for president based not on a candidate ’s intellectual ability and judgment , but upon some idea about who would be more fun to have a beer with .
Now , for a writer who seems to take great joy in how scientists make mistakes so often and are not to be trusted , Crichton is guilty of making fundamental errors in many of his books .
I do n’t mean something small like “ photon ” being replaced by “ proton ” in one sentence accidentally .
I mean , just plain not having a clue what the hell he ’s talking about .
While I ’m not going to criticize the idea of getting dinosaur DNA from mosquitoes in amber , which is neat if not quite possible , it is clear that he has no idea about chaos theory which he uses as a theme in Jurassic Park .
Chaos theory does not mean , without “ Chaotician ” Malcolm even writing down a single equation , that every complex system will fail .
Zoos routinely operate without immediate widespread disaster .
A similar analysis of the space shuttle , including the math , indicates it ’s too complicated to fly , but it does .
Why ?
Because complicated things can be understood , individual parts can be tested for quality , and feedback control systems do n’t let just anything happen .
And moreover , chaos theory is about understanding predictable aspects of non-linear systems , not just throwing up your hands and saying “ it ’s unpredictable ! ”
Luckily , the book is about dinosaurs , not chaos theory .
However , his books on global warming , State of Fear , and on the dangers of nanotechnology , Prey , are riddled with outright errors and misunderstandings that undermine the premise of each .
Realclimate.org deconstructs State of Fear , while Chris Phoenix at Nanotechnology
Now explains how the science in Prey “ is n’t real . ”
Please do take a look at both of these links if you have any doubts about the case I ’m making here .
They ’re both very clear and compelling .
While Crichton paints scientists full of hubris causing death and destruction , threatening our entire way of life , he himself is setting back the public perception of not only individual branches of science but of science itself .
And he has the gall to think he understands the science better than the scientists doing the work , at least in the case of global warming ; he lectured to packed crowds and advised politicians about his skewed and incorrect views all the while claiming the working climatologists doing the work had the skewed and incorrect views .
Well , luckily for us there ’s a way of determining if he got his facts right or wrong , and he got a great number of them wrong .
The problem is that he ’s full of hubris himself and apparently has n’t acknowledged his numerous mistakes and misunderstandings .
He ’s just like the stereotypical hypocritical neocon , who intentionally labels their enemies with their own shortcomings and uses antonyms interchangeably with synonyms .
Hence the scientists possess the sin of hubris and Crichton fancies that he himself is writing scientifically accurate work even while it ’s full of anti-science .
If the anti-science itself is n’t the key to Crichton ’s popularity , I ca n’t help but wonder at how positive an influence he could have been if he ’d been promoting science instead of attacking it .
Finally , if you ’re like me , both fascinated and repulsed by the popularity of a writer like Crichton , enjoying his work even while being revolted by its flaws , check out The Science of Michael Crichton : An Unauthorized Exploration into the Real Science behind the Fictional Worlds of Michael Crichton ( Science of Pop Culture series ) , edited by a friend of mine , Keven R. Grazier .
The book contains essays by several experts ( including Ray Kurzweil ) concerning the accuracy or lack thereof of the science in Crichton ’s work .
If I ’d finished reading the book , I ’d probably have written a longer post !

15 Reasons : Piracy Attack of a Ship is Different from Hijacking of an Aircraft
ADVERTISEMENTS
We very often hear about piracy attack on ships and very few cases of hijacking of aircrafts .
Why so ?
Piracy attack on ships are different from Hijacking of aircrafts .
Though there are some similarities in both cases , the differences are more .
For clarity , I prefer to use the term ‘ piracy ’ for ships and the term ‘ hijacking ’ for aircrafts .
Here are the similarities in Piracy and Hijacking :
Surprise element :
In both the cases , there is no specific warning and we come to know only after the ship or aircraft is trapped .
In both the cases , there is no specific warning and we come to know only after the ship or aircraft is trapped .
Organized groups :
In both the cases it is carried out by organized groups .
In both the cases it is carried out by organized groups .
Use of compact , lethal weapons : Compact , lethal weapons find immediate applications in both the cases .
Here are the 15 differences in Piracy and Hijacking :
1.Motive :
Piracy is a terrorist act to earn quick money .
In case of hijacking , it is a terrorist act to demonstrate or draw the world attention to meet political cause .
2.Ransom :
Ransom is demanded against the ship and ship ’s cargo .
Ship ’s crew are generally not harmed .
In case of aircrafts , the hijackers demand release of terrorists who are in prison or simply blow up the aircraft to draw world attention or expect the government to meet their political demands .
3.Place :
Piracy takes place at certain known places , mostly in coastal areas .
In case of hijacking , it can take place anywhere .
4. Crime network :
Piracy is by local criminals and is restricted to certain regions only .
In case of hijacking , it is carried out by worldwide network of criminals .
5.Planning :
Hardly any planning is done by pirates to attack a ship .
They carry out the attack on sighting a ship .
In case of hijacking , foolproof planning to hijack a specific aircraft is done meticulously .
6.Background :
Sea pirates are only males , less educated , poor and good navigators .
Hijackers can be males and females , well educated , intelligent , misguided youth with strong will power .
7. History :
Piracy is going on for centuries and is an old profession .
In case of of hijacking , it is a recent development going on for the past few decades .
8.Speed of the craft :
Ships are bigger in size and move very slowly comparing to the aircrafts .
Pirates come in fast moving crafts with modern weapons to capture the ship .
In case of aircrafts , the hijackers have no means to chase an aircraft and capture the aircraft .
9. Type of Craft :
Pirates prefer to capture generally cargo ships because of less number of ships crew to resist the attack .
Pirates prefer to take possession of costly ship and costly ship ’s cargo .
In case of aircrafts , hijackers prefer passenger aircrafts to take possession of the passengers to use them as human shield .
Also , they prefer to use the aircraft to crash on soft targets .
10 . Mode of Attack :
Pirates approach towards the ship in fast moving crafts with lethal weapons to attack after sighting a ship .
In case of aircrafts , hijackers board the aircraft as passengers and commence their operation after getting airborne .
11 . Resistance :
Pirates can be scared or repelled by the ship ’s crew if the ship is provided with light arms , ammunition and training to the ship ’s crew .
In case of hijackers , repulsion by the passengers is impossible as the hijackers are ready for suicide missions .
12 . Meeting the demands :
Shipping companies or Ship owners meet the demands of the pirates to release the ship and ship ’s crew .
In case of hijacking , the government takes action to meet their demand .
13 . Punishments and Preventive actions :
Tougher punishments or preventive actions by the countries are the least to stop piracy .
In case of hijacking , tougher punishments and foolproof preventive actions are being taken by all countries to stop hijacking .
14 . Intelligence inputs or warnings :
No definite intelligence is available of a piracy attack .
Reliable intelligence is available on hijacking because of global determination to fight out terrorism .
15 . Government reaction and Global efforts :
Very few countries only react strongly to piracy attacks .

" At current oil prices , an attack would be unlikely to stop the Iranian program , " the report , titled " Iran 's Political , Demographic , and Economic Vulnerabilities , " said .
" The government would be able to finance the reconstruction of the facility and continue the current program without major budgetary consequences . "
The report warned of a spike in crude oil prices and a decline in investor confidence in Gulf Cooperation Council states .
Rand said Iran could block Iraqi oil exports and GCC shipments in the Gulf .
" An Israeli action would also have a detrimental effect on popular Iranian opinion of the United States because Iranians would see the attack as having had the blessing of the United States , although the turnabout in public opinion might be less precipitous than in the event of a U.S. attack , " the report said .
" Bombing Iran 's nuclear facilities would have financial repercussions both for Iran and for the rest of the world . "
" The political ramifications within Iran of an attack are less clear , " the report said .
" [ Iranian President Mahmoud ]
Ahmadinejad has come under fire from other politicians for baiting the United States .
An attack might be perceived as his comeuppance .
In our view , a more likely response would be a strong push to retaliate against the United States [ or Israel ] .
Critics of such a policy would likely choose to keep silent . "
The U.S. intelligence community appeared to dispute some of the assumptions of the Rand report .
CIA director Michael Hayden said Teheran might not be successful in using even its Lebanese - sponsored militia , Hizbullah , to retaliate against any U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear facilities .
" Is it in Hizbullah 's interest to become involved in a global war against the United States of America ? "
Hayden asked in an interview with the Bloomberg financial news service .
" That 's a question to be answered . "
For its part , Rand proposed a reconciliation with Teheran and warned the United States not to inflame ethnic tensions in Iran .
Authors Keith Crane , Rollie Lal , Jeffrey Martini also called on Washington to halt threats to overthrow the Islamic regime or impose additional sanctions .
" At least in the near term , the Iranian regime is likely to be relatively stable and resistant to external pressures for dramatic change , " the report said .
" But societal conditions for a more - constructive relationship with the United States exist :
In contrast with the Arab Middle East , the United States is popular in Iran .
Long - term trends suggest that Iran is likely to become more democratic and less obdurate . "

MOSCOW ( AP )  Russia announced Monday that it is sending warships to patrol Arctic waters for the first time since the breakup of the Soviet Union — the latest move to increase the country 's global military presence .
Patrols by the Northern Fleet 's Severomorsk submarine destroyer and Marshal Ustinov missile cruiser will begin Thursday , Navy spokesman Igor Dygalo said .
Russia began sending aircraft carriers to the Mediterranean Sea in December and resumed long - range bomber patrols in August .
" We have been talking for a long time about widening our activity in the Arctic , " Dygalo said .
" There is nothing aggressive in it — it is in the interests of security . "
Former President Vladimir Putin expanded Russian military patrols and Dmitry Medvedev , who succeeded Putin in May , appears to be maintaining that course .
Moscow - based military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer said security was not Russia 's primary motivation in sending the Navy ships to the Arctic .
" This is flag - waving and that 's basically it , " Felgenhauer said .
" Sending a couple of patrol boats to the Arctic wo n't change anything . "
Russia has also been moving to stake its claim to resources that are increasingly accessible as global warming melts Arctic ice .
Moscow recently sent an expedition to plant a Russian flag on the seabed under the North Pole and said research indicates a massive underwater mountain range in the area , which is believed to contain huge oil and gas reserves , is part of Russia 's continental shelf .
And Russia hopes it can increase access for fishermen who are blocked from seas around the island of Spitsbergen , where Norway claims exclusive rights .
Russia does not recognize the 200 - mile economic zone delineated by a 1982 U.N. treaty .
Dygalo said protecting Russian fisherman was one of the aims of the new Arctic patrols .

Thousands Cheer as Pakistani Militants Decapitate , Shoot Afghans Accused of Spying for U.S. Associated Press
Published : Saturday June 28 , 2008
|
Print This Email This ISLAMABAD , Pakistan 
A gang of Pakistani militants executed two alleged U.S. spies in front of thousands of cheering supporters Friday as a top U.N. official expressed fears that Pakistani government peace deals with the gunmen were sparking a wave of human rights abuses .
At least 5,000 people gathered by a stream in the Bajur region to watch the executions , which highlighted the power of local Taliban forces in the lawless tribal areas near the Afghan border .
Masked militants pulled the two blindfolded Afghans from a car and forced them to kneel on the ground .
Waliur Rehman , a local Taliban commander , told the crowd that the two men confessed to aiding in a suspected U.S. missile strike on a house in the border town of Damadola that killed 14 people last month .
The men disclosed the names of others involved , and they would be killed as well , he said .
" Whoever , for the sake of money , for the sake of America , harms the interest of the Islamic world will meet the same fate , " he said .
Gunmen with daggers then pounced on one of the men  identified as Jan Wali , 36  decapitated him and waved his bloody head to the cheering crowd .
The militants then argued over how to kill the other man because he may have been a teenager , before one lost patience and shot him with an assault rifle .
The crowd erupted in cheers of " God is great ! " and gunmen fired in the air in jubilation .
The celebratory gunfire killed two bystanders and wounded six , local official Fazal Rabbi said .
The recently elected Pakistani government has supported negotiations that would give local tribes and militants broad authority over some tribal areas .
The U.S. says those deals will only give Taliban and Al Qaeda forces in the border region more freedom to attack Afghanistan .
A deal has not yet been reached over Bajur , but the militants are clearly able to operate freely in the area .
U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour said Friday she was concerned that the peace deals undermined state authority and left residents vulnerable to a range of human rights abuses , including extrajudicial killings .
" The government has the responsibility to ensure the protection of civilians , " she told reporters in Islamabad .
Minorities and women were particularly in danger , she said .
Hours before Arbour spoke , suspected Taliban militants torched two girls schools in the Swat region , the latest in a string of attacks on the female education system in the area , police said .
The attack on the schools cast doubt on efforts to shore up the collapsing peace deal in Swat .
Local government officials said talks Thursday with representatives of a pro-Taliban cleric were a success , however both sides acknowledged serious disagreements remained .
Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani met with Arbour earlier Friday to discuss the human rights situation in the country .
A statement released by his office did not directly address her concerns about abuses in the tribal areas .
However , he told her the U.S. - led war on terror had badly damaged Pakistan 's economy and the country needed to take action , the statement said .
The government was talking with " the moderate elements who have laid down arms " and would resort to military force if the agreements were violated , he told her according to the statement .
He also assured Arbour he was committed to women 's rights and to ensuring that girls have access to education , the statement said .
Arbour also expressed concerns about the human rights violations in the government 's counterterrorism operations , including the disappearances of hundreds of people .
She also called on the ruling coalition to resolve its dispute over reinstating dozens of senior judges fired by President Pervez Musharraf last year , saying the crisis was paralyzing the government .
Redmond , WA – As the Mozilla Foundation releases Firefox 3 and tries to set a record for most downloads in a day , they will be receiving help from an unlikely source : Microsoft .
Steve Ballmer announced early Monday that Microsoft would be halting development on Internet Explorer 8 and focusing the company ’s efforts on Firefox 3 .
“ I ’m going to be downloading it myself , and I ’ve told all our employees to download Firefox 3 on Tuesday and instructed our programming teams to start working on making the open source browser better rather than stumble around with Internet Explorer 8 , ” said Ballmer .
“ I mean , why bother ?
Firefox 3 has the ‘ AwesomeBar , ’ you ca n’t seriously expect to compete with that , can you ? ”
Ballmer said that Firefox 3.0 will be the standard browser included with Windows 7 installations along and will replace Internet Explorer 7 on Windows Vista SP2 .
“ We ’ve been looking for something to try to salvage Vista , and this could be it , ” said Ballmer .
The Mozilla Foundation was surprised by the news .
Carmen Pinter , head of press relations for the Foundation , said , “ We ’re closing in on 20 % of the marketplace , and we know Microsoft is worried , but we did n’t expect this .
We predicited capitulation with the release of Firefox 4.0 in 2011 which will have the ‘ TotallyAwesomeBar . ’ ”
Ballmer pleaded with other browser makers to coalesce around Firefox .
“ Why should we have so many programming hours going into different browsers ?
It ’s so easy for everyone to contribute to Firefox .
Safari and Opera programmers should get on board too .
If we all rally around one browser then consumers will be the big winners , and that ’s always been a priority for Microsoft , ” said Ballmer .

The programmers working on Internet Explorer 8 were excited .
“ I ca n’t wait to stop working on IE8 , fucking thing sucks .
Most people around here already use Firefox anyway and are sick of doing it Live , ” said browser programming team leader William Reily .
The Mozilla Foundation said it welcomed any contributors to the project , even from its arch rival Microsoft except “ we do n’t want any of the people responsible for Internet Explorer 6 .
They could set back Firefox decades . ”

In March , after U.S. President George W. Bush got an earful about problems and progress in Afghanistan , he said : " I must say , I ’m a little envious .
If I were slightly younger and not employed here , I think it would be a fantastic experience to be on the front lines of helping this young democracy succeed .
It must be exciting for you … in some ways romantic , in some ways , you know , confronting danger . "
Well , we ’ve got some jobs lined up for George when he leaves office in January .
Heck , he ’ll only be 62 years old , and with all that mountain - biking I ’m sure that even a dummy like him he can handle the easy jobs we ’ve found for him .
His reservations should n’t matter , if he ’s honest about it ( I know ) .
First , let ’s check out the romance of confronting danger as seen through the dead eyes of two US Navy sailors who served together in romantic Afghanistan .
Raised in Davison , Michigan , Ross Toles , the father of three boys —
Shawn , 14 , Jake , 10 , and Ryan , 5 — had recently relocated his family to a new home in North Branch .
He was the consummate family man — the kind of guy who stepped in to head the cub scout troup and served on the neighborhood association .
Toles enlisted in the Navy right out of high school , and now at 37 , he was settling into a managerial role in his career .
He ’d followed in his dad ’s footsteps , Ross Toles II , and switched over to the Naval Reserves .
His father retired from the same unit earlier this year as a senior petty officer .
There was no reason to believe he ’d have to go into the war zone , because he was in a unit that supported the Naval Air Station Sigonella base in Sicily .
Annually they ’d trek to the country for three weeks of training .
Lt. Commander George Degener , Toles ’ executive officer for 10 years , said Toles was tapped for an assignment in Afghanistan for one reason — he was the best .
" Being in the military we are all subject to individual augmentation , where you ’re chosen because of the rate or specialty you have , " Degener said .
" That was the case in Petty Officer Toles going to Afghanistan .
His specialty was public works and construction battalions . "
Marc Retmier spent his life like most of his friends , riding skateboards and doing high - flying motocross stunts in the hills of Beaumont and Lake Elsinore , California .
A star safety on the West Valley High School football team , he also had lettered in swimming as a freshman .
He attended Hemet High and graduated from Alessandro High School in Hemet .
He was the eldest of three brothers , ahead of Matthew , 17 , and Mason , 11 .
" He was one of the most popular kids in town , " said Dale Powers , the grandfather whom Marc Retmier called " Papa . "
After graduating from high school , Retmier enlisted in the Navy .
He attended training at Fort Bragg and Camp Lejeune , N.C. and worked in the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda , Md. , before volunteering for a tour , either in Iraq or Afghanistan .
His dream was to become a doctor eventually , his mother said .
Steven Retmier , Marc ’s father , said the lack of job opportunities and activities makes the region an easy target for military recruiters .
" There ’s nothing else for these kids to do , " he said .
" There ’s no future here for them . "
When a Marine deployment to Iraq was canceled , Retmier volunteered for one to Afghanistan to provide medical services for Marines there .
When in Afghanistan , Retmier exchanged e-mails and phone calls with his family and said he loved what he was doing , but they sensed the war was beginning to wear on him .
When his convoy delivered candy and coloring books to Afghan children , they often would throw rocks at the Humvees as they drove away .
" He felt like they were wasting their time there , " his mother said .
" He was worried they did n’t want us there at all . "
Last week , on Wednesday , June 18th , a US Navy unit was working in an Afghan village when ten Chinese - made rockets slammed into them .
Petty Officer 1st Class Ross Tolles III , 37 , of Michigan , and Corpsman Marc Retmier , 19 , of California died at the scene .
One of the tragedies of war , among others , is that we send our best and strongest to get physically and mentally mangled in the war racket .
Smedley Butler understood this .
General Butler , who served thirty - three years in the Marine Corps and received two Congressional Medals of Honor , had some ideas on who should go to war and who should pay for it .
General Butler on the war racket : " The only way to smash this racket is to conscript capital and industry and labor before the nations manhood can be conscripted .
One month before the Government can conscript the young men of the nation — it must conscript capital and industry and labor .
Let the officers and the directors and the high - powered executives of our armament factories and our munitions makers and our shipbuilders and our airplane builders and the manufacturers of all the other things that provide profit in war time as well as the bankers and the speculators , be conscripted — to get $ 30 a month , the same wage as the lads in the trenches get .
Let the workers in these plants get the same wages — all the workers , all presidents , all executives , all directors , all managers , all bankers — yes , and all generals and all admirals and all officers and all politicians and all government office holders — everyone in the nation be restricted to a total monthly income not to exceed that paid to the soldier in the trenches !
Let all these kings and tycoons and masters of business and all those workers in industry and all our senators and governors and majors pay half of their monthly $ 30 wage to their families and pay war risk insurance and buy Liberty Bonds .
" Why should n’t they ?
They are n’t running any risk of being killed or of having their bodies mangled or their minds shattered .
They are n’t sleeping in muddy trenches .
They are n’t hungry .
The soldiers are ! "
Now under General Butler ’s prescription , Bush ’s pay would be cut to a private ’s and he could keep the job that daddy got him .
But George did say he wanted a romantic assignment confronting danger , so here ’s some choices for George .
KBR — Afghanistan # 455906 Pest Controller # 443624 Coordinator — Security Services # 425510 Field Buyer # 10432 Heavy Truck Driver ( plus others too numerous to list , and they change )
Just do it , George , and be sure to write .
Thanks for everything that you ’ll do .
It ’s never too late ; let ’s hope the experience will make a man of you .
In the meantime , our thoughts return to two real men , and others like them , who saw their duty and did it .
They did n’t BS it like George , they just did it .
So this GI poem is for them , Ross and Marc and all the other gentle heroes who were left behind .
If you are able , save them a place inside of you and save one backward glance when you are leaving for the places they can no longer go .
Be not ashamed to say you loved them , though you may or may not have always .
Take what they have left and what they have taught you with their dying and keep it with your own .
And in that time when men decide and feel safe to call the war insane , take one moment to embrace those gentle heroes you left behind .
This poem was written by Major Michael Davis O’Donnell , on January 1 , 1970 in Dak To , Vietnam .
Major O’Donnell was a helicopter commander with the 170th Aviation Company , 17th Aviation Group , 52nd Aviation Batalion , 1st Aviation Brigade .
He and his crew were shot down two months later , on 24 March , 1970 , while performing an extraction operation .
Major O’Donnell ’s remains were never found .
" Take what they have left and what they have taught you with their dying and keep it with your own . "
Let ’s just do it , without reservations .
The Best of Don Bacon

( Gerd Rühle , ed. , " Das Dritte Reich , " Berlin , 1938 ed. ) - Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring 's Air Ministry building on Wilhelmstraße was a classic example of Nazi architecture .
The building somehow escaped major damage during the war , and was restored by the East German government .
Its appearance today is almost exactly as in the 1930s ( minus the Eagles and Swastikas ) .

( photos courtesy Mark Grootendorst ) Joseph Goebbels ' Ministry of Propaganda stood prominently on Wilhelmstraße , across the street from the old Reichs Chancellery .
During building construction just before the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 , a dreary East German building was erected in the open area just on Wilhelmstraße , blocking the front of the old Ministry building .
This modern building is today a youth activities building , and access to the old Propaganda Ministry building behind it can be difficult .
However , the entrance shown here was on Mauerstraße .
( from Frau Prof. Gerdy Troost , " Das Bauen in Neuen Reich , " Bayreuth , 1938 ) - Wehrmacht headquarters on Bendlerstraße was where Army officers who opposed Hitler planned the attempt on his life on 20 July 1944 .
After the attempt failed , the leaders were rounded up and shot in the courtyard of this building ; among these was Col.
Claus von Stauffenberg , who had planted the bomb .
Today the building houses the Memorial and Museum of the German Resistance .
The street has been renamed Stauffenbergstraße .
( Gedenkstätte Deutscher Widerstand ) Left - an SA column marches past the Anhalter Bahnhof ( train station ) .
The station was severely damaged by bombing during the war , and the ruins were pulled down in the 1960s , leaving only part of the front façade .

The air - raid shelter serves today as a haunted house and bunker museum .
( My advice if you visit - skip the " haunted house , " and proceed directly to the bunker museum on the lower floor . )
( Anhalter Bunker Museum ) - Horst Wessel was a member of the SA who was murdered by Communists in 1930 .
Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels turned him into a Nazi martyr and hero , and Wessel 's song " Die Fahne Hoch ! " became the favorite Nazi marching song .
After the Nazi takeover of the government in 1933 , Bülowplatz was renamed Horst Wessel Platz , and the Communists were thrown out of their headquarters at the Karl Liebknecht Haus , which became SA headquarters and a shrine to Horst Wessel .
( Click here to see the site of Wessel 's grave in the nearby Nikolaifriedhof cemetery . ) ( period photo from Imre Lazar , " Der Fall Horst Wessel , " Stuttgart , 1980 ) The Gasthaus Zum Nußbaum was a popular inn that figured prominently in an episode during the political battle for Berlin in 1929 , when Horst Wessel and his SA Troop ventured into the heart of the Communist stronghold of the Fischerkietz district .
Here , at the Zum Nußbaum , Wessel faced down a crowd of Communist supporters and proclaimed the area free of the " Red Menace , " all without any bloodshed .
This part of Berlin was practically destroyed by bombing in 1943 - 45 , but the popular Zum Nußbaum was rebuilt as a copy in the mid-1980s in the nearby Nikolai section , adjacent to the famous Nikolai Church , where Horst 's father Ludwig had served as pastor .
( period photo from Erwin Reitmann , " Horst Wessel - Leben und Sterben , " Potsdam , 1933 ) - Horst Wessel was born in Bielefeld in northwestern Germany on 9 October 1907 , in an apartment house on what was then Kaiserstraße .
In 1939 a large bronze monument was erected on a median in the middle of Kaiserstraße , approximately in front of the Wessel birth house .
The building directly behind the statue , which is the building to the right in the monument dedication photo on the left above , has been replaced .
However , the building to the left ( behind the statue in the photo on the left above ) still exists , and still has the flagpole holders and iron hooks to hold the wreaths between the windows and the long swastika banner running down the middle of the building , that can be seen in the period photo .
In fact , this building , whose address is now Alfred - Bozi - Straße 14 ( or Oberntorwall 14 ) , is practically unchanged from 1939 , and is evidently the original Horst Wessel birth house .
( Google Maps link ) - Berlin was protected by concentrated anti-aircraft defenses , including three huge concrete flak towers .
Flakturm 1 ( also called the " Zoo Bunker " ) in the Tiergarten was completely destroyed after the war .
Flakturm 3 in Humbolthain Park ( shown here ) was only partially destroyed after the war .
The massive concrete walls of the front half of Flakturm 3 remain today in Humbolthain Park .
( The metal railings seen below are not period . )
The main gun positions at each corner were for long - range twin 12.8 cm flak guns ; the smaller pedestals on the level below were for smaller caliber guns of shorter range ( 2.0 cm and 3.7 cm ) .

This part of the ruined structure can be visited during a tour by the Berlin Unterwelten group .
On the left , gun crews load one of the 12.8 cm guns in a Berlin flak tower .
Ammunition was lifted to the gun platform on the top of the tower by a hoist ( seen in the right foreground ) , and carried by hand to the guns from there .
The guns had automatic rammer mechanisms to load the cartridges into the breech .
On the right is one of the smaller gun positions on the Friedrichshain tower ( Flakturm 2 ) - a Flakvierling four - barrel 2.0 cm gun , for engaging low - flying aircraft .
The photos below show a 2.0 cm Flakvierling position on Flakturm 1 ( " Zoo Tower " ) .
( Bundesarchiv ) Flakturm 2 was located in Friedrichshain Park .
Following the war it was mostly destroyed and buried in rubble from the bombed city .
Today only a small part of one of the upper parapets can be seen above the current ground level .

Lichterfelde Kaserne , southwest of the downtown area , was an old Prussian cadet training school .
The Nazis took it over in 1933 , and it became the headquarters of Hitler 's body guard regiment , the Leibstandarte - SS " Adolf Hitler . "
In this December 1935 photo , Hitler and LSSAH commander Sepp Dietrich review the Leibstandarte .
The U.S. Army took the compound over in 1945 , and it served the Berlin Brigade as Andrews Barracks until 1993 , when it was returned to the German government .
The older part of the barracks area seems mostly deserted now .
( National Archives , RG 242 - HB )
Other buildings on the Kaserne were built in the 1930s especially for the Leibstandarte .
This was their headquarters building , with their name above the main entrance .
The two stone guards , or " Reichsrottenführer , " stood eternal watch .
The newer part of the compound is now a German government archives .
The Soviets removed the eagle and swastika before the Americans arrived , and the US troops removed the Leibstandarte name .
The " Reichsrottenführer " guards were not removed , but covered with concrete ; they remain today on their pedestals , although hidden from view .

Adolf Hitler had plans to completely rebuild Berlin .
Few of these architectural plans were realized , but one that saw work was the Fehrbelliner Platz .
This was a series of office buildings in a semi-circle around an open area , featuring decorative sculptures by Werner March .
Most of these decorative works are now gone , but some remain .

Hitler 's grand scheme was to redesign Berlin into " Germania , " which would be the capital of a Germanized Europe following a successful World War II .
These grand plans included a huge triumphal arch and an immense domed building , with new government buildings along redesigned North - South and East - West Axis boulevards .
Almost none of this work was started , but one project can still be seen above - ground ( some tunnels beneath the Tiergarten also remain from the " Germania " plans ) .
The structure seen above was placed to test the ability of the sandy Berlin soil to support the weight of the triumphal arch .
It was a large concrete mass with apparatus to test and measure its movement relative to the ground level .
It can be found today off Dudenstraße near Tempelhof airport .

One of the most recognizable sights in the western part of Berlin today is the spire of the Kaiser - Wilhelm Gedächniskirche ( Memorial Church ) .
This view shows the church in the early 1900s .
The church was severely damaged during the many bombing attacks on the city .
The ruins of the spire and transept were left as a memorial to the victims of World War II .
( author 's collection ) Berlin hosted the 1936 Olympic Games , a propaganda coup for Adolf Hitler .
The view of the stadium remains much the same on the outside as it was in 1936 , although the curved swastika symbol has been removed from the right - hand tower .
The interior was completely modernized for the 2006 soccer World Cup .

Berlin was the scene of intense building - to - building fighting , with tank battles and artillery barrages , during the final days of World War II in late April and early May 1945 .
Remaining German units were thrown in piecemeal to try to stem the tide of the Soviet advances .
On 29 April 1945 , two King Tiger ( Tiger II ) tanks of the 503rd SS Heavy Tank Battalion were stationed in Potsdamer Platz .
Tank Nr. 101 seen here was commanded by SS - Oberscharführer ( E - 6 , equivalent to U.S. Staff Sergeant ) Karl - Heinz Turk .
Turk 's tank destroyed several Soviet tanks over a three day period in the Potsdamer Platz .
With damage to his track and almost out of ammunition , Turk and his crew abandoned the tank in front of the Potsdamer Bahnhof , where it was later photographed with its turret turned toward the east .
This is an example of the difficulty of matching many wartime photos to the current Berlin locations .
The Potsdamer Bahnhof was badly damaged during the war and later torn down .
Most of the other buildings on Potsdamer Platz were demolished by the Soviets because the Berlin Wall ran right through the center of the square .
When the rebuilding of Berlin began in the 1990s , building blocks and even entire streets in this area were changed from the 1945 configuration .
Turk 's
Tiger tank sat in the foreground of the modern photo , about where the line of cobblestones crosses the paved area ( this line of cobblestones marks the location of the Berlin Wall ) .
The Potsdamer Bahnhof was located in the near distance , just beyond the grassy mound .
This photo is often labeled as showing the famous Weidendammer Bridge , scene of one of the final tank actions of the war on the night of 1 - 2 May 1945 .
However , it is actually the Moltke Bridge , some 1300 meters to the west .
As the Soviet tanks came onto the bridge from the north ( other side of the bridge in these photos ) , they could see their goal of the Reichstag building straight ahead , only 600 meters away .
( Bundesarchiv Berlin )
An exact corresponding view is not possible today , as the building from which the period photo was taken no longer exists , necessitating a modern view from street level .
This area remains under construction as part of the new Berlin .

The Reichstag building had not been restored by the Nazis since the 1933 fire that gutted the interior , but the Soviets considered it a prime target in the battle for Berlin , and artillery and tank fire took their toll on the building .

The Reichstag has been completely restored , with a new glass dome , and the German government once again meets there .

Click here for more about Medical Marijuana .
A newly updated analysis , released June 16 , 2008 , shows that state medical marijuana laws have not increased teen marijuana use .
In fact , teen marijuana use has consistently declined in states with medical marijuana laws , and generally more markedly than national averages .
A copy of the report , " Marijuana Use by Young People : The Impact of State Medical Marijuana Laws , " is available from the CSDP research archive .
There were some interesting charts and commentary in a recent issue of Contrary Investor showing the contraction in asset backed commercial paper .
By permission from CI :
As of the end of May , the year over year change in US banking system commercial and industrial loans outstanding was close to 20 % .
Without belaboring the point , that 's one very big growth number .
Set against historical experience of the last few decades at least , we 've never really seen annual growth like this .
Of course when looking at this data without digging a bit , the natural response is " what credit crisis " ?
Clearly the banks are lending with more than a bit of gusto , no ?
This simply flies in the face of conventional thinking , as well as the tone and detail of the most recent Bank Loan Officer Survey showing us that banks have tightened the credit reigns in a big way .
So it appears that although credit cycle woes have taken a very meaningful toll on the financial markets and the real US economy , US commercial banks have n't even blinked .
In fact , they have hit the lending accelerator in terms of commercial and industrial loans , as their real estate lending activities have been curtailed significantly .
Of course this is how it " appears " when looking at the raw bank lending data .
But as always , appearances can be deceiving , especially in the modern US financial markets .
Let 's quickly have a peek at an update of a chart we have probably shown you too many times this year .
Specifically , what is important is the ongoing trend in asset backed commercial paper outstanding ( the gold line ) .
Commercial Paper
Here 's the deal .
As we all know full well by now , the big boys in the US banking system have been heavily involved in off balance sheet shenanigans for many years now , these shenanigans now coming home to roost in a very big way .
You know the vehicles by now - special purposes entities ( SPE ) , structured vehicles ( SIV ) , etc .
Very much akin to the Enron structure before that house of cards collapsed due to sudden illiquidity .
The commercial banks simply thought they were smarter than the Enron crowd as they pursued off balance investment fun and games for profit over the decade to date period .
As you also may be fully aware , many an off balance sheet " investment " for the banks was funded with asset backed commercial paper .
The oldest trick in the book and really the oldest mistake in the book - borrowing short ( maturity ) and lending ( theoretically investing ) long .
We 've seen this mistake repeated so many times over our careers we 've simply stopped counting .
And literally every time it has ended in the same manner - in tears .
So as you look at the chart above , it is clear that asset backed commercial paper has been contracting very meaningfully since the summer of last year .
In very rough numbers , contraction to the tune of maybe $ 225 billion .
As you also probably know full well , many a bank has been forced ( and will continue to be forced ) to take many of these off balance sheet investments / assets back onto their own balance sheets in a formal manner .
When this happens , the financing of these assets shows up as a loan .
It shows up in the C&I numbers .
And so now we 're sure you are starting to put the pieces of the puzzle together here .
Since the end of July 2007 , US banking system commercial and industrial loans have expanded by roughly $ 220 billion .
Wow , what a coincidence , right ?
Wrong .
Clearly , this is almost the same amount by which asset backed commercial paper has shrunk .
Point being , bank commercial and industrial lending is not strong .
It has not expanded meaningfully since last summer to fill the hole left by the contracting asset backed securities markets .
To a very large extent , the increase bank C&I lending is simply the banks taking off balance sheet vehicles back onto their reported balance sheets in a formal manner .
An illusion of lending strength ?
In many senses , yes .
The fourth quarter of 2007 witnessed the first quarter over quarter decline in total asset backed securities outstanding in history .
Well guess what ?
Contraction continues .
As of the first quarter of this year , not only do we now have two straight quarters of nominal dollar contraction in the total asset backed markets , but the first year over year decline on record .
We do not expect this to change any time soon .
Is The Fed Easy ?
We constantly hear from the talking heads that the Fed 's recent policy actions are creating mammoth amounts of financial liquidity .
But have these talking heads bothered to look at the data ?
If they did , they would have to change their tune .
Chart 1 shows that the year - over - year growth in the total assets of the Federal Reserve System was up 3.85 % in the week ended June 18 .
Although total asset growth has rebounded from slightly negative territory of late April , the latest 3.85 % growth still is low in comparison with recent years ' behavior .
So , the Fed is not creating massive amounts of credit on its own .
In yesterday 's comment , I noted that the Fed had reduced its holdings of U.S. Treasury securities by billions of dollars in the past six months .
In effect , the Fed has been " sterilizing " much of the credit it has been creating via the discount window and its new borrowing facilities .
Federal Reserve Banks Total Assets
Now , let 's take a look at what commercial banks have been doing with their loans and investments .
Chart 2 shows that in the 13 weeks ended June 4 , loans and investments at all commercial banks were contracting at an annual rate of 2.25 % .
It is true that bank credit growth ballooned in 2007 as banks were forced to take on credit that had originally been financed in the commercial paper market .
But we seem to be over that " hump . "

When a chemical that I have been waiting for arrives at my lab , it feels a bit like Christmas for two reasons :
Getting shiny new toys is exciting , and there will be a ton of stuff strewn across the floor .
I 'm all for safety , but five layers of packaging material seems like a bit of overkill for a one gram bottle of ethidium bromide – even if it is slightly flammable and highly toxic .
This little glass container , which came to my lab today , seemed to be packed for Armageddon .
Perhaps a much smaller but sturdier plastic container would do the trick and save lots of room in the delivery truck – which is becoming more important as gas prices rise .
Do you think all of that packaging material is overkill ?
Arizona public schools would be barred from any teachings considered counter to democracy or Western civilization under a proposal endorsed Wednesday by a legislative panel .
Additionally , the measure would prohibit students of the state 's universities and community colleges from forming groups based in whole or part on the race of their members , such as the Black Business Students Association at Arizona State University or Native Americans United at Northern Arizona University .
Those groups would be forbidden from operating on campus .
The brainchild of Rep. Russell Pearce , the measure appeared as an amendment to Senate Bill 1108 , which originally would have made minor changes to the state 's Homeland Security advisory councils .
The House Appropriations Committee approved the new proposal on a 9 - 6 vote .
Pearce , a Mesa Republican , said his target is n't diversity instruction , but schools that use taxpayer dollars to indoctrinate students in what he characterized as anti-American or seditious thinking .
The measure is at least partially a response to a controversy surrounding an ethnic - studies program in the Tucson Unified School District , which critics have said is unpatriotic and teaches revolution .
SB 1108 states , " A primary purpose of public education is to inculcate values of American citizenship .
Public tax dollars used in public schools should not be used to denigrate American values and the teachings of Western civilization . "
For schools that violate the anti-Western - teachings provision , the bill provides the state superintendent of public instruction with the authority to withhold a portion of state funding .
Rep . John Kavanagh , a member of the Appropriations Committee , said he hopes the measure helps return cultural studies in the state 's schools to a " melting pot " model .
" This bill basically says , ' You 're here .
Adopt American values , ' " said Kavanagh , a Fountain Hills Republican .
" If you want a different culture , then fine , go back to that culture . "
But Democratic committee members complained that the measure is overly vague , failing to define what constitutes teachings that " disparage or overtly encourage dissent from the values of democracy and Western civilization . "
The result , said Rep. Pete Rios , would likely be a chilling effect on public instruction regarding diversity and other cultures .
" There 's nothing wrong with being bilingual , bicultural , " said Rios , a Hayden Democrat .
" I like Mexican music .
I like Elvis Presley .
I 'm bicultural .
What 's wrong with that ?
I think kids , students , need to learn about their culture . "
Reports are coming in that the government in Malaysia has ordered the immediate suspension of many BitTorrent trackers hosted in the country .
In a shock move , the government - citing the ' Copyright Act 1987 ' - has ordered hosts to suspend servers hosting BitTorrent sites , pending an investigation .
Many sites are offline .
When BitTorrent sites get into legal trouble or other pressures force a move to a new location , the speculation begins on the safest place to go .
For instance , would a site bail out of the Netherlands and move to Canada ?
Is Canada too dangerous now , and would a move to Sweden be more appropriate ?
What about moving to Ukraine - based hosting like Demonoid or further afield – China or Russia maybe ?
Inevitably , discussions usually involve ideas of moving sites east , to countries like Malaysia .
Fairly high - tech countries like this seem an attractive proposition , particularly given their government ’s track - record in failing to do much about piracy .
Given this background , BitTorrent tracker admins with their sites hosted in Malaysia were confronted by a very unpleasant surprise today .
An administrator from a well known tracker contacted TorrentFreak this morning with worrying news , he told us : “ Malaysia ’s government suddenly forced all torrent websites to shut down today until further notice , a complete surprise to torrent admins and the offshore hosting companies in Malaysia . ”
The news was given to this and other site admins , via an email from their hosting provider , which indicates the action has been ordered down from a high level .
The email informs the admins that their servers have been suspended by the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs , under the Copyright Act 1987 .
As the request came from the government , the host makes it clear they had no choice but to shut down the site .
Among the affected sites are Extremebits , Rapthe , Superfundo and several others .
According to sources , although torrent sites have been taken offline , other sites dealing in pirate material have also been suspended after the government decided to act on mounting copyright - related complaints .
Prominent Malaysian host Shinjiru confirmed the closures , telling TorrentFreak : “ We can confirm that this is accurate .
We had enforcement officers from MDTCA visiting the office to confirm the closure of BitTorrent sites hosted on our network .
We will comply to all shut down instructions from the local authorities or agencies with warrants or documents . ”
Update : Contrary to comments from a site admin , sources close to the situation are saying the shutdowns are limited to a small number of sites and are n’t necessarily part of a wider crackdown , despite government involvement .
A Home Office spokesman said last night : " Our starting point will be that all criminal gains should be removed from offenders .
For example those criminals buying commodities to avoid the circulation of cash could have their assets seized before they have chance to disperse them .
Hissing Storm
A bright , powerful , lightning - producing storm churns and coasts along the lane of Saturn 's southern hemisphere nicknamed " Storm Alley " by scientists .
NASA 's Cassini spacecraft detected this particular tempest after nearly two years during which Saturn did not appear to produce any large electrical storms of this kind .
The storm appears as a bright , irregular splotch on the planet near lower right .
Lightning flashes within the persistent storm produce radio waves , called Saturn Electrostatic Discharges , which the Cassini radio and plasma wave science instrument first detected on Nov. 27 , 2007 .
Cassini 's imaging cameras then spotted the storm , taking the images used to create this color view about a week later on Dec. 6 . This electrical storm is similar in appearance and intensity to those previously monitored by Cassini .
All of these powerful electrostatic producing storms appeared at about 35 degrees south latitude on Saturn .
( See PIA07788 PIA08142 and PIA06197 for additional images of Saturn 's electrical storms imaged by Cassini . ) This storm has now been continuously tracked by Cassini for several months , whereas previous storms observed by the spacecraft lasted for less than 30 days :
See PIA08411 for images of the storm acquired three months after this view .
The view looks toward the un-illuminated side of the rings from about 5 degrees above the ringplane .
Tethys ( 1,071 kilometers , or 665 miles across ) is seen here in the foreground , and casts its shadow onto the high northern latitudes .
Images taken using red , green and blue spectral filters were combined to create this natural color view .
The images were acquired with the Cassini spacecraft wide - angle camera at a distance of approximately 1.7 million kilometers ( 1 million miles ) from Saturn .
Image scale is 97 kilometers ( 60 miles ) per pixel .
The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA , the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency .
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory , a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena , manages the mission for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate , Washington , D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed , developed and assembled at JPL .
The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in Boulder , Colo .
The radio and plasma wave science team is based at the University of Iowa , Iowa City .

Can Less Money Equal Better Eating ?
Healthy eating in a bad economy need not be pricey , says one nutritionist .
June 19 , 2008  --
The less money you have , the better you can eat .
That sounds odd , but it can be true .
So often people think that only when you 're in the chips ( cash , not the potato kind ) can you have a good diet .
Raspberries in February , organic baby veggies from Spain , 89 - grain organic bread that was made at the hand of Bolivian monks who never watch television , meat from cows that spent time in a spa -- you name it .
It 's easy to think there 's no way a family with a modest budget -- even more modest , nowadays -- can have a healthy and decent diet without hawking the house .
It 's a huge mistake to think that good healthy food has to cost a bundle .
Sure , some of it does , but junk food is even more expensive in the long run .
It 's not so healthy , and it 's loaded with calories , fat , salt and sugar .
Even if it 's free , it 's not a bargain .
A lot of " luxury food " is n't all that healthy , either -- for instance , pricey Kobe beef that 's been massaged by hand for extra marbling , to the tune of up to $ 125 per pound .
Great , but it 's still loaded with fat , and your arteries do n't care how the meat spent its days .
Not - so - lean hamburger will have just as much fat and set you back considerably less , but do n't eat too much of that , either .
The point is that big budget or small , your diet can be great or terrible .
Since most people feel the financial pinch these days , let 's examine how to eat well for less .
Protein on the Cheap
First , let 's take on protein .
It 's one of the most expensive parts of the diet because we tend to favor animal protein , and animals take a long time and effort to grow , increasing their cost .
Ironically , the most economical sources of animal protein also have the highest protein quality : eggs and milk .
No kidding .
The protein in these foods most closely matches the protein of human tissue , so the body uses it very efficiently .
Even with recent price increases , eggs and milk beat beef , hands down .
Two eggs are only about 40 cents -- that 's $ 1.60 for a family of four .
A glass of milk is about 25 cents -- cheaper than even a bargain can of soda .
Milk and eggs also provide at least a dozen important nutrients each , so they 're rock - solid nutrition sources .
No need to become a vegetarian , but if you trade one meat meal a week for an egg - based meal , you can eat well and pocket the spare change .
Producing Produce on a Budget
The 2005 U.S. Dietary Guidelines recommend that people eat about four and a half cups of fruits and vegetables daily , for good health .
But you do n't need to buy raspberries in winter to get the job done .
Eat seasonally and you 'll do better .
During the summer , melons go a long way , and they 're some of the healthiest fruits around .
Watermelon and cantaloupe are loaded to the hilt with antioxidants , and they 're terrific sources of potassium .
Apples and oranges are around all winter , and they 're at their peak then .
Buy them by the bag and you 'll save a bundle .
A three - pound bag of apples is only about $ 2.50 , and they last forever in the crisper .
A box of those supersweet clementines may be $ 7 , but it'll contain up to 30 fruits -- a huge bargain .
Take a Pinto for a Spin
Beans are probably the top nutrition source here .
Any type you like -- pinto , black , red , kidney -- they 're all tops .
Beans are schizophrenic , too ; they count as both a vegetable and a protein food .
They 're also a vegetable that kids and adults all like .
They go in everything -- soups , salads , stir - fries , rice and pasta dishes .
Plus , the canned ones are just fine and still among the best buys anywhere .
The dietary guidelines recommend half a cup daily , anyway , so beans are a great place to start eating better and for less .
Incidentally , just one - half cup of pinto beans every day has been shown to reduce cholesterol by about 8 to 10 percent .
With nutrition like that , beans should be on our plates no matter what our budgets are .
Carrots , Cabbage and Collards -- Oh , My !
Carrots are the deep orange of the antioxidant carotene , cabbage is a high - octane cruciferous veggie , and deep - green collards have more anti-cancer compounds than almost any vegetable .
And they 're all economical .
They never need go to waste , either , because the aging ones can always go into soups and stir - fries .
The vitamin content may wane a little , but the minerals stay put , and so do most of the disease - fighting compounds .
See what I mean ?
Now , the other part of eating better on a budget involves ditching some of the wasted stuff .
Sugar - water beverages -- of all colors -- are a total waste of money .
If you really need a sweet beverage and you insist on it having sugar , then some homemade iced tea does the trick for next to nothing , plus tea is healthy .
At least this way , you can control the amount of sugar and calories .
On the savory side , ditch the chips and even the pretzels .
Invest in a hot - air popper and make popcorn -- the cheapest snack of all -- and it's even a whole grain treat .
As an added bonus , clean up is easy because you do n't use oil .
Spray air - popped popcorn lightly with butter - flavored popcorn spray ( it has no calories ) , and flavor it with all kinds of herbs , or just a little salt .
Eat smart with some of these tips and you and the family will make it out of this recession with extra money and healthier bodies .

( GameTap.com ) --
The uncertainty that confronts consumers and investors in the U.S. is staggering .
There 's the price of gasoline , which creeps higher almost daily ; a housing market that month after month gets gloomier and gloomier ; and the conflict in Iraq that has cost the U.S. an estimated $ 3 trillion .
Is it any wonder that the Consumer Confidence Index - - maybe the most telling measure of how rank - and - file consumers view their economic health both present and future -- is at a five - year low ?
GameStop executives thinks the Grand Theft Auto IV release could net them $ 100 million in one week .
Shift for a second from the very real world of kids , homes , global conflict , and cars to the make - believe world of video games .
There , at least for some , the economy that is breeding so much concern and trepidation seems a distant factor .
Times are good , with double digit growth expected for sales of games this calendar year as well as for the hardware that 's used to play those games .
But even among the winners in the game sector there is one that stands to gain the most -- the nation 's biggest specialty retailer of games and game - playing consoles , GameStop .
In a perfect storm of technology , demographic shift , and pricing , the retailer is bucking the general trends in the broader economy and stands to profit like it has never before .
" As we analyze our sales deployment , we can't find evidence of the economy affecting our business , " company officials said recently .
" In fact , like we did after 9/11 , we 're seeing [ comparable ] store growth as consumers travel less and stay at home more , as well as trade in more games on new game purchases . "
GameStop executives explained their enviable position , calling the present moment for them the outcome of the game industry reaching " a transformative stage made up of many pieces , all of which have a profound impact on our business . "
The company 's financials tell some of the story : for all of last year , GameStop 's sales increased 33 percent , same store sales increased nearly 25 percent , and profit for the company increased 82 percent compared to the previous year .
" By any barometer , " one company executive said in a conference call with analysts , " [ it 's been ] another outstanding year for GameStop . "
One industry analyst , Janco Partners ' Mike
Hickey , forecasts growth for the company that builds even further on those enviable figures .
" Accelerating demand for next - gen hardware including the PlayStation 3 should benefit comparable store sales in the [ present ] period , " Hickey said of the company , who added it is not just demand , but broad demand which is fueling GameStop growth .
Success for GameStop is " highly attributable to video game play attracting a mainstream audience , " with the demographic expansion having much to do with " new consoles like the Wii , which pull back on the geekish complexity of typical content aimed at hardcore gamers . "
But it 's really the library of upcoming games that will supply GameStop with most of its revenue infusion in 2008 .
Hickey said today he expects that the release of Grand Theft Auto IV could net the company more than $ 100 million -- in a single week .
" GTA IV ... could ship 5.8 million units in the first week , or $ 360 million in retail sales and potentially $ 110 million for the Company , " says Hickey .
He said the game 's publisher , Take - Two Interactive , is tracking higher than anticipated preorders leading to the game 's April 29 release date .
Another game which should help GameStop tally record revenues this year is the second expansion pack for Blizzard Entertainment 's phenomenally successful multiplayer game World of Warcraft .
The game has an active user base of 10 million , a chunk of which has already proven themselves interested in acquiring product extensions when they become available .
The first World of Warcraft expansion pack released last year sold 2.4 million copies in 24 hours and 3.5 million copies in the first month , Hickey says .
The game 's second expansion pack , Wrath of the Lich King , is expected to be released in the second half of 2008 " and should provide meaningful product sales over a considerably larger World of Warcraft subscriber base . "
From every vantage point , the year is shaping up to be one of record - setting revenues and profit for GameStop - - with more than just insiders noting the potential .
Today on Wall Street , investors clamored for GameStop shares , bidding up the price just a nickel shy of $ 4 , or almost 8 percent , to $ 55.66 .
Hickey , who is projecting that GameStop shares will top $ 70 in the next year , says investing in the company " offers investors an opportunity to participate in the growth of the video game market with comparatively less operational volatility than publishers and offers [ an investment opportunity based ] on the remarkable success of the Wii and DS platforms from Nintendo .

The U.S. military is promising action to address conditions in a barracks at Fort Bragg , North Carolina , after a soldier 's father posted images on YouTube showing a building that he said " should be condemned . "
" This is embarrassing .
It 's disgusting .
It makes me mad as hell , " Ed Frawley said of the building where his son , Sgt. Jeff Frawley , had to live upon his return this month from a 15 - month deployment to Afghanistan .
Frawley 's 10 - minute video shows still photos from throughout the building , which appears to be falling apart and filled with mold and rust .

There is a kind of soft , toxic snail that lives in the sea called a Nudibranch .
The many kinds of Nudibranch all have intense coloration and weird shapes — so weird , in fact , that National Geographic just devoted an entire gallery to the strange creatures .
See below for more multicolored , deep - sea weirdness worthy of Cthulhu 's spawn .

According to National Geographic :
Nudibranchs crawl through life as slick and naked as a newborn .
Snail kin whose ancestors shrugged off the shell millions of years ago , they are just skin , muscle , and organs sliding on trails of slime across ocean floors and coral heads the world over .
Found from sandy shallows and reefs to the murky seabed nearly a mile down , nudibranchs thrive in waters both warm and cold and even around billowing deep - sea vents . . .
So why , in habitats swirling with voracious eaters , are n't nudibranchs picked off like shrimp at a barbecue ?
The 3,000 - plus known nudibranch species , it turns out , are well equipped to defend themselves .
Not only can they be toughskinned , bumpy , and abrasive , but they 've also traded the family shell for less burdensome weaponry : toxic secretions and stinging cells .
A few make their own poisons , but most pilfer from the foods they eat .
Species that dine on toxic sponges , for example , alter and store the irritating compounds in their bodies and secrete them from skin cells or glands when disturbed .
Other nudibranchs hoard capsules of tightly coiled stingers , called nematocysts , ingested from fire corals , anemones , and hydroids .
Immune to the sting , the slugs deploy the stolen artillery along their own extremities .

The most detailed survey yet of planets orbiting nearby stars indicates that a full 30 percent of them may harbor jumbo versions of our own planet .
Astronomers who presented the finding this week at an international conference also announced they had discovered a star system bearing three such super - Earths — potentially rocky planets up to 10 times as massive as our own .
Both results come from the HARPS ( High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher ) instrument at the European Southern Observatory on La Silla mountain in Chile , which looks for tiny changes in the color of starlight that indicate the star is wobbling under the sway of an orbiting planet .
The frequency and strength of the wobbles tells researchers the approximate mass of the planet , its distance from the star and the time it takes to complete an orbit .
Past experiments indicated that about 7 percent of stars possess planets .
But those studies had a hard time resolving relatively small color shifts corresponding to subtle changes in a star 's motion .
Thus , the extrasolar planets discovered that way were typically at least as massive as the gas giants Saturn or Jupiter .
HARPS , however , can identify changes in stellar motion as slight as six feet ( two meters ) per second , or about the speed of someone on a brisk walk .
Four years ago , astronomers began using the instrument to survey a group of about 400 stars within 100 light - years of Earth that had no obvious sign of a planet based on prior surveys , says Didier Queloz , an astronomer with the Observatory of Geneva in Switzerland who took part in the new research .
According Queloz and crew 's preliminary results , reported this week in Nantes , France , at a conference on super - Earths , nearly 30 percent of them do have planets after all .
" It turns out that a large fraction of the stars that we had believed had no planets actually have planets , but of small mass , " Queloz says .
He says that he and his colleagues have closely analyzed about 45 stars on their list .
In one case , HARPS was able to tease apart the signatures of multiple planets .
The star HD 40307 , located 42 light - years away , has three super - Earths with masses of at least 4.2 , 6.7 and 9.4 times that of Earth , the researchers reported at the same conference .
The planets orbit HD 40307 once every 4.3 , 9.6 and 20.4 days , respectively .
Some of the newly discovered planets could be solid .
" We suspect there is a high chance that a four–Earth [ mass ] object may be rocky , " Queloz says .
But finding out for sure would require astronomers to observe such a planet transiting , or passing in front of , its parent star .
Queloz says that researchers can use the result of the HARPS survey to pick out candidate stars for transit studies .
He adds that HARPS could in principle detect an Earth - mass planet in a tight orbit .
Finding Earth - like planets at distances comparable to Earth 's orbit , in the habitable zone around a star where water might remain liquid , will probably become easier in five to 10 years , he says , as new technology is incorporated into planet - spotting instruments .

Precisely on schedule , the usual assortment of right - wing operatives is preparing its expected assault on the Democratic presidential nominee .
While this unwholesome phase of the election cycle is known universally as " Swift - boating " -- named after the defamatory media blitz against John Kerry four years ago -- the style and some of the personnel date back at least two decades .
So does the winking charade of separation between the official Republican presidential campaign and the dirty business conducted on its behalf .
The only notable difference this year is that neither the money nor the message has crystallized yet behind any " independent " effort to destroy the candidacy of Barack Obama .
Whether such a campaign against him can be mounted effectively remains to be seen , but it will not fail for lack of trying .
Back in 2004 , the Swift Boat group 's attack on Kerry commenced in earnest with the August publication of " Unfit for Command , " a book purporting to prove that the Democratic nominee 's decorations for courage as a Navy officer in Vietnam were undeserved and that he had fabricated his sterling military record .
Those sensational charges won immense publicity for the authors and were soon augmented by a wave of national advertising , with millions in seed money provided by a group of wealthy Bush supporters based in Texas .
Of course the fingerprints of Karl Rove , then the president 's top political strategist , were all over that ugly episode .

This August will mark the publication of the first book - length screed against Mr. Obama , courtesy of Regnery Publishing , the house responsible for the scurrilous smearing of Kerry between hard covers .
At work on the Obama tome is David Freddoso , a young writer from the stable of the National Review , whose byline has also appeared in the ultra - right - wing magazine Human Events and who was reportedly trained by Robert Novak , the conservative " prince of darkness . "
His straightforward title is " The Case Against Barack Obama . "
Competing with Freddoso's book for talk radio promotion and cable airtime will be a similar product by Jerome Corsi , one of the authors of " Unfit for Command , " who has migrated from Regnery to a Simon & Schuster imprint .
With somewhat labored cleverness , his book will be titled " The Obama Nation , " and is likely to posit , among many other implausible claims , that the Illinois senator is under the influence of the defunct Communist Party USA .
Aside from such far - fetched theorizing , which excites only the hard - core fringe , what canards will the anti-Obama campaign exploit ?
Several themes have undergone pretesting in recent days , with mixed results .
Evangelical leader James Dobson has suggested that Obama is deliberately distorting the meaning of the Bible , which is an unsubtle method of questioning the Democratic candidate 's Christian commitment and raising fears ( again ) that he is really a Muslim .
" I think he 's deliberately distorting the traditional understanding of the Bible to fit his own worldview , his own confused theology , " said Mr. Dobson on his popular radio broadcast , adding that Obama " is dragging biblical understanding through the gutter . "
Describing Mr. Obama 's interpretation of the Constitution , he used the word " fruitcake , " a term that must be very familiar to him .
Meanwhile Floyd Brown , a right - wing huckster and unabashed promoter of racial fear dating back to the notorious Willie Horton ad of 1988 , is back pushing the Muslim theme against Obama .
This , too , is an obvious attempt to inflame anxieties over race and ethnicity .
For too many Americans , Muslim wrongly means foreign and nonwhite .
And this week the world heard again from Rove , who raised the old " elitist " trope against Obama , much as the Republicans used envy and resentment against Kerry for his wealth and status .
" Even if you never met him , you know this guy , " sneered Rove during a breakfast at the Capitol Hill Club .
" He 's the guy at the country club with the beautiful date , holding a martini and a cigarette that stands against the wall and makes snide comments about everyone who passes by . "
Insecure and pathetic as that makes Rove sound , he surely knows how to provoke envy and resentment among voters , especially white males .
That was one of the most important messages used by the Republicans against Kerry in 2004 with the famous windsurfing ad .
So perhaps Obama will be portrayed as a Muslim Marxist who hangs out at the country club , sipping cocktails and sneering at the common folk .
The true message in that kind of crude , contradictory propaganda is utter contempt for the target audience -- in other words , for you .

STIRLING ENGINE
Rev Dr Robert Stirling ( 1790 - 1878 )
History and Introduction
" Van Arsdell 's clever toy belongs to a diverse class of heat engines called air engines , or , more commonly , Stirling engines , after a Scots clergyman , Robert Stirling , who filed the first patent for the type in 1816 .
Actually , rudimentary Stirling engines existed before Stirling , going back to the late 1600's ; but Stirling added a refinement that he called an ' economizer ' .
It is now called a ' regenerator ' , and it increases the engine 's yield of work for a given input of heat increases , in other words , what we call its ' efficiency ' .
A regenerator is now a standard part of every Stirling engine design . "
It runs without noise or vibration and is truly an environmentally friendly device .
When one end is heated and the other kept cool , useful work can be obtained through a rotating shaft .
It is a closed machine with no intake or exhaust which results in very quiet operation .
Anything that gives off heat can be used to run a Stirling engine .
Some common methods are burning coal , wood , straw , gasoline , kerosene , alcohol , propane , natural gas , methane and so on .
But combustion is not required , only heat is required , or more accurately , a temperature difference between the hot and cold sides .
This allows Stirling engines to run on solar energy , geothermal energy , or even on the surplus heat from industrial processes including cooling water from a nuclear power plant .
It competed with steam engines of that time , and was even sold by Sears Roebuck to pump household water in the 1920s .
Stirling engines are used today in much of the " undeveloped " world .
Robert Stirling patented his Heat Economiser in 1816 .
The patent described a number of applications for use in glass and other furnaces .
Also described was a motive power engine incorporating his ideas and designed to work with a reduced fuel consumption compared with the designs of steam engines then available .
The drawing shown , right , is taken from his English patent .
This patent is hand written , and a comparison with known examples of Stirlings own hand writing clearly shows the writing to be that of Robert Stirling and there is no reason not to believe that he also penned the drawings .
In 1818 Robert Stirling erected an air engine to his design to pump water from a stone quarry .
In the 1820s he teamed up with his younger brother James who suggested that greater power output might be obtained using air at pressures greater than atmospheric pressure .
Further patents were obtained in 1827 and 1840 , for improvements in air engines .
Robert Stirlings patent of 1816 contained all the elements of what is now termed the STIRLING CYCLE ENGINE .
That is a power piston , a displacer to move the enclosed air between the hot and cold ends and a regenerator set between the hot and cold ends of the displacer cylinder .
Closed cycle operation with external heating .
The design shown in the 1816 patent drawings is a form of inverted beam engine .
Stirling states that this is preferable since the oil used to lubricate the piston can not get into the hot space , where it would be carbonized .
In the animation , right , the power piston , links and crank are shown in red .
The displacer , displacer beam and linkage is shown in blue .
A simple Watt three link parallel motion connects the power piston to the working beam .
The piston and displacer work out of phase , this is achieved by means of a bent lever .
The power piston compresses the enclosed air in the cold end of the displacer cylinder .
The displacer then shifts the air from cold to hot chambers .
The piston is driven back , the power stroke , by the air expanding in the hot end .
Regrettably none of Stirling 's experimental work or papers have survived except for two model engines built by him when he was a Minister at Kilmarnock .
These models were donated to the Universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh some time before 1824 .
At Edinburgh Stirling 's engine was used by Professor John Leslie , who thought practical demonstration important .
In 1975 the department of Natural Philosophy at Edinburgh University donated their engine to the Royal Scottish Museum where it is now on display .
At Glasgow the engine was put in to store where it lay forgotten until discovered , in 1847 , by William Thomson , then professor of Natural Philosophy , who later became Lord Kelvin .
Thomson used the model to show that Stirling 's machine worked on a reversible cycle .
The engine was in constant use by Thomson for lecture illustration .
It is still at Glasgow and can be found on display with other historical artifacts in the refectory of the department of Physics .
A sectioned replica of the engine can be found on display at the London Science Museum .
Small domestic hot air engines remained in production and used into the early 1900's , at which time the internal combustion engine improved with the advancements of the electrical components .
Currently they are the subject of considerable research and development efforts because of their potential for high efficiency and their clean and quiet operation .
Current levels of performance are impressive and are achieved using high temperature alloys , new mechanical drives , computer designed heat exchangers , and use helium or hydrogen at high pressures for their working fluid .
Modern Stirling engines can easily surpass typical gasoline and small diesel engines in efficiency and in power - to - weight ratio .
They are renowned for their quiet operation and low pollution levels .
This makes it ideal for future clean burning automobiles , quiet lawnmowers , and electricity production from the sun .
As a final note a solar powered stirling engine coupled with a generator achieved a record solar - to - electric efficiency of 30 % !

Anno 1988
In un rapporto giudiziario dell ' ormai lontano agosto 1978 , i carabinieri di Palermo , nel riferire le notizie confidenziali ricevute pochi mesi prima dal noto mafioso Giuseppe Di Cristina , affermavano : " Le notizie fornite dal Di Cristina rivelano anche… l'agghiacciante realtà che , accanto all ' autorità dello Stato , esiste un potere più incisivo e più efficace che è quello della mafia ; una mafia che agisce … che lucra , che uccide , che perfino giudica ; e tutto ciò alle spalle dei pubblici poteri .
Tale riflessione - continua il rapporto - che poggia su una realtà indiscutibile ( l'assunto del Di Cristina la conferma , ma nulla innova rispetto ai dati acquisiti dall ' Arma ) , indigna e sgomenta per la inammissibilità di questo stato di cose , che mortifica ed avvilisce gli sforzi che vanno compiendo i pubblici poteri " .
Ebbene , dopo quasi dieci anni , nonostante il maggior impegno delle forze dell ' ordine , col conseguimento di indubbi risultati , la situazione non è granché mutata ; si avvertono , anzi , i segni di
una accresciuta durezza dello scontro tra organizzazioni mafiose e pubbliche istituzioni .
Ciò può essere , paradossalmente , il sintomo positivo di una certa inversione di tendenza nella preesistente infiltrazione della mafia nei gangli vitali dello Stato ; ma , per converso , dimostra , senza possibilità di equivoci , quanto lunga sia ancora la strada da percorrere , se non per eliminare , quanto meno per ridurre la capacità offensiva di queste forme di criminalità organizzata a livelli più accettabili per un Paese civile .
Per tutta una serie di motivi che non è il caso di analizzare in questa sede , i primi innegabili successi della repressione giudiziaria del fenomeno mafioso , dopo anni e anni di sostanziale impunità , sono stati enfatizzati a dismisura e , dal canto loro , anche le sedi più autorevoli hanno lanciato segnali di minimizzazione del problema mafia , contribuendo oggettivamente a creare un clima di disimpegno nell ' opinione pubblica , disorientata , peraltro , da certi comportamenti antimafia di maniera .
Le polemiche sui maxiprocessi , poi , e le insinuazioni , sempre meno velate , su insussistenti violazioni dei diritti di difesa da parte di giudici- protagonisti , hanno determinato un generalizzato desiderio di " uscita dall 'emergenza " ed una sempre maggiore disaffezione della società civile verso i temi della repressione della criminalità organizzata .
A ciò si aggiunga che la uccisione per mano mafiosa di valorosi ufficiali di polizia giudiziaria ha determinato negli organismi investigativi un notevole calo di tensione che , in una [...] con le intuitive difficoltà a sostituire detti funzionari con elementi dotati di specifica professionalità , ha provocato un radicale rallentamento nelle indagini antimafia .
La conseguenza è stata che una fase di obiettiva difficoltà della mafia non è stata adeguatamente sfruttata , perdendosi così un'occasione storica , e che Cosa nostra ha avuto modo di risollevarsi e di riorganizzarsi più agguerrita e pericolosa di prima .
Si è tentato di contrastare in ogni opportuna sede questo diffuso e pericolosissimo clima di smobilitazione , avvertendo che i risultati raggiunti erano appena il punto di partenza - e non già quello di arrivo - dell ' attività repressiva ; ma ogni tentativo è stato inutile e , spesso , ha ottenuto effetti di segno opposto .
Adesso , alcuni recentissimi e gravi fatti di sangue , di chiara matrice mafiosa , hanno richiamato bruscamente tutti alla realtà , facendo ripiombare la Sicilia nel clima di terrore e di sfiducia di alcuni anni addietro e palesando , senza possibilità di equivoci , che la mafia mantiene intatta la sua pericolosità sociale ed è tuttora in grado di colpire , come , quando e dove vuole .
Ed ecco , allora , il risorgere di disperate affermazioni sull ' invincibilità della mafia , sull ' irredimibilità della Sicilia , e il riaffiorare delle solite polemiche sul mancato impegno degli apparati statuali sia sul piano repressivo , sia su quello della bonifica sociale ; atteggiamenti , questi , destinati a stemperarsi nel tempo , salvo a ripresentarsi , puntualmente , in occasione dei prossimi , purtroppo prevedibili , omicidi eccellenti .
Ora , se non poteva essere condiviso l'ingiustificato clima di sottovalutazione del fenomeno mafioso diffusosi dopo i primi risultati positivi dell ' attività repressiva , allo stesso modo è da contrastare l'attuale tendenza , determinata dai più recenti fatti di sangue , a reagire istericamente ed in maniera sostanzialmente irrazionale .
Se non si comprenderà che , per quanto riguarda Cosa nostra e altre organizzazioni similari , è assolutamente improprio parlare di " emergenza " , in quanto si tratta di fenomeni endemici e saldamente radicati nel tessuto sociale , e se si continuerà a procedere in modo schizofrenico , alternando periodi di intensificata repressione con altri di attenuato impegno investigativo , si consentirà alle organizzazioni criminali di proseguire indisturbate nelle loro attività e , in definitiva , sarà stato vano il sacrificio di tanti fedeli servitori dello Stato .
E ' necessario , dunque , prescindere da fattori emozionali e procedere ad una analisi razionale della situazione attuale ; analisi che , è bene ribadirlo , è non solo legittima , ma doverosa anche in sede giudiziaria , senza per ciò ledere prerogative istituzionali di altri organismi statuali , specificatamente preposti alla repressione del fenomeno mafioso .
Spesso si dimentica che Cosa nostra e le altre organizzazioni che si avvalgono del metodo mafioso sono , a parte la indubbia rilevanza del fenomeno sotto il profilo economico - sociale , anche organizzazioni di natura squisitamente criminale e che i membri di tali consorterie debbono essere perseguiti , sulla base del principio dell ' obbligatorietà dell ' azione penale , sia per specifici e numerosissimi reati , sia per la loro appartenenza a tali organizzazioni , costituente di per sé reato .
Questo richiamo può apparire banale per gli " addetti ai lavori " , ma è bene ribadirlo , perché stranamente , le verità elementari non sempre vengono adeguatamente considerate .
Ed allora , se è vero - come è vero - che l'attività giudiziaria incide su vicende tutt ' altro che concluse storicamente e su di un fenomeno tuttora in pieno svolgimento , non vi è dubbio che non possano essere studiate ed attuate le più appropriate tecniche di indagine né possano essere efficacemente gestite le istruttorie dei processi alla grande criminalità organizzata , senza una previa ed accurata ricognizione ed analisi di tali vicende e delle linee di tendenza del fenomeno .
La verità è che su questi temi riaffiorano polemiche mai sopite su pretese attività di supplenza della magistratura , sul giudice - sceriffo e così via ; polemiche , tuttavia , che , almeno per quanto riguarda le indagini sulle organizzazioni mafiose , sono mal poste , poiché qui non si tratta , se non molto indirettamente , di sopperire , attraverso l'intervento giudiziario , ad eventuali carenze di altri settori dei pubblici poteri , ma , molto più semplicemente , di perseguire fatti- reato che , per numero e per gravità , hanno un effetto indubbiamente destabilizzante per le istituzioni democratiche .
Riemergono così , camuffati nei panni del garantismo , perniciosi limiti culturali che , fino ai tempi recenti , hanno portato perfino a negare l'esistenza della mafia come organizzazione criminale , così confondendo due aspetti del fenomeno che vanno accuratamente distinti , e cioè quello dell 'esistenza di organizzazioni mafiose e quello del " comune sentire " di alcuni settori delle popolazioni meridionali . [… ]
Le più recenti acquisizioni probatorie hanno consentito , infatti , di stabilire con certezza che Cosa nostra - e cioè l'organizzazione mafiosa per eccellenza - ha salde radici in tutta la Sicilia e propaggini in diverse città d'Italia , e che da oltre un decennio le attività dell ' organizzazione sono dirette e regolate da un organismo di vertice , la Commissione regionale , ferma restando una larga autonomia operativa delle varie " famiglie " , su base locale e provinciale , per gli affari che non riguardano l'organizzazione nel suo complesso .
Quindi per riallacciarsi all 'affermazione di Sciascia , si dovrebbe parlare più appropriatamente , anziché di confederazione di Stati , di Stato federale .
Tale struttura verticistica , a seguito della recente " guerra di mafia " e per effetto delle incisive indagini giudiziarie , è , tuttavia , divenuta ancora più monolitica ed impermeabile alle indagini stesse .
Avevamo appreso da imputati appartenenti all ' organizzazione che gli organismi direttivi di Cosa nostra , articolata in " famiglie " coordinate su base provinciale e regionale , ad un certo punto , erano divenuti strumento formale di ratifica delle decisioni prese da un gruppo egemone , che aveva assoggettato tutta l'organizzazione .
Adesso è da ritenere molto probabile che questi meccanismi si siano ulteriormente accentuati con la istituzione , in ogni parte del territorio siciliano , di fiduciari del gruppo egemone che gestiscono il potere e dirigono l'organizzazione a livello locale , rispondendone direttamente a un vertice unitario ed inaccessibile .
In altre parole , si è creato un sistema di compartimentazione , che rende più salda l'organizzazione e difficili le indagini .
E ' , poi , divenuta più rigida la regola del segreto , e ciò come conseguenza delle dichiarazioni dei " pentiti " , talché circolano pochissime notizie riguardanti i membri e le attività dell ' organizzazione , e gli stessi capi delle varie " famiglie " tengono rigorosamente segreti , a differenza del passato , i nomi degli affiliati .
Sembra importante , altresì , notare che l'individuazione , in sede giudiziaria , di diversi membri di Cosa nostra , non ha prodotto , come a prima vista sarebbe sembrato logico , un decadimento della qualità dell ' organizzazione , dovuto alla necessità di rimpiazzare i vuoti con soggetti non sempre dotati delle caratteristiche necessarie per divenire " uomini d'onore " .
L'organizzazione , infatti , si è chiusa a riccio , e così , mentre si avvale stabilmente , per le meno impegnative attività illecite , della delinquenza comune , procede ad arruolamento di nuovi " uomini d'onore " dopo una verifica molto più rigorosa delle loro qualità .
Si sta realizzando , così , insieme con una maggiore coesione delle strutture di Cosa nostra , un collegamento tra l'organizzazione e la criminalità comune , la cui pericolosità è di tutta evidenza .
Va rilevato , infine , che esistono ed operano in varie zone della Sicilia , altre organizzazioni che possono essere definite , senz ' altro , di tipo mafioso , ma che , tuttavia , non appartengono a Cosa nostra , non essendo dalla stessa riconosciute , e che non hanno di per sé pari dimensioni e pericolosità .
Tale precisazione , frutto di approfondite indagini , appare di notevole importanza
pratica , poiché , da un lato , fornisce la chiave interpretativa di diverse vicende mafiose di rilievo ; dall ' altro , consente di distinguere con precisione gli appartenenti a Cosa nostra dai membri di organizzazioni similari .
Una situazione del genere , però , non è stata riscontrata , almeno allo stato attuale delle indagini , nella provincia di Palermo , in cui la presenza di Cosa nostra è totalizzante nelle vicende della criminalità organizzata ; per contro , ricorre in diversi centri della Sicilia , con la conseguenza che quelli che , nel passato , venivano etichettati indistintamente come scontri tra opposte fazioni mafiose , in realtà erano spesso faide tra la " famiglia " locale di Cosa nostra ed altre organizzazioni ad essa non appartenenti , il cui esito era , ovviamente , scontato .
Queste conoscenze sulla struttura essenzialmente unitaria di Cosa nostra , potranno consentire , insieme con altre risultanze probatorie , notevoli passi avanti nelle istruttorie di gravi procedimenti penali , fornendo una chiave di lettura puntuale di episodi criminosi finora avvolti nel mistero .
Ma non meno importanti sembrano le conoscenze acquisite sulle principali attività criminose attuali di Cosa nostra .
Negli ultimi anni , il traffico nazionale ed internazionale degli stupefacenti è sembrato - ed era - la più lucrosa delle attività illecite della mafia .
Ma forse , si è commesso un errore di segno opposto rispetto a quello compiuto nella sottovalutazione della pericolosità del contrabbando di tabacchi .
Si intende dire che , probabilmente , la necessaria attenzione ed il particolare impegno profusi dalle forze dell ' ordine nel tentativo di stroncare il traffico di stupefacenti ha fatto perdere di vista altre rilevanti attività illecite della mafia , che sono proseguite indisturbate .
Era forse inevitabile che ciò accadesse e non si intende muovere , per ciò , critica o censura a chicchessia , ma , adesso che le cognizioni del fenomeno mafioso sono più complete del passato , occorre rivolgere l'attenzione anche alle altre attività criminali , non meno importanti del traffico di stupefacenti , e forse , ancora più destabilizzanti dello stesso commercio della droga .
Nel settore dei pubblici appalti , ad esempio , gli interventi investigativi e gli approfondimenti istruttori sono assolutamente insoddisfacenti , mentre è certo che trattasi di attività fortemente inquinate dall ' intervento mafioso ed in cui si realizzano inquietanti saldature con oscuri centri di interessi economici , in grado di influenzare i pubblici poteri .
Né vanno trascurate le cosiddette truffe comunitarie che , a parte il discredito per l'immagine dell ' Italia nel contesto europeo , in Sicilia sono quasi sempre di matrice mafiosa e costituiscono , altresì , fonte di elevati profitti e , come è stato dimostrato dalle indagini istruttorie , comodo canale per il riciclaggio di danaro proveniente da traffico di stupefacenti .
La piaga , poi , delle estorsioni sistematizzate ha raggiunto livelli ancora superiori rispetto al passato , e la determinazione delle cosche nel pretendere i " balzelli " è provata dai numerosi omicidi di imprenditori , recentemente avvenuti soprattutto a Palermo .
Né va trascurato che questo fenomeno costituisce un grave fattore inquinante della stessa classe imprenditoriale , perché spesso si producono interessate familiarità tra i vari imprenditori soggetti alle estorsioni e gli stessi mafiosi , generalmente nella speranza che questi ultimi siano meno esosi nelle loro richieste estorsive ; e , al momento opportuno , tale familiarità viene utilizzata spregiudicatamente dagli " uomini d'onore " per ottenere protezioni ed appoggi di ogni genere , nonché per sfuggire alle investigazioni e per mantenersi latitanti .
E' , questo , uno dei campi in cui più subdola ed inquietante è l'infiltrazione della mafia nel tessuto sociale , tanto che è arduo distinguere , nei casi concreti , fino a che punto l'imprenditore sia una vittima della mafia e non si sia trasformato , invece , in una ruota dell ' ingranaggio , divenendo funzionale ed attivo nel sistema di potere mafioso .
Ed ancora , la cosiddetta microcriminalità - che tanto è a cuore della stampa locale - costituisce , almeno alla stato attuale , un problema non già distinto rispetto a quello della repressione della criminalità mafiosa , ma , per diversi aspetti , connesso .
Non si vuol dire , sia chiaro , che le numerosissime rapine commesse quotidianamente nei maggiori centri siciliani siano tutte da ascrivere ad attività di Cosa nostra , né che vi sia un disegno unitario preesistente .
Non vi è dubbio però che , avendo Cosa nostra il controllo del territorio , la consumazione di fatti illeciti senza reazione alcuna da parte della " famiglia " locale , è possibile solo in quanto tali fatti , per motivi più disparati , sono stati consentiti o voluti o tollerati dalla " famiglia " .
Va poi sottolineato che il generalizzato clima di allarme sociale determinato dalla consumazione di questi gravi reati - che , a mio avviso non vengono adeguatamente puniti nei rari casi in cui se ne sono individuati gli autori - finisce con l'essere funzionale al sistema mafioso .
Infatti , l'attenzione dell ' opinione pubblica viene distolta dai temi della repressione della grande criminalità e concentrata sull ' insicurezza dei cittadini , sul mancato intervento delle forze dell ' ordine , sull 'eccessivo peso dato alle indagini su una criminalità mafiosa oramai in ginocchio e non più pericolosa , e cosi via . [… ]
E ' indiscutibile che Cosa nostra è un organizzazione unica , radicata in tutta la Sicilia , con importanti ramificazioni nel resto d'Italia e con ambito di operatività anche all 'estero ; ed è parimenti provato - ed è stato riconosciuto dalla sentenza del cosiddetto maxiprocesso di Palermo - che l'organizzazione mafiosa è sotto il domino assoluto dei palermitani che ne dirigono ed orientano le attività .
Ora , poiché il principio dell ' obbligatorietà dell ' azione penale impone di perseguire tutti i responsabili di reati e , quindi , tutti gli appartenenti a Cosa nostra , sia per gli specifici reati- fine commessi , sia per i reati associativi , ci si chiede quale sia la soluzione processualmente praticabile .
E ' di tutta evidenza che un accentramento di tutti i procedimenti per i reati riferibili a Cosa nostra in un'unica sede giudiziaria , oltre ad essere un grave errore tattico , si risolverebbe , in definitiva , in un ulteriore regalo alla mafia per l'assoluta ingestibilità del processo . [ … ]
Io ritengo che la riconosciuta unità di Cosa nostra impone , nel quadro normativo della obbligatorietà dell ' azione penale , l'attribuzione ad un'unica autorità giudiziaria - e cioè a quella della sede dell ' associazione - della competenza a giudicare il delitto di associazione mafiosa , salva la possibilità di devolvere ad altro giudice , territorialmente competente , il giudizio sui singoli reati-mezzo dell ' organizzazione .
Ma in ogni caso , a prescindere dalle soluzioni concrete che , caso per caso , possono essere adottate , non è chi non veda che il nocciolo della questione non è tanto quello della individuazione in concreto delle autorità competenti in ordine a determinate fattispecie di reato , bensì quello della possibilità di avere , in ogni momento , un quadro , per quanto possibile , unitario e completo dell ' organizzazione e delle attività di Cosa nostra , in modo da poter cogliere i nessi ed i collegamenti tra vicende apparentemente slegate tra loro .
Ed allora , non è certamente la celebrazione di uno o più processi presso distinte autorità giudiziarie che potrà contribuire apprezzabilmente ad alleviare l'enorme carico di lavoro gravante sull ' autorità giudiziaria del luogo in cui ha sede Cosa nostra , in quanto quest ' ultimo giudice avrà sempre la necessità di prendere cognizione dei separati incarti processuali che spesso , si rivelano utili ai fini delle indagini sulla associazione solo dopo notevole lasso di tempo .
La individuazione dell ' autorità giudiziaria competente appare poi ancor più problematica per quelle associazioni , di cui si è constatata l'esistenza , diverse da Cosa nostra ma con questa collegate .
Per esempio , non è infrequente che uno o più " uomini d'onore " si avvalgano di associazioni criminali esterne , e cioè composte di membri non appartenenti a Cosa nostra ; oppure che , per specifiche attività illecite ( traffico di stupefacenti , etc. ) vengano costituite associazioni criminose che , sia pure sotto il manto protettivo di Cosa nostra , con la stessa non si identificano e sono composte , oltre che da mafiosi , anche da appartenenti alla criminalità comune e collegate con organizzazioni diverse ( ad esempio , organizzazioni dedite al riciclaggio del danaro sporco ) .
Questa complessa realtà criminale è stata espressamente riconosciuta anche dalla Suprema Corte che , più di una volta , ha ritenuto giuridicamente possibile la contemporanea appartenenza del medesimo soggetto a più organizzazioni criminali .
E ' chiaro , ovviamente , che tale teorica possibilità , di cui nessuno dubita , va poi verificata nel concreto ; e si tratta di una indagine estremamente delicata che , per difetto di specifiche conoscenze , comporta il rischio , da un lato di dedurre l'esistenza di pretese e non meglio qualificate associazioni mafiose da vicende associative che vanno più esattamente inquadrate in Cosa nostra , e , dall ' altro , di non cogliere l'esistenza di organizzazioni criminali distinte da Cosa nostra , seppur con la stessa collegate .
La situazione è , poi , resa ancora più complessa dalla proliferazione normativa di fattispecie associative , il che impone una approfondita analisi e distinzione di vicende che , tutto sommato , potrebbero essere trattate unitariamente .
Il nodo centrale , comunque , resta sempre quello di coniugare le specifiche previsioni normative di reati associativi con il principio dell ' obbligatorietà dell ' azione penale , nei confronti di tutti i membri dell ' associazione criminale .
Non intendo qui pronunciarmi , né a favore della discrezionalità dell ' azione penale , né a favore dell ' abolizione o di una drastica riduzione dei reati associativi ; desidero soltanto osservare che , anche col nuovo codice , il problema dei processi- inchiesta , come sono stati efficacemente chiamati , rimarrà irrisolto e forse sarà aggravato , se resterà immutato questo quadro normativo , sostanziale e processuale . [ … ]
Tirando a questo punto le fila del mio discorso , vorrei ribadire che bisogna finalmente smetterla di parlare di " emergenza - mafia " e cercare di attrezzarci in modo serio per affrontare una situazione che , ancora per lunghi anni , impegnerà le strutture repressive statuali .
Gli interventi di bonifica e di promozione sociale sono indubbiamente indispensabili e costituiscono , probabilmente , la chiave di volta per affrontare alla radice il fenomeno mafioso ; e il funzionamento più efficiente della macchina statale , in tutte le sue articolazioni , costituirebbe il segno più tangibile della presenza delle istituzioni in vaste zone del Mezzogiorno d'Italia dove , finora , lo Stato ha brillato solo per la sua assenza .
Ma questi interventi , senz ' altro auspicabili , da un lato non sono in alcun modo ricollegabili con l'esercizio della funzione giurisdizionale e , dall ' altro , non debbono costituire il comodo alibi per giustificare la sostanziale inazione dell ' autorità giudiziaria nel perseguimento di crimini che , per numero e gravità , non hanno pari nella storia dello Stato unitario .
Ci sono voluti lunghi decenni per renderci conto che non solo la mafia esiste , ma che ha terribili potenzialità criminali e costituisce grave fattore destabilizzante per le istituzioni democratiche ; è sperabile che non ci voglia un periodo altrettanto lungo per attrezzarci in modo adeguato per poter vincere questa autentica sfida allo Stato democratico .
Nel concreto , bisognerà porre ogni attenzione per poter circoscrivere ed isolare il fenomeno , tenendo sempre ben presente che comportamenti e attività illecite che in altre parti d'Italia sono espressione di comune devianza , in Sicilia , e , in genere , nel Mezzogiorno , acquistano ben diverso significato .
Occorre , in altri termini , che i centri di poteri e di interessi - che finora , al di là di mere affermazioni verbali , hanno ritenuto possibile la convivenza con la mafia - si rendano conto che i tempi sono ormai maturi per ripudiare qualsiasi intesa con organizzazioni ormai anacronistiche per un Paese civile come il nostro .
Solo così ridotto a puro fatto criminale , il fenomeno mafioso potrà essere affrontato e represso giudiziariamente senza quelle interferenze e quelle pressioni che purtroppo ben conosce chiunque si occupi di processi contro organizzazioni mafiose .
In questa ottica , a mio avviso , gli uffici giudiziari nelle zone costituenti l'epicentro delle organizzazioni mafiose dovrebbero essere strutturati in modo da assicurare in modo stabile e continuo il flusso delle necessarie informazioni e notizie fra i vari magistrati incaricati delle istruttorie , tenendo ben presente che , nelle zone ad alta densità mafiosa , ogni inquirente deve essere professionalmente attrezzato per comprendere ed affrontare i molteplici problemi derivanti dalla presenza della mafia .
E tali esigenze di razionalità organizzativa saranno esaltate dalla prossima riforma del codice di rito penale , come sicuramente sarà evidenziato dalle altre relazioni .
Dovrebbe , infine , essere compiuto ogni sforzo per ottenere la costituzione di nuclei di polizia giudiziaria , altamente specializzati , centralizzati e strutturati , in grado di intervenire in ogni parte del territorio nazionale in stretto raccordo con l'autorità giudiziaria e di polizia giudiziaria locali .
Organismi centralizzati e sgravati dalle esigenze della quotidianità avrebbero il duplice pregio di attuare una continua attività di intelligence informativa e di assicurare , in una visione finalmente globale ed unitaria del fenomeno mafioso , i necessari raccordi con le unità territoriali , individuate volta per volta sulla base delle esigenze contingenti .
Solo così potrà essere assicurata una seria e razionale attività di polizia giudiziaria , in relazione alla gravità dei problemi .

An unusual book ( Andrew Jenner )
Reviews of This Book is an extremely unusual book , and therefore calls for a most unusual review .
The book consists of nothing but reviews of itself .
At first glance , one might think that this would make the reviewer 's job extremely easy - all he or she has to do is reproduce part of the book .
However , this seemingly cunning plan has a fatal flaw - the book has n't been written yet .
Writing a review of a book without reading it is itself a formidable task , but in this case , the reviewer 's job is doubly difficult because , in the process of reviewing , he or she has to write part of the book !
This brings to mind an old joke about critics becoming critics because they lack the talent to write books themselves , so one might expect Reviews of this book to be somewhat mediocre .
But just as one should n't count one 's chickens before they are hatched , one should n't judge a book before it has been written .
Book reviews can be entertaining in their own right , even if you have never read ( or have no intention of reading ) the book in question .
Hopefully , some of the world 's leading reviewers will review ( and therefore contribute to ) this book , and hopefully this will make it extremely entertaining reading and raise it above the level of " just a gimmick " .
Although he has not contributed to it directly ( other than providing inspiration ) , Reviews of this book is the brainchild of Douglas Hofstadter , author of such classic books as " Gödel , Escher , Bach : An Eternal Golden Braid " and " Metamagical Themas " .
In the latter of these , Hofstadter writes :
... Reviews of This Book , is just a fantasy of mine .
I would love to see a book consisting of nothing but a collection of reviews of it that appeared ( after its publication , of course ) in major newspapers and magazines .
It sounds paradoxical , but it could be arranged with a lot of planning and hard work .
First , a group of major journals would all have to agree to run reviews of the book by the various contributors to the book .
Then all the reviewers would begin writing .
But they would have to mail off their various drafts to all the other reviewers very regularly so that all the reviews could evolve together , and thus eventually reach a stable state of a kind known in physics as a " Hartree - Fock self - consistent solution " .
Then the book could be published , after which its reviews would come out in their respective journals , as per arrangement .
That was written in 1985 .
Since then , technology has evolved which could make the task of writing Reviews much easier .
It could start off with just one " review " , which does n't really need to be a review at all ( indeed it cannot really be , since there is nothing to review at this point ) .
Then other people could come and review that review , adding their work to the work so far .
Of course , the process of reviewing changes that being reviewed , so each reviewer will probably want to edit their reviews many times , stopping only when all the reviewers feel that their reviews are good and fair reviews of the entire book .
This can all be done on a website - regularly updated with the latest reviews and therefore always an up - to - date copy of the book .
That website is what you 're reading right now .
Like any community , this one will need rules to keep it from deteriorating into anarchy .
The rules are simple : authors will have complete editorial control over their own reviews , but our benevolent [ 1 ] dictator of an editor , Richard Herley ( see review below ) , will choose which reviews become part of the final project .
When the Hartree - Fock state is finally achieved , the book will be published electronically and any proceeds donated to some charity which seeks to improve communications between people , such as the RNID ( contributers would be expected to grant their copyrights to the project for this purpose . )
A few weeks before the eBook is due to be published , the organizers can email an announcement to newspapers , magazines and broadcasters all over the world and invite editors to download just one review to publish or read out .
Reviews could also be posted on any websites hosted by contributors , and could also be posted in discussion groups all over the net , with links to the project 's home page so the curious can download a copy of the book .
Perhaps reviewers who work for major journals will pick up on this and contribute , and ( if the finished result is good ) maybe it will even be published in paper form .
I hope that the reviews will not all say " Reviews of This Book is an utterly pointless waste of time , consisting of the same sentence repeated hundreds of times " , but will instead bring out the best in book reviewers - allowing them to write thought provoking essays on the nature of books , reviewing , and self - reference .
Some fantastic jokes have been made in reviews [ 2 ] so hopefully the book will be very funny as well as thought provoking .
Anyway , if you 're a book reviewer for a major journal ( or even if you 're just a budding proto - reviewer , but especially if you 're a book reviewer for a major journal ) and would like to write a review of Reviews of This Book , please go ahead and write it , and then send it to me , Andrew Jenner , for inclusion here .
In conclusion , I think that Reviews of This Book has great potential and is already quite entertaining , although is a little short at the moment to be accurately called a book .
Andrew Jenner
[ 1 ] I say benevolent , but Richard says : " I hereby warn innocent contributors that the description of Charles Kinbote -- annotator of John Shade 's poem in PALE FIRE by the divine Mr Nabokov , as given on the back of the Penguin edition -- could equally apply to myself : '... this all - too - efficient editor is not as other editors are .
Haughty , inquisitive , eccentric , intolerant he certainly is ; but is he -- can he possibly be -- mad , bad , even dangerous ? ' "
[ 2 ]
Although usually at the expense of the book , as in :
" The covers of this book are too far apart " ,
" This is a book to kill time for those that prefer it dead " ,
" This is not a book to be laid aside lightly .
It should be hurled with all your force into the furthest corner of the room , "
" Once I 'd put it down I could n't pick it up again , "
" Of all the books Mintzberg has written , this one is without doubt his latest , "
" This books is a jewel - insomniacs will find it invaluable " and , of course , Groucho Marx 's classic
" From the time I picked up your book until I put it down I was convulsed with laughter .
Some day I intend reading it . "

A New Take on the Written Word ( Richard Herley )
Nature is essentially uncertain .
From the quantum level upwards , Heisenberg is king [ 1 ] .
Electrons can be in two places at once ; the properties of benzene [ 2 ] are understandable only if you accept that its molecule exists simultaneously in two mutually exclusive isomers , called from their shape the ' boat ' and the ' chair ' ; and the cosmos will continue to expand indefinitely , even though it began by contraction to a single point and the consequent Big Bang was only one in an infinite series of similar bangs .
This selfsame uncertainty is manifest in human perception .
The brain interprets external stimuli using memory and imagination .
You recognize the things you already know .
New things are processed in part by comparing their familiar aspects , if any , with those of the known ; but their unfamiliar aspects are processed by the imagination .
In so doing the brain strives to come up with the best , the likeliest , answer for each set of data it receives .
All this usually happens at breakneck speed .
The blizzard of information -- sight , sound , taste , touch , smell , feel , kinetic feedback -- reaching the brain is continuously being made sense of .
The software responsible is so subtle that most of us , most of the time , are not even aware of the miracle we are performing .
Sometimes , when this process is interfered with , we cannot decide on a best answer and ambiguity is produced .
Typically this happens when the distinction between the remembered and the imagined becomes blurred .
We have developed , for instance , certain conventions to represent three - dimensional objects on a two - dimensional medium like paper .
Optical illusions exploit these conventions and the assumptions they require .
We find these puzzles enjoyable but vaguely unsettling .
It reminds us that our interpretation of the world is nothing more than that .
Which brings me to a remarkable new book , Reviews of this Book , comprising solely reviews of itself .
Like an optical illusion , Reviews of this Book can be regarded as an exploration of ambiguity .
Ambiguity is the father of paradox , and it is paradox which lies at the heart of this work .
You see , I am reviewing this book before it has even been written , yet my review will be , or might be , part of the book .
The book exists in that Escherian [ 3 ] otherworld of illusion and ambiguity , the world of the imagination : it has existed there since at least 1985 , when it was proposed by that tireless investigator of paradox , Douglas R. Hofstadter .
In Metamagical Themas he says of this idea : ' [ it ] is just a fantasy of mine .
I would love to see a book consisting of nothing but a collection of reviews of it that appeared ( after its publication , of course ) in major newspapers and magazines .
It sounds paradoxical , but it could be arranged with a lot of planning and hard work .
First , a group of major journals would all have to agree to run reviews of the book by the various contributors to the book .
Then all the reviewers would begin writing .
But they would have to mail off their various drafts to all the other reviewers very regularly so that all the reviews could evolve together , and thus eventually reach a stable state of a kind known in physics as a " Hartree - Fock self - consistent solution " .
Then the book could be published , after which its reviews would come out in their respective journals , as per arrangement . '
Computer technology has overtaken the world of conventional publishing .
We no longer need newspapers and magazines , or the co-operation of their editors , to turn Hofstadter 's vision into reality .
Because this book is as yet unwritten , it is perfect .
This , putatively the first review , is already sullying Hofstadter 's vision by defining and delimiting some small corner of it .
My choice of words and the effect it has on subsequent reviewers have already done their damage .
This most beautiful creation has now been compromised , much as paradise is corrupted by the arrival of the first tourist .
Yet the finished work is a celebration of what it means to be human .
We are human because we can imagine and make connections to a level of abstraction unknown elsewhere in the animal kingdom ; and we are human because we can communicate our imaginings to one another .
In conveying them , we raise each other to new heights of consciousness .
Reviews of this Book requires a new tense .
Past , present , and future tenses are inadequate to the task .
It has been written ; is being written ; will be written .
As the verb blends from future to past the quality of the text changes , becoming realized rather than imagined .
But even the realized text is subject to revision , and so the verb becomes even more complex .
The labyrinth made by these complexities is for me the chief interest of the book .
Like Theseus [ 4 ] , the reviewers are unspooling thread on their way to the centre where dwells a creature whose form they can , while writing , but dimly imagine .
If you find the human imagination the most fascinating mystery of all , I urge you to read this book .
You wo n't be disappointed .
Unless , of course , it turns out to be a complete load of rubbish .
Richard Herley
A partial commentary on Richard Herley 's review , by himself
[ 1 ] Heisenberg is king :
Or rather , his Uncertainty Principle .
Werner Karl Heisenberg ( 1901 - 76 ) , a wily physicist , upset everyone with his calculations about the momentum of electrons .
[ 2 ] Benzene :
An organic compound composed of carbon and hydrogen , liquid at normal temperatures and pressures .
Has a notionally hexagonal molecule .
One of God 's neatest ideas .
Inhaling or drinking benzene is briefly fun but fatal and is therefore NOT RECOMMENDED .
[ 3 ] Escherian : By , or pertaining to the works of , M. C. Escher ( 1878 -1972 ) .
Another clever fellow , Dutch I believe , noted for his intricate representations of impossible scenes .
I like the Dutch a great deal and one of my happiest memories involves eating fish and chips at the market in Enschede in May , 1984 .
[ 4 ]
Theseus : Son of Aegeus , king of Athens .
A hearty .
He volunteered to be one of the seven youths , with seven maidens , whom the Athenians were obliged to send each year to be devoured by the Minotaur [ 5 ] in Crete .
You guessed it , Theseus slew the beast with a special sword , then found his way out of its labyrinth using a clew of thread -- I 'm sure you now remember the story in all its detail and can spare me the need to go on .
[ 5 ]
Minotaur : A fabulous creature , half man and half bull , partial to human flesh .
Its labyrinth was constructed by Daedalus , the legendary genius of sculpture and architecture , whose name was borrowed by James Joyce [ 9 ] for one of the characters in Ulysses , my favourite sentence of which reads as follows : ' He [ 6 ] kicked open the crazy [ 7 ] door of the jakes [ 8 ] . '
( Page 83 in the 1960 Bodley Head edition . )
[ 6 ]
He : Mr Leopold Bloom , protagonist of the book .
[ 7 ]
Crazy : Hanging askew .
[ 8 ]
Jakes : Privy .
[ 9 ]
James Joyce : A Hibernian , cleverer than Heisenberg and Escher put together .
Friend of Flann O'Brien ( Brian O'Nolan ) , whose novel At Swim - Two - Birds first saw daylight in 1939 .
Initial sales were unfortunately too small to avert World War II .
By these means we have finally arrived at Mr O'Brien 's yarn ( or thread , unclewed for the benefit of his readers ) , whose book - within - a - book , written by one Dermot Trellis , has many parallels with the project in hand .
The characters gang up on the heartless author [ Trellis ] and try him for his crimes .
His maid , Teresa , puts paid to his literary ambitions by inadvertently lighting the fire with his manuscript , exemplifying the sad but inevitable conclusion of all human endeavour .
I say nothing about the self evident book - within - a - bookness of Ulysses and hereby assign to others hereafter , at present unknown , the task of continuing , amending , refuting , ridiculing , exploring , ignoring or disproving my adumbrations .

Reviewing Their Possibilities ( Michael Kelly )
Stephen Potter in his timeless Lifemanship books succinctly defined the art of literary reviewing as that of becoming one - up on the author without actually tampering with the text .
' In other words , how , as critic , to show that it is really you yourself who should have written the book , if you had had the time , and since you had n't , you are glad that someone has , although obviously it might have been done better . '
This being so , the reviewer of Reviews of This Book is faced with both a unique opportunity and a dizzying challenge , since he gets to both tamper with the text and help write the book , but is also faced with the necessity of becoming one - up not only on the other contributors but on his own self .
Like the book itself , he must end up like the mythical serpent Ourobouros , with his head lodged firmly up his own fundament .
A word of explanation is in order .
Reviews of This Book is an evolving metadocument consisting only of reviews of itself .
It was inspired by an idea by one Douglas R. Hofstadter , who I imagine to be the kind of genius - nutcase pointy - head who lives in an attic giggling to himself over his favourite irrational numbers , who whiled away a long winter evening once by positing the notion of a book composed of nothing but reviews of the book .
When he first revealed this brainwave his friends and guardians made soothing noises and backed away slowly , but , thanks to the magic of the internet and the misplaced energy of a couple of imbecile - savants named Andrew Jenner and Richard Herley , Hofstadter 's batty scheme has become a reality .
Over a period of months a group of critics , thinkers , and graduate - school goof - offs will / have / will have contribute ( d ) reviews of Reviews of This Book , palimpsesting their original reviews periodically to take into account new additions .
The idea is that eventually the work will metastasize into a stable form which will then be published , reviewed in journals by parts of itself ( an act which brings to my mind a certain auto - erotic practice dogs indulge in Because They Can ) , and filmed by Peter Jackson starring New Zealand as the book .
Joking aside , the idea is a fascinating one and the book itself , while at the moment shorter even than such famously slender volumes as The Thoughts of George Bush or Laugh Along With Franz Kafka , lives up to its promise .
If I may echo Mary McCarthy 's review of Nabokov 's Pale Fire ( a book to which Herley acknowledges himself indebted for his editorial style and the delightfully scatty footnotes adorning his review ) , Reviews of This Book is an elaborate arrangement of mirrors reflecting each other .
It is a many - sided crystal every facet of which contains every other , or a shredded hologram postcard like the one in William Gibson 's story ' Fragments of a Hologram Rose ' , every shard of which contains the image of the whole .
It may be the first book ever to achieve self - awareness ; again to reference Gibson , it reminds me of the ending of ' The Difference Engine ' , with Lady Ada 's mega - computer overloading with the synergy of its multiple viewpoints and triumphantly achieving intelligence : ' The Eye at last must see itself .
Myself ... I see : I see , I see I !'
It is a droll investigation into the difference between being and becoming .
It may well become an exercise in literary log - rolling reduced to an absurd level .
It recalls the language - laboratory experiments of writers such as Nathalie Sarraute or Robbe - Grillet .
It is a cucumber or a stick of seaside rock , every slice of which is the same and yet different .
Yes , that is how I will think of this book , as a marvellous metamagical cucumber .
Be that as it may , what does the book actually contain ?
Enough about the sum of the parts , what of the parts ?
Both Jenner and Herley are clearly men C.P.
Snow would have been keen to hang out with .
Indeed , he would have kitted them out with matching gang jackets with ' Two Cultures ' embroidered on the back and the three of them would have gone swaggering around campuses together shouldering Science - or - Humanities chauvinists off the pavement .
They are equally at home discussing Hartree - Fock states or Nabokov , Escher or Heisenberg , and I hate them .
Jenner performs the difficult task of introducing the project with aplomb .
I was surprised , however , that in his appended list of humorous book reviews he neglected to include Groucho Marx 's classic , ' From the time I picked up your book until I put it down I was convulsed with laughter .
Some day I intend reading it . '
Herley propounds his vision of the book as a celebration of the transcendence of the human imagination with an infectious fire in his belly , yet does not neglect the art of narrative .
From the beginning , with Heisenberg enthroned as King , through the second act curtain , with Ambiguity sensationally revealed as the father of Paradox , to the gripping climax in the labyrinth of Knossos , it is clear we are in the hands of an exponent of high drama and classical tragedy almost on a par with Sophocles .
His conception of the first review as causing The Fall from a tabula rasae Eden of infinite possibilities is touching and poignant .
But lest he be wracked with guilt , let us rather see it as the first stroke which determines the rest , the Word which was in the beginning , the flaw in the cosmic mirror giving rise to Creation .
I was sorry , though , that Herley references Flann O'Brien 's At - Swim - Two - Birds as paralleling this book yet fails to mention the same author 's The Dalkey Archive , which , with its theory of mollycular exchange and policeman becoming part bicycle while his bicycle becomes part policeman , will surely become equally relevant to the project as the contributors ' various styles and obsessions slowly but surely rub off on each other in the months to come .
As for Michael Kelly 's review , I am afraid it marks a disappointing falling - off after the early promise of the first two contributions .
Kelly never really achieves consistency of tone .
He begins with some jocular faux - naif egghead - baiting , then suddenly abandons this and tries to turn intellectual himself .
He throws in a couple of likely - sounding words such as ' metastasize ' and ' palimpsest ' and ' synergy ' and drops a few O.K. names , but he is bluffing and he knows it .
He fawns over the other critics in the hopes they will be kind to his own effort , while making obvious attempts at Potteresque oneupmanship .
I also have to regret that , after the almost monastic asceticism of the first two pieces , so refreshing in our salacious modern literature , Kelly 's review drags an unwelcome note of prurience into the enterprise , ending as it does with the word abdomen .

Sartre , Lenin , Hartree and Fock : quantum physics and the ontology of Marxism ( Charlene V. Babbage , Reader in Philosophy at the University of Muskateegee )
[ This review has been withdrawn at the request of the author ]
A Beautiful Idea Abused ( Natalie Praed )
I unreservedly reject everything Charlene Babbage has to say about Reviews of This Book .
She misses the point .
And like far too many of the reviewers on this site , she regards it not as a place for serious consideration of Hofstadter 's ideas , but as a forum for showing off and angling for smartass laughs .
It 's juvenile and pathetic and Douglas R. deserves better .
I have tried in vain to find out from our so - called editor how Babbage 's contribution came to be written .
Was it on her own impulse , or was it solicited by him ?
Does he know her , socially , professionally , or even in the biblical sense ?
His silence on this matter is sinister and , I think , a cause for concern .
O.K. , Babbage is a professor of existential philosophy , but the best she can get these days is a chair at some crappy midwestern university where most of the students and not a few of the faculty are functional illiterates .
She may once have sat at a café table with Jeal - Paul Sartre , fed his cat when he was on holiday , or for all I care taken part in a threesome with Simone de Beauvoir , but that does n't qualify her to go so far beyond the tenets of existentialism as to claim that ' ... application of Hartree - Fock parameters to such plays as Huis clos ( 1944 ) and Altona ( 1960 ) casts the whole of Sartre 's canon in an entirely new light ' or that 'in Men Without Shadows [ he ] gives a stunning prognostication of the whole paradox enshrined in Reviews of This Book ' , or , even worse , ' when my spellchecker balked at " existentialism " it offered the alternative of " exprobation " , which strikes me as a miraculous window into the unknown possibilities of cyber - language ' etc. , etc .
Really , this will not do .
It is not good enough for someone like Babbage to come along and impose these constructs on the work of the greatest mind of the 20th century .
Where in her piece is evidence of the most basic academic rigor ?
Peer examination ?
Or even logic ?
And where , pray , is a shred of evidence that Sartre ever ' betrayed his underlying contempt for Marxism by peevishly complaining , like some petit - bourgeois , that the dry - cleaners had shrunk his beret ' ?
Until Herley makes plain the nature of his connection with la Babbage , I feel other contributors should withhold their reviews in protest .
If it transpires that favoritism of any sort is at work , we should demand that her review be erased .
Only when this has happened can the stately progression of our project towards Hartree - Fock stability be resumed .
In anger
Natalie Praed
Cool it , Natalie ( Paul Vermeyer )
I was lucky enough to read the Babbage piece before it was pulled .
It made its points most pithily and I for one am a convert .
Dr Praed 's familiarity with the works of J.- P. S. is not as complete as she pretends .
In Iron in the Soul ( p. 221 in the Viking edn of Sparshott 's translation ) Mathieu enters the dry - cleaner 's shop and complains ' you have shrunk my cardigan , you stupid bastards , and at the same time you have managed to stretch the arms so that it makes me look like a chimpanzee ' .
In a footnote , Sparshott shows that this incident is based on Sartre 's diary entry for October 23rd , 1933 .
His best beret was indeed ruined .
In the subsequent uproar [ Sartre ] was ' thrown into the street and landed on my arse ' .
The proprietor of the shop became a personification of capitalism and Sartre 's dalliance with Marxism dates from this time : it has nothing to do with Hitler , as Praed simplistically argues elsewhere .
So cool it , Natalie , and accept that there are other views of the world besides your own .
This is no place for intolerance .
With this is mind I urge the editor to reinstate the Babbage review .
Paul Vermeyer
[ Alas , the umbrage taken by Prof. Babbage at Natalie Praed 's attack seems permanent .
Incidentally , I have never met her and have no designs on her body .
Charlene , if you change your mind why not send an email with your permission -- together with your phone number and a recent pic ?
A snapshot of Sartre 's cat is appended for the curious . ]
Praed of Ignorance ( Veronica Smoot - Hawley )
I agree with Paul Vermeyer that Natalie Praed 's review was stupid , vicious and unfair .
While it may go too far in places -- I am still not sure how she thinks quantum theory relates to the films of Jerry Lewis -- Charlene Babbage 's thesis was a timely hand - grenade lobbed into this moribund project .
I also strongly urge that it be reinstated .
In fact , I am considering embarking on a hunger strike until it is .
I am bemused by the aspersions cast by Dr Praed on the academic standing of the University of Muskateegee .
Praed may not know that Muskateegee is the repository of all Sartre 's surviving correspondence with his dry-cleaners .
Moreover the municipality of Muskateegee is known to many as the existentialism capital of the prairie states , and the number of motiveless murders and random life - choices there is well above the national average .
As to Charlene Babbage 's own credentials -- the fact is , unlike Dr Praed , who I doubt has ever got closer to the Left Bank than Paris , Texas , Babbage has spent time in Sartre 's milieu -- Praed seems not to be aware that Babbage 's first husband was Sartre 's close disciple Charles Boisson [ 1 ] .
And while I have no information as to whether Babbage ever fed Sartre 's cat , it is not actually that far - fetched given the fact that on two well - documented occasions Sartre entrusted the care of his house - plants to the Boissons while he was away .
So much for Praed 's crass sarcasm !
I must take exception with Mr Vermeyer on a couple of minor points , however .
He is in error if he believes that the shrunken beret incident took place in 1933 .
In fact it was 1953 .
The date matters because several authorities now consider that Sartre 's breach with Albert Camus can be attributed to the latter 's insensitive reaction to the mishap -- according to Juliette Greco [ 2 ] , upon beholding Sartre wearing the resized headgear Camus giggled and said , " Is that a beret or did a poodle crap on your head , cock - eye ? "
A more important point is that the picture he provides is not , by any means , Sartre 's cat .
For one thing , the cat in the photograph is clearly reading the collaborationist newspaper Je Suis Partout .
In fact , it is Celine 's cat , Bebert , which was tarred and feathered after the Liberation for allowing Germans to rub its belly .
I must also deplore our editor 's blatant attempt to hit on Charlene Babbage .
Whatever the function of this book - in - embryo may turn out to be , it is certainly not a pick - up joint .
That said , I must inform him that he would have better luck with Natalie Praed , unless she has changed her habits greatly since our Vassar days .
[ 1 ] Charles Alain Boisson , 1910 - 1979 .
Marxist , resistance hero and Cahiers du Cinema journalist .
Author of a seminal work on Hitchcock 's films , " Modes of Alienation in Tippi Hedren 's Hairstyles " .
Notorious for his unfavourable review of Francois Truffaut 's " Day For Night " , in which he proposed that Truffaut be executed " Pour encourager les auteurs " .
[ 2 ] Juliette Greco , 1927 - .
French chanteuse and bohemian figure .
[ Thanks for the tip , Veronica .
If you 're reading this , Natalie , give me a buzz .
I made the mistake of reading Mary McCarthy 's The Group , so I know all about Vassar girls .
Ed .
And hey , Veronica , you can give me a buzz , too !
Even though you know diddly - squat about Jean - Paul S. and his posse . ]
" Sartre 's Cat " : A Hermeneutic Approach ( Janet Ingram )
My attention has been drawn to the controversy surrounding the identity of the cat pictured on this website .
I should explain that I am a forensic scientist employed by the Home Office in Britain .
My special area is hermeneutic examination of films , videos and photographs .
Cursory examination of the snapshot shows that the cat is morbidly overweight .
Obesity on such a scale suggests that this pet has learned to visit many places for food besides its owner's .
In all probability it has also been ingesting anabolic steroids .
The fact that it has fallen asleep on a table indicates a low level of alertness , consistent with consumption of steroids .
Turning now to the surroundings , we note that the skirting - board is of the same shade to be found in all extant photographs of Le Café Grec post 1937 .
This was a Left Bank establishment much favoured by the existentialists ( see Babbage 1990 , Grincheux 1973 ) .
The red table - top and beechwood chairs are also typical of that café .
It has been suggested that the newspaper is Je Suis Partout .
In terms of format , print density , and pulp colour I find nothing inconsistent with this suggestion , though the comparatively coarse ( 200 ASA ) grain of the emulsion does not permit the sort of enlargement necessary to read the type .
If required I could pass the image to one of my colleagues for digital enhancement .
The orange - red footstool and matching plant - stand (? ) cannot be identified .
The object on the plant - stand (? ) is an early example of a Moulinex croissant - heater ( Model A - 09 ) which was not on sale before October 1939 and which was superseded by the A - 11 in April 1947 .
Chemical analysis of the print itself ( my thanks to Mr Herley for providing this ) reveals that the paper was made by Kodak between 1941 and 1945 .
The heavy - metal content of the emulsion indicates a manufacturing date around June 1942 .
The reverse of the print is stamped in pale grey with the legend : " Kodak Paper , Sep 1942 " .
Unless this is an elaborate forgery perpetrated for obscure reasons of academic rivalry , we can take this as indicating the date of printing .
It is reported ( Herring and le Blanc , 1968 ) that Sartre hated cats .
He writes in his 1966 essay , Dégoût , " I hate them " , and later in the same piece eulogizes The Sailor Who Fell from Grace from the Sea .
The protagonist in this story is one of a gang of schoolboys who kill and dissect a kitten .
The scene is praised by Sartre for making him throw up while reading .
Sartre is also reported ( Farnweiter 1988 ) as getting in trouble over the neighbourhood cats when he visited Camus in Algeria .
He told the Oran police : " They are large enough to present a satisfactory target , but small enough to provide a challenge . "
Farnweiter reproduces an arrest - sheet dated 7 April 1952 .
Sartre narrowly escaped the charge that " ( i ) with a Smith and Wesson .38 revolver he did lie in ambush for and shoot an elderly marmalade cat , property of Mme Ernestine Ploc ; and ( ii ) he did with said firearm destroy 7 roof tiles , a chimney pot and a radio aerial , property of the aforementioned .
Suspect released with a caution .
Ammunition confiscated . "
CONCLUSION
Evidence for the cat being 's Sartre 's rather than Celine 's : the picture may well have taken in Le Café Grec , one of Sartre 's haunts .
Inconclusive evidence : date of photograph , June -- September 1942 , fits both possibilities .
Identity of newspaper not established .
Evidence against : all other data .

An intriguing look into the world of paradox , not only discussing it , but illustrating it in a way even the simplest person can understand .
A Review That Has Little To Say About the Previous Reviews Which is Something of a Challenge Given the Content of Reviews of This Book and is Excessively Titled ( Bren MacDibble )
There were world wars fought over less volatile differences than those of the fans and nay - sayers of Reviews of This Book .
This ground - breaking work has been charged with being innovative and visionary or juvenile and pathetic , depending on whom you talk to .
What needs to be noted , however , is that at its heart Reviews of This Book is a ' feelgood ' book designed to put a smile on your face ( the questioning your own existence thing is just an unforeseen side - effect ) .
This is a bizarre , disturbing and yet oddly comical look into the creation of a paradox .
With a steadily increasing cast of protagonists as diverse as they are devious ( including a cat of dubious credentials and a very small beret which the cat may or may not from time to time wear ) , and antagonists almost as scary as sheep , the reader cannot help but hope the goal of the plot will win through .
The goal , of course , is one man 's desire ( Douglas Hofstadter 's ) to make his mark on the world ( well , a further mark , he does have a few nice books out , after all ) .
An unusual mark .
One of those marks that , if you stare at it long enough , it seems to spiral upon itself until you cannot tell the beginning from the end or even the middle ( and if you stare at it any longer you become a gibbering fool and feel compelled to add to the tale ) BUT , a mark nonetheless .
Asking the cart to pull the horse is not likely to serve you well in the future .
This much we know ( although someone is yet to inform Messrs Jenner and Herley , the driving force behind this particular cart which may indeed learn to pull the horse or at the very least cause the pair to be fined for erratic use of media ) .
It does , however , make for a delightful read .

My Cat ( Erwin Schrödinger )
I do not wish to stoke the fires of controversy , but the cat belonged neither to Sartre nor Celine .
He was mine , and famously featured in my 1935 paper , Die gegenwartige Situation in der Quantenmechanik , Naturwissenschaftern 23 : 807-812 ; 823 , 844-849 .
If you are familiar with quantum mechanics you will already know my 1926 equation for the wave function of a particle , the time - independent version of which is :
where is the wave function , the Laplace operator , the Planck constant , the particle 's mass , its total energy , and its potential energy .
In accordance with current consumer law , I must add that my equation is exactly soluble only for very simple cases .
Approximations are needed for more complicated atoms and molecules , which is where our ingenious and charming friends , Hartree and Fock , come in .
It is not generally known that my cat expired during the 1935 experiment .
Poisoning by hydrocyanic acid is at least swift , a fact of which the Nazis were apprised .
( I will return , very briefly , to this unpleasant line of thought in a moment ) .
The photo shows poor Albert laid out on a table in the sun-room of my house in Headington .
He was buried in the garden and given all due honours in the name of wave mechanics .
A bronze plaque still marks the spot .
I left my native Austria in 1933 to avoid the Nazis , who as you know had worrying plans .
I went to Oxford , but three years later returned to Graz thinking perhaps I had judged them too harshly .
No : I was right the first time , and in 1938 fled to the safety of Dublin and the Institute of Advanced Studies .
Here I was assigned to a team headed by Professor B. O'Nolan .
O'Nolan was a man of such extraordinary insight that he rejected mathematics as the natural language of physics .
His formulae were instead all expressed in literary form .
It was quite a culture shock for me , I can tell you !
Here I was , joint winner of the 1933 Nobel Prize for physics , reduced to the position of mere factotum .
For the first three weeks all I was allowed to do around the lab .
was sharpen pencils and fill inkwells .
As time went on O'Nolan showed more confidence in me and soon I was a full member of the team .
We were working on a project so revolutionary , so incredible , that I was at first dazzled by its potential .
To put O'Nolan 's Primary Equation into crude mathematical terms :
where is the ' immanence of God ' and is the ' sum of possibilities in all possible universes ' .
Even today I find this formulation easier to understand than its literary equivalent , which I nonetheless reproduce :
A PINT OF PLAIN IS YOUR ONLY MAN .
O'Nolan thus reduces the whole of science , including the knowledge which allowed the creation of nuclear weapons , to a mere corollary of his unifying theorem .
My friend Albert Einstein was moved to epiphanous tears on reading the Primary Equation .
We scurried at once to the pub , where he cried : ' What 's your shout , Schrödinger , my dear fellow ? '
I could tell he had already grasped the very crux of the Theorem .
Later , describing this moment , he wrote : 'as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality , they are not certain , and as far as they are certain , they do not refer to reality . '
The spring and summer of 1938 were for O'Nolan 's team an exhausting race against its own limitations .
We knew that , if only we could publish in time , widespread dissemination of the Theorem would render all conflict impossible .
On 3 September 1938 - how little then did we realize the ominous significance of that date !
- the manuscript was completed and rushed by courier to the London offices of Messrs Longmans Green , who had on instructions from the War Office cleared their lists for the Book to End All Books .
The publishers tried to change the title from ' At Swim - Two - Birds by Flann O'Brien ' to something they regarded as more commercial , but were overruled on the direct order of the British Prime Minister .
The publishers were right and we were wrong .
Sales in the period to 30 June 1939 did not even cover the £ 50 advance ( this sum having already been disbursed on Grandchild , which fell in the 4.30 at Gatwick on Friday 16 April , 1937 ) .
With such low sales , the combined sensibilities of readers could not achieve a Hartree - Fock stable state , and the rest , as they say , is history .

A Review of Reviews of This Book
( William Alan Rieser )
Clearly , clarity is amorphous , as enthusiasts of this tome should comprehend .
At first , I thought the weightless brevity of under- stimulation rather non-thought provoking , reminiscent of ritual political sidetracking or the suppository demands it inspires .
But , having just examined a comparison of Bush / Blair inanities , I am forced to acquiesce the amazing parallels and their relevance to contemporary lunacy .
Thoughtlessness merely appears to be mindless inefficiency .
It most certainly has not achieved such a lofty status and deserves the explanation afforded by these critics .
To characterize it as inept is premature but neither should I award it anything resembling a provocative kudo .
True , the review of a review is little more than an exercise in stagnation to some , blithe bliss to others and surely a wealth of resources for the American and British literary press , assuming literacy has survived J. K Rowling .
Some might wish to compare it to reviews of Peter Jackson 's LOTR , where all the columnists failed to anticipate the sequel .
Why have n't they accused Jackson of threatening Treebeard by telling him that the entwives were spotted screwing bushes in the south , or worse , shrubberies ?
Such oversights are not seen here , where lack of vision is less an achievement than a requirement .
Surely the dearth of reason ought to establish some sort of guideline for prospective critique drawn unprofessionals .
Then again , we do n't want to be controversial and assign sentience to those who exhibit a void where synapses ought to dwell .
Mayhap the lapses seen here are mere figments of imaginative constipation ?
Perhaps what is needed is a poll to solidify the public 's desire for another circumspect analysis .
And if that is insufficient , surely a probe might be adequate to determine whether reviews satisfy the psychological urge to have one 's words unread , like mating during an earthquake or pushing the progenitors of The Simpson 's into the sea .
In conclusion , I would suggest that ignoring reviews is tantamount to the foolish perpetration of sanity .
Consider how many civilizations have succumbed in the wake of their failing to flaunt their failings and permit them to subside via observation .
I , for one , loathe the thought of society crumbling without having had the crumbs submitted to an exhaustive and penetrating exposition .
Let those who are erstwhile enough to examine such behavior proceed to their illogical culmination .
William Alan Rieser
Forensic Phrenology ( Dr S.A. Murphy PhD )
Edward Gorey on Henry James , " I 've read everything he 's written , and I loath and detest all of it " .
Now that is truly an exemplary review .
The man knew his subject .
Thoroughly exhausted it in fact , and only then formed an opinion , absolute as it is , on his subject .
When given an item to criticize , this is the preferred methodology .
The dilemma we face with our task is that this is , of course , impossible .
As stated , the logical way to approach a serious work of criticism is to know one 's subject thoroughly .
As I am not able to comment on the work of those that follow me , any attempt at criticizing becomes an utter absurdity .
So , how to go about this then ?
Being forced to ignore future work lends itself to several freedoms .
If I am to ignore the work of future critics , I am then free , should I choose , to ignore the work of past critics also .
And so , I will undertake my aspect of this work as a truly independent exposition .
In other words , I may pick and choose , and diddle around .
Interesting though the comments on Groucho Marx were , I noticed some glaring literary omissions .
It is admittedly a little known fact that Groucho was a great fan and reader of Somerset Maugham .
His admiration was so great that he arranged a meeting with Maugham on a visit to England .
This meeting was much anticipated by both parties and Groucho even brought along first editions for Maugham to sign .
When the two finally met at Maugham 's home , Groucho was immediately offended by Maugham 's effeminate manner and that both men wore the same necktie .
When invited by Maugham to have tea , Groucho stormed out of the house snarling , " No thank you , we Americans prefer more manly recreations ! " .
Groucho forever held a grudge against Maugham , and from then on referred to him only as " Mr. Margaret Dumont " .
I am also a bit surprised by the slavish devotion to one J.P. Sartre .
Why some of the reviewers would spend their time arguing about a cat owned by a man who was known to spend his Sundays sashaying about town dressed in nineteenth century garb and a fake walrus moustache , all the while proclaiming himself to be " Zee Grand Flaubert ! " is beyond me .
Simon de Beauvoir had written many times in her journals , " I wish he would just stay home on Sundays " .
An embarrassment if nothing else , Sartre 's obsession with Flaubert was responsible for more conjugal strife than any other matter in his life , even his inability to balance a checkbook .
Simon de Beauvoir wrote at length in several journal entries : Goddamn him , he has torn apart my best feather pillow looking for the perfect moustache substitute ....
As is commonly known , Sartre devoted much of his later years to dissecting Flaubert 's life and his four part major reference work on Flaubert speaks volumes , if nothing else .
So , after a thorough reading of the wilder statements made by previous reviewers , I am near nervous exhaustion wrestling with what I consider to be the ultimate question or perhaps the penultimate if the other question regards drink preferences :
Are we to believe everything that we read ?
The answer is obvious , yet that is no guarantee that we are not informed by mendacities in print .
For instance , if one is to take Lombroso at his word , I am a small , slightly overweight man with a tendency to slip into degeneracy and having an almost triumphant ability to stare fixedly at large breasted women , or men .
That I have never rubbernecked my way into a lad 's heart goes without saying , but what of the rest ?
I am small in stature , this is true , but my girth is reminiscent more of a large herbivore than only slightly overweight .
So , we have caught this one out in the cold , have we not ?
Do I slip into degeneracy ?
I 've been told that on certain late evenings , I make people uncomfortable , but I 've never been charged with a criminal act .
So , shall we call strike two ?
No , let us make that three , as I am hardly alone in straining my ocular apparatus to glean a glimpse of a well powdered and flush bosom .
These musings do nothing if not bring to mind early attempts by Kerouac at stream of consciousness writing .
To quote from his own " Barstool notes at the Tiger Club " :
" Hmmmmm ... going ... going to need to go ...
Barman 's pouring , taps are running and he 's pouring ... oh , pouring and flowing , GOD I'VE GOT TO GO ... he starts the tap and pours and pours and pours .
Christ , you 'd think they'd have more than one john in this joint ... gotta go - gotta go - gotta go .
Whew ... I gotta go ... oooh , when will that guy get out of there ?
I really gotta go ...
I 'm full , totally full and need to pee ... be free ... be free my pee , be free ... wee - wee - wee , I really need to pee ...
Jesus , what the hell is that guy doing in the crapper for this long ?
Oh - whoa - whoa - whoa-oh , Jeeee - zus ...
Jeeee - zus ...
Jeezus - Jeezus - Jeezus - WEEEEEEEZUS
CHRIST !
How friggin ' long does it take to drain a pipe ?
Oooooooooh ... "
FINAL THOUGHTS : I 've noticed no mention of cash flowing into the hands of contributors .
This is a disappointment .

A short note ( Don Stockbauer )
I believe that the amount of information on the web has finally become infinite .
I was rather amazed the Reviews of this Book had actually been pulled - off .
Being a long time Hofstadter fan ( having read GEB when it came out and almost all his other works since ) it 's nice to know that someone accepted the challence and brought it to fruition .
I always thought that it would be hard to do , due to the first review basically having nothing to say , but one should never underestimate the creativeness of a writer , and it was done quite well .

Polytemporal Discourse : A Digression Of Humorous Origin ( Greyston R. Cindertoke )
" Man plans , God laughs . "
-- Rabbi Hillel
The idea that God ( whatever that term might mean to any specific individual ) laughs is at the heart of the suggestion made in a non-fiction book ( referenced extensively elsewhere in this document ) popular among those prone to make references to books of that kind , because finding humor in a situation is to see it 's essential properties .
How funny something is can be said to depend on how artfully a rational construct is exploited and , however enlivened or bereft of humorous expertise any endeavour might seem , the most important thing to keep in mind is the original premiss : whether it was intended to be funny , or not .
As the author of the aforementioned popular book is seen as something of a hip - intellectual pseudo - deific pop-cultural figure , and since the idea that laughter and humor are known to motivate ultimate deity ( ie : " God " ) , the aforementioned author undoubtlably intended his suggestion as a pseudo - hip pop-intellectual joke , for within the fabric of a joke ( ie : exploitation of rational construct ) can be discovered patterns of relationship which underlie the fabric of human consciousness , and it's not important that it does n't neccessarily make people laugh .
Also , the very idea that " God " ( a rhetorical device referring to the First Cause or Prime Mover ; the impetus for existance ) likes to laugh can be quite distrubing to those individuals prone to being tight - asses , undermining the short - sighted arrogence of those who believe that their minds have encompased all that there is to know .
In fact , making fools out of those who foolishly believe there is nothing more to learn is highly characteristic of the sort of humor often attributed to whatever is representated by the term God .
Therefor , writing a pompous critique such about the self - referential quality of this document is exactly the sort of thing that makes
God laugh , which is a good thing because , at the very least , it annoys uptight pricks .
Rabbi Hillel also said , " If I am not for myself , then who will be for me ?
And if I am only for myself , then what am I ?
And if not now , when ? " , which does n't have too much relevance to this discussion , but it 's a pretty cool idea and is vaugely applicable to the idea of procrastination , which is a common affliction of those who are terribly intelligent and insightful , ie : those inclined to write critiques similar to this .
But why bother to write yet another critique as part of a potentially hubric construction intended to reach into the foundation of linguistic coherence ?
Has n't the topic been enumerated to a sufficient level prior to the writting of this critique ?
The answer is " no , there is never a good reason to stop beating a dead horse " .
This is not to imply , of course , that this document is in any way characteristic of a dead horse , but the reader may wish to take precautions regarding the potnetial smell , just in case .
A literary critique is , essentially , a story about a story .
Literary critics are , after all , detailing their personal interpretation of the cogntitive experience induced by reading something someone else has written .
Such a cognitive experience is , of course , a neccessary quality of the act of reading in general [ 1 ] , except in this specific case , literary critics exploit that experience and flog it for money , fame , and the raw sensation of power that comes from knowing that some other mind has become irrevocably warped by exposure to the words contained in the critique .
That is to say that literary critics pre-eat intellectual food and allow the general public to sample the results .
The genius behind the aformentioned Girddle , Esher , Back guy 's idea about a self - referential literary construct is readily apparent , and many people agree with that .
Unfortunately , the greater public tends to ignore the salient fact that this idea was suggested by someone too lazy to do it himself , and - as such - constitutes what is clinically known as a " lazy idea " .
This practically ensures that only very lazy people will be attracted to it .
To whit , the literary critic , the product of which is both the content and context of this literary construct ( ie :>> insert name of this document here < < [ 2 ] ) .
The concept of an entirely recursive document undoubtably holds interest for many people due , in part , to the fact that it resides at the borders of impossibility , just beyond the reach of rational analysis , yet still remains tantalizingly cogent , much like the fundamental nature of existence itself .
Other interesting observations regarding this topic will be made later in this critique [ 13 ] , but for now , on with that critical examination of the document in question which is the primary substance of a literary critique .
Starting out with a few well - placed patronizing platitudes is a typical example of a rhetorical strategy employed to signal to the reader the fact that the extremely brilliant and subtle wit contained in this critique will be cleverly incorporated amongst what will otherwise appear to be particulalry lame commentary .
The author is not suggesting that this document ( which includes this critique ) is the expression of such a crass and manipulative strategy , but pointing it out is the kind of sophistic crap that goes over well with snobs and morons , so it can't hurt to pander to the majority right off the bat .
It is worth again stressing the point that this very critique which the reader is currently reading [ 4 ] is included in the document being critiqued .
The intent of the document , as has been sufficiently expounded upon elsewhere , is to provide a context for polytemporal discourse ; that is , to be the arena within which human language is challenged to produce an adequate representation of concepts and conditions which exist independant of ( or , at least , in conjunction with ) a strict linear temporal progression .
Human languages ( with the exception of a well - known few , which - for the sake of propriety - will not be mentioned other than to point out how extremely innapropriate to this discussion they are , and everyone damned well knows it ) tend to have grammatical rules which favor the expression of ideas in a manner which reflects a cognitive state engaged in linear temporal experience .
The very words themselves - verb , nouns , adjectives , and all that stuff - are constructed to work within a syntax based on the principle of cause and effect .
At least the English language is , and since that 's the only language the author is fluent enough to write a critical discourse in , the grammatical rule of that language is assumed to be universally applicable [ 5 ] .
The endeavor to engage in a polytemporal dialog is , therefore [ 6 ] , a cogent and meaningful act , rather than the trite and diversionary pursuit it might otherwise seem to be .
A valient attempt at kick - starting the anteroliterative process ( which is the substance of this document ) had already been made by that point in the so - called four - dimentional " space - time continuum " occupied by ( ie : the temporal thread being traversed by ) this author as this critique is being written [ 7 ] .
Many of the major salient points defining this project have been eloquently expressed by other authors , not the least of which being the general absurdity of the whole thing .
Also , Sartre was mentioned , giving this document the kind of existentialist credentials that good post - modern deconstructionism needs to make the critics really sit up and take notice [ 8 ] .
Speaking of existentialism , let us examine more closely the applicability of this document to the nature of self - conscious perception itself .
Similar to the way the mind of a human being develops over the course of a lifetime through the accumulation of experience , so this document strives to attain a literal representation of self - reflective awareness by the accumulation of self - referential content .
It would be no exageration to say that this document - which , excavated like a midden at an archeological site , provides the understanding reader with a sense of transendence verging on ( if not completely embracing ) the realm of the mystical - is as important as it ( or anything like it ) can possibly be , for without attempts to exceed the realm of the possibile , how can the limits of possibility ever be known ?
Like a mutant cross between a magic carpet and a talking mirror , this document takes on mythical proportions of its own makings .
It is a tapestry made with threads of time so intricately interwoven that this document will eventually gain self - awareness and takes on a life of its own , destroying the city of Cincinatti , Ohio in a wild rampage brought on by tranquilizers and a generally shitty feeling about life , but that 's not important now .
Sartre 's cat was also mentioned , but there was some uncertainty about the cat 's ownership and a suggestion that it might be Edwin Schroedinger 's [ 10 ] was made , which brings up the topic of historical dialectics .
Consciousness evolves by much the same process as life : though a combination of innate factors and the interaction of those factors with the environments within which those factors are expressed .
History , too , can be interpreted as if it were an individual evolving towards sentience .
Much as the previously mentioned metaphorical dog no longer needs the metaphorical lamp - post to exist in order to metaphorically pee on it , a self - reflective literary construct such as this document strives to pee on itself .
It was Hegel who developed the idea that " history " is the human species conducting a form of dialog with itself through social action over the course of time .
Later on , Marx updated the idea , pointing out that if it's a dialog , that means people can say things .
Meanwhile , Kirkegaard decided that life sucks and , following in Kirkegaard 's shadow like Marx echoed Hegel , Sartre made a career out of saying that yes , there 's no doubt about the fact that life sure does suck , thereby empowering himself with a great excuse to act like a pompous twit and take a lot of speed [ 11 ] , but that was his choice and he 's dead anyway .
The Beatles summed up the feelings of many with the succinct phrase " everybody 's got one " .
As the dialog of human history ( which is nothing a pack of lies hobbled together to tell a story which justifies its own existence , by the way ) is an analogy of the evolution of human consciousness , so this document contains the tattered and fragmented remnants of lofty dreams that turned all too quickly into a heap of shattered ambitions .
Like the flash of a strobelight in the dark , each addition to this document discloses another freeze - frame image of its true form , leaving the reader to assemble that series of flashes into a terrifying clear image of the Frankenstien - like madness that spawned the birth of this document , leading the authors onward with a promise of that same vital thrill that must have consumed the very first satirist to recognize the power of a smart - assed remark .
The fact that some of the original contributors to this document have subsiquently withdrawn their participation due to conflicting interpretation of what constitutes god - like humor , is ... well ... typical , is n't it ?
While it may be possible to formulate a cogent syllogysm by which the self - reflective nature of human consciousness and the socio- historical dialog of the human community are proven to be substrative to this progenative documentary of the anteroliterative effect of recursive exposition in the pursuit of polytemporal discourse , the author was simply looking for an excuse to use the word " syllogysm " without refering to illicit acts involving a window .
[ 1 ] A thoroughly pointless statement .
[ 2 ]
This is a replacement tag that was forgotten by the author until after the document had been submitted for publication and it was too late to fix [ 3 ] .
[ 3 ]
Same goes for the footnote .
[ 4 ]
A footnote wo n't help if you can't sort it out for yourself .
[ 5 ]
Blind arrogence is a hallmark of Western Civilization , and probably other Civilizations as well , come to think of it , given the fact that human beings are notoriously pigheaded .
[ 6 ]
Ok , ok .
No explicit arguement has been made , so there is no logical basis for make this statement of conclusion , but the author needs to speed things up a bit , so will the reader kindly get off the author 's back about it ?
[ 7 ]
Deal with it .
[ 8 ]
The author has resolved not to descend into an embittered diatribe about how fickle , cruel , or deeply ignorant some critics can be and would rather focus on catering to the interests of those remaining critics who know a really talented author when they see one and are n't afraid to take money in exchange for making that fact known .

After many long hours of debate concerning the ontological implications of quantum mechanics , Niels Bohr drove Edwin Schroedinger to tears by being right .

Yup , Rabbi Hillel really hit the nail on the head a coule thousand years ago when he pointed out that God had a really good sense of humor .

The authors of Reviews of This Book set out to explore self - referral by publishing a book consisting solely of reviews of itself .
This may sound self - contradictory , but the books introduction goes to great depths to explain that it may indeed make sense , since the book can evolve through stages of not actually being self - referring , while still at some point obtaining self - consistency , and thus achieving it 's goal .
" Reviews of This Book " is co-written by many authors .
The authors do not seem to share any common ground , and the different reviews clearly shows that the process of obtaining a " Hartree - Fock self - consistent solution " , as one part of it claims is the books goal , may indeed have a better chance of succeding if the book was not literally being written by a thousand monkeys with typewriters .
Some parts of the books contains discussions of whether other parts " misses the point " , goes to far in critizizing which other parts are " too vicious " , etc .
There is no common thread , and most reviews completely misses the point .
Saying : " hopefully the book will be very funny as well as thought provoking . " , is ( just about ) the funniest and most thought - provoking sentence in the book , with very few exceptions .
The introduction to the book states : " ... But just as one should n't count one 's chickens before they are hatched .. " , actually pecks ( in a metaphorical sense ) on the shell of the old problem " was the egg or the chicken first ? " , to which the process of the creation of the book is the answer .
Unfortunatly , this interesting fact is only stated much later in the book , when it really should have been stated both before and after to have things in the proper order .
I suggest that readers actually interested in self - referral and recursion go elsewhere for knowledge on this subject .
Self - referral is thoroughly treated in the branch of mathematics called logic where you would probably do much better to invest your time than in reading this book , any re-view or review of this book is a waste of time .
The book states : " technology has evolved which could make the task of writing Reviews much easier " , which must make any creator ask " OK , which of you m*** ns let the monkeys use internet ? " .
Review of ' Reviews of this Book ' ( Charles Fox )
Reviews of this Book was a concept conceived well before its time .
The idea of a book containing reviews only of itself was detailed in Hofstadter 's 1985 book Metamagical Themas , which specified a converging dynamical system of reviews all referring to one other , gradually being updated to take account of the changes in other reviews , and causing other reviews to update in turn .
Hofstader was concerned with questions of convergence and integrity could such a system ever reach a stable point ?
The idea was born before its medium the internet .
Only now do we have the technology to enable such a rapid review revision process , and Andrew Jenner has brought about the latest attempt at its instantiation .
Jenner 's own review is functional , explaining the core concept of the book and an overview of the rules by which it was generated .
He writes clearly and concisely , but suffers from a lack of reference to the other reviews .
This is clearly because he wrote the first review and has yet to take account of what happened after he wrote .
If his project is to work , he needs to put more work into updating his review .
Echoing Hosftadter 's Godel , Escher , Bach , Richard Herley 's review draws upon themes of quantum mechanics ( Heisenberg is king ) and Zen Buddhism ( Because this book is as yet unwritten , it is perfect ) .
He also will point out the interesting fact that the tense of this book had to be left ambiguous , as each review referred both backwards and forwards in time .
This however presents the following paradox :
Each review can refer only to what is reviews , so should be past tense Each review should refer to the all other reviews , including the ones not written yet .
Perhaps Herley 's problem is resolved in this book by its now constant use of the present tense , allowing all reviews to exist in the same moment of simultaneity ?
Michael Kelly 's review draws the inevitable comparisons of this book to both Oroborus and what dogs do because they can .
( Which I believe is a reference to Jasper Carrot ) .
He also used some great phrases like graduate school goof offs and metastabalise .
His comparison to holography is intriguing as each shard of a hologram contains ( a degraded version of ) the whole image , so should each review of this book .
In this sense , the book is also reminiscent of neural net theory ; whose discussion of so - called optimal brain damage demonstrates how a biologically plausible computational system can store global information in its parts .
And if such a Perus - ian holographic net can be called conscious , then what of this organically evolving book ?
Kelly 's reviews of the other reviews are focussed on a single line of criticism : that of leaving out references to other works , which Kelly fills in .
This of course is a useful way to add new material to this book , by bringing in new lines of thought not yet mentioned in other reviews .
There seems to be a theme of consciousness and the mind emerging in this book .
In fact the idea of multiple drafts in endless circulation of improvement and revision is indeed reminiscent of Dennets model of consciousness in his book Consciouness Explained .
( More cynically known as Consciousness Ignored by non-behaviourist philosophers . )
Further , the process of review convergence is suspiciously analogous to current research in loopy bayesian belief propagation
Is this book really a metaphor for something much bigger than some of the light - hearted reviews suggest ?
An interesting practical problem facing the creation of this book is that as the number of reviews increases to N , each review will have to review all N of them .
Or worse , some reviews may wish to discuss each review reviewed by each review .
Will this book face some kind of exponential meltdown as its complexity increases ?
Thorstein Veblen divided human activity into useful work and pecuniary work ; the latter being work that is essentially useless except as a display of waste of resources .
It is work that accomplishes nothing except to display the wealth of its creator .
Could this book be the ultimate pecuniary activity , one which contains precisely no information except the meta - information that its authors have too much free time on their hands ( and therefore make attractive mates ? ) .
As a publicly funded graduate student ( or goof off , as Kelly would have it ) I feel partly ashamed to be expending resources on such a project ,
It is not our own wealth we are squandering here but that of the taxpayers .
As such , the completion of this book should not be taken as an indication of our greatness , but like the snapshots from the Mars Rover as a symbol of greatness of the whole society which has given rise to the project .
( A further credit assignment problem presents itself when we consider the privately funded reviewers - should their names appear on the cover along with the taxpayer ? )
This book has been criticised as a form of pecuniary intellectual masturbation , and for attempting the supposedly impossible task of creating something from nothing .
But let us not forget the ancient Egyptian myth that our entire world was created by our God swallowing his own semen and giving birth to the whole of creation .
The existence of their belief shows at least that this form of creation is logically possible !
Taken together , the reviews form a deeper message than any one of them could contain .
Like Cage 's 4'33 " this is a book that makes a statement about books .
Cage took rational western art to its logical end - point , the zero point , the end of modernism .
However , this book shows that there exists another extremum , a kind of opposite , infinite point of recursion , of potentially unlimited complexity constructed out of the same nothingness .
A truly postmodern work , we have moved beyond rational construction of art , and embraced the repetition , stealing and sampling of others as an artform in itself .
Art has nowhere new to go , so it collapses in on itself , endlessly digesting its own intestines .
And this book captures that zeitgeist precisely .
However in demonstrating that postmodernism does in fact have a logical end - point , and taking us to it , Fox 's review raises the interesting and possibly unanswerable question of where on earth we are supposed to go next ?

The race is over .
Though it is not officially over , it is mathematically over .
And for all intents and purposes , “ mathematically over ” is as good as “ officially over . ”
After last night ’s primaries in North Carolina and Indiana , Hillary Clinton ’s campaign is done .
Her chances for the nomination just ran from slim to none .
Hillary Clinton herself is not admitting defeat .
Her website sent out a blog piece this morning saying , “ Today , in every way that I know how , I am expressing my personal determination to keep forging forward in this campaign . ”
She has also stated that she is “ staying in this race until we have a nominee . ”
Of course , we already have a Democratic nominee … for all intents and purposes .

As Hillary continues to put on a brave and cheerful face publicly , serious signs from her campaign team that she is considering withdrawal are leaking like water from a loosed fire hydrant .
Earlier today , CBS News reported “ several top advisers are suggesting to Hillary Clinton that she stay in through West Virginia , Kentucky and Oregon and then in two weeks , gracefully bow out . ”
There are also some pretty concrete rumors that somebody from within the Hillary campaign has already had “ the talk ” with her , uttering the words , “ Senator Clinton , you simply cannot win this nomination at this point . ”
Mathematically , the above “ rumored point ” is absolutely true .
An article posted on CBSNews.com written by Vaugh Ververs and Brian Montopoli commented that “ here ’s how it breaks down : Right now , Obama leads Clinton by nearly 700,000 votes , if you do n’t count Michigan and Florida .
Clinton was on the ballot in both states ; Obama was not on the Michigan ballot , though many of his supporters voted “ uncommitted . ”
If you count only the votes cast for the candidates in both states – and thus do n’t count uncommitted for Obama – Obama would still have a national vote lead of more than 73,000 votes .
If you give Michigan ’s uncommitted vote to Obama , he would lead by over 310,000 .
And if only Florida were counted , Obama would lead by more than 400,000 votes .
Under every scenario , Clinton does not claim the popular vote lead . ”
And if all of the above were n’t enough , Arianna Huffington of The Huffington Post , a political insider herself , revealed this morning that , “ a senior campaign official and Clinton confidante has told me that there will be a Democratic nominee by June 15 .
He could not bring himself to say the words ‘ Hillary will drop out by June 15 , ’ but that is clearly what he meant .
Everything about our conversation implied that he had already had this reality - based discussion with Hillary . ”
And so it is .
It does appear that the Democrats have gotten themselves a nominee .
And Hillary Clinton is not it .
Earth has been through many mass extinctions , and the causes of most remain mysterious .
A new study suggests the ebbs and flows of ocean levels and sediment could be to blame .
" The expansions and contractions of those environments have pretty profound effects on life on Earth , " says Shanan Peters , a University of Wisconsin - Madison assistant professor of geology and geophysics .
Peters argues that changes in ocean environments related to sea level exert a driving influence on rates of extinction , which animals and plants survive or vanish , and generally determine the composition of life in the oceans .
Few smoking guns
Since life sprang forth on Earth about 3.5 billion years ago , scientists think there may have been as many as 23 mass extinction events .
During the past 540 million years , there have been five well - documented mass extinctions , primarily of marine plants and animals , with as many as 75 - 95 percent of species lost .
The dinosaur extinction 65 million years ago has a smoking gun : an impact crater that suggests a space rock was at least partly responsible for the die - off .
But the causes of other mass extinction events have been murky , at best .
" Paleontologists have been chipping away at the causes of mass extinctions for almost 60 years , " said Peters , whose work was supported by the National Science Foundation .
" Impacts , for the most part , are n't associated with most extinctions .
There have also been studies of volcanism , and some eruptions correspond to extinction , but many do not . "
Peters measured two main types of marine shelf environments preserved in the rock record , one where sediments are derived from erosion of land and the other composed primarily of calcium carbonate , which is produced in - place by shelled organisms and by chemical processes .
" The physical differences between ( these two types ) of marine environments have important biological consequences , " Peters explained in a statement , noting differences in sediment stability , temperature , and the availability of nutrients and sunlight .
In the course of hundreds of millions of years , the world 's oceans have expanded and contracted in response to the shifting of the Earth 's tectonic plates and to changes in climate .
There were periods of the planet 's history when vast areas of the continents were flooded by shallow seas , such as the shark - and mosasaur - infested seaway that neatly split North America during the age of the dinosaurs .
As those huge ontinental seas drained , animals such as mosasaurs and giant sharks went extinct , and conditions on the marine shelves where life exhibited its greatest diversity in the form of things like clams and snails changed as well .
The idea was put forth by the journal Nature yesterday .
No one cause
Arnold I. Miller , a paleobiologist and professor of geology at the University of Cincinnati , says the new study is striking because it establishes a clear relationship between the tempo of mass extinction events and changes in sea level and sediment :
" Over the years , researchers have become fairly dismissive of the idea that marine mass extinctions like the great extinction of the Late Permian might be linked to sea - level declines , even though these declines are known to have occurred many times throughout the history of life .
The clear relationship this study documents will motivate many to rethink their previous views . "
The new study does not preclude other influences on extinction such as physical events like volcanic eruptions or killer asteroids , or biological influences such as disease and competition among species , Peters said .
But what it does do , he argues , is provide a common link to mass extinction events over a significant stretch of Earth history .
" The major mass extinctions tend to be treated in isolation ( by scientists ) , " Peters says .
" This work links them and smaller events in terms of a forcing mechanism , and it also tells us something about who survives and who does n't across these boundaries .
These results argue for a substantial fraction of change in extinction rates being controlled by just one environmental parameter . "
My Assembly Programming Language teacher , Belal Hashmi Sahib said in the first lecture of the course , “ Assembly is extremely simple .
It is so simple that students do n’t expect such simplicity and hence it starts appearing complex to them ” .
Then he wrote MOV AX , BX on the board , explained it and asked if everyone understood it .
Everybody nodded .
He asked again to make sure there was not even a slightest bit of confusion .
It seemed very simple and trivial to everyone .
He proceeded by saying “ This is the end of the assembly language programming course .
The rest of the course is just the revision of MOV AX , BX ” .
Everybody thought it was a joke but later it turned out that assembly indeed ended at MOV AX , BX .
The rest of the course was about learning other concepts to fully utilize the potential of MOV AX , BX .
Last year I learned Lisp on my own and then TAed a course on Lisp at LUMS with Dr. Umar Saif .
In the first lecture the first thing Dr. Umar taught was ( lambda ( x ) (+ x x ) ) .
At this moment I realized that just like Assembly , Lisp had finished !
Because if students had understood it , there was nothing much about the language left .
All they needed now was to understand some important concepts such as recursion , closures etc. to use Lisp .
What is common between Assembly and Lisp ?
Both of these two languages are very simple to learn as they have little syntax or fancy language features .
However the process of learning them compels one to grasp some important concepts .
For instance by learning assembly you are bound to understand some flavor of computer architecture , interrupts , timers and other hardware related stuff .
Similarly by learning Lisp you automatically get to know functional programming , interpretation , recursion , closures etc .
There ’s been predictably little interesting discussion in the United States of Fidel Castro ’s retirement as Cuba ’s commandante en jefe , maximo etc .
That ’s because in the U.S. political mainstream , Cuba policy has for a generation been grotesquely disfigured by a collective kow - towing — yes , collective , it was that craven Mr. Clinton who signed into law the Draconian Helms - Burton act that made it infinitely more difficult for any U.S. president to actually lift the embargo , and the equally craven Mrs. Clinton appears to pandering to the same crowd — to the Cuban - American Ahmed Chalabi figures of Miami , still fantasizing about a day when they ’ll regain their plantations and poor people of color will once again know their place .
But let ’s not for a moment forget the mirror - image of that view so common on the left , where Castro ’s patent fear of his own people and reluctance to trust them to debate ideas and options ( much less hold competitive elections that , in all probability , he ’d have easily won ) is strenuously rationalized on the basis of the CIA ’s repeated efforts to kill him .
( Sure , they repeatedly tried to kill Castro , and Washington might like to manipulate Cuba ’s politics given half a chance , but those are not sound reasons to imprison economists or avoid discussing policy options even within the Communist Party . )
What fascinates me , however , is the guilty pleasure with which so many millions of people around the world revere Fidel Castro — revere him , but would n’t dream of emulating his approach to economics or governance .
People , in other words , who would not be comfortable actually living in Castro ’s Cuba , much as they like the idea of him sticking it the arrogant yanqui , his physical and political survival a sure sign that Washington ’s awesome power has limits — and can therefore be challenged .
Nelson Mandela is a perfect example of the guilty pleasure phenomenon : A dyed - in - the - wool democrat with an exaggerated fondness for British institutions , Mandela is nonetheless a warm friend and admirer of the Cuban leader .
The same would be true for almost all of the current generation of ANC leaders in South Africa , not only those who jump and prance while singing about machine guns , but also those with impeccable credentials in Washington and on Wall Street .
When the guests were being welcomed at Nelson Mandela ’s presidential inauguration in 1994 , the announcement of Hillary Clinton ’s presence , representing her husband ’s administration , elicited polite applause .
When Fidel Castro was announced , the assembled political class of the new order went into raptures of ecstasy .
Sure , Fidel had earned their loyalty not only by being a firm supporter of the ANC when Washington was n’t interested , but more importantly , by sending his own men to fight and die on African soil to defend Angolan independence from the machinations of the U.S. and the apartheid regime , and their Angolan proxies .
But equally important was what Fidel represented to the global south — not a model of governance and economic management ( after all , the very ANC leaders who cheered him to the heavens were embarked upon a diametrically different political and economic path to Castro ’s — whose revolution , by the way , looked as if it was on its last legs in 1994 , having lost the massive Soviet subsidy that had enabled a quality of life for poor people unrivaled in the developing world ) .
No , what Fidel represented to South Africa ’s new leaders was a symbol of independence , of casting off colonial and neo-colonial overlords and defending your sovereignty , against Quixotic odds , from an arrogant power .
Take a survey among today ’s Latin American leaders on Fidel Castro , and he ’ll get a huge popularity rating .
For the likes of Venezuela ’s Hugo Chavez and Nicaragua ’s Daniel Ortega , he has , rather unfortunately , been a role model in every sense ; for the more sober and pragmatic social democrats of the Lula - Bachelet - Kirschner variety , Fidel nonetheless represents an inspiration that opened the way for their generation to cut their own path and stand up to the U.S. - backed dictators that imprisoned and tortured their ilk .
In Latin America , Castro personifies nothing as much as defiance of the Monroe Doctrine , by which the U.S. had defined the continent as its backyard , reserving the right to veto , by force , anything it did n’t like .
Get a Mexican conservative politician drunk in a discreet setting , and you ’ll probably discover a closet Castro fan .
Castro appeals not only to socialists , but to nationalists everywhere .
And , of course , the Cuban leader himself was a radical nationalist , rather than a communist , when he seized power in 1959 , and the U.S. response to his moves to nationalize the sugar industry were part of what drove him to make common cause with the Soviets .
At the same time , of course , it is not simply nationalism , but his revolution ’s social achievements , that account for his popularity at home .
Back in 2000 , when the Miami Chalabis were desperately trying to prevent the traumatized Elian Gonzales from being reunited with his father , they insisted that any Cuban given the choice would flee to the United States , and that Elian ’s father was being coerced .
Nonsense , said the CIA — actually , more than 90 % of the population would rather stay on the island .
And the regime could count on the support of the majority of them should it come under external attack .
( It was also a relatively safe bet that were multiparty elections to be held , Castro ’s party would have won . )
And it ’s not hard to see why .
Visiting Cuba in 1994 , I had been all geared up to write the sort of cynical ex-leftie P.J. O’Rourke - style political epitaph , but what I discovered — even at the height of the Special Period , when the sudden disappearance of the Soviet subsidy that had given Havana more than $ 800 a year for every Cuban had left them literally starving — was something far more nuanced and challenging .
Typical of the experience was a young curator at an art museum , who I shall call simply Antonio .
The twentysomething Afro-Cuban had a master ’s degree in art history , and loved his work with a passion .
But the rest of his life was hell :
His breakfast consisted of a couple of glasses of water sweetened with sugar .
That was all .
He worked all day without lunch .
And then , at night , in his darkened apartment ( Havana was constantly in darkness due to power cuts ) , he ’d consume his meal of the day — a plate of rice and beans .
And then sleep , for there was nothing else to do .
That Antonio was frustrated and deepy depressed was beyond question .
Did he want things to change in Cuba ?
Very much so , he wanted more openness , more discussion of ways out of the destitution that seemed to be staring Cuba in the face .
But despite his despair , he remained intensely loyal to Castro and his revolution .
Why ?
Antonio ’s parents had been cane - cutters on a plantation before the revolution .
Not only his grandparents , but his parents .
Descendants of African slaves , they were n’t that much better off .
But here , 55 years later , Antonio ’s brother was an electrical engineer with a master ’s degree and a good job , and his sister was a science lecturer at a university in Havana .
Antonio ’s parents were cane - cutters ; their children were university educated intellectuals .
And they had n’t won a lottery — their social mobility had been enabled by Cuba ’s social system , the education and health and other programs designed to lift up the impoverished majority had transformed their life possibilities within a generation .
Antonio understood all too well what his life would have been had the revolution not triumphed in 1959 .
And he was sticking by it , no matter how bad things got .
With a few exceptions , most of the people I encountered represented a similar ambiguity .
Many people were angry and frustrated by Castro ’s stubborness — the former seminarian man had an almost theological attachment to a bankrupt economic model .
But they were n’t about to turn their backs on the whole social system he ’d created .
And then there was the race question , which was never formally acknowledged either in pre-revolutionary Cuba , or in the color - blind communism of the Castro era .
Close to two thirds of Cubans are people of color — African and mulatto .
The old regime protected the interests of an almost exclusively white elite , and it was that same elite that ran the Chalabi operation in Miami .
Castro ’s own government , of course , was also overwhelmingly white , but its social policies and official ideology championed the interests ( and also the story ) of the majority .
The problem , of course , was the extent to which Fidel Castro had made his own personality indistinguishable and inseparable from the social system he ’d created — a classic cult of the personality regime , built in no small part on the highly militarized approach to political organization that has been the legacy of Leninism .
He hints at the problem in his statement announcing his decision to stand down : “ Preparing the people for my psychological and political absence was my primary obligation after so many years of struggle . ”
His “ psychological absence ” is , of course , a recognition of the fact that many of his most loyal supporters and party cadres will feel , quite literally , orphaned by his departure from the scene .
And it is this problem that he appears to be seeking to address , albeit very late in the game , by phasing his withdrawal from politics rather than dying in power and setting off a national trauma of the type that followed Stalin ’s death .
I ca n’t help but recall Yevgeny Yevtushenko ’s horrific account of being in the crowd at his funeral : “ Tens of thousands of people jammed against one another … in a white cloud …at that moment I felt I was treading on something soft .
It was a human body .
I picked my feet up under me and was carried along by the crowd .
For a long time I was afraid to put my feet down again .
I was saved by my height .
Short people were smothered alive , falling and perishing . ”
More than 150 mourners were trampled to death , in an event that Yevtushenko saw as emblematic of a political culture that had stripped its citizens of all agency and subjectivity .
Belatedly , perhaps , Castro appears to be seeking to avoid the same .
I suspect he has a lot of catching up to do .
Back in 1994 , a visitor came to the house where I was staying in Havana to make sure I was given the “ correct ” perspective — he was a little concerned that my host , his son - in - law , was an enfant terrible , with insufficient reverence for Fidel and an inclination to entertain problematic ideas .
The old man , let ’s call him Edgardo , was a marvelous interlocutor , who entertained me with hilarious and hair - raising stories from the 50s and 60s .
I enjoyed the opportunity to ask a party cadre just what Cuba was going to do to dig itself out of the hole into which it appeared to have fallen .
“ You mark my words , ” Edgardo said indignantly .
“ They can talk all they want about Fidel , but one day the imperialists will be forced to have a drink with him . ”
( For Edgardo , it was all about respect and acknowledgment . )
Fair enough .
But what was Cuba going to do to keep its economy going in the mean time ?
“ You mark my words , they will sit down with Fidel … ” Okay .
But what are you guys thinking about how to proceed now that the Soviet subsidy has gone .
Will you follow the Chinese route ?
“ We will never buckle before the imperialists .
Fidel will find a way … ”
And so it went on .
Clearly , despite the economic crisis , the party cadres had not been engaged in any discussion over how Cuba was going to respond .
It was all about Fidel , an omnipotent , ominscient Fidel , who would find a way .
My suspicion of the paucity of discussion even within the Party were confirmed a few days later when a man came to the door selling homemade wine .
Everybody in Cuba in 1994 was selling something , hoping to raise a little cash to buy food on the black market .
And like everybody in Cuba , he was all too keen to talk , and share his story .
He ’d been a nuclear engineer , working at the now - mothballed atomic energy plant at Cienfuegos .
He ’d been studying in the Soviet Union in the late 1980s at the height of Mikhail Gorbachev ’s glasnost and perestroika initiatives , and had returned home to Cuba fired up to begin discussing how the Soviet reform and democratization process applied to Cuba .
He had been an active party member , and simply assumed that his comrades back home would in the same state of ideological ferment that he ’s witnessed in the Soviet Union .
No such luck .
That reform stuff , he was told , was for the frozen - over socialism of Moscow ; “ Here we do n’t need this because we have sunshine socialism . ”
There was simply no discussion .
The man from Cienfuegos had been bitterly disappointed .
The problem in the Cuban party , he said , was that no serious debate or discussion was tolerated .
Debate was seen as threatening .
It offered an opportunity to “ the enemy ” to create divisions and undermine the revolution .
Best leave the decision making to the leadership — to Fidel , more precisely .
He ’ll know what to do …
The nuclear engineer from Cienfuegos seemed , to me , to personify the tragedy of Castro ’s legacy .
However much the aging revolutionary has done for his people , he refused ever to trust them — to openly debate political questions , and to choose wisely in a genuinely competitive political system .
Instead , it was Father knows best , on an epic scale .
Whether he manages to belatedly repair the damage remains an open question .
Our CRN Test Center conducted a faceoff - type of performance evaluation .
Testing was done on two identical desktops : HP 's rp5700 model with a single 160 GB SATA drive on each machine , 1.8 GHz dual - core Intel processors and 1 GB RAM on both .
There were no extraneous applications installed on the two computers , just the software needed to perform benchmark testing and OpenOffice.org 's productivity suite .
Screensavers and desktop image backgrounds were disabled as well .
The XP desktop was installed with beta- release service pack 3 RC2 and the Vista desktop with Vista Ultimate service pack 1 plus all current Vista updates .
One of the first tasks tested was a simple restart .
XP SP3 took 35 seconds to restart .
Vista SP1 took 58 seconds .
Just to reiterate , this was a test done without any other programs loading like anti-virus or network policies , so " real - world " times may be slower .
A simple file copy operation was performed next .
A 1.25 GB file was copied from a network share to each desktop .
This proved to be one area where Vista did show some strength : the copy time for XP was 2 minutes and 54 seconds ; for Vista SP1 : 2 minutes and 29 seconds .
After that , it went downhill for Vista .
The next test performed utilized Primate Labs ' Geekbench .
Geekbench tests the performance of the processor and the memory .
Keep in mind , with Geekbench , the higher the number , the better the performance .
Benchmarks were run five times for each OS and the results were subsequently averaged .
XP SP3 results were 2052.6 , Vista SP1's were 1994.0 .
Vista testing was re-run with the Aero desktop disabled , as previous testing showed that the enabling of Aero contributed to overhead .
Vista SP1 results fared a bit better with Aero disabled than with Aero enabled , the results were 2018.2 .
But that was still lower performance than XP .
CPU Utilization in XP SP3 , when browsing using IE7 hit a maximum 56 percent .
Opening a spreadsheet and a few word processing files had the CPU hovering at around 22 percent .
Browsing the same pages in Vista SP1 and opening the same files , had the CPU hit a max at 60 percent , not a substantial increase from XP 's max .
the paging file for both PCs was set to the same level 1524 - 3043 max .
This is where a significant difference was seen .
In XP , the page file usage hovered at 260 - 270 MB , whether browsing or opening files .
In Vista , the page file usage averaged 555 MB , half the physical memory .
This lends credibility to assertions that Vista still requires more physical memory than XP to run optimally .
The bottom line : XP still rules , performance wise , over Vista .
Vista is certainly outfitted for enhanced security , but with new features in XP SP3 like Network Access protection , XP SP3 does not seem like a slouch in the security department either .
Microsoft is pushing Vista , hard , over XP .
But it 's increasingly clear that it will have to address the performance drop that takes place in the migration from XP to Vista .
The scenario is reminiscent of XPs phasing out the then popular Windows 2000 desktop .
Microsoft managed to shore up XP and make it the reliable product it is today .
Hopefully , that is what the future holds for Vista as well .
Stay tuned .
Luxury Spring Water Only $ 100 a Bottle
Just the other day I found myself pushing three one - dollar bills into a vending machine , frustrated that it cost the same for water as it does for a bottle of coke .
Not that three bucks is the most expensive water i have seen .
I remember reading about Bling H2O , which was the most expensive bottle of water I had ever seen until today .
“ Fillico Beverly Hills “ , a premium line of spring water from a company name Vieluce in Osaka , Japan , comes from a natural spring at the foot of Mount Rokko in Kobe , Japan .
The spring is very famous for producing excellent water for Sake production .
Due to the limited supply of spring water , only 5,000 bottles are sold each month and they can be purchased for around $ 100 per 750 ml bottle .
Of course if paying $ 100 for a bottle of water is not enough , “ King and Queen ” pairs of the spring water with caps resembling the crown of Fredrick II of the Roman Empire and decorated with Swarovski rhinestones are also being sold for around $ 230 .

Drug dealers looking for extra profits apparently added lead flakes to packets of marijuana , inflating their value while causing dozens of cases of serious poisoning , doctors in Germany reported today .
The lead made up , on average , 10 per cent of the material in the marijuana packets , boosting profits by about $ US1,500 ( $ A1,613 ) per kilogram , Franzika Busse of University Hospital Leipzig reported .
" One package contained obvious lead particles ; this strongly indicated that the lead was deliberately added to the package rather than inadvertently incorporated into the marijuana plants from contaminated soil , " the researchers wrote in a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine .

" In our ' friends like these ' department , the unsolicited endorsements keep piling up for Obama , " she said .
" First , it was Hugo Chavez , and then it was the modern day band of merry men Hamas .
And let 's not forget the Jack Lalanne of totalitarianism , Fidel Castro .
Now it 's , drum roll , please , the one and only contestant in North Korean Idol , Kim Jong Il , ladies and gentlemen . "

The York University student council has voted in favour of a motion to ban funding to anti-abortion groups on campus .
The controversial decision means that groups promoting anti-abortion ideas will not be reimbursed by the student union but will still be allowed to operate on campus , said Gilary Massa , vice - president external of the York Federation of Students .
“ This policy does not apply to religious organizations , ” said Massa .
“ It only applies to groups whose sole purpose is to spew anti-choice rhetoric on our campus . ”
Eight members of the York University student council voted unanimously for the decision on Sunday afternoon .
Washington ordered destruction of Guantánamo interrogation records
By Bill Van Auken
10 June 2008
In another confirmation of the criminal character of Washington ’s handling of so - called “ enemy combatants , ” a “ Standard Operating Procedure ” manual has come to light that explicitly instructs US interrogators at the American prison camp in Guantánamo Bay , Cuba to destroy contemporaneous records of their interrogations .
The existence of the document was made public by the military defense attorney for Omar Khadr , a Canadian national who has been held for six years since being captured by American forces as a 15 - year - old minor in Afghanistan .
The lawyer , Lt. Cmdr. Bill Kuebler , filed an affidavit on the manual , reporting that it had been shown to him only last week .
The document , issued for “ intelligence exploitation teams , ” also known as “ tiger teams ” operating inside the Guantánamo camp , explicitly orders destruction of evidence to avoid potential exposure of government criminality .
“ This mission has legal and political issues that may lead to interrogators being called to testify , ” states the manual , cited in an affidavit filed by Kuebler .
It continues , “ Keeping the number of documents with interrogation information to a minimum can minimize certain legal issues . ”
Citing the document , the military attorney has asked for the charges against Khadr to be dismissed , on the grounds that his supposed confession , which comprises the core of the prosecution case , cannot be challenged as to its accuracy based on existing records .
The patent purpose of the order was to assure the destruction of evidence implicating the US government in the systematic torture of those it has detained in the so - called “ global war on terrorism . ”
Khadr is being tried as a war criminal for acts he is alleged to have committed at the age of 15 .
These acts stem from the siege mounted by US troops of a house in which Khadr was staying in an Afghan village .
The youth was captured after the house was demolished by 500 - pound bombs , grenades and gunfire .
He is accused of murder in connection with one US soldier killed by a grenade in the siege , though evidence — including the fact that the youth was shot in the back — suggests that he was not responsible .
The United Nations and numerous human rights groups have condemned the US for the prolonged imprisonment of Khadr and the attempt to try him as an adult on charges that could put him in prison for life .
“ The government ’s case against Omar is based almost entirely on statements interrogators extracted from him in the course of interrogations at Bagram [ Afghanistan ] and Guantánamo Bay , ” Lieutenant Commander Kuebler told the Canadian daily Globe and Mail .
“ If handwritten notes were destroyed in accordance with the [ Standard Operating Procedure manual ] , the government intentionally deprived Omar ’s lawyers of key evidence with which to challenge the reliability of his statements . ”
The Canadian youth was subjected to torture , beatings and abuse at both the Bagram and Guantánamo prisons .
He was also denied adequate medical treatment for wounds suffered in the US assault , which have left him nearly blind in one eye and with severely impaired vision in the other .
The military defense attorney also indicated that he would seek to file his affidavit for a dismissal of the charges with the US Supreme Court .
Earlier attempts to appeal to the high court have been rejected by the military authorities .
The Supreme Court is expected to rule sometime this month on whether those held at Guantánamo have a right to challenge their detention .
The exposure of the manual ordering the destruction of evidence follows the Pentagon ’s removal of the military judge charged with hearing Khadr ’s case .
The judge , Colonel Peter Brownback , was replaced last month after he ordered military prosecutors to turn over numerous documents they had been withholding to the defense .
Included among them were records detailing Khadr ’s treatment while at Guantánamo .
Meanwhile , the Washington Post reported Sunday that the military defense attorney for another Guantánamo detainee — who was also arrested as a minor and charged as a war criminal — has asked that all charges against his client be dismissed based on the release of documents demonstrating that his client had been subjected to abusive treatment tantamount to torture .
The detainee , Mohammed Jawad , is accused of throwing a grenade at US military convoy in Afghanistan in December 2002 , when he was 16 or 17 years old .
He faces a possible death penalty based on this alleged act , which he denies committing .
Based on daily prison logs , Jawad ’s defense lawyer , Air Force Major David Frakt , has established that the youth was subjected to what military interrogators dubbed the “ frequent flier program , ” in which he was moved back and forth between two cells 112 times in just 14 days .
These cell extractions , conducted every 2 hours and 55 minutes , were aimed at “ breaking ” the detainees through sleep deprivation .
There has been no attempt to claim that Jawad held any intelligence value for the US military , and the tactic appeared to have been employed largely as part of the sadistic “ standard operating procedure ” utilized against all of the Guantánamo inmates .
In Jawad ’s case , the disorienting and abusive treatment was organized in 2004 , just a few months after the youth had attempted suicide .
“ I think it reflects the abandonment of basic American values of human decency that occurred on a widespread basis in detention operations in the first two to three years of the global war on terror , ” Major Frakt said of his client ’s torture .
“ What started as an effort focused on a few detainees believed to possess critical intelligence filtered down to ordinary detainees and became routine . ”
The use of this procedure against Jawad also occurred two months after it was supposedly banned at Guantánamo in March 2004 , after FBI interrogators filed reports expressing concern about it and other forms of torture being carried out at the offshore US detention facility .
A subsequent military investigation claimed , falsely , that it had been carried out solely against so - called high - value detainees and discontinued .
No mention was made in the report of Jawad ’s treatment .
The military ’s chief prosecutor at Guantánamo , Colonel Lawrence Morris , while acknowledging that Jawad had been subjected to the protracted sleep deprivation technique , insisted that just “ because the government may have stumbled some in how he was treated , ” this constituted no grounds for dropping the charges .
The 2006 Military Commissions
Act , under which the detainees are to be tried , treats confessions extracted through torture as well as hearsay and secret evidence as admissible .
It explicitly denies all those declared by the president to be “ illegal enemy combatants ” — US citizens and non-citizens alike — any rights under the US Constitution or the Geneva Conventions .
The new revelations of torture and cover -up in the cases of these two individuals — the first in history to be charged as war criminals for acts committed when they were minors — has served to further discredit the entire military commissions system , which is now being revved up to conduct a politically motivated show trial of individuals charged in connection with the September 11 , 2001 attacks on New York City and Washington .
Air Force Brigadier General Thomas Hartmann , the legal advisor to the civilian appointees overseeing the trials , told the media over the weekend that the Pentagon has made the trials “ the No. 1 obligation ” for its legal services division and is dispatching another 108 uniformed lawyers to participate in the sham proceedings .
Hartmann has been charged by other participants in the process with politically interfering in the organization of the drumhead trials .
Air Force Col. Morris Davis , who formerly served as the chief military prosecutor at Guantánamo , has given sworn testimony that Hartmann had instructed him to speed up trials of “ sexy ... high profile cases , ” cases “ with blood on them ” in order to generate popular support for the military commissions .
Davis has likewise accused the second highest civilian official at the Pentagon , Deputy Defense Secretary Gordon England , of demanding that he rush the prosecution of the 9/11 defendants , including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , “ because there could be strategic value before the [ November ] election . ”
This process is moving full steam ahead .
Five individuals allegedly involved in the planning of the September 11 attacks were brought before a military commission in Guantánamo for the first time last Thursday in preparation for a trial that is set to begin a week and a half after Republican presidential candidate John McCain is formally nominated and to run through the height of the election campaign .
In this initial arraignment , the defendants rejected their defense teams — uniformed lawyers presented to them on the eve of the trial after they had spent at least five years in isolation and undergoing torture .
While observers were allowed into the courtroom , they were seated behind soundproof glass and provided a time - delayed audio transmission of the proceedings , in which prisoners ’ statements referring to their torture at the hands of interrogators , drugs that had been administered to them and the circumstances of their arrests were all deleted .
One of the defendants , Ammar al - Baluchi , mocked the military judge when he explained the “ rights ” of the accused .
Speaking in fluent English , he declared , “ Everything that has happened here is unfair and unjust . ”
“ Since the first time I was arrested , I might have appreciated that , ” he said in response to the judge ’s assurance that he would be provided free legal counsel .
“ The government is talking about lawyers free of charge , ” he continued .
“ The government also tortured me free of charge all these years . ”
The mounting revelations about the criminality dominating the imprisonment of detainees at Guantánamo , Bagram , Abu Ghraib and secret CIA prisons around the world have thoroughly discredited these sham legal proceedings before they can even begin .
More than ample evidence has been uncovered in the course of these exposures to place Bush , Cheney , Rice and other top officials in the Bush administration on trial for their own war crimes .
Using Causality to Solve the Puzzle of Quantum Spacetime
A new approach to the decades - old problem of quantum gravity goes back to basics and shows how the building blocks of space and time pull themselves together
On the same day the Dallas Cowboys announced that wide receiver Terrell Owens had agreed to a contract extension with $ 13 million in guaranteed money , Owens was in New York meeting with NFL officials after being placed in the league 's " reasonable cause " testing program for performance - enhancing drugs , sources told ESPN .
Owens was placed in the program because he missed day - of telephone calls to set up random tests , the sources said .
A player who misses a test can be subject to disciplinary action , but because Owens had a " plausible " explanation , league administrators decided he would not be suspended or fined .
Owens acknowledged Monday having missed the test several weeks ago , blaming it on a " communication problem involving cell phone numbers . "
In an interview with The Associated Press , Owens said : " I 'm not really worried about anything .
It 's not a big deal .
Anything I do is going to grab headlines .
I have nothing to hide .
I 've made a statement and that 's it .
It 's basically a dead issue . "
Earlier he issued a statement that read :
" It was openly discussed and cleared up in a meeting that I had at the NFL office last week .
I have been in the NFL for over 12 years and have never had a positive test for substance of any kind .
That includes tests that took place as recently as last month .
The matter was resolved to everyone 's satisfaction last Tuesday , and everyone has moved on . "
Owens can now be randomly tested for performance enhancers up to a maximum of 24 annual screenings , and these additional screenings can be required , if the NFL chooses to do so , for the remainder of his NFL career .
One of the first changes to my diet will be to add sweet potatoes to the weekly menu .
Also , as I develop my repertoire , friends and relatives will be getting sweet potatoes as gifts !
Have you been naughty or nice ?
Naughty , you get a bag of tubers .
Healthy , but probably not on your list to Santa .
If you have been nice you may get a box of handmade camotes , maybe even flavored with Poblano pepper .
Sweet potatoes were an important part of the diet in the United States for most of its history , especially in the Southeast .
From the middle of the 20th century , however , they have become less popular .
The average per capita consumption of sweet potatoes in the United States is only about 1.5 - 2 kg ( 4 lbs ) per year , down from 13 kg ( 31 lb ) in 1920 .
Southerner Kent Wrench writes : " The Sweet Potato became associated with hard times in the minds of our ancestors and when they became affluent enough to change their menu , the potato was served less often . "
Sweet potato varieties with dark orange flesh have more beta carotene than those with light colored flesh and their increased cultivation is being encouraged in Africa where Vitamin A deficiency is a serious health problem .
HarvestPlus , the International Potato Center , and African partners have successfully introduced " biofortified " sweet potatoes packed with vitamin A , giving children hope for a healthy future .
This food is low in Sodium , and very low in Saturated Fat and Cholesterol .
It is also a good source of Dietary Fiber , Vitamin B6 and Manganese , and a very good source of Vitamin A and Vitamin C .
" Dulces " or sweets , are very popular in Mexico .
The camote is a candy made of sweet potato and fruit flavoring .
It is the signature goodie in Puebla .
The candy shops on Candy Street , the nickname given to Avenue 6 Oriente in old town Puebla , must be seen to be believed .
Bees , attracted to the sugar , buzz the windows , the candy counters and probably leave with you and your purchases ; all part of the shopping experience !
Though some Mexican Mercado have stalls specializing in sweets , more typically confections in the market area are sold from sidewalk vendors .
Maybe a little table will be set up at a street corner , or perhaps a boy will be circulating with a tray of goodies strapped around his neck .
Sweet potatoes :
Use them in soups , casseroles , puddings , baked goods , or as a substitute for white potatoes in your favorite recipes .
They make a nice addition to stir - fries ; cut them into thin sticks so that they will cook quickly .
Also , get on my " list " and you may receive some very unique " dulces " .
You may enjoy reading : The " Vice President of Cake " politely declined .
Also , may I recommend for your enjoyment :
The Food Bank recently got a letter from a key vendor .
I am by no means ready to die !

With an electric motor at each wheel , the UK - built Lightning GT , unveiled yesterday at the British Motor Show , is said to produce a total of 700 HP .
According to the company , the Lightning 's nanotechnology battery pack will provide a 200 - mile range on a ten - minute charge .
Those are mighty big numbers to be throwing around , but with precious little known about the batteries , it makes it hard for us to validate the claims without independent testing .
What we do know after the jump .

The Lightning GT 's nano - titanate batteries are supplied by a U.S. company called Altairnano , who claims the NanoSafe cells have a 12 + year life expectancy and retain 85 % of their charge capacity after 15,000 cycles .
They 're also free from heavy metals , toxins and graphite , and are more thermally stable than other high - tech batteries .
They may also grant you three wishes .

Jalopnik Snap Judgment :
If everything the company claims is true , the Lightning should be one hell of a ride — even at the roughly $ 300,000 asking price .
Much of that price likely offsets the battery costs .
But , as demonstrated over about seven decades now , the British cottage car industry is n't exactly a model of reliability , so we 'll be surprised if an all - electric British sports car produces anything more than smoke and irate customers — we can barely keep our gasoline - powered Triumphs running .
Things should become clearer as 2010 approaches , the year the Lightning GT is expected to be available .

This is the Image Fulgurator , half guerrilla - art stunt and half homemade - gadget awesomeness .
Berlin based artist Julius von Bismarck uses his oddly named camera - mod to project images onto street furniture where they appear in the photos of strangers , but remain invisible to their eyes .
How ?
It ’s simple .
The device has a slave unit on top which is triggered when it sees a flash fire .
This triggers his own flash , which fires through the back of the camera , through a film slide containing his slogan and then on and out through the lens at the front .
This works because a camera is pretty much a projector in reverse .
And because the light - graffiti is fired at the exact same moment the unsuspecting victim takes a picture , it ends up in their photograph and paranoid mind ramblings result .
Neat .
Here ’s a video of von Bismarck in action at fake Berlin tourist hot spot , Checkpoint Charlie ( no relation ) :
Bismarck is n’t the first to use a camera that looks like a gun .
The kind of thing that would see statesiders lobbed in Guantanamo has a history in Europe .
Take the Enjalbert Photo Revolver de Poche , for instance , a French gun-cam from 1883 which recently sold for around $ 90,000 .
Inside the barrel is the lens , and inside the magazine are 10 16 × 16 photographic plates .
It seems gimmicky , and at the time the image quality from those tiny negatives would probably be terrible , but being able to fire off 10 shots between reloads would have been a novelty for those used to plate cameras .

Over in the United States , meanwhile , the Orange County Cops take the obvious step for a SWAT team .
Instead of making a camera which looks like a gun , why not just clip a camera onto a real gun ?
The PistolCam is just that .
The video camera sits below the barrel and captures 30 fps video for up to an hour .
We covered this $ 700 accessory when it entered testing at the Newburgh Police Department , and I mentioned that it was nothing more than an amazing real - life game of Quake .
I stand by that , although so far no footage has turned up on YouTube , which was my other prediction .

Skipping back across the pond to Germany , we find this antidote to all the cameras .
The IR.ASC is an infrared light mounted on a headband .
Invisible to the eye , it whites out your head on security cameras , protecting your identity whether you are up to no good or just tired of being watched everywhere you go .
We imagine that if this were used in the same place as the Image Fulgurator , some kind of singularity would result , and the Universe would end in a matter / antimatter , do n’t - cross - the - streams implosion .

Tomorrow I will be meeting up with von Bismarck for a chat about his Fulgurator and to see what other hardware hacks he has in mind .
Until then , here ’s a schematic of the device .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The specter of inflation and a bear market in equities is a powerful formula to rekindle investor interest in gold , which looks to be staging a catch - up rally after lagging other commodities in 2008 .
Bullion , which has often moved in lock - step with oil because of the metal ’s appeal as a hedge against inflation , has in the last several months parted ways with the energy and grain markets , which have soared to record highs .
Yet , in the wake of U.S. Federal Reserve ’s decision this week not to raise interest rates but its warning that inflation is a growing threat , a sudden resurgence in gold appears to have revived its positive correlation with oil .
That should mean gold benefits as resurging inflation continues to wreak havoc for the stock markets , erode the value of the dollar and drive equity investors to seek returns elsewhere .
“ The recent rise in the gold market shows that uncertainty and fears still exist out there , and the inflation concern due to the lack of a definite Fed statement was a big plus for the metal , ” said Bill O’Neill , managing partner of commodity firm LOGIC Advisors in Upper Saddle River , New Jersey .
On Thursday , U.S. gold futures soared nearly 4 percent , posting the biggest one - day gains in dollar terms since 1985 , as financial market worries and record oil sent global stocks tumbling .
Even though gold has lost 10 percent after it hit a record high of $ 1,030.80 on March 17 , bullion is still up 10 percent year to date , compared with a 12 percent decline of the broad - based global equities MSCI ACWI index .
.
MIWD00000PUS
On Friday , the U.S. blue - chip Dow Jones industrial average .
DJI was at one point more than 20 percent below its October 2007 peak , on the brink of Wall Street 's definition of a bear market , while U.S. futures for August delivery ended nearly 2 percent higher at $ 931.30 .
O’Neill , whose firm has halved its gold investment since March , said bullion ’s bottom at $ 845 on May 2 should be the lowest level of this year .
GOLD - OIL LINK RESUMING ?
Meanwhile , gold should soon rise in tandem with oil after their positive link was temporarily broken by a dollar rally in the past several months , market watchers said .
Gold is also seen as an alternative currency to the greenback .
Indeed , the correlation between bullion and oil was a negative 0.46 after gold ’s hit a record in March , sharply different from a positive 0.87 in the last 20 years , according to Reuters data .
Thomas Winmill , portfolio manager of the $ 225 - million Midas Fund MIDSX.O , said that the gold / oil ratio has only be so skewed in favor of oil in two cases since 1979 , and each time it was followed by a rally in gold , a recent study by research firm Ned Davis showed .
Also , gold ’s oil - buying power is at its lowest now after oil has rocketed nearly 50 percent so far this year .
On Friday , an ounce of gold only bought only 6.53 barrels of oil , which is the lowest level since 2005 .
In March , an ounce could buy more than 10 barrels of oil .
The recent rise of gold - a traditional barometer of inflation and a safe haven investment in times of crises - could signal that inflation could worsen , and the turmoil in the financial markets may not be over soon .
“ We have seen a repatriation into the commodity trade , mostly coming out of the stock market .
Commodities are still the one safe play so far this year as stocks have been volatile and not directional .
It ’s been really tough to make money there , ” said Zachary Oxman , senior trader with Wisdom Financial in Newport , California .
Robert Lutts , president and chief investment officer of the $ 500 - million Cabot Money Management in Salem , Massachusetts , said he expected more investors to buy gold as a portfolio diversifier , and bullion products would be offered as part of more 401 - K programs and pension plans .
Lutts , who recommends his clients to own 5 to 10 percent of their investments in precious metals products , forecast gold could hit $ 1,500 within the next 3 years .
Others fund managers cautioned that the commodity market could be volatile and there are risks associated with any investment .
" There is no such thing as a safe asset anymore .
Cash is not a safe asset , and commodity is just one way to diversify in a world where there is no safe haven , " said Axel Merk , portfolio manager of Merk Hard Currency Fund MERKX.O in Palo Alto , California , who manages $ 400 million of assets .
Just beyond the reach of the North Coast fog , this little community of 1,150 basked until recently under the protection of a police force of just four officers .
Four officers packing 31 submachine guns .
The Blue Lake police force was armed on a par with a big - city SWAT team .
And no Blue Lakers knew until Police Chief David Gundersen ’s life began to very publicly unravel .
In February , Humboldt County sheriff ’s deputies arrested Gundersen on suspicion of crimes in his own bedroom .
Advertisement
Prosecutors have charged him with 33 counts , alleging that the chief repeatedly drugged his wife , a Blue Lake police sergeant , and forced her to have sex .
As investigators dug deeper into his private life , they discovered Gundersen ’s guns .
At home , he had a weapons cache that included a machine gun and a James Bond - style pistol with a silencer , both unregistered .
At police headquarters , he had enough weaponry to arm a small platoon .
Advertisement
Gundersen , 53 , advertised his love of guns on a MySpace page for “ Gundy Bros , ” with a photo of a machine gun , the words “ LIVE , LAUGH . . . LOVE ” and the offer of “ Weapon Systems / Sales and Services . ”
In all , investigators seized 111 weapons -- nearly a quarter of them from his home .
The chief behind bars , the police force mothballed , City Hall under fire -- this was a seismic scandal for a bucolic town tucked peacefully in the Humboldt County redwoods .
But Blue Lake is handling it with a mix of civic reflection and gallows humor .
Some residents are talking of running a whole new slate of council candidates .
Advertisement
A local playwright is using Gundersen ’s submachine guns as a plot line in his next production .
At the venerable Logger Bar , a stand - up comedian lobbed one - liners about high - powered weapons and sleeping pills ( “ Honey , is n’t it time for your nightcap ? ” ) .
“ This is like trying to picture Barney Fife with a submachine gun , ” said Al Clark , owner of Blue Lake Video .
The town that Dave Gundersen was hired to protect is a sleepy place five miles up Trinity Scenic Byway from the coast .
The old lumber mill sits rusting .
Today the biggest businesses are Mad River Brewing Co. and a nearby Indian casino .
With plentiful sun and warmer temperatures than at the coast , Blue Lake has drawn retirees , artist types and commuters to Humboldt State in nearby Arcata .
Advertisement
Gundersen arrived in 1999 after a short run in nearby Trinidad and a controversial stint in the high desert San Bernardino County city of Adelanto , where he was accused of theft ( police union leaders attributed it to small - town politics ) .
In Blue Lake , he made an immediate impression .
No one thought the town had much crime until he arrived .
But the chief bombarded the City Council with statistics showing an increase in vehicle break - ins , burglaries and other property crimes .
City leaders now figure he was inflating the numbers to justify a ballooning budget , Councilwoman Karen Barnes said .
Advertisement
Detractors say they never liked his style .
“ He was n’t the warm and fuzzy kind of small - town cop most wanted , ” Councilwoman Marlene Smith said .
“ He ’s a classic passive - aggressive kind of guy -- the type to smile and then stab you in the back , ” said Michael Fields , artistic director of Dell ’ Arte International , a critically lauded local theater company and performing arts school .
Gundersen drew Fields ’ ire by calling the company ’s annual summer festival an unwelcome police headache .
Advertisement
The police force also took to stopping the school ’s foreign - born students on the street , a practice Fields saw as racial profiling .
Dave Beebe , 59 , got crosswise with the chief a couple of years ago over an improperly suspended driver ’s license .
The county grand jury looked at Gundersen and his department ’s tactics , but nothing substantive came of it .
Still feeling wronged , Beebe filed a lawsuit .
It was dismissed , but he now feels that he ’s won .
“ It ’s too rare in life you get to see karma firsthand , but that ’s what I feel has come around , ” Beebe said .
“ Spousal rape and machine guns in this little burg ?
That ’s just ridiculous . ”

Clark , owner of Blue Lake Video , remembers how Gundersen conducted a “ sting ” at his 50th - birthday bash .
Clark hired four bands , supplied six kegs of beer and invited 300 friends .
Gundersen wrote him up for putting out a donation jar to offset costs .
“ He comes in like a hotshot big - city gunslinger , ” Clark said .
“ The man was not a good fit for this town . ”
Earlier this month , Gundersen went to court in a jail jumpsuit .
He pleaded not guilty to all counts .
The trial is scheduled for June 30 .
If convicted , Gundersen could face up to life in prison .
For now , he remains behind bars in lieu of $ 1.25 - million bail .
His attorney , Russell Clanton , contends that seeds of trouble were planted by the chief ’s former wife , now a Humboldt County sheriff ’s office dispatcher , who he says has plotted to poison Gundersen ’s relationship with his current spouse .
Advertisement
The result , he said , has been a “ witch hunt ” that has prosecutors , the media and disgruntled Blue Lakers piling on .
Clanton said that each weapon was acquired “ by a verifiable and legitimate route ” -- mostly from gun manufacturers at steep discounts or for free -- and that the department had reason to possess them .
With a tribal casino and schools to protect , he said , the chief ’s weaponry has n’t been seen in the “ proper context . ”
Paul Gallegos , Humboldt County district attorney , counters that the proper context is “ an unhealthy trend toward paramilitarism ” by some police departments .
As for the submachine guns , which can fire 800 rounds a minute , “ I am still waiting to hear a rational , reasonable law enforcement explanation for the apparent irrational , unreasonable exuberance in collecting such a supply , ” he said .
While the case has been proceeding at the county courthouse in Eureka , Blue Lake ’s two remaining officers , both rookies , have lacked the legally required command structure to be allowed on patrol .
Relegated for weeks to paperwork and dog catching , both were placed on paid administrative leave .
Advertisement
Sheriff ’s deputies are filling Blue Lake ’s law enforcement void for the next year under a $ 200,000 contract .
Some residents believe that arrangement should be made permanent , but the council recently decided that a revamped police force would be best -- as long as a decent chief was at the helm .
“ However we achieve it , we need that little Mayberry thing , ” Councilwoman Barnes said .
In the meantime , critics are questioning why the City Council did n’t step in more decisively long ago .
Council members respond that they knew nothing of the gun cache until they read about it in the paper .
Advertisement
At a tense City Hall meeting soon after Gundersen ’s arrest , City Manager Wiley Buck told the council that Gundersen rationalized the submachine guns as valuable bait with which to barter with other cities .
Two of the guns , Buck said , had been lent to nearby Rio Dell in exchange for traffic - monitoring equipment .
Though some of the machine guns were n’t properly registered , the only weapons charges against Gundersen are two counts for the unregistered submachine gun and secret - agent pistol he kept at home .
He also continued to draw a paycheck while behind bars -- until the council finally terminated his contract May 5 .
For locals such as Al Clark , it was about time : “ Most people I know say it could n’t have happened to a nicer guy . ”

Mexico officer flees drug gang killers targeting police Mexico officer escapes drug gang killers targeting police
MEXICO CITY — A federal police commander escaped killers near Monterrey on Tuesday as authorities in Mexico City pursued leads in a plot to assassinate more top police officials .
For the first time , Mexico 's warring drug gangs are training their guns on the heads of the nation 's security forces .
Under siege from an unprecedented federal anti-narcotics campaign , the gangs are switching from bribes to bullets in defending their lucrative smuggling routes to the United States .
The result is three police commanders killed in the capital since May 1 , including Edgar Millan , who as commissioner of the 30,000 - member federal police led the civilian front of the drug war .
Another federal police commander narrowly escaped assassination early Tuesday .
Arturo Cabrera had just left the Nuevo Leon state police academy at 1 a.m. when gunmen opened fire on his car , wounding him slightly in the face .
He managed to return to the police base , where he exchanged fire with his assailants before a SWAT team came to his rescue , officials said .
The force 's Mexico City commanders have been less fortunate .
Anti-narcotics officials revealed details late Monday on a cell of killers they said was behind Millan 's May 8 assassination .
The gang 's alleged leader , Jose Antonio Montes , was himself a federal police officer .
He was arrested along with five suspects , including the alleged hit man , Alejandro Ramirez .
The gang was apparently plotting to kill a total of six police commanders in the capital , officials said .
In addition to Millan , targets included Roberto Velasco , a former head of the federal organized - crime unit , who was gunned down outside his Mexico City home on May 1 .
At his arrest , Montes was carrying a list of license plate numbers belonging to the commanders ' vehicles and what appeared to be sketches of Velasco 's house , they said .
All the targets were former or current top officials of the federal anti-narcotics squad .
Federal investigators suspect the Sinaloa drug cartel was behind the attacks in the capital .
Millan had recently coordinated the arrest earlier this year of Arturo Beltran Leyva , the cartel 's alleged No. 2 man .
Agents have also arrested a dozen other cartel members and seized millions of dollars in weapons and cash in recent raids in Mexico City and the Pacific coast state of Sinaloa .
On Tuesday , President Felipe Calderon dispatched hundreds of federal police to reinforce anti-narcotics efforts in Culiacan , the Sinaloa capital and the cartel 's headquarters .
Twelve federal police have been killed in the state so far this month .
And analysts predict the bloodshed will only increase , as the gang gives vent to internal rivalries .
In recent weeks , Culiacan has been littered with banners from feuding factions threatening violence against each other and the security forces , including one hung inside the city 's Roman Catholic cathedral .
Experts say the government crackdown has fueled tension between the reputed cartel boss , Joaquin " Chapo " Guzman , and Beltran Leyva , who is aligned with the Juarez cartel .
Guzman 's son , Edgar , was killed on May 8 in a shootout between rival traffickers outside a Culiacan supermarket .
And local news reports suggest Beltran 's gang might have been responsible .
The violence is also a reaction to a more coordinated assault by the federal authorities on the cartels ' power structure , some analysts said .
" For the first time , we 're seeing surgical assaults on their safe houses , where the police go , attack and arrest them 10 or 15 at a time , " said Jorge Chabat , a Mexico City - based security analyst .
" This suggests a far more effective intelligence effort " by the federal forces .
However , Mexican authorities dispute whether the police force is up to the challenge of taking on the drug gangs .
Bipartisan members of the Mexican Congress are calling for the army to patrol the capital .
Already , thousands of troops are battling the traffickers in a dozen states across Mexico .
" The police are totally out of their depth here , " Obdulio Avila , a legislator from Calderon 's conservative National Action Party , said on Tuesday .
" There are entire neighborhoods where the police do n't dare go in . "
He denied that the demand was a political challenge to the capital 's leftist mayor , Marcelo Ebrard , who has opposed such a plan .
" It 's not a political demand , " Avila said .
" It 's a citizen 's demand . "

Tom Kristensen , Allan McNish and Dindo Capello took a magnificent victory for Audi in a truly classic 76th running of the 24 Hours of Le Mans .
The drivers of the No.2 R10 TDi put in what must go down as one of the all - time great Le Mans performances to score the eighth win in nine years for the German manufacturer .
The trio successfully fought off the challenge from the three Peugeot 908 HDis to give Kristensen his record - breaking eighth victory , McNish his second ( a decade after the first ) , and Capello his third .
Despite maintaining its pace advantage throughout the race , Peugeot will have to wait at least another year to win the classic race on its home soil .
Audi did exactly what they set out to do knowing they were coming into the race as underdogs .
They played to their strengths and put the quicker Peugeots under pressure as much as possible .
A mammoth crowd of 260,000 spectators turned out and stuck with the race to its thrilling conclusion as Kristensen held firm against a late charge from Nicolas Minassian in the No.7 Peugeot .
A tremendous duel had raged race - long between the two cars , through changeable weather , reliability niggles , and several off - track moments , before climaxing with a pulsating battle in the final hour .
Peugeot had carried their anticipated greater speed into the race and looked far more likely to triumph by Saturday evening .
But Audi are experienced hands at Le Mans , and gathered momentum each time the great race threw something else at its contestants .
The R10's superiority in wet conditions during the night left the No.2 crew with a three - minute advantage over the No.7 Peugeot , which Jacques Villeneuve , Marc Gene , and then Nicolas Minassian took it turns to chip away at throughout the morning .
But their progress was steady at best , thanks mainly to magnificent stints from Allan McNish and Tom Kristensen during the morning .
The Peugeot may have been the quicker car , but the Audi 's stability in tricky conditions and its veteran drivers ' ability to stay consistent under any circumstances made the telling difference .
Kristensen gave his Audi team a big scare a couple of hours from the end when he clashed with Juan Barazi when lapping his LMP2 car and spun .
He was fortunate to escape without significant damage and pressed on with protecting his lead .
Audi forced Peugeot to take a desperate gamble in the last hour by sending Minassian out on slicks while it poured with rain over parts of the circuit .
Peugeot hoped he would be able to make up significant time on the dry Indianapolis and Porsche sections , but a closing margin of four seconds per lap was no more rapid that it had been when they were evenly shod .
Minassian gave it absolutely everything , though , risking far more than he probably should have in pursuit of a car that was realistically too far ahead .
The Frenchman twitched his skittish - looking 908 around La Sarthe lap after lap , flying off the road at the Dunlop and Mulsanne chicanes , and seeming never far from a potentially huge accident .
He was eight seconds quicker at times , but struggled to control the 908 after picking up a left rear puncture , and had to give best in the end .
Kristensen 's advantage was insurmountable and no matter how hard Minassian tried , he could n't prevent the popular Dane from taking another record - breaking victory .
It may have come down to a last hour charge , but the turning point of the race was shortly after 3 am .
The odds were stacked in Peugeot 's favour at the time , with the No.7 car maintaining a comfortable two - minute lead over the No.2 Audi .
But a sudden downpour changed everything .
Villeneuve , and the other two Peugeots , struggled with poor visibility , while Dindo Capello came into his element .
The momentum swung to Audi in a matter of minutes as Villeneuve 's two - minute lead was eroded .
The No.7 car was further delayed in the pits as all three Peugeots had to be pulled into the garage at their scheduled stops so the team could attend to their overheating problems .
Kristensen took over behind the wheel of the No.2 car and assumed the lead when Peugeot 's slower , closed - roof driver changes hindered their pit stops and Marc Gene rejoined in second place .
Kristensen then hammered home the extent of Audi 's advantage in full wet conditions by streaking into a 30 - second lead over Gene in just two laps .
The Dane drove absolutely flat out for the best part of the next hour to build a lead approaching two minutes .
The rain eased off and the track began to dry , allowing the Peugeot to claw its way back towards the Audi in what was becoming an amazing cat and mouse contest .
But McNish 's relentless consistency paid off for Audi in a race that bore a stark resemblance to the Scot 's previous Le Mans victory 10 years earlier , when he was able to defeat the Toyotas despite being at a significant disadvantage on raw pace .
The No.7 car closed to within 20 seconds at one point , but a tyre problem forced Gene to pit mid-way through a stint and the gap extended to over a minute again .
McNish then stretched the lead out to around one lap and gave the car back to Capello , who was able to marshal the gap to Villeneuve throughout his stint .
The margin was even stretched to three minutes before the circuit began to dry and Peugeot were able to mount their final charge in the last hour .
The work of all three aboard the No.2 Audi in the changeable conditions had earned the car a healthy lead , but Kristensen still had to push harder than Audi would have liked to maintain a safe margin on the slippery track at the end .
Peugeot once again proved the outright pace of their car as a dry line emerged in the closing moments , but they will have to improve their all round package if they are to defeat Audi over 24 hours .
The almost bulletproof reliability and wet weather driveability of the R10 mean it is still a dominant force by the chequered flag .
The No.8 Peugeot was the quicker of the quickest cars , and would certainly have been able to challenge the Audi , but it seemed attract all the misfortune .
Its hopes of victory were dashed after just hours when a gearbox problem lost it six laps , but Stephane Sarrazin , Pedro Lamy and Alexander Wurz pressed on regardless and dragged the car back into the top six time and again .
It lost another 12 minutes when it needed a battery change during the night , and was delayed yet again when Lamy spun into the tyres at Arnage and had to limp back for a new rear wing .
But the car still made it home in fifth place , with a lap in hand over the No.1 Audi R10 , which lost five laps with a clutch problem this morning and was delayed further when Frank Biela spun at the first chicane during the last hour 's frenetic downpour .
The No.17 works Pescarolo of Harold Primat / Benoit Treluyer / Christophe Tinseau fought off the charge of the closed - roof newcomers to come home first in the unofficial petrol class .
The Lola Aston Martin would have been a sure contender for the honours on pace alone , but Jan Charouz had a big crash at the Dunlop chicane less than two hours into the race and ended the car 's hopes .
But Stefan Mucke , Tomas Enge , and Charouz charged on undeterred for the remaining 22 hours and earned a well - deserved top 10 finish on the car 's debut .
The Dome also showed inspired speed and future potential in the early stages , but a string of problems during the night delayed the car before engine trouble finally put pay to its hopes of a strong finish .
The No.16 Pescarolo had set the pace for the non-diesels for the much of the race , but also dropped out this morning with engine trouble , while the No.5 Courage Oreca retired with a heavy crash on Saturday evening , after which Marcel Fassler was taken to hospital .
The LMP2 class finally produced a competitive battle for the category win thanks to the presence of the Van Merksteijn and Team Essex Porsche RS Spyders .
The two cars exchanged the lead during Saturday afternoon as Casper Elgaard continually ran down the No.34 car .
The Dane seemed to have the legs of Jeroen Bleekemolen at the time , but could never quite establish the Essex car at the head of the class for long .
It lost out to the Van Merksteijn time and again in the pits and had to settle for chasing from a distance from the evening onwards .
The pair remained no more than a lap apart up until the early hours of the morning , when the Essex car developed a persistent misfire and lost several laps as the team attempted to locate its cause at each of the scheduled pit stops .
The strength in depth of the class was , unfortunately , traditionally thin , and the Saulnier Pescarolo completed the class podium , despite being over 20 laps behind the Van Merksteijn car .
The Quifel Lola was the only other car still running competitively at the end of the race , following the demise of Barazi Epsilon which stopped out on track after picking up a puncture on the Mulsanne Straight , and the Speedy Racing Lola , which was delayed by an electrical problem .
Aston Martin may have been perceived as the underdog by some in its fight with Corvette , but it triumphed over its American rival for the second year in a row , with the No.009 car again coming out on top of a close , race - long battle .
The factory Corvettes looked the stronger package in the early stages of the race , but rapid evening stints from Darren Turner and David Brabham lifted the Aston into lead during the evening .
But they , and third driver Antonio Garcia , struggled to build a strong lead during the night as they struggled with traffic and did not make the best of their tyres while the circuit was wet .
It narrowed to a two - car fight , with the No.63 Corvette of Jan Magnussen / Johnny O'Connell / Ron Fellows , during the night as each team 's second car hit trouble .
The No.64 Corvette fell off the lead lap with an alternator problem on Saturday evening and never really recovered .
The No.007 Aston of Karl Wendlinger / Andrea Piccini / Heinz - Harald Frentzen was in touch with the lead pair until the early hours of the morning when a similar problem dropped it out of the hunt .
The Larbre Saleen had hoped to take the fight to Aston Martin and Corvette , but its hopes were dashed early on when Christophe Bouchut lost a wheel and spun into the gravel at the Dunlop Curve .
The car was still circulating at the end , but 40 laps behind the class leaders .
Risi Competizione gave Ferrari its first victory at Le Mans in five years in a race of attrition in the GT2 class .
The billed battle between Ferrari and Porsche never quite materialised as every one of the Porsches hit trouble and fell away before presenting a sustained challenge to Risi 's lead .
The Flying Lizards Porsche rivalled the Risi car in the early stages , before clashing with the IMSA Porsche , which made its way through the field after starting from the back .
The Felbermayr Porsche took up the challenge and swapped the class lead with the No.82 Risi car between pit stops .
It eventually ran into trouble and lost 12 laps with a gearbox problem , leaving only Ferraris to contest the victory .
The Risi car then had to fight off the charge of the Virgo Motorsport F430 throughout the night , but the sheer speed of Gianmaria Bruni , Mika Salo , and Jaime Melo meant they were always in control at the front .
The Virgo car retired with engine problems in the last three hours , leaving the BMS Scuderia Italia Ferrari and the similar Farnbacher car to complete the podium .
The Farnbacher car completed a spirited comeback drive to secure a place on the podium after multiple incidents earlier in the race dropped it way behind the class leaders .

There has been a constant narrative that aims to reduce you to an ex-wife of a former head of state .
This is factual , but in mainstream media there seems to be no other description of you

The infra red is invisible to The Man , but will cause CCTV cameras to flare out over the face of the wearer , obscuring his identity and making this the digital equivalent of a hooded sweatshirt .

Is White House Blocking Search for Bin Laden ?
White House wo n't OK special forces raids into Pakistan , report says .
June 30 , 2008  --
The Pentagon has drafted a secret plan that would send U.S. special forces into the wild tribal regions of Pakistan to capture or kill Osama bin Laden and his top lieutenants , but the White House has balked at giving the mission a green light , The New York Times reported today .
The Bush administration , which has seven months left in its term , gave the go - ahead for the military to draw up the plan to take the war on terror across the Afghan border and into the mountains of Pakistan where bin Laden is believed to be hiding , according to the newspaper .
Intelligence reports have concluded that bin Laden has re-established a network of new training camps , and the number of recruits in those camps has risen to as many as 2,000 in recent months from 200 earlier this year .
Although the special forces attack plan was devised six months ago , infighting among U.S. intelligence agencies and among White House offices have blocked it from being implemented , the Times reported .
The Bush team would like to leave office next January having put bin Laden , the man behind the Sept. 11 attacks , behind bars or in his grave .
But sending U.S. forces into Pakistan would be controversial and risky .
The rugged mountain area is populated by bin Laden sympathizers , hurting the chances that such a raid could succeed .
It would also trigger a diplomatic outcry from the Pakistani government .
The United States has conducted a series of aerial drone attacks on Taliban and al Qaeda leaders in Pakistan , killing several key Qaeda figures and narrowly missing bin Laden 's deputy , Ayman Zawahiri , in one strike .
But an attack earlier this month killed several Pakistani border guards instead and has made Pakistan less willing to allow U.S. strikes on its territory .
The Taliban of Pakistan , who are close al Qaeda allies , have grown alarmingly stronger in Pakistan 's lawless border areas and threatened the regional capital of Peshawar last week .
Pakistan 's new coalition government , which has made a series of truces with the militants in recent months , was forced over the weekend to launch an offensive to push the militants back from the outskirts of Peshawar .
Pakistan called the operation a success , even though none of the heavily armed militants in the area were reported killed .
Pakistan announced Sunday that Bush had invited Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani to Washington next month .
High on that visit 's agenda is the question of whether Pakistan can restrain the Taliban by itself or whether the United States could decide to take action in the tribal areas .
A separate report said the Bush administration has also begun a " major escalation of covert operations against Iran ... to destabilize the country 's religious leadership . "
The charge was made by veteran journalist Seymour Hersh in the current issue of The New Yorker magazine .
Hersh claims that elite American commando units are operating inside Iran and that Congress has authorized $ 400 million for the covert operations .
The article claimed that U.S. special forces have been conducting clandestine operations against Iran since last year and have seized members of the Iran commando force al Quds and taken them to Iraq for questioning .
The U.S. ambassador in Iraq Ryan Crocker denied the report .
" I 'll tell you flatly that U.S. forces are not operating across the Iraqi border into Iran , in the south or anywhere else , " he said in an interview from Baghdad Sunday .
Web Browser Wednesday
Earlier this year a guy installed 100 Firefox extensions without any problems .
Well … I decided to try and top that .
I picked the nice round number of 200 for a few different reasons .
First and foremost because Firefox “ 2 ” was recently released but also because back in August Mozilla celebrated 200 million downloads of the fantastic browser !
Right now they are past 263 million but this is kinda like a belated celebration .
A discussion about Firefox extensions also started over in the forum which is the whole reason I decided to do this .
Hey Chris , hope you have Guinness on hold . :D
I do n’t just have one screenshot to show you either …
I have several to show you what installing all of these extensions does to your menus as well .
Prepare to be amazed !
Installing the Extensions
To install the extensions I went through the Mozilla Extension page one by one , like any normal person would be doing .
I went through the top Firefox extension page until I had all 200 installed .
I did install repetitive extensions ( such as the three versions of Forecast Fox ) because I wanted to see if they affected each other , but there were n’t too many extensions that overlapped in functionality .
The only ones that I really skipped were the dictionaries which there happened to be quite a few of .
After I had installed 50 of them I decided to restart the browser to see how things were going .
It took about one minute to startup but everything looked like it installed correctly .
Then I moved on and after about an hour I had all 200 installed and was ready to restart the browser .
I did n’t think that it was going to work but to my surprise it did …
The Overall Result
Ahhh … the beauty of Firefox is in the eye of the beholder and let me say that it looks pretty sweet when running in Vista .
It took 6 - minutes to start Firefox with the 200 extensions installed but it worked !
Not only that but there are the popup windows that you get for certain extensions right after they are installed … yeah … I received 47 of those .
That also seemed to delay the initial start time but I did n’t sit there filling out information for all of the options , otherwise that would have taken me hours .
It was quite a site to see and there was a very limited viewing area for websites because of the toolbars .
On my 24 ″ widescreen monitor I had about 2 ″ of viewable area at the bottom of the browser .
But hey , it was still usable .
Here is a screenshot of the overall result of a Google search that I performed :
Click for Full-size
It is also pretty amazing what the Google website looks like when I have all of those extensions installed .
Not to mention how funny it is when you type a search in the search box and press “ Enter ” just to see it replicate itself amongst all of the toolbars .
That was probably my favorite part about the whole experience . ;)
Extensions That Were Installed
The All - in - One Sidebar decided to replace the default Add - ons page in Firefox with its own sidebar module .
That was fine except for the fact that it could n’t handle all of the extensions .
It did n’t show a listing of anything that I had installed and in the title it said “ undefined [ 0 ] . ”
I was a little worried at first because I wanted to show a listing of the extensions that I had installed … but have no fear because there was another menu option that listed them without any issues .
Here are the several screenshots of the extensions I installed :
Click any of the images above to enlarge them
Using the ListZilla extension that I installed ( which is the only one that I installed that is n’t in the top few hundred according to Mozilla ) I also generated an HTML listing of all 200 extensions .
See , some extensions do have a purpose . ;)
Tools Menu
Many extensions will put some sort of “ helpful ” link in the Tools menu when you install it .
Well , I can confirm that nearly all of them put something in the menu .
You do n’t even want to know how long it took me to find the “ Options ” in this disaster :
Click any of the images above to enlarge them
Possible Toolbars
I wanted to conserve some space so I ditched the Bookmarks toolbar that is included with Firefox . :)
After all , it is all about the extensions , right ?
Here is a listing of all the toolbars that are available to choose from but I did n’t setup Weatherbug which is why it ’s not shown :
Click for Fullsize
Possible Sidebars
Thank goodness that in Firefox you can’t have a bunch of sidebars open at the same time , because I would have absolutely no website viewing space !
Here is a listing of the possible sidebars that could be shown :

Other Less - Altered Things
Here are a few more screenshots of things that did n’t get hit quite so hard by the extensions hurricane …

Memory Usage
Firefox is notorious for its memory leaks but it did n’t turn out to be as bad as I thought .
By the time Firefox would start after a few minutes it had climbed up to 145 MB but it capped off around 195MB .
I did n’t use it as much as I typically use a browser to see if memory leaks would really start to kick in but it was running for quite awhile .
I did however find that it would become sluggish or become unresponsive pretty frequently but it only crashed once in the two - hours that I had it up and running .
Here is a screenshot of the memory usage at the end of that two - hours :
Click for Fullsize
Conclusion
Hope you enjoyed this because I know that I sure found it interesting .
I thought about uploading my profile to a file - sharing site but it would have taken way too long since it is over 120 MB in size .
It was definitely an experience and I was thinking about naming this the “ Firefox 200 ! ”
What are you still doing here ?
Go download some extensions . :D
You should also stop by the forum and share what extensions you are currently using .
what people say
We are very pleased with the performance .
Aesthetically , it has enhanced the curb appeal of our parks , and significantly reduced annual maintenance .
There has been no breakdown of the product and the colors remain as bright as the day of installation .
Furthermore , for a surfacing product that meets necessary ASTM and CPSC standards , I have yet to find a better price .

Al Qaeda increasingly faces sharp criticism from once - loyal sympathizers who openly question its ideology and tactics , including attacks that kill innocent Muslims , according to U.S. intelligence officials , counter - terrorism experts and the group ’s own communications .
A litany of complaints target Osama bin Laden ’s network and its affiliates for their actions in Iraq and North Africa , emphasis on suicide bombings instead of political action and tepid support for , or outright antagonism toward , militant groups pressing the Palestinian cause .
The criticism apparently has grown serious enough that Al Qaeda ’s chief strategist , Ayman Zawahiri , felt compelled to solicit online questions .
He responded in an audio message released this month .
For more than 90 minutes , Bin Laden ’s second - in - command tried to defuse the anger .
In March , Zawahiri released a 188 - page Internet book to rebut complaints , particularly those of an influential former Islamic militant who said Zawahiri and Bin Laden should be held accountable for violence against Muslims .

Sayyed Imam Sharif , an Egyptian physician who once was a senior theologian for Al Qaeda , was one of Zawahiri ’s oldest associates .
The author of violent manifestoes over the last two decades , Sharif did an about - face while incarcerated in Egypt .
Several other prominent Muslim clerics and former militants have similarly condemned Al Qaeda .
Such rifts have been emerging for several years , but they have become increasingly contentious lately , in cyberspace and on the streets of some Arab countries .
In addition to Zawahiri , Al Qaeda leaders , including Bin Laden himself , have gone on a public relations offensive .
In October , Bin Laden asked followers for forgiveness for the deaths of civilians in Iraq .
Analysts with U.S. and allied intelligence agencies differ over whether the backlash poses significant risks for Al Qaeda , or whether it is simply a public relations problem .
The organization is expanding its pool of hard - core recruits , according to one U.S. counter - terrorism official .
And Internet communications and other intelligence have shown that its anti-American message continues to resonate with extremists throughout much of the Islamic world .
But Al Qaeda also has sought to use regional groups to become more mainstream and expand its power base .
It is in these groups that most of the conflict is occurring .

“ We know that all of this matters to Al Qaeda and that its senior leadership is sensitive to the perceived legitimacy of both their actions and their ideology , ” Juan Carlos Zarate , the White House ’s deputy national security advisor for combating terrorism , said in a speech Wednesday at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy .
“ They care about their image because it has real - world effects on recruitment , donations and support in Muslim and religious communities for the Al Qaeda message . ”
Some counter - terrorism experts say they suspect that some criticism may have been planted on websites by Western intelligence agents , or lodged by imprisoned radicals who have been coerced .
But Zarate and others say the dissent is real and widespread .
“ There has been a growing rejection of the Al Qaeda program and message , ” said Zarate , who added that the U.S. and its allies have encouraged the backlash by exploiting rifts between Al Qaeda and once - supportive Islamic fundamentalists objecting to its tactics .

U.S. officials cite a variety of evidence , including intelligence , Internet traffic , statements from Al Qaeda leaders , polling data and even songs by popular Pakistani and Indonesian musicians .
Prominent Saudi cleric Salman Awdah sent an open letter to Bin Laden in September in which he condemned violence against innocents and said Al Qaeda was hurting Muslim charities by its purported ties to them .
“ Brother Osama , how much blood has been spilled ? ” wrote Awdah , who is believed to be independent of the Saudi government .
“ How many innocents among children , elderly , the weak and women have been killed and made homeless in the name of Al Qaeda ? ”
“ Who benefits from turning countries like Morocco , Algeria , Lebanon or Saudi Arabia into places where fear spreads and no one can feel safe ? ”

In London this week , former extremists launched the Quilliam Foundation , an organization dedicated to discrediting Al Qaeda and other Islamic extremists .
Zawahiri described his audio message as the first of several “ open meetings ” and answered complaints , many of them asking why Al Qaeda had killed innocents , including students on a passing bus who died in a bomb attack on the Algerian Constitutional Council in December .
“ Excuse me , Mr. Zawahiri , but who is it who is killing with Your Excellency ’s blessing the innocents in Baghdad , Morocco and Algeria ?
Do you consider the killing of women and children to be jihad ? ” asked one questioner whom Zawahiri identified as a geography teacher .
“ Were we insane killers of innocents as the questioner claims , it would be possible for us to kill thousands of them in the crowded markets , ” Zawahiri responded .
The deaths of any innocents were the result of “ unintentional error or out of necessity .
. . .
The enemy intentionally takes up positions in the midst of the Muslims for them to be human shields for him . ”

Others asked about Al Qaeda ’s legal authority , and questioned why Zawahiri criticizes the militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah , which are fighting Israel , for their participation in politics .
Zawahiri ’s often - rambling explanations referred listeners to his recently released book , “ The Exoneration , ” which primarily rebuts statements by Sharif , whom Zawahiri suggests was coerced into criticizing Al Qaeda .
Sharif denies that .
Such criticism ultimately could undermine Al Qaeda , said Frank Cilluffo , a former White House counter - terrorism official who is director of the Homeland Security Policy Institute at George Washington University .
“ It has raised the bar in using violence to achieve its objectives , and people are starting to ask a lot of hard questions .
It is losing popular support , ” he said .
“ It is occurring within the strategic thinkers , but also among the rank and file . ”

Some of the earliest manifestations of the dissent were in Iraq .
The first leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq , Abu Musab Zarqawi , killed so many Shiite and Sunni Muslims that a 2005 letter allegedly from Zawahiri told him to stop .
The violence continued after Zarqawi was killed by U.S. forces in 2006 , and angry Sunnis were driven to form councils of neighborhood volunteers with U.S. support to counter the foreign fighters that helped make up Al Qaeda in Iraq .
In North Africa , some radicals have rebelled against a merger with Bin Laden ’s network , objecting to the wave of suicide bombings that have killed women and children since last April , as well as to efforts to send the group ’s young men to Iraq .
Several prominent members of the Al Qaeda affiliate , including regional commander Benmessaoud Abdelkader , have charged that suicide bombings serve Al Qaeda ’s global ambitions at the expense of their efforts to fight what they view as corrupt and anti-Islamist governments in Algeria , Morocco and elsewhere in North Africa .

Olivier Guitta , a Washington - based counter - terrorism consultant born in Morocco , said some militants have alerted authorities to impending bomb attacks so they could be stopped .
“ They do n’t mind hitting the government of Algeria , or France for supporting Algeria .
But they do not want their kids to go off and fight in Iraq against the Americans . ”
In Yemen , old guard Al Qaeda operatives have split with a newly emerging generation of fighters in the last year over the younger militants ’ violent tactics , starting with a suicide bombing in July that killed seven Spanish tourists and two Yemenis .
In Pakistan , recent polls suggest that Bin Laden ’s popularity has suffered because of the widespread belief that Al Qaeda has been behind the killing of many Muslims there , including former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto .
Cilluffo said that on a recent trip to the Middle East he interviewed fighters who had just returned from Iraq , many of them disillusioned .
“ People are saying , ‘ I did n’t sign up to kill fellow Muslims , ’ ” he said .
Advertisement
Fawaz Gerges , an author of two books on Islamic militants who has spent the last several years interviewing militants , cited evidence of “ major fault lines ” within Al Qaeda in chat rooms and other Internet venues .
“ Bin Laden ’s statement and this one [ from Zawahiri ] really tell us about the gravity of the crisis . ”
But several officials and experts suggested that Al Qaeda was mostly trying to do a better job of reaching out to more mainstream recruits .
“ Using this Q - and - A is a way to legitimize Al Qaeda and seek input and increase their following , and not be seen as a hierarchical organization that is divorced from its followers , ” said Farhana Ali , a counter - terrorism analyst at Rand Corp .
“ This is an issue of survival .
They are trying to stay plugged in to Muslim opinion . ”

Would - be Vegas hitman ’s story ends in Irish jail Card dealer ’s strategy : Double - cross clients
We all nurse private ambitions .
Essam Ahmed Eid , a 53 - year - old Egyptian man living in Vegas and dealing poker at the Bellagio , dreamed of becoming a hit man .
He longed to take off the casino clown suit , the Nehru shirt and simpering smile — and replace them with a gun and a grimace .
So Eid did what any enterprising 21st century contract killer would :
He created a Web site — www.hitmanforhire.net — and waited for the clients to come .
They did .
And what happened next went so wrong , backfired so badly , that it was the subject of almost every cover article in every newspaper in the country —
Ireland , that is .
That ’s where Eid ’s final contract to kill flopped fantastically .
The story is straight supermarket thriller , full of half - predictable twists , jealous girlfriends , wealthy businessmen and Eid armed with not a gun , but poison .
While several Irish newspapers have spent the past year digesting every angle of the story , the American press has largely ignored it .
And so Eid is infamous in another country but has been anonymous here — until now .
What follows has been combed from Irish and U.S. court documents , as well as a mountain of international newspaper articles and correspondence with foreign reporters covering the case .
Despite the mountain of papers , the rationale behind Eid’s hit man ambitions is hardly clarified by the reading .
What unfolds , however , should intrigue anyone who likes to read paperback mysteries or watch people fall on their faces , because this story is a bit of both .
•••
If Eid really fancied himself a hit man , he was a lousy one .
He never came close to killing anybody .
In fact , his whole strategy was not to kill the intended target , but to let him in on the plan , to tell whomever he ’d been hired to kill all about it , and then generously give him the opportunity to buy out the bounty on his life .
Whether this was Eid ’s cowardice or cleverness is unclear .
What is clear is that rage overpowers reason .
There is no other explanation for why anyone would look at a Web site like the one Eid created and decide the services detailed therein were a sound solution to his problems .
The site was amateur and , even if you did n’t think it was a fall - flat joke , pretty lame .
There was a picture of a shadowy Al Capone - style gangster alongside text that read : “ Assassinations are the most practical solutions to common problems .
Thanks to the Internet , ordering a hit has never been easier .
We manage a network of freelance assassins , available to kill at a moment ’s notice . ”
Apparently , some people took this seriously .
About a month after the site was created , Eid had a client — a disgruntled ex-girlfriend who , court documents indicate , wanted someone to shoot her old boyfriend ’s new flame in the head .
If criminals are made in a moment ’s bad decision , this was Eid ’s moment .
Consider it a test - drive for the Ireland fiasco .
The intended victim , a loan broker from Southern California named Anne Royston , got her first call from the casino employee in September 2006 .
He told Royston he wanted her to refinance his house .
Within days , Eid and a woman he identified as his assistant were in Royston ’s Woodland Hills office .
But when Royston slid the home paperwork across her desk to Eid for his signature , he pushed it back and told her : “ Somebody wants your head .
Somebody wants you killed and they hate you a lot . ”
Eid showed Royston an e-mail indicating that her boyfriend ’s ex had deposited about $ 17,000 in Eid ’s bank account .
He then , according to court documents , told Royston he was n’t going to kill her because she reminded him of his own daughter .
Tables turned , Eid instead offered to kill the ex-girlfriend .
Royston refused .
After some negotiation , Eid and his associate — later identified as his wife , Theresa Engle — said Royston could save her life by paying the balance on the contract : $ 37,000 .
Then the Vegas couple left , giving Royston a few days to come up with the money .
Instead , she called the police .
With an FBI agent listening in , Royston called Eid .
During the phone conversation , Eid said he lied about his name , which was really Tony Luciano .
It would not be the first time Eid , an Egyptian , would claim this made - for - TV - movie Italian alias .
“ Luciano ” then told Royston he wanted only $ 20,000 .
When Royston told him she was worried that someone else would be hired to kill her , the hit man told her not to worry :
Only 700 people in the world work as hit men , and his father , Michael Luciano , is boss over all of them .
If any of them got a contract on Royston , his father would know , and therefore , so would she .
One day after this phone call , Eid and Engle flew to Ireland , where they would attempt a carbon - copy crime .
Eid must have thought he was on a roll and that he’d be back shortly to collect the money he gave Royston two weeks to come up with .
He was wrong .
Instead , almost everything Eid planned would go foul , and the inner workings of his relationship with Engle , who had flown across the Atlantic with him to bluff a murder for hire , would be revealed for what it was : as complicated as the couple ’s schemes and just as doomed .
•••
Eid and Engle were married in Clark County three years ago .
They lived in North Las Vegas with Eid ’s first wife , Lisa , whom he had married in Michigan a few years earlier and apparently never divorced .
They also lived with Eid ’s teenage daughter .
It was a housing arrangement that Engle admitted to the Irish court was “ quite bizarre . ”
Engle met Eid five years ago in a Michigan casino where he dealt poker and she played .
At the time , she was living with her second husband and their teenage daughter .
She and Eid had an affair , and when Eid moved to Vegas in 2004 , she followed .
After drinking , Eid and his two wives would have group sex , though both women told police they did n’t exactly want to .
That , however , was one of the few things the two women agreed on .
Engle told a court psychologist Eid had promised to divorce his wife , but it never happened .
Instead , Engle says , he slowly started to control and abuse her .
She says he threatened to kill her and leave her in the desert .
He made her cut off contact with her family .
He bit her and hit her , she alleged .
Engle told the psychologist Eid made her drink his blood and urine .
“ Every night I would say to myself , ‘ Please , God , do n’t let me live through this night , ’ ” she claimed .
Eid ’s other wife , as well as his teenage daughter and a family friend , all said they did n’t see any of this alleged abuse and do n’t believe it happened .
But Engle needs you to believe it ’s true , because if you believe she was abused , you might believe that she is , as a psychologist submitted to the California court , a victim of Stockholm syndrome , meaning her role in Eid ’s crimes was a result of being a hostage .
It appears Engle made the same claim in the Irish case , which was higher stakes all around : more money , more scheming , and more people to kill .
Eid ’s California contract was nothing compared with what Eid had working internationally .
While the poker dealer was negotiating with the California broker , he was also exchanging e-mail , as Tony Luciano , with an Irishwoman who called herself “ Lying Eyes . ”
This woman , described in the Irish press as “ a veritable walking cliche of the sassy , blond temptress with the knowing smile ” was really Sharon Collins , a 45 - year - old divorced mother of two who had been dating multimillionaire property developer PJ Howard since 1998 .
While dating the wealthy businessman , who divided his time between a luxury lakeside home and a penthouse apartment in Spain , Collins must have been pampered — but it was n’t pretty .
Or so it seemed in e-mail written by Collins and later discovered by the Irish national police .
Collins , according to newspaper accounts of the court case , sent an anonymous e-mail in April 2006 to an Irish radio program , accusing Howard of pushing her into having “ strange sex ” and detailing his affections for prostitutes , transsexuals and swinging .
When Collins contacted Eid a few months later , she had moved beyond leaking sordid details of her sex life and onto arranging the multimillionaire ’s death .
Writing from a computer in Howard ’s business office , Lying Eyes told Tony Luciano how much she disliked Howard , and how , although she felt bad about it , she had to have him — and his two sons — killed to protect herself .
The problem for Lying Eyes was that she was n’t entitled to Howard ’s money .
The real estate developer wanted to leave his fortune to his sons , and would not marry Collins .
Sure , the couple had promised themselves to each other , had thrown a party and even served wedding cake , but they never officially tied the knot .
So Collins , desperate to marry Howard , figured out a way to get what she wanted , at least kind of :
She visited the Web site proxymarriage.com and paid $ 1,000 for a Mexican marriage certificate that required neither partner to be present .
Now his wife on paper , Collins might be entitled to Howard ’s millions .
The plan Luciano and Lying Eyes came up with was , like their aliases , right out of a bad book .
First , an assassin would fly to Ireland and track down Howard ’s sons in one of their favorite pubs .
There , the assassin would poison the sons ’ drinks with the deadly neurotoxin Ricin , which Eid and Engle were cooking up in their Vegas home for this express purpose .
Shortly after the sons were killed , Howard , vacationing with Collins in Spain , would “ jump ” from the 14th floor balcony of his penthouse , overwhelmed with grief at his sons ’ untimely passing .
Eid ’s price : $ 90,000 to kill all three , with a down payment of $ 45,000 .
Collins sent 15,000 euros , just over $ 23,700 , to Vegas in August .
The following month , Eid and Engle landed in Limerick .
Their flights , and their hotel , were paid for with a credit card registered to PJ Howard .
They day after they landed , the offices of Howard ’s business , not far from Limerick , were robbed of a two computers , including one Collins used .
She was in Spain with Howard when the robbery occurred , enjoying the seaside while Eid , in Ireland , was planning to double - cross her .
After the robbery , Eid called Howard ’s oldest son , 29 - year - old Robert , and told him about the bounty on his family .
“ Luciano ” was willing to let the Howards pay off the contract , for 100,000 euros , or about $ 158,000 .
Robert agreed to meet Eid at a hotel the following evening .
Robert also called police to report he was being extorted .
Officers were waiting down the street from the hotel when he arrived and found Engle waiting to broker the exchange .
Instead of getting more euros , Engle and Eid got arrested .
•••
Engle was behind bars for less than a week and then returned to Las Vegas .
She got her stuff out of Eid ’s house and headed to the airport .
She flew back to her home in Ohio , where she has remained since late 2006 .
At the request of the courts , she has made trips back to Ireland and California , where the Royston extortion case is ongoing .
Ireland granted Engle immunity after she made a deal with Irish prosecutors to testify against her husband , according to Sunday Tribune reporter Mark Hillard in Dublin .
Eid , on the other hand , has remained in custody since his arrest , and the murder for hire trial has become one of Ireland ’s biggest stories , with all the right characters to really crackle : an Egyptian hit man from Las Vegas , a millionaire target , a money - hungry blonde .
Five months after Eid was arrested , the Irish cops got Collins too .
They searched one of the computers Eid had stolen and discovered the e-mail sent from Lying Eyes to Tony Luciano .
Collins , however , has denied any involvement .
She claims she was being blackmailed by someone else , a woman named Maria Marconi , who somehow got access to her computer and was sending the e-mail to Luciano .
Marconi , Collins claims , was a friend she made over the Internet , an American confidante .
When the FBI looked for Marconi , however , they could n’t find her .
Prosecutors have called her a figment of Collins ’ imagination .
After Collins was arrested , police searched Eid ’s cell and found he had a contact lens case with traces of Ricin inside .
That evidence , on top of the e-mail , the phone calls , the testimony from Engle and the money Lying Eyes sent to Vegas , was enough for a jury to find Eid and Collins guilty .
Collins was convicted of soliciting and conspiring to murder the Howards .
Eid was convicted of extortion , which carries a maximum sentence of 14 years in Ireland , and assorted theft charges , for the office break - in .
The poker dealer has been described as being rather buoyant about the whole experience , enjoying “ an easy , humorous relationship with prison officers and everyone around him . ”
His Web site , hitmanforhire .net , is dead , however .
Pikachu of Pokemon fame , known for his lightning - fast moves and , er , shocking electric effects has inspired the name of a newly discovered vision protein - Pikachurin .
See , nerds really do have a sense of humor !
The team of 18 Japanese research scientists credited with the discovery all work at the Osaka Bioscience Institute 's Department of Developmental Biology ( left ) .
The reasearchers recently published their findings in the Web version of the the U.S. science magazine Nature Neuroscience .
The title of the post is ( deep breath ) ...
“ Pikachurin , a dystroglycan ligand , is essential for photoreceptor ribbon synapse formation . ”
The body of the submission , although only a paragraph long , has to be the most convoluted , big - word packed piece of writing I 've ever seen ... so , like , I guess those dudes know what they 're talkin ' ' bout !
Read it here – if you really want to feel like a dummy .
For those who are satisfied with the Reader 's Digest condensed version , it goes something like this : the new protein is essential for both eye - to - brain transmission of visual signals and the way the eye tracks moving , or kinetic , objects in the field of vision .
Without Pikachurin , it can take up to three times longer for visual signals to be sent to the brain 's vision center .
That 's , like , not good !
Whew , I 'm all scienced out but I 'll close by saying that the discovery of Pikachurin may lead to new methods of treatment for diseases like Retinitis Pigmentosa , as well as showing that nerds & geeks can lighten up a little when they 're not all intense and studious .

Editor 's Note :
For those reading this article while searching for a great Pickachu gift , I suggest this 25 inch Pickachu cuddle pillow , this sllpper plush and this funny hat .
Sometimes in life , you come across something … unusual .
Something that leaves you happy , but confused .
Something that you desperately need to share with other people , because you just can't put into words exactly what it is .
A moment like that came for me when my brother rented The Story of Ricky .
Does the name sound a little familiar ?
Fans of the Daily Show might remember the Five Questions bit , where Craig Kilborn would ask his guest questions .
Five of ‘em .
Anyway , the opening graphic to that bit featured a man smashing another man 's head with his bare hands .
That brief bit of video is from this very movie , and I assure you , there is much more hilarious , over - the - top gore in the rest of the film .
So , without further ado …
Right away , you can tell it 's going to be a classy movie by the music .
Nothing says " big budget picture " like the noodlings of a first year piano student on a synthesizer .
It 's kind of a warm up for what you 'll be seeing in a few minutes .
For starters , here 's some background info presented in easy - to - digest paragraph form :
Pay extra attention to that last line : " Prisons , like car - parks , have become franchised business … "
Now , I 've never been to China , except to visit the sweatshop where they make the I - Mockery T - shirts , but how the hell could anyone make a franchise out of parking .
Do parents , going for a night on the town , say to each other , " should we park over here at ‘ Parky's " , or over there at ‘ TGTP ' ( Thank God There 's Parking ) ? "
Do n't think about it too hard .
There 's a lot more nonsensical crap coming up .
The new prisoners are brought in , and their names and convictions are read off by the narrator .
You get your first taste of the glory of early English dubbing here , too , as the officers angrily shout their every line ( I 'm almost certain , looking back , that every character in the movie is voiced by one of only two men ) .
Anyway , there 's our man Ricky
Ho , the girly fellow in the tan jacket .
He 's in ten years for manslaughter and assault .
Assault on who ?
Oh , you 'll find out , my little chickadee .
After the narrator reads off his criminal charges , Ricky ignores the guard 's order to wait and proceeds through the metal detector .
It goes off , and two of the guards try to bring him down with their batons .
Well , the one on the right tries .
He leaps over the counter , rushes towards Ricky , and takes a big swing at him .
The guy on the left gives a short , unenthusiastic swing .
I guess he knew Ricky was going to stop it , and figured , " eh , why work for it ? "
They check him out with a handheld detector , and even though he 's wearing a metal belt buckle , the detector does n't go off until it reaches his chest .
A quick visit to the futuristic X - ray / ATM on the wall reveals that Ricky has five bullets lodged in his chest .
Why ?
Let 's listen in :
Officer : " Why did n't you let the doctors take the five bullets out of you ? "
Ricky : " Souvenirs . "
Oh , you 're a tough guy , Ricky .
Real tough .
Kinda cute , too , but mostly tough .
With that little episode behind them , the prisoners are moved to their cells , and the narrator tells them the rules of the prison :
" The warden is the most powerful in the prison .
After him , it 's the assistant warden . "
… Yes , that is how prisons generally work .
Warden , then assistant warden , and so on down the line .
I did n't mean to interrupt , though , please continue .
" The cells are divided into four wings : east , west , north , and south .
Each wing is controlled by a leader .
They 're also known as the gang of four .
None of you are worthy enough to see the warden or the assistant warden yet .
Just make sure you know the rules and your place here . "
That last line bothered me because initially , I did n't realize he was addressing the prisoners , and I thought he was just insulting the audience .
Sure , it seemed like an odd thing to do , but then again , so does saying that parking lots are a big business .
Anyway , that concludes the introduction .
On to the morning preparations in the bathroom .
The captain of the cells is having a bit of a disagreement with an older , dorky prisoner regarding a washcloth , but they decide to settle it like gentlemen .
Just kidding .
The captain has his goons hurl the poor bastard into a window .
And boy , do they take pride in their work .
As it turns out , the old man is scheduled to be out on probation soon , and the captain is upset that he was n't consulted on the matter .
After collapsing from the window - induced trauma , the old man drops a little wooden train , a toy he made for his son .
Still miffed about the old man wanting his washcloth back , the captain smashes the toy train on the man 's head .
And that 's the last straw .
You can only push a man so far , stealing his towel and throwing him into a window like that , but smashing his train sets the old man off .
He produces a block of wood with handlebars and a big razor sticking out of it and rushes the captain .
Unfortunately , he announces his intentions well beforehand , and the bald thug trips him .
The captain , apparently familiar with the use of such strange weapons as this , steals the tool and puts it to good use .
Yeesh .
The camera does n't show exactly how he does this , but regardless , he takes a big strip off of the old man 's face .
A guard shows up to check on the screams of agony , but the captain , being pals with the guards , tells him that the old man just " fell into a knife . "
A knife ?
Is that what they call that thing ?
Man , China is a weird place .
Anyway , the captain is walking tall after his victory over the nerdy fellow .
That is until …
Ouch .
Ricky trips him , and he falls face first onto a conveniently placed board with nails in it .
Baldy confronts Ricky , and Ricky gives him the least intimidating , " you talkin ' to me ? " that I 've ever heard .
Still , the thug gets scared and backs down .
Giving him the benefit of the doubt , he 's just scared that ol '
Ricky will make him trip and fall onto something even worse , like another of those " knives " .
Instead , he and the other thug haul the captain off to get treatment for his eyeful of nails .
The plot thickens , as later on in his cell , the captain and his cronies devise a way to get back at Ricky .
One of them suggests that they bring in " Zorro " .
The other adds that Zorro " was so hungry he ate a whole horse yesterday . "
What an odd sentiment , not just for the Mexican champion of justice , but for anyone you 're thinking of recruiting as a hatchet man .
I guess he just has a healthy appetite …
FOR DESTRUCTION !!!
So , the captain sets it up with the guards that Zorro will be let out to fight Ricky the next day .
For those of you who have n't figured it out already , he is n't exactly " Antonio Banderas as Zorro " .
In fact , here 's a picture of horse - eating Zorro :
Oh yeah .
Z is for Zorro , baby .
The next day , the old man who had a run-in with the captain receives word that his probation has been declined for sending a letter home " behind our backs . "
Sure , the old man is painfully aware that the captain had his probation turned down , but to come up with such a lame excuse …
That 's just cold - blooded , bro .
The old man does n't take the news well .
Very not well .
Still , I suppose it was polite of the guards to let him out of his cell long enough to gather some rope , tie it off , and hang himself while everyone has to sit in their cells like regular prisoners .
Yeah , they are n't such bad guys after all .
Ricky takes it hard , though .
Really hard , considering that he only knew the guy for about two minutes .
He leaves his cell , somehow , and sees the old man off as he 's hauled away on a stretcher .
After breaking the handcuffs off of his dead buddy ( God knows why they were on in the first place ) , Ricky produces a toy train from his jumpsuit and lays it on the old man 's chest .
Then , he throws a big tantrum , screaming , jumping up and down , and flailing his arms .
A goofy end to what was probably meant to be a solemn , depressing scene .
Secondary characters aside , it 's time now for the fight between Ricky and the alleged " Zorro " .
Ricky is taking a shower when Baby Huey sneaks up and gets him with a sucker punch .
He lands next to another guy taking a shower who quickly runs off , perhaps wondering why Ricky is taking a shower with his shorts on .
Zorro strikes a bodybuilder 's pose before introducing himself to Ricky , a pose that fails not just because he 's a lardass , but also because there 's a significant amount of drool rolling down his chest .
He remarks that someone gave him thirty pounds of rice to " finish you off , and turn you into mincemeat , and put you in a pie . "
Then , the fight really begins .
Fifteen seconds later , the fight is over .
Here 's why :
But what really happened , you ask ?
This .
This is what happened .
Mmm , delicious .
That is pretty much the end of Zorro .
The captain , however , is not easily discouraged .
Thinking that he can do better , he produces a large nail , puts it between his middle and ring fingers , and rushes Ricky .
It was a very well thought out plan , but unfortunately , Ricky is able to accept the spike - in - the - hand , and he 's still able to break the captain 's fingers .
Oh well , better luck next time , captain .
Undaunted , Ricky pulls the aforementioned nail out of his hand .
It 's an intimidating move , or at least it would have been , had it not been for the " squeak " that accompanies the nail 's removal .
Finally , the guards show up to break up the fight , but Ricky has other plans …
Well folks , wave bye - bye to another bit player .
With the fight having resolved itself , the guards move in to take Ricky back to his cell .
Ricky decides to play by the rules and , despite the fact that he can knock the cherry cobbler out of his enemies , allows the guards to escort him out of the shower room .
Before they leave , however , Ricky gets a visit from the head of the North Cell .
A man named Oscar .
Oscar …
Anyways , he only stops by long enough to tell Ricky that he 'll be getting more punishment once he 's punished by the Assistant Warden .
And that 's all you get in the way of foreshadowing , folks , so deal with it .
Once he gets back to his cell , Ricky sits down and starts meditating .
It 's very intense meditation , and once he gets into it , he flashes back to when he was a yuppie teenager .
While visiting his father 's grave , Yuppie Ricky encounters his uncle .
Said uncle knew that Ricky started showing signs of superhuman strength since he was " seven and eight years old , " and asks Ricky to show him how strong he is .
Ricky obliges , and goes into a martial arts routine , complete with air punches , jump kicks , and backflips .
No actual blows , though , just his little dance .
At the end of his display of " strength , " Ricky rushes his uncle , only to be effortlessly bitch slapped away .
Adding insult to injury , Ricky 's uncle calls him clumsy , and then starts laughing at him .
Ricky realizes that the reason he was smacked like a punk as because his uncle knows Chi Kun , and he begs him to teach him the martial art .
You get points for trying , Ricky .
The uncle , amused at the sight of his nephew talking to his crotch , starts to laugh again , thus signaling the beginning of the training .
The main focus of the training : Breaking headstones .
And uncle 's got a hell of a lineup .
After letting Ricky polish off a standing headstone , the uncle starts hurling them at Ricky , and Ricky breaks them all , some with punches , some with kicks , and others he breaks simply by letting them hit him and break apart .
Once his uncle exhausts his supply of headstones , he starts to laugh , thus signifying the end of the training .

A paragraph from William Schneider 's 1987 article about Reagan 's impact on American politics :
What keeps the Reagan coalition together is not affection or agreement but the perception of a common threat .
The threat is that liberals will regain control of the federal government and use it , as they have in the past , to carry out their " redistributionist " or " reformist " or " anti-military " program .
The threat will not disappear when Reagan leaves office , and neither will the Reagan coalition -- not even if it loses the 1988 election .
A coalition may be defeated , as Reagan 's was in the 1986 Senate elections , but that does not mean it has been destroyed .
In the short run the Republicans are likely to lose many elections , just as the Democrats did over the fifty - year history of their New Deal coalition .
The short - term fate of the Republican Party is highly dependent on the condition of the economy .
That is what brought the party to power in 1980 and kept it in power in 1984 .
A major recession would spell the end of Republican rule .
But the Reagan coalition would dissolve only if the various groups that compose it no longer felt they had a common interest in limited government .
The Republicans are now the party of a weak government and a strong state , attracting people who are committed to one or both objectives .
The Reagan revolution , not just Reagan himself , has acquired a popular constituency .

A NASA employee is off the job because of what he posted on his blog .
Federal Computer
Week reports the man — a worker at Johnson Space Center in Houston — made posts soliciting donations and campaigning for political candidates on company time .
He ’s also accused of sending non-work - related emails while on the clock .
NASA has suspended him without pay for 180 days , according to FCW .
They say his actions violated the Hatch Act , a policy that governs political activity of government - funded employees .
This serves as a reminder for us all :
The things you type on a work computer are not private .
Just last week , a study by research agency ProofPoint found 41 percent of all large American companies have staff members in place to monitor outgoing messages .
Half of those staffers have no other responsibilities outside of watching what you do .
And it ’s not just the big corporations playing big brother , either ; about 30 percent of all companies , small or large , admit to the same .
Some other interesting numbers from the report :
Eleven percent of all U.S. companies say they ’ve taken disciplinary action specifically related to blogging or message board posting .
Thirteen percent have punished workers for spending time on social networks .
More than a quarter of the companies doing monitoring have fired someone because of what they found .
Adult - oriented content is the most common violation .
Yikes .
Guess I ’ll have to switch over to oggling co-workers instead of internet babes .
That ’s still allowed , right ?
Gunmen in the southern Somali city of Kismayo have killed a local journalist .
Nasteh Dahir , who worked for both the BBC and Associated Press news agency , was shot in the chest and stomach outside his home .
The National Union of Somali Journalists said it was a " targeted assassination " and that the 26 - year - old had received death threats .
Somalia , mired in chaos and violence since 1991 , is among the world 's most dangerous countries for journalists .
At least nine other journalists have been killed in Somalia since February 2007 , according to the human - rights group Amnesty International .
Islamist insurgents are suspected in the attack on Mr Dahir , correspondents say .
The memoir The Bicycle Rider in Beverly Hills was written by William Saroyan and not Henry Miller as stated in the article below .
When asked what their favourite invention of all time is , what do you suppose people say ?
Mobile phones get some votes ; computers , too ; iPods , inevitably .
And there are always some people who love their car and could n't imagine life without it .
If it 's a poll conducted by a radio programme , some will generously nominate the transistor for making their listening possible .
But what comes out top ?
The bicycle , every time .
It seems a paradox in the age of consumer electronics and ever more gorgeously refined designer " black goods " , but it's this sturdy piece of Victorian technology - the good old bike - that we love most .
But why does the bicycle occupy this special place in our affections ?
The heart has its reasons .
A shrink might say it's to do with attachment .
The great majority of us first learn to ride a bike as a child .
For us , you might say , the bicycle is a type of " transitional object " , carrying us for the first time , experimentally , away from our parents .
A mechanically assisted reprise , perhaps , of our unremembered first steps .
When we learn to cycle , aged five , six or seven , the scary thrill of discovering that we can balance to ride - wobbling and hesitant at first , but soon faster and faster - gives us our first real taste of freedom and independence .
It 's a primary pleasure of cycling that you move under your own steam , and you control where you want to go .
For a child , always exploring boundaries , that 's an ecstatic moment .
How could you not feel , ever afterwards , that your bicycle is in some way your friend for giving you that experience ?
And it 's not only you .
In a volume of memoirs , The Bicycle Rider in Beverly Hills , the writer Henry Miller wrote how , as a boy , he would infuriate his mother by cleaning his bike in the house and leaving smudges of oil on the hall floor .
" You 'd sleep with that damn bike , if you could , " she cursed ( I quote from memory ) - and he silently agreed .
Another volume , comprising portraits of friends and lovers ( both plentiful and fluid categories in Miller 's life ) , he entitled My Bicycle and Other Friends .
Another Californian writer , poet William Saroyan , described the bicycle as " the noblest invention of mankind " - a sentiment echoed by our own Iris Murdoch who , in the early 60s , composed a line that has only gathered resonance since :
" The bicycle is the most civilised conveyance known to man .
Other forms of transport grow daily more nightmarish .
Only the bicycle remains pure in heart . "
It is not that writers necessarily have a particular affinity for the bicycle , but simply that they voice for us all the pleasure , and meaning , of cycling .
For me , just the short , 15 - minute ride to work is a twice - daily spirit - lifting treat that helps me stay fit and healthy and , more importantly , keeps me sane .
And that despite having to negotiate my way through other people 's " more nightmarish " forms of transport : the buses , cars , cabs and motorbikes that clog the sclerotic streets of our cities like chunks of cholesterol plaque .
And that is the extraordinary thing about the bicycle .
There may be little mystery as to why we feel so warmly about our bikes , but what is remarkable is the way cycling has spanned the industrial revolution and survived where so many technologies have been overtaken and fallen by the wayside .
The bike just rolls on .
Onwards and upwards , in fact .
The object that first inspired the early Modernists as a symbol of a new harmony between mankind and machine , that seemed to bring into being a new social mobility and equality of the sexes when it first arrived in the 1890s , has found fresh purpose and new relevance in the 21st - century as people begin to look towards a post - carbon economy .
The wheel has turned .
The bicycle , you might say , has come full circle , re-synchronised with the spirit of the age .
If you are of an optimistic frame of mind - and cyclists tend to be ( it 's all the endorphins running around their system ) - you might feel that the best is yet to come .
Increasingly , people directing public policy have seen the light , that cycling solves so many problems at once : it gives you your daily dose of exercise without even having to shell out for that gym membership ; it 's cheap , accessible and democratic - almost everyone can cycle and own a bike .
The bike is also superbly practical and convenient : cyclists know their journey times around cities to the nearest minute , more or less .
And it civilises , as Iris says , in a multitude of ways .
It gets us out of our polluting , potentially lethal vehicles , hermetically sealed from social interaction .
And it helps turn blighted inner-city streets from sinister rat-runs for cars back into pleasant boulevards with pavement cafes , safely traffic - free for pedestrians .
Utopian ?
It would be , if it did n't already exist in many cities of northern Europe - in the Netherlands , Germany and Denmark , where in many places more journeys are made by bike than by car .
But , in the weird dialectic of progress , what was once the greatest cycling nation on earth , China , is busy stripping out bike lanes to make way for more cars , now seen , in every sense , as the vehicle of prosperity .
That familiar cycle - of growing congestion and a public health crisis caused by vehicle emissions - seems destined to repeat itself on an epic scale .
And the greatest irony of all : that the vast productive capacity of China 's bike manufacturing industry is virtually all for export .
They make , we ride .
But we can hope that what goes around will come around , as it has for us .
You only have to swing your leg over your bike and get rolling , in that gorgeously rhythmic cadence of pedalling , to feel better .
About the world , about yourself , even about the person on the bike in front .
The hum of tyre on tarmac , the gentle whirr of the chain running over ring and sprocket , the roar of the wind in your ears .
As the road unfurls in front of you , you start to unwind .
And then you might feel that , after all , we might get there in the end .
Two - wheel stats
If you cycle regularly , you can expect to be as fit as an average person 10 years younger .
Almost half the population lives within one mile of a National Cycle Network route , which is longer than the UK 's motorway system .
On a bicycle , you can travel up to 1,037 km on the energy equivalent of a litre of petrol .
Cyclists absorb lower levels of pollutants from traffic fumes than car drivers .
On average , cyclists live two years longer than non-cyclists .
" When I see an adult on a bicycle , I no longer despair for the human race . "

Very nice project page at Google App Engine .
Already has a FAQ , articles , blog , forums , example applications , nice tutorial , and a nice touch is how to work with Django .
Some hard chargers are already posting questions to the forum .
Python only .
More languages will follow .
As you are uploading clear text into the engine there 's no hiding from mother Google .
You are n't getting root .
Applications run in a sandbox , which is a secure environment that provides limited access to the underlying operating system .
These limitations allow App Engine to distribute web requests for the application across multiple servers , and start and stop servers to meet traffic demands .
- An application can only access other computers on the Internet through the provided URL fetch and email services and APIs .
Other computers can only connect to the application by making HTTP ( or HTTPS ) requests on the standard ports .
- An application cannot write to the file system .
An app can read files , but only files uploaded with the application code .
The app must use the App Engine datastore for all data that persists between requests .
- Application code only runs in response to a web request , and must return response data within a few seconds .
A request handler cannot spawn a sub-process or execute code after the response has been sent .
The data access trend continues with the RDBMS being dissed infavor of a properties type interface .
- The datastore is not like a traditional relational database .
Data objects , or " entities , " have a kind and a set of properties .
Queries can retrieve entities of a given kind filtered and sorted by the values of the properties .
Property values can be of any of the supported property value types .
- The datastore uses optimistic locking for concurrency control .
An update of a entity occurs in a transaction that is retried a fixed number of times if other processes are trying to update the same entity simultaneously .
- They have some notion of transaction :
The datastore implements transactions across its distributed network using " entity groups . "
A transaction manipulates entities within a single group .
Entities of the same group are stored together for efficient execution of transactions .
Your application can assign entities to groups when the entities are created .
You 've got mail : Applications can also send email messages using App Engine 's mail service .
The mail service also uses Google infrastructure to send email messages .
If you 've ever been marked a spammer because you send a little email , this is actually a nice feature .
It 's mostly free for now : 500 MB of storage , up to 5 million page views a month , and 10 GB bandwidth per day .
Additional resources will be available for $ $ $ .
Limits exist on various features .
If a request takes too long it 's killed .
You can only get 1,000 results at a time .
That sort of thing .
Pretty reasonable .
Developers must download a Windows , Mac OS X or Linux SDK .
Python 2.5 is required .
The SDK includes a web server application that simulates the App Engine environment .
So this in the RoR and GWT type mold where you have a nice local development environment that emulates what happens in the deployment environment .
Google App Engine supports any framework written in pure Python that speaks CGI ( and any WSGI - compliant framework using a CGI adaptor ) , including Django , CherryPy , Pylons , and web.py .
You can bundle a framework of your choosing with your application code by copying its code into your application directory .
Google has their own framework called webapp .
Nice MS style naming .
Here 's a hello world application using webapp :
import wsgiref.
handlers
from google.appengine.ext import webapp
class MainPage( webapp.RequestHandler ) :
def get ( self ) :
self.response.headers [' Content - Type ' ] = ' text / plain '
self.response.out.write(' Hello , webapp World ! ')
def main ( ) :
application = webapp .
WSGIApplication (
[ ('/' , MainPage ) ] ,
debug=True )
wsgiref.handlers.CGIHandler( ).run( application )
if __name__ == " __main__ " :
main ( )
This code defines one request handler , MainPage , mapped to the root URL (/ ) .
When webapp receives an HTTP GET request to the URL / , it instantiates the MainPage class and calls the instance 's get method .
Inside the method , information about the request is available using self .
request .
Typically , the method sets properties on self .
response to prepare the response , then exits .
webapp sends a response based on the final state of the MainPage instance .
The application itself is represented by a webapp .
WSGIApplication instance .
The parameter debug=true passed to its constructor tells webapp to print stack traces to the browser output if a handler encounters an error or raises an uncaught exception .
You may wish to remove this option from the final version of your application .
Google is standardizing components on their infrastructure .
Take the login interface .
When your application is running on App Engine , users will be directed to the Google Accounts sign - in page , then redirected back to your application after successfully signing in or creating an account .
Forms looks normal .
Lots of embedded html .
Take a look .
Python like Perl has a nice bulk string handling syntax so this style is n't as fugly as it would be in C++ or Java .
Database access is built around Data Models : A model describes a kind of entity , including the types and configuration for its properties .
Here 's a taste :
Example of creation :
from google.appengine.ext import db
from google.appengine.api import users
class Pet ( db. Model ) :
name = db. StringProperty ( required =True )
type = db. StringProperty ( required =True , choices=set ( " cat " , " dog " , " bird " ) )
birthdate = db.DateProperty ( )
weight_in_pounds = db. IntegerProperty ( )
spayed_or_neutered = db.BooleanProperty ( )
owner = db. UserProperty ( )
pet = Pet ( name = " Fluffy " ,
type=" cat " ,
owner=users.get_current_user ( ) )
pet.weight_in_pounds = 24
pet.put ()
Example of get , modify , save :
if users.get_current_user ( ) :
user_pets = db. GqlQuery ( " SELECT * FROM Pet WHERE pet.owner = :1 " ,
users.get_current_user ( ) )
for pet in user_pets :
pet.spayed_or_neutered = True
db.put(user_pets )
Looks like your normal overly complex data access .
Me , I appreciate the simplicity of a string based property interface .
You can use Django 's HTML Template system .
Static files are served using automated mapping mechanism .
You do n't get local disk store for your css , flash , and js files .
Applications are loaded using a command line tool : appcfg.py update helloworld / .
Applications are accessed like : http://application-id.appspot.com.
You get your domain name .
There 's a dashboard that has six graphs that give you a quick visual reference of your system usage : Requests per Second , Errors per Second , Bytes Received per Second , Bytes Sent per Second , Megacycles per Second ( The amount of CPU megacyles your application uses every second ) , Milliseconds Used per Second , Number of Quota Denials per Second .
I have no idea what a megacycle is either .
I think it 's bigger than a pint of beer .
Also I wonder if this is meant to compete with Facebook more than Amazon ?
Developers with a lot of little projects will find AppEngine especially useful , which always leaves open a Adoption Led Market play .

I am not confident in Google App Engine as a hosting solution for any real business ... "
I have n't developed an AppEngine application yet , I 'm just taking a look around their documentation and seeing what stands out for me .
It 's not the much speculated super cluster VM .
AppEngine is solidly grounded in code and structure .
It reminds me a little of the guy who ran a website out of S3 with a splash of Heroku thrown in as a chaser .
The idea is clearly to take advantage of our massive multi-core future by creating a shared nothing infrastructure based firmly on a core set of infinitely scalable database , storage and CPU services .
Do n't forget Google also has a few other services to leverage : email , login , blogs , video , search , ads , metrics , and apps .
A shared nothing request is a simple beast .
By its very nature shared nothing architectures must be composed of services which are themselves already scalable and Google is signing up to supply that scalable infrastructure .
Google has been busy creating a platform of out - of - the - box scalable services to build on .
Now they have their scripting engine to bind it all together .
Everything that could have tied you to a machine is tossed .
No disk access , no threads , no sockets , no root , no system calls , no nothing but service based access .
Services are king because they are easily made scalable by load balancing and other tricks of the trade that are easily turned behind the scenes , without any application awareness or involvement .
Using the CGI interface was not a mistake .
CGI is the perfect metaphor for our brave new app container world : get a request , process the request , die , repeat .
Using AppEngine you have no choice but to write an app that can be splayed across a pointy well sharpened CPU grid .
CGI was devalued because a new process had to be started for every request .
It was too slow , too resource intensive .
Ironic that in the cloud that 's exactly what you want because that 's exactly how you cause yourself fewer problems and buy yourself more flexibility .
The model is pure abstraction .
The implementation is pure pragmatism .
Your application exists in the cloud and is in no way tied to any single machine or cluster of machines .
CPUs run parallel through your application like a swarm of busy bees while wizards safely hidden in a pocket of space - time can bend reality as much as they desire without the muggles taking notice .
Yet the abstraction is implemented in a very specific dynamic language that they already have experience with and have confidence they can make work .
It 's a pretty smart approach .
No surprise I guess .
One might ask : is LAMP dead ?
Certainly not in the way Microsoft was hoping .
AppEngine is so much easier to use than the AWS environment of EC2 , S3 , SQS , and SDB .
Creating an app in AWS takes real expertise .
That 's why I made the comparison of AppEngine to Heroku .
Heroku is a load and go approach for RoR whereas AppEngine uses Python .
You basically make a Python app using services and it scales .
Simple .
So simple you can't do much beyond making a web app .
Nobody is going to make a super scalable transcoding service out of AppEngine .
You simply can't load the needed software because you do n't have your own servers .
This is where Amazon wins big .
But AppEngine does hit a sweet spot in the market : website builders who might have previously went with LAMP .
What is n't scalable about AppEngine is the scalability of the complexity of the applications you can build .
It 's a simple request response system .
I did n't notice a cron service , for example .
Since you can't write your own services a cron service would give you an opportunity to get a little CPU time of your own to do work .
To extend this notion a bit what I would like to see as an event driven state machine service that could drive web services .
If email needs to be sent every hour , for example , who will invoke your service every hour so you can get the CPU to send the email ?
If you have a long running seven step asynchronous event driven algorithm to follow , how will you get the CPU to implement the steps ?
This may be Google 's intent .
Or somewhere in the development cycle we may get more features of this sort .
But for now it 's a serious weakness .
Here 's are a quick tour of a few interesting points .
Please note I 'm copying large chunks of their documentation in this post as that seems the quickest way to the finish line ...
Coburn Omnibus planned for July
Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) is planning a “ Coburn Omnibus ” for July that would wrap most if not all of the bills held by Sen.
Tom Coburn ( R - Okla . ) into one large measure to be voted on by the Senate , according to a Coburn aide and two Democratic leadership staffers .
Coburn is blocking roughly a hundred bills that are generally non-controversial or have broad support .
By placing a hold , Coburn prevents the bills from passing quickly through the Senate under a unanimous consent request .
With floor time at such a premium , Reid would have trouble bringing up each bill for an individual debate and vote .
But in a stroke of legislative creativity that may have no precedent , Reid could lump all of the bills into one package and bring up the Coburn Omnibus for a single vote .
Coburn can still object , but the broad popularity of the bills means that there would likely be more than enough support for veto - proof passage .
Julian Zelizer , a professor of the history of public affairs at Princeton University ’s Woodrow Wilson School , said that the move is most unusual when viewed in historical context .
“ I have n’t heard of something like this , ” he said .
There are very few moving vehicles left in the Senate this session , and seats on those rides are pricey .
Two Democratic aides said that the details of which specific Coburn bills would be lumped into the package were still being debated .
One leadership aide said that even some semi-controversial bills not uniquely associated with Coburn , such as the media shield law , could become part of it .
UPDATE ( 3:22 ) : A Democratic aide says that " most if not all " probably overstates the portion of the roughly one hundred bills that 'll make it into the Coburn Omnibus .
" Some , " said the aide , is a better way to phrase it at this point .
As for timing , aides say look for it in late July .

A close binary system of two candidate black holes in the quasar OJ 287 has shown Einstein some physics love .
A central black hole , with a mass equal to 18 billion times that of the Sun , is orbited by a smaller one , and the interaction of the system with its surroundings produces brightness changes that allow astronomers to study the evolution of the orbit .
This evolution is dominated by one of the most intriguing predictions of Einstein 's General Theory of Relativity : the emission of gravitational waves .
Astronomers believe that very massive black holes lurk at the centers of most galaxies but , as in the case of our own Galaxy , they often remain silent and are difficult to detect .
In other cases where the black holes are surrounded by disks of material that fall onto them ( accretion disks ) , the infalling material is heated and emits huge quantities of radiation : the active nucleus of a galaxy can appear , then , as a quasar .
One such quasar is OJ 287 , the center of a galaxy 3.5 billion light - years away in the constellation of Cancer .
This object exhibits the peculiarity of sending quasi- periodic pulses of energy every twelve years with two outburst peaks per interval .
A study in Nature confirms one of the suspected interpretations for this behavior : this quasar is powered by a binary black hole .
The very massive black hole is surrounded by an accretion disk , the classical quasar display , but a second , much lighter black hole orbits the very massive black hole and blasts into the accretion disk twice per orbit : this generates the quasi-periodic pulses .
The research group , led by Dr. Mauri Valtonen of University of Turku , Finland , has analyzed the behavior of this system .
Timing the brightness changes over many years , they have been able to plot the orbit of the small black hole and this provides a precise way to measure the big hole : 18 billion solar masses .
They have also followed the evolution of the orbit and checked that its size and orientation change accordingly to the predictions of Einstein 's General Theory of Relativity .
Previous tests of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity have been carried out in weak gravitational fields but this study clearly shows an example of gravitational waves at work , one of the most exotic predictions of Einstein 's theory .
Effectively , the binary black hole orbit shrinks and evolves in a way that can only be explained if it is losing huge quantities of energy in the form of gravitational radiation .
The observations leading to this discovery have been done thanks to the joint collaboration of a number of observatories at Japan , China , Turkey , Greece , Finland , Poland , Great Britain and Spain .
More than 25 astronomers from 10 countries took part in the campaign .
Two points deserve a special mention : first , that all the telescopes involved are considered " small " apertures ( only two of them were close to 2.5 m in diameter ) , and second , that a number of key participants were amateur astronomers who operate their own telescopes .
Calar
Alto observatory participated in the observational campaigns with its 2.2 m telescope , equipped with the instrument CAFOS , to perform photometric and polarimetric observations .
The polarimetric data were crucial to confirm the conclusions of the study , as stated in the paper published in Nature , and only two of the participant observatories provided this kind of data .
The model of the binary black hole developed by Valtonen and collaborators predicts a new outburst of OJ 287 quasar in 2016 .
No doubt many telescopes will be looking to Cancer around the predicted dates of that year .

Unlike in 1981 , when Israel destroyed Iraq ’s nuclear reactor at Osirak , there is no single target .
A sustained bombing campaign would end up killing many civilians and still might not cripple Iran ’s nuclear program .
Tehran also has many frightening ways to retaliate .
And even Arab states who fear Iran shudder at the thought of America , or its ally Israel , bombing another Muslim country and the backlash that that could provoke .
Mr. Olmert may be trying to divert attention from his political troubles .
Still , there is no denying a growing and understandable sense of urgency in Israel , which Iran ’s president has threatened with elimination .
A recent report by United Nations inspectors on Iran ’s nuclear progress , and worrisome links to military programs , has only fanned those fears .
Javier Solana , the European Union ’s foreign policy chief , is scheduled to visit Tehran later this month to discuss , in more detail , an incentives package first offered in 2006 by the United States and other major powers .
It is likely to fall far short  both in incentives and punishments  of what is needed to get Tehran ’s attention .
There is no indication it will contain tougher sanctions  including a broader ban on doing business with Iranian banks and bans on arms sales and new investments .
It also needs a stronger commitment from Washington to lift sanctions and to fully engage Iran if it abandons its nuclear efforts .
The United States is the only major power not sending a diplomat with Mr. Solana .
Senators Barack Obama and John McCain disagree on holding direct talks with Iran ( Mr. Obama would ; Mr. McCain would not ) .
But last week , both endorsed enhanced sanctions , including limiting gasoline exports to Iran .
That is an idea well worth exploring .
Iran relies on a half - dozen companies for 40 percent of its gasoline imports .
The United Nations Security Council is unlikely to authorize a squeeze , but quiet American and European appeals might persuade some companies to slow deliveries , and it would grab Tehran ’s attention .

The Incredible Shrinking Evangelical
Ah , spring .
Fresh flowers , fresh leaves , fresh leases on life ... and , in step with a tradition dating back to around 2004 -- the year when Christian " values voters " reportedly seized our fragile nation 's helm -- there 's also a fresh crop of new books unabashedly bashing evangelicals .
Leading the pack is " The Family : The Secret Fundamentalism at the Heart of American Power , " which is yet another entry in the behind - the - scenes , just - like - Skull - and - Bones Christian conspiracy genre .
Luckily for yawning readers , there 's also a newer , cuter , echoes - of - Jon -Stewart form of Christian - bashing on the 2008 market , which involves shelving the drama , loading up on the irony , going undercover and making merciless fun of the poor religious saps .
In early May , self - affirmed tolerant and open person Matt Taibbi ( who , in a recent Rolling Stone article , ridicules " nerdy " evangelicals wearing " the gayest " shirts as " a slow - moving hulk of confused , shipwrecked masculinity , flailing for an Answer " ) comes out with " The Great Derangement , " his own book on the topic .
Daniel Radosh , meanwhile , offers a kinder , gentler evangelical skewering -- but a skewering nonetheless -- in his new book on Christian popular culture , " Rapture Ready . "
The funny thing about all of this is , of course , that it 's not 2004 anymore .
And as any barely alert political observer can tell you , evangelicals are certainly not running the show .
They 're ... well ... where are they , anyway ?
Seriously , where 'd all those hard - right , Republican evangelicals go ?
The supposed storyline is a familiar one : Religious fundamentalists , a.k.a. " values voters , " catapulted Bush into office .
( John Kerry 's " I voted for it before I voted against it , " in this questionable - at - best narrative , had nothing to do with it . )
In the wake of the Kerry disaster , Democrats scrambled to appear more religious .
As Austin Dacey recently pointed out in USA Today , " The Democratic Party concluded that because values voters are religious , the way to Washington must lie on the road to Damascus .
Since then , it has been closing the God gap that is thought to stand between it and the White House . "
As it turns out , Christians , including evangelicals , are n't as monolithic as everybody thought .
The rising religious left has enthusiastically agitated for the environment , a more " fair " budget , and for other " social justice " issues .
More importantly , the religious right , made up largely of those dastardly evangelicals , just is n't playing that large of a role in Road to the White House 2008 .
Sure , we see all three presidential candidates offering lip service to faith .
But that 's an occasional outlier among the greater themes -- the economy , health care , Iraq - - of the 2008 White House race .
And sure , there was that feverish spurt of support for Mike Huckabee .
But we all know how that worked out .
John McCain , the ostensible GOP ( or , as the latest crop of books would likely have it , " God 's Old Party " ) nominee , is famed for being tight - lipped about his religious beliefs , and he frequently annoys evangelical leaders by being notoriously tight - lipped on other issues as well .
This week , the LA Times reported that Tony Perkins , the president of the Family Research Council , said that the nation 's values voters " are posing a very different question than they did four years ago :
What are we going to do in November ?
' The question this time four years ago , ' Perkins said , ' was : ' What are we going to do to help Bush win ? ' "
Smell that shift in the zeitgeist ?
If anything , it 's towards the material rather than the ethereal .
On April 20 , Slate writer Mickey Kaus offered a fascinating and honest dissertation on the philosophical roots of Obama 's " yokels clinging to their religion " remarks , along with their larger implications for modern politics .
" But of course it was a Marxist thing to say , " Kaus wrote , " was n't it ?
If Democrats had delivered on the economy , Obama suggests , all those GOP cultural " wedge " issues would lose traction .
This idea -- that the economy trumps culture - - is n't new .
It 's ' materialism . ' "
And it may be on the rise .
While evangelicals loom large in the popular imagination , they 've shrunk on the map of reality , particularly in context of the current campaign .
Our presidential candidates , particularly Obama and Clinton , whisk past pressing cultural problems like disintegrating families , unwed mothers , and abortion with startlingly sanitized economic arguments .
Even the Wall Street Journal editorial page , long lambasted by liberals for its " bias , " has picked up one of America 's more prominent modern materialists as a regular columnist : Thomas Frank , author of " What 's the Matter with Kansas ? "
Frank , interestingly , also offers a glowing blurb for the most conspiracy - minded of the latest batch of Christian - bashing books : " Of all the important studies of the American right , ' The Family ' is undoubtedly the most eloquent .
It is also quite possibly the most terrifying . "
Terrifying ?
For all of the hullabaloo about radical right - wing evangelical power , they 're certainly acting fairly scattered , and they 're certainly not making a very big impact on the domestic front as of late .
40 % of births in America are out of wedlock .
Gay marriage thrives in Massachusetts .
Evolution is still taught in schools , and , yes , " Gossip Girl " is still on the air .
Secular America seems to be safe , sound , and thriving .
What , then , is so scary about evangelicals ?
Why the fixation , particularly when the real shift in the political debate seems to be toward secular materialism ?
The most common complaint about born - again Christians , often heard from left - wing quarters , is that the God - boggled can't " learn to be rational " when it comes to serious policy debates .
Science and fact , they argue , are all left behind once one enters the hard - core Christian realm .
Meaningful policy debate is impossible .
Irrationality , prejudice , and apocalyptic fatalism rule the day .
This is all highly ironic , of course , given that materialism , in its essence , often misses obvious facts -- particularly when it comes to connections between cultural realities and economic , material results .
Perhaps even more to the point , many modern secular crusades find followers scoffing at facts and , yes , disengaging from science .
Two prominent examples include abortion ( an article on fetal pain in the New York Times , for instance , caused an uproar in certain circles , as have current pending laws requiring ultrasounds before abortions ) and the environment .
Are there nutty fundamentalists out there ?
Sure .
Are hard - core evangelical events and culture sometimes goofy and cringe - worthy ?
Certainly .
Are there some wacky political ideas that can grow out of religious fundamentalism ?
You bet .
But " clinging " can happen on both sides of the aisle .
In both the sacred and secular realms , zealots can come across information they do n't want to hear -- and on both sides , there 's the capacity to ignore that information in favor of a certain belief system .
And in this election , contrary to the tired old narrative , that capacity might be more likely to come from the fans of Marx and Engels than the fans of Matthew , Mark , Luke and John .
Cops Missed Bodies in Double Murder Case First responder in Entwistle double murder admits he did not see dead bodies .
June 12 , 2008  -- When Sgt. Michael Sutton of the Hopkinton Mass. , Police department entered the home at 6 Cubs Path on the cold , wintry night of Jan. 21 , 2006 , the lights were on , classical music played in the baby 's room and the dog was barking .
All signs of life .
But on the witness stand today , Sutton admitted that what he failed to see that night were the two dead bodies lying under a comforter on the four - poster bed in the master bedroom .
Sutton was testifying in the double - murder trial of 29 - year - old Neil Entwistle , who is accused of killing his wife , 27 - year - old Rachel Entwistle and 9 - month - old baby , Lillian , before fleeing to his native England .
Sutton described being called to the house by a " distressed " and " anxious " friend of Rachel Entwistle 's , Joanna Gately , who said the couple had n't shown up for a dinner engagement .
Sutton said he performed a " well - being " check on the house and " nothing looked out of the ordinary . "
There were some bills on a table in the kitchen , and a digital camera left out showed pictures taken just a few days before , an upstairs bathtub was still half full " as if they had been going to give the baby a bath , " said Sutton .
When Sutton returned to the house the next morning , something had changed .
" I noticed a slight odor ... we basically followed the odor upstairs , " said Sutton .
In the master bedroom , Sutton walked around to the head of the bed and lifted the comforter up .
" I observed a small baby 's face , eyes and a nose .
I looked to the right of the baby 's face and saw a woman 's face , " said Sutton .
During Sutton 's testimony , Neil Entwistle 's mother , Yvonne , left the courtroom .
His father , Cliff , and brother , Russell , remained seated behind him .
Sgt. Mary Ritchie of State Police Crime Scene Services described in excruciating detail the wounds she found on the victims ' bodies .
On Lillian , Ritchie noticed " a puncture to the left chest area .
... " It appeared to be a darkened color , almost like soot . "
As the investigators gently unzipped the pajamas , " we noticed the puncture … and there was a slight pooling of blood on the external part of the sleeper . "
There was also some " discoloration that appeared to be bruising " on Lillian 's face , she testified .
" When investigators rolled Rachel onto her back they noticed " a puncture wound to her left breast . "
The medical examiner later determined that Rachel had died of a gunshot wound to the head .
The alleged murder weapon was also brought out in court today -- a .22 caliber Colt revolver .
Ritchie donned blue latex gloves to handle the weapon as she testified that there were 10 fingerprints found on the gun , but they " could n't be matched because of quality or quantity . "
Prosecutors contend that Entwistle killed his wife and daughter because he was unhappy with his sex life and distraught over his mounting debts .
Prosecutors allege that Entwistle stole his father - in - law's .22 caliber handgun to commit the murders and then drove back down to his in - laws house , Joseph and Priscilla Matterrazo 's home , in Carver , Mass . , to return the gun before fleeing the country .
But Entwistle has maintained that he had a happy marriage , and he has no idea who could have killed his family .
In court testimony Tuesday , Pamela Jackson , who acts as a " Welcome Lady " for the town of Hopkinton , described how she met the couple just days after they moved into their Hopkinton home .
Jackson testified that she visited the couple in their " dream house " on a quiet cul - de-sac .
Jackson said the couple she met seemed to be " loving " and " adorable , " and that Neil Entwistle seemed to dote on his daughter , Lillian .
More forensic evidence is expected to be introduced as the trial continues .

When the weak act strong …
June 4 , 2008 by humboldtsquid
by the squid
Congratulations to Senator Obama on sealing the Democratic nomination , he can finally exhale .
However , he now needs to make the most important decision of his entire campaign – selecting a Vice President .
Sun
Tzu implored strategists :
When you are weak , act strong , when you are strong , act weak .
Senator Obama is now strong , but he has a very , very soft underbelly : experience .
This is not said to undermine his historic win , as Obama has just beaten his most difficult rival .
However , it is important to remember what happened when Obama ran for his Senate seat in Illinois .
As a state legislator , he ran against Republican incumbent Jack Ryan , who at the time was married to Jerry Ryan of Star Trek fame .
During the campaign , the Ryans went through a horrible divorce where allegations of sex club infidelity torpedoed his campaign .
After Ryan ended his campaign , Alan Keyes was asked to run against Obama .
Keyes , the only notable Black Republican , lived in Washington DC at the time but rented an apartment in Illinois , to comply with the residency requirement , with the vow to move to Illinois if he won .
The Republicans tossed that seat into the bonfire .
They gave up and Obama won easily .
Fast forward four years , and Obama beats Clinton .
This victory is genuinely huge and shows the Obama can run an effective campaign , but he still has a weakness in the area of leadership experience .
So at this point , to shore up that side of his credentials as a candidate , he needs to have a Vice President who needs no introduction , one who can easily harden Obama ’s soft under belly .
To broaden his appeal and to possibly unify the country , Senator Obama ought to consider looking across the aisle to select a fiscal or military hawk , a person who is fiscally prudent and has real foreign policy clout .
I believe Senator Obama needs to have former Secretary of State Colin Powell on his short list of possible candidates for Vice President .
Powell is more patriot than politician and he needs no introduction to the American people .
Foreign leaders know Mr. Powell and his capabilities .
He knows government inside and out .
He is “ Republican ” in a limited sense and he even believes in affirmative action .
With Mr. Powell , no one speaks of his race but rather of his integrity .
Another reason Colin Powell would be a great choice is because Senator McCain can not use him .
A McCain / Powell ticket would be a weak ticket because both men have too much military experience and this would help alienate those who have not served .
Similarly , if Senator Obama selects a liberal as his running mate , it will be a disaster and Obama will lose the South , the Mid-West and the general election .
Then there is Hillary Clinton , who is too divisive a person to have an a running mate and beyond that , she comes with angry meddling Bill .
Senator Obama would have to spend much of his time defending Bill ’s angry ramblings much like he had to defend , then repudiate , his former pastor ’s rantings .
If the Hillary supporters actually do vote for McCain out of anger , which I believe they will , this is another reason to select a solid candidate for Vice President that can broaden Senator Obama ’s base .
So , congratulations to Senator Obama ; Do n’t mess it up !

WASHINGTON — Sen. Patrick Leahy chastised Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff Wednesday for his agency ’s plan to build a permanent immigration checkpoint in central Vermont , wryly exclaiming that Chertoff should just “ federalize Vermont . ”
The interaction comes as the Bush administration is proposing a $ 4 million project to build fixed facilities within 100 miles of the Canadian border to conduct random vehicle checks for illegal immigrants , drugs and weapons , according to Leahy .
“ So what you ’re saying is in a little state like mine everyone should be stopped going down that interstate , no matter whether they ’re going to visit a sick relative at the VA hospital ? ”
Leahy prodded Chertoff in a Judiciary Committee hearing .
“ We ’re all sort of presumed guilty until proven innocent , ” the Vermont Democrat added .
“ It sounds like Big Brother gone awry . ”
Chertoff said , “ Here ’s the bottom line .
Having checkpoints make sense . ”
He said drug dealers and child molesters have been captured at similar checkpoints .
A similar , though temporary , checkpoint was maintained for 18 months along I -91 near Hartford , Vt. , before closing in May 2005 , according to Leahy .
But he says it ’s an inconvenience for Vermonters miles away from the border they may never cross .
Leahy , for instance , was stopped at a different checkpoint in New York and told to get out his car , he recalled at a separate hearing last month .
When he asked the Border Patrol agent under whose authority he was working , the agent pointed to his gun .
“ That ’s all the authority I need , ” the agent said , according to Leahy .
Interior checkpoints are used mostly in the south as a second layer of security to apprehend terrorists , illegal immigrants and drug smugglers who evaded detection at the point of entry .
But there is debate about the effectiveness of permanent facilities versus tactical checkpoints , which are moved frequently .
“ We have dozens and dozens of roads you can take from the Canadian border to get down to either New York or Massachusetts from Canada , ” Leahy said Wednesday , adding dryly , “ Why do n’t you just put roadblocks on every one of them and federalize Vermont ? ”
Leahy then leaned into his microphone and whispered conspiratorially : “ We ’ve had Canadians come up to my house in Vermont .
Some of them are related to my wife . ”
Chertoff responded , “ That ’s great .
But I ’m not sure what your point is , Mr. Chairman . ”
But by then Leahy was done jesting with Chertoff .
“ I think you understand my point , ” Leahy said .

What is the nature of this organization of people calling themselves the “ government ” ?
Is it based in consent , as their own founding documents claim ?
Or are they actually a group of men and women doing business by the threat of violence ?
The latter is what most of the people I associate with believe , but which is the truth ?
Earlier this year , I ventured into a similar area when I questioned the government people over a parking ticket .
You can read parts one and two of that here .
( Eventually , I will write a part three when time permits ! )
So , now we begin a new saga into the world of “ property taxes ” .
If you ’re like me , paying property taxes is a painful experience .
You know that the government people are going to waste your money and that they will have little to no accountability for what they choose to do with it .
Not to mention that a huge chunk of it goes to the government indoctrination camps where it is inevitably used to dumb down young people and brainwash them into the belief that the state is great .
Alas , you have to pay it … or else .
Or , do you ?
Did you ever ask yourself how you became obligated to pay property tax bills in the first place ?
Do you ever remember signing a contract binding you to that obligation ?
When the people calling themselves the “ CITY OF KEENE ” recently sent me “ 2008 PRELIMINARY PROPERTY TAX BILL ” I decided it was time to get some answers to the questions I have .
In fact , by their own rules ( rules which they agreed to follow and I have not ) when one is presented with a bill , one may demand to see the original contract that created the obligation in the first place .
You might be saying to yourself , “ Ian , you know they do n’t follow their own rules . ” , and you would be right .
However asking these questions and posting their responses publicly will shine more light on their dishonorable activities , perhaps persuading others that now is the time for noncooperation with their dictates .
With that in mind , I will post the full text of the “ NOTICE OF DISCUSSION ” that I sent in response to receiving their “ TAX BILL ” , followed by the tax collector ’s response , and my reply I sent to her this morning .
First , here ’s a link to a scan of the “ 2008 PRELIMINARY PROPERTY TAX BILL ” .
Look carefully at it and you ’ll notice that curiously , there are no dollar signs anywhere to be found .
Honest mistake , you say ?
From what I understand , Keene is not the only place where property tax bills have no dollar signs .
Here ’s another interesting point .
Take a look at the water bill .
It looks like it was designed on similar software and it has dollar signs all over it .
Provided they can actually prove I ’m obligated to pay this bill , I would like to know what it is that they would like 2,651.21 of !
Bananas ?
Zimbabwe dollars ?
Gold bars ?
So , the idea here is to clarify the nature of the bill they have sent me .
Here is the text of the “ NOTICE OF DISCUSSION ” that I had notarized and hand delivered to them on June 30 , 2008 in response to their bill .
You can also see scans of the notarized version here : page1 and page2 .

CITY OF KEENE
REVENUE COLLECTOR
3 Washington St .
Keene , NH 03431 To Whom it May Concern , I am writing in acknowledgement of the receipt of a “ 2008 PRELIMINARY PROPERTY TAX BILL ” for PROPERTY ID XXXXXX , commonly known as XXXXXXXX , issued on the 14th of May 2008 , demanding the amount of “ 2,651.21 ” .
Allow me to introduce myself .

While it took the police bureaucracy over a month and a half to respond to my parking ticket discussion , to the credit of the tax collector , Ms. Mary Alther , she had her response out the door within a couple of days .
Unfortunately , that ’s about the only good thing I can say about her letter which barely qualifies as a response .
In fact I only got a responsive answer to one of my questions and it was not in the way I had required .
In addition , the check I sent them very clearly specifies that its deposit was subject to the terms described in my “ NOTICE OF DISCUSSION ” .
Here ’s a scan of the memo section of my check as proof .
Even though she did not provide the evidence and answers required to deposit the check , they deposited the check anyway .
Here ’s a scan of the letter she sent me , and here ’s the text :
July 2,2008 Dear Mr. Bernard :
We are in receipt of your check number 150 , dated June 30 , 2008 in the amount of $ 2,651.21 issued by you in payment of the 2008 Preliminary Property Tax Bill for real estate located at XXXXXXXXX .
Our records indicate that you are the owner of the property .
The City of Keene acts with statutory authority granted to it by the New Hampshire legislature .
That authority includes the issuance of real property tax bills and the acceptance of payments .
Accordingly , your payment will be deposited and credited against that tax obligation for the property .
Thank you for your payment .
Sincerely ,
Mary Alther
Tax Collector
While my first notice I sent was addressed “ to whom it may concern ” , at this point , having identified the head bureaucrat , I address my next “ NOTICE OF DISCUSSION ” to Ms. Alther .
I sent this response this morning via e-mail :
Hello Mary ,
In the interests of saving time and postage , I thought we should continue our discussion via e-mail .
Here is my response to your recent letter : Dear Ms. Alther , I do not know you , but from what I can tell from your involvement with hospice , you ’re probably a very nice person .
Therefore I am sorry that you have to deal with this matter .
Let it be known that I as a
sovereign seek only harmony with others , I reserve all rights , and do not intend conflict with you or the “ CITY OF KEENE ” .
It is to that end of harmony and peace that I must question the bills that your
agency ( the “ CITY OF KEENE ” ) is sending to people .
You recently wrote me , presumably in response to the original notarized letter I hand - delivered on June 30 , 2008 .
Your letter mentions the term “ payment ” four times , yet I never once used it in my original notice .
I would like to discharge this matter but in order to properly do that , I require certain evidence and information .
I have not yet received the required evidence and you have yet to give responsive answers to the super majority of my questions .
It is my understanding that your government is founded in consent .
If I ’ve misunderstood this and you would like to claim that I am a subject of your government , please clarify .
In fact , if you see that
I have misunderstood anything in this notice , please respond with clarification .
Let it be known that as a sovereign I do not consent to be bound by your statutes and regulations .
It is my understanding
however that you , Ms. Alther , have sworn to be bound by the rules of your government .
So , by your own rules you have presented BERNARD IAN with what you are calling a “ PROPERTY TAX BILL ” .
I responded with my original notice , cut a check for $ 2,651.21 in USD , and stipulated that you may deposit the check and discharge this matter in full when you provide to me the following : · Evidence of the valid , original instrument with my signature binding BERNARD IAN and / or his agent ( s ) to the obligation to your “ PROPERTY TAX ” .
· Considering I can not find evidence on the “ TAX BILL ” showing you are demanding US Dollars ( USD ) , define how one would properly satisfy your demand of “ 2,651.21 ” .
It is my understanding that by your own rules you must “ exhibit the instrument ” upon demand ( my original notice should be considered a demand ) in order to be able to receive payment .
Otherwise , you and the “ CITY OF KEENE ” will be in dishonor and this matter will be discharged .
As I specified in my original notice , you have until no later than August 15th , 2008 to provide the required evidence and
answers .
At that point , on the principle of estoppel by acquiescence I shall assume that there is no contractual authority for your agency to make this demand and that BERNARD IAN and / or his agent is not obligated to any CITY OF KEENE “ TAX BILL ” until a meeting of the minds is reached , and a contract signed .
In my original notice I also asked several questions .
While it appears from your letter that you did answer number six ( now # 5 below ) responsively , you did not answer it in the enumerated way I required .
Therefore I will rephrase my questions , and add a few more in response
to your letter .
Answer the following questions responsively .
Keep your answers appropriately enumerated to the questions : 1 . Factually , what are the “ CITY OF KEENE ” and the “ STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE ” ?
2 . Do the group of men and women calling themselves the “ CITY OF KEENE ” have “ authority ” over me , a sovereign ?
If so , what are the origins of and how did you as a member of that group , receive this “ authority ” ?
3 . Is your government a voluntary association of consenting individuals ?
4 . Do you believe you have the right to aggress against those peaceful sovereigns who do not consent to your government ?
5 . Who owns the property commonly known as XXXXXXXXXXXX ?
6 . You stated in your letter , “ The City of Keene acts with statutory authority granted to it by the New Hampshire legislature . ”
Factually , what is “ statutory authority ” ?
How did the people calling themselves the legislature get it to grant in the first place ?
7 . You also stated , “ payment will be deposited and credited against that tax obligation for the property . ”
Factually , how is it that an inanimate object can become obligated todo anything ?
How was this obligation created ?
8 . I noticed the check I sent has been deposited .
Were you responsible for the decision to deposit my check during this as - of - yet unresolved discussion phase ?
If it is not you who is responsible , do
you know who is ?
It is my understanding that your organization offers certain services , some of which I may be interested in contracting for , but we can discuss that after this initial discussion is resolved .
Note that any correspondence is subject to being posted on the blog at FreeKeene.com I look forward to your response ,

Will the bureaucrats answer simple questions about the nature of their “ bills ” and organization or will they continue to stonewall and obscure ?
Is this a government by the consent of the governed or is it an organized gang of men and women ruling by threat of violence ?

McClellan testifies to House Judiciary Committee David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Friday June 20 , 2008

Print This Email This ( Update : Dem lawmaker calls for impeachment during McClellan hearing - click here )
Former White House spokesman Scott McClellan testified to the House Judiciary Committee about his new revelations on the exposure of CIA agent Valerie Plame and the Bush administration 's " propaganda campaign " that led the country into war .
McClellan was invited to testify after publication of his tell all memoir , What Happened : Inside the Bush White House and Washington 's Culture of Deception .
Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers said the revelations McClellan wrote about " may or may not constitute an impeachable offense . "
The revelation of a pre-war propaganda campaign was " a confirmation that the White House played fast and loose with the truth in a time of war , " Conyers said to open the hearing .
" Depending on how one reads the Constitution , that may or may not be an impeachable offense . "
Conyers , a Michigan Democrat , said Plame 's outing was a direct component of that propaganda effort because it was aimed at discrediting her husband Joe Wilson , a former ambassador who undercut the administration 's argument that Saddam Hussein was attempting to buy nuclear weapons materials from Africa .
Friday 's hearing , he said , was aimed at uncovering possible evidence of obstruction of justice and painting a fuller picture of administration officials involvement " not only in the leak but also in the coverup . "
McClellan said he had no " direct knowledge " of whether President Bush or Vice President Dick Cheney were directly involved in outing Plame , but he criticized the White House for continuing to hide from a full accounting of the scandal , implying a cover - up could be ongoing .
" This White House promised or assured the American people that at some point when this was behind us they would talk publicly about it , " he said .
" And they have refused to .
" And that 's why I think more than any other reason we are here today and the suspicion still remains , " McClellan told the panel .
McClellan said he does not believe Bush knew about or caused the leak .
When asked about Cheney , he replied : " I do not know .
There 's a lot of suspicion there . "
Earlier in the hearing , Rep. Lamar Smith , the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee , gave a prebuttal of McClellan 's testimony , reciting accusations that McClellan was simply trying to make a buck with a critical book and that he was perhaps trying to get back at his former bosses .
He even name - checked controversial right - wing author Ann Coulter 's book How to Talk to a Liberal and tried to tie McClellan to liberal financier George Soros , a favorite bogeyman of conservatives .
McClellan was sworn in before delivering his opening statement , which has been posted at the committee 's Web site .
The former administration official , who began working for George W. Bush during his time as governor of Texas , criticized the campaign - style of governing Bush brought to the White House .
And he said the dirty politics that have become standard in the GOP were exemplified in the reaction to his memoir from conservatives and Bush allies .
" I received plenty of criticism for daring to tell the story as I knew it , " he said .
" Yet few of my critics tried to refute the larger themes and perspectives in the book .
Instead of engaging in a reasoned , rational , and honest discussion of the issues raised , some sought to turn it into a game of ' gotcha , ' misrepresenting what I wrote and seeking to discredit me through inaccurate personal attacks on me and my motives . "
On the case for invading Iraq , McClellan said the president and his aides did not properly present the intelligence on the country and ignored doubts laid out by the intelligence community .
But he was wary to say the administration deliberately misled the nation into war .
" I do n't think there was a group sitting around saying let 's mislead the American people , " he said .
After less than an hour of testimony , the Judiciary Committee went on recess for debate and an expected vote on an update to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .

And there 's reason to celebrate .
The majority of literate human beings with IQs of 80 or above ( who do not have a reason to be professionally dense about the subject ) now believe the US government is actively covering up major facts about the 9/11 attacks .
The majority of that group believes elements of the US government were actively involved in permitting , facilitating and / or organizing the attacks .
All this is spite of a total media blackout , endless lying on the part of government officials , and a campaign of misinformation and ridicule directed against serious researchers .
A testament to the intelligence of human beings and the power of the Internet .

We present parametric higher - order abstract syntax ( PHOAS ) , a new approach to formalizing the syntax of programming languages in computer proof assistants based on type theory .
Like higher - order abstract syntax ( HOAS ) , PHOAS uses the meta language 's binding constructs to represent the object language 's binding constructs .
Unlike HOAS , PHOAS types are definable in general - purpose type theories that support traditional functional programming , like Coq 's Calculus of Inductive Constructions .
We walk through how Coq can be used to develop certified , executable program transformations over several statically - typed functional programming languages formalized with PHOAS ; that is , each transformation has a machine - checked proof of type preservation and semantic preservation .
Our examples include CPS translation and closure conversion for simply - typed lambda calculus , CPS translation for System F , and translation from a language with ML - style pattern matching to a simpler language with no variable - arity binding constructs .
By avoiding the syntactic hassle associated with first - order representation techniques , we achieve a very high degree of proof automation .

To manage this onslaught the teams ’ computers have to perform triage , and winnow those events to a couple hundred per second .
That is dangerous , Dr. Gianotti said , “ because we are looking for something rare . ”
The Higgs occurs once in every trillion events , she said .
Contending Armies
The competition between Atlas and the C.M.S. is in keeping with a long tradition of having rival teams and rival detectors at big experiments to keep each other honest and to cover all the bets .
As Dr. Mangano put it , “ If you screw it up , others are here to crucify you . ”
At the Fermilab Tevatron , the teams , several hundred strong , are called CDF and D0 .
In the glory years 20 years ago at Cern , they were called UA1 and UA2 .
Over the years , as the machines have grown , so have the groups that built them , from teams to armies , 1,800 people from 34 countries for Atlas and 2,520 from 37 countries for the C.M.S .
The other two experiments —
Alice with 1000 scientists , and LHCb with 663 — are only slightly smaller .
Robert Cousins of U.C.L.A. and C.M.S. joked that he was old enough so that after 25 years in the business “ half my friends are on Atlas , the others on C.M.S. ” Dr. Jenni said all 1,800 Atlas scientists would have their names on the first papers out of the collider , adding : “ The people who work in the pit make as important a physics contribution as those who end up in front of the computers .
This is a big step in energy .
It ’s new territory , and that ’s in the end why everyone is excited . ”
At the end of the day , Dr. Mangano said , unless there is a major problem both machines will perform .
“ It will come down to sociology , ” he said .
“ How quickly can they analyze the data ?
How do you manipulate and analyze the data ?
The process of understanding is long . ”
There could be new phenomena , he added , new particles that theorists have not thought of .
Dr. Mangano pointed out that it had been a long time since high - energy physicists had made a fundamental discovery .
And back then , when Dr. Rubbia was doing his Nobel work , there were well - defined theories of what would be found .
Now , everything will be new .
“ There are many students who have never seen data , ” Dr. Mangano said .
“ I do n’t know how much longer we can keep going like that . ”

While George Bush ’s lack of eloquence is hardly something to write about , there are so many of his beliefs that are just plain scary .
One of these ( which received surprisingly little news coverage at the time ) was when George Bush Senior mentioned his views on atheism .
The Rob Sherman Advocacy web site offers the following quote :
I asked Mr. Bush , “ What are you going to do to win the votes of Americans who are atheists ? ” Mr. Bush replied , “ I guess I ’m pretty weak in the atheist community .
Faith in God is important to me . ”
I followed up : “ Do you support the equal citizenship and patriotism of Americans who are atheists ? ” Mr. Bush replied , “ I do n’t know that atheists should be regarded as citizens , nor should they be regarded as patriotic .
This is one nation under God . ”
After other reporters asked a few questions about issues that they were concerned about , I was then able to get in one more follow - up question on my subject : “ Do you support the constitutionality of state / church separation ? ” Vice President Bush responded , “ I support separation of church and state .
I ’m just not very high on atheists . ”
If that ’s not enough to make your stomach turn , Positive Atheism offers The Big Scary List of George W. Bush Quotations .
Perhaps I should n’t be surprised that George is n’t “ very high ” on atheists ( it does make me wonder , though , what he is “ high ” on ) .
But people should see this is an outrage .
Here , a politician of the United States is claiming that one must be religious ( and probably Christian ) to be protected by the Constitution of the United States of America .
And , better yet , the whole “ under God ” phrase was added to the Pledge of Allegiance in the 1960s .
For those that do n’t realize it , this guy is the highest ranking public official in the United States .
Adobe released patches for its Reader and Acrobat programs last Wednesday , but there 's reason to suspect that the company has closed the barn door long after the cattle fled .
According to a blog entry at the SANS Internet Storm Center , this particular vulnerability has been exploited in the wild for several weeks .
In this case , hackers use malicious banner ads as a host for an infected PDF .
The PDF then installs the Zonebac Trojan , which sets to work deactivating antivirus products , modifying search results , and changing banner ads .
Adobe 's 8.12 update supposedly plugs the loopholes that the Zonebac delivery system exploited , but the company has declined to give any information on what , exactly , the update changed .
The lack of information is disappointing ( though not surprising ) , but Adobe 's failure to address the issue in a timely manner raises questions about the firm 's commitment to security .
An 18 - day gap between the appearance of a verified exploit and the release of a patch is n't exactly impressive , and this particular issue had been on Adobe 's radar for months .
iDefense Labs first reported the existence of this particular buffer overflow vulnerability in early October 2007 .
The attack has raised some questions regarding the security of the PDF standard — Symantec researcher Hon Lau discusses the relevant PDF vulnerability in his blog before rhetorically asking : " With more and more of these attacks happening , how much longer will it be before people implicitly attach a higher risk association to PDF files and avoid them altogether ? "
To answer his question , some of us already do .
While there 's not a whole lot of evidence suggesting that the PDF standard is under concerted attack , there mere existence of these exploits affects perception of them , and Adobe is doing itself no favors .
Granted , we still know far , far more people who were infected via JPGs , DOCs , and the like , but this is n't Adobe 's first high - profile security issue .
Hon Lau covered a different cross-scripting attack that also exploited a PDF vulnerability back in January 2007 .
Ironically , Adobe recommended users update to Reader 8 as one way of solving the problem .
Given the file format 's popularity and ubiquity , Adobe has a very strong interest in keeping PDF as secure as possible ; if it fails to do so , it opens the door for competing standards such as Microsoft 's XML Paper Specification ( XPS ) .
These recent attacks , in and of themselves , are n't enough to steer businesses away from a trusted format they may have been using for decades , but Adobe may need to adjust the way in which it communicates with customers and the speed with which it delivers its security patches .
PDF files have been traditionally represented as safe for download or viewing , which makes the need to stay ahead of hackers — rather than nearly three weeks behind them — all the more important .
The Bush administration has worked overtime to manipulate or conceal scientific evidence  and muzzled at least one prominent scientist  to justify its failure to address climate change .
Its motives were transparent : the less people understood about the causes and consequences of global warming , the less they were likely to demand action from their leaders .
And its strategy has been far too successful .
Seven years later , Congress is only beginning to confront the challenge of global warming .
The last week has brought further confirmation of the administration ’s cynicism .
An internal investigation by NASA ’s inspector general concluded that political appointees in the agency ’s public affairs office had tried to restrict reporters ’ access to its leading climate scientist , Dr. James Hansen .
He has warned about climate change for 20 years and has openly criticized the administration ’s refusal to tackle the issue head - on .
More broadly , the investigation said that politics played a heavy role in the office and that it had presented information about global warming “ in a manner that reduced , marginalized or mischaracterized climate - change science made available to the general public . ”
Cheap Green Computer Runs on 2 Watts
June 29th , 2008 by Michelle Bennett
As far as green gadgets go , this little desktop computer will give Dell and ( to a lesser extent ) Apple a run for their money .
The CherryPal promises to be affordable , efficient , and powerful enough for the average PC user .
At first glance , that stats on the system look modest , and for good reason .
This design actually cuts out 20 % of PC components to reduce energy usage .
But fear not , despite being small ( the size of a paperback ) , the CherryPal claims it can start up in 20 seconds , and cloud computing provides more power / storage when you need it .
A Linux operating system ( now more user friendly than ever ) , and cloud computing means you wo n’t need to worry about viruses or install protective programs that can slow down your PC .
On a more green note , the CherryPal is supposed to sell for under $ 400 ( monitor , keyboard , etc. not included ) .
It should hit the market on August 4th , 2008 .
For that price and low energy use , it will appeal to wallets as well as the environmentally conscious .
Though there is some understandable skepticism , I ’ll praise any manufacturer that lowers the bar on PC environmental impact .
I recently took a blow to all of my electronics in the same week ( Murphey ’s Law at work ) , so it ’s nice to see alternatives on the market .
I ’ll definitely have my eye on this cute little computer that thinks it can .
Readers :
What are your thoughts on cloud computing ?
What are CherryPal ’s chances of becoming popular ?

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
As if yesterday ’s memo asserting unprecedented extra constitutional Executive authority were n’t bad enough , the Associated Press reports today that former Presidential adviser John
Yoo also asserted that a key provision of the Bill of Rights could be ignored in the name of the War On Terror :
For at least 16 months after the Sept. 11 terror attacks in 2001 , the Bush administration believed that the Constitution ’s protection against unreasonable searches and seizures on U.S. soil did n’t apply to its efforts to protect against terrorism .
That view was expressed in a secret Justice Department legal memo dated Oct. 23 , 2001 .
The administration on Wednesday stressed that it now disavows that view .
The October 2001 memo was written at the request of the White House by John Yoo , then the deputy assistant attorney general , and addressed to Alberto Gonzales , the White House counsel at the time .
The administration had asked the department for an opinion on the legality of potential responses to terrorist activity .
The 37 - page memo is classified and has not been released .
Its existence was disclosed Tuesday in a footnote of a separate secret memo , dated March 14 , 2003 , released by the Pentagon in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union .
“ Our office recently concluded that the Fourth Amendment had no application to domestic military operations , ” the footnote states , referring to a document titled “ Authority for Use of Military Force to Combat Terrorist Activities Within the United States . ”
Exactly what domestic military action was covered by the October memo is unclear .
But federal documents indicate that the memo relates to the National Security Agency ’s Terrorist Surveillance Program , or TSP .
That program intercepted phone calls and e-mails on U.S. soil , bypassing the normal legal requirement that such eavesdropping be authorized by a secret federal court .
The program began after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and continued until Jan. 17 , 2007 , when the White House resumed seeking surveillance warrants from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court .
Writing specifications for bids , picking a vendor and waiting for delivery takes years , even if the money is in hand .
Amtrak is an alternative to airlines along the Boston - New York - Washington corridor , and on some routes out of Chicago and a few in California .
But most of its other routes are so slow that people take those trains because they have no alternative to reach places like Burlington , N.C. , or Burlington , Iowa .
Or they go for the train ride itself .
The railroad carried about 25 million passengers last year and may hit 27 million this year .
( That is all intercity traffic ; commuter rail , connecting suburbs and cities , is also growing , but that is not Amtrak ’s market . )
By contrast , the airlines carry about 680 million domestic passengers a year .
If Amtrak were an airline , in terms of passenger boardings it would rank approximately eighth , behind Continental and US Airways and ahead of AirTran and JetBlue .
H. Glenn Scammel , a former head of staff of the rail subcommittee of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee , said the railroad should give up on some of its cross-country trains and redeploy the equipment on relatively short intercity trips , where it could provide enough frequency to attract new business .
( Providing one train a day in each direction will not draw many new business travelers . )
But the railroad ’s labor contracts provide stiff penalties for dropping routes , and dropping states from its itinerary would hurt its political support , especially in the Senate , where thinly populated states are overrepresented relative to their population .

Scarcity is not all bad for the railroad , though .
It has raised ticket prices , so that it recorded ticket revenues of $ 153.4 million in May , up 15.6 percent from $ 132.7 million in May 2006 .
That jump is higher than the ridership increase of 12.3 percent , to 2.58 million , from 2.30 million .
Sugar , or White Gold , as British colonists called it , was the engine of the slave trade that brought millions of Africans to the Americas beginning in the early 16th - century .
Profit from the sugar trade was so significant that it may have even helped America achieve independence from Great Britain .
Each Monday , this column turns a page in history to explore the discoveries , events and people that continue to affect the history being made today .
What 's not to like about candy , ice cream and all those other sweet treats made with everybody 's favorite indulgence , sugar ?
Plenty , as it turns out , beyond the way it expands waistlines and causes cavities .
It 's unlikely that many candy - lovers in the United States think about history while quaffing an estimated 100 pounds of sugar per year , but sweet stuff once played a major role in one of the sourest eras in modern times .
White Gold , as British colonists called it , was the engine of the slave trade that brought millions of Africans to the Americas beginning in the early 16th - century .
The history of every nation in the Caribbean , much of South America and parts of the Southern United States was forever shaped by sugar cane plantations started as cash crops by European superpowers .
Profit from the sugar trade was so significant that it may have even helped America achieve independence from Great Britain .
The Trade Triangle
Today more sugar is produced in Brazil than anywhere else in the world even though , ironically , the crop never grew wild in the Americas .
Sugar cane — native to Southeast Asia — first made its way to the New World with Christopher Columbus during his 1492 voyage to the Dominican Republic , where it grew well in the tropical environment .
Noting sugar cane 's potential as income for the new settlements in the Americas — Europeans were already hooked on sugar coming from the Eastern colonies — Spanish colonizers snipped seeds from Columbus ' fields in the Dominican Republic and planted them throughout their burgeoning Caribbean colonies .
By the mid 16th - century the Portuguese had brought some to Brazil and , soon after , the sweet cane made its way to British , Dutch and French colonies such as Barbados and Haiti .
It was n't long , however , before the early settlers realized they were lacking sufficient manpower to plant , harvest and process the backbreaking crop .
The first slave ships arrived in 1505 and continued unabated for more than 300 years .
Most came from western Africa , where Portuguese colonies had already established trading outposts for ivory , pepper and other goods .
To most of the European merchants , the people they put on cargo ships across the Atlantic — a horrendous voyage known as the Middle Passage — were merely an extension of the trading system already in place .
Sugar slavery was the key component in what historians call The Trade Triangle , a network whereby slaves were sent to work on New World plantations , the product of their labor was sent to a European capital to be sold and other goods were brought to Africa to purchase more slaves .
By the middle of the 19th century , more than 10 million Africans had been forcibly removed to the New World and distributed among the sugar plantations of Brazil and the Caribbean .
Sugar boosts independence
During those three centuries , sugar was by far the most important of the overseas commodities that accounted for a third of Europe 's entire economy .
As technologies got more efficient and diversified , adding molasses and rum to the plantation byproducts , sugar barons from St. Kitts to Jamaica became enormously wealthy .
The importance of those sugar - rich colonies , especially those belonging to Britain and France , had enormous consequences for the map of the Americas during the 1700s .
Britain lost its 13 American colonies to independence in part because its military was busy protecting its sugar islands , many historians have argued .
As opposed to the slaves working plantations in the U.S. South , Africans on Caribbean sugar plantations ( and the islands themselves ) outnumbered their European owners by a wide margin .
The British planters lived in constant fear of revolt and demanded soldiers for protection .
Several decisive battles of the Revolutionary War would have turned out differently had Britain thrown its full might behind the war , experts believe .
Sizable garrisons were also stationed in the West Indies to guard the few sugar holdings Britain had left at the end of the Seven Years ' War in 1763 .
In carving up the Americas after the fighting stopped , King George III had decided to cede a few of his Caribbean sugar islands to France in order to secure a sizable chunk of North America .
How important was sugar cane in that time ?
In swapping sweet and profitable Guadeloupe for the barren , sugar - free wasteland of Canada , plus most of the land east of the Mississippi River , many Englishmen thought the King got a raw deal .
The PR executive John McCain just tapped to help run the GOP convention quit today after a report that his firm once represented the Burmese junta that is now doing little to relieve its people from the devastation incurred by this week ’s cyclone .
Doug Goodyear , CEO of the DCI Group , said in a statement issued by the convention committee that he was resigning “ so as not to become a distraction in this campaign . ”
Asked whether he made the decision to quit or was asked by the campaign , Goodyear said : " My decision . "
" [ It was ] unambiguously the right thing to do , " he said in an email to Politico .
In a piece posted online today , Newsweek ’s Michael Isikoff reported that DCI represented Burma ’s military regime in 2002 .
DCI is a well - regarded firm in the Republican orbit , but has been known to represent some politically controversial clients .
Given McCain ’s ardor for campaign finance reform and the number of lobbyists and PR gurus who comprise the senior ranks of his campaign , his aides are acutely sensitive to appearances .
Goodyear accepted the post just this past week .

The NYT today prints Hillary ’s latest lie , unquestioned .
This one is quite likely her biggest lie to date :
“ I ’ve been closing very strongly since Feb. 20 , ” she said , referring to the day after Mr. Obama won Hawaii and Wisconsin .
“ I have won more votes and won more states than Senator Obama .
All the independent analyses break in my direction .
A lot of the key states that we have to win , I win those states . ”
Put aside for a moment the “ more votes ” argument , where Hillary does n’t count 15 states ( so she ’s won more votes in 35 states – uh , thats nice . )
Hillary is now claiming that she ’s won more states than Obama .
Uh , no .
Not by a mile .
Obama : 33 states won
Clinton : 19 states won
( Note : some states have primaries and caucuses so the total is more than 50 . )
Now , what Hillary is probably REALLY claiming is that she has won more states SINCE FEBRUARY 20 .
Uh , maybe .
And so what ?
How do you magically choose February 20th as the day after which primaries and caucuses count , but any that happened before that date do n’t count ?
How – because only after February 19 does Hillary win more states .
Now how many states do you think Hillary has thrown out of her calculations because their primaries and caucuses happened before ?
38 states .
That ’s 76 % of the states not counted .
Yes , Hillary ’s argument is that if you throw out the results in 38 of the 50 states , then she wins more states than Obama .
Here are the 38 states that Hillary now says do n’t count :
Iowa caucuses
New Hampshire primary
Michigan primary
Nevada caucuses
South Carolina primary
Florida primary
Alabama primary
Alaska caucuses
Arizona primary
Arkansas primary
California primary
Colorado caucuses
Connecticut primary
Delaware primary
Georgia primary
Idaho caucuses
Illinois primary
Kansas caucuses
Massachusetts primary
Minnesota caucuses
Missouri primary
New Jersey primary
New Mexico primary
New York primary
North Dakota caucuses
Oklahoma primary
Tennessee primary
Utah primary
Louisiana primary
Nebraska caucuses
Washington caucuses
Maine caucuses
D.C. primary ( not a state , but whatever )
Maryland primary
Virginia primary
Hawaii caucuses
Wisconsin primary
Ohio primary
So , under Hillary ’s absurd math you only count the last 24 % of the game , and ignore the first 76 % .
Good luck with that math in November .
“ Dear Electoral College , I know I lost to John McCain by over 100 electoral votes , but if you only count the electoral votes in the following 12 states , I really won ! ” – Love , Hillary
UPDATE : I just tallied the 14 races held after February 20th , and in fact Hillary won 8 and Obama won 6 .
Yep , that ’s Hillary ’s huge mandate for changing the minds of the superdelegates , her 8 victories to his 6 victories .
And if you count Obama ’s expected wins tomorrow in South Dakota and Montana , then they ’d be tied , 8 - 8 .

So far , Microsoft has been very tight - lipped about Windows 7 , carefully trying to prevent another Longhorn PR disaster where the company promised the heavens and more for Longhorn , but in the end ditched Longhorn to make way for Vista .
Chris Flores ( Windows Client Communications Team ) as well as Steven Sinofsky , has broken the silence a little bit to talk about Windows 7 .
In addition , it is believed Windows 7 will make its first official debut at the D6 All Things Digital conference today , during a keynote held by Steve Ballmer and Bill Gates .
First of all , Flores confirmed Microsoft has indeed taken a different approach to promoting the next release of Windows .
“ We know that when we talk about our plans for the next release of Windows , people take action .
As a result , we can significantly impact our partners and our customers if we broadly share information that later changes , ” he explains , “ With Windows 7 , we ’re trying to more carefully plan how we share information with our customers and partners .
This means sharing the right level of information at the right time depending on the needs of the audience .
More interesting are the rather clear goals Flores puts forth for Windows 7 :
The long - term architectural investments we introduced in Windows Vista and then refined for Windows Vista SP1 and Windows Server 2008 will carry forward in Windows 7 .
Windows Vista established a very solid foundation , particularly on subsystems such as graphics , audio , and storage .
Windows Server 2008 was built on that foundation and Windows 7 will be as well .
Contrary to some speculation , Microsoft is not creating a new kernel for Windows 7 .
Rather , we are refining the kernel architecture and componentization model introduced in Windows Vista .
Apparently , Windows 7 will focus on performance – not a bad idea seeing the lukewarm reception Vista has gotten was mostly based on its demanding requirements .
In fact , one of our design goals for Windows 7 is that it will run on the recommended hardware we specified for Windows Vista and that the applications and devices that work with Windows Vista will be compatible with Windows 7 .
Steven Sinofsky , Microsoft ’s Windows chief , also broke the silence today in an interview with CNet ’s Ina Fried .
He reiterated the three year time frame , where Windows 7 is scheduled for release three years after Windows Vista .
Sinofsky also confirmed what Flores had to say : driver and programs that work on Vista will also work on Windows 7 .
“ We ’re very clear that drivers and software that work on Windows Vista are going to work really well on Windows 7 ; in fact , they ’ll work the same .
We ’re going to not introduce additional compatibilities , particularly in the driver model . ”
He added that Windows Server 2008 ’s kernel is an evolution of Vista ’s kernel , and Windows 7 ’s kernel will be an evolution of the Server 2008 kernel .
Ina Fried posed some interesting questions to Sinofsky , one of which is about backwards compatibility .
Many people , including myself , have argued for an Apple - like approach : move backwards compatibility into a virtual machine .
Sinofsky dismissed the idea of looking at backwards compatibility as a burden or challenge :
All of those IHVs and ISVs .
I look at them as the key asset to the Windows and PC ecosystem .
So , I do n’t at all look at them like a compatibility burden or challenge , to use the words that you used , but I look at it as well , that ’s the big asset that customers look to when they buy into a Windows PC .
They say , hey , if I bought this printer five years ago , I want to keep using it , and I want to keep using it as part of my PC network .
If I have this other piece of hardware , I want to keep using it .
We do have to get better at the work that we ’ve done , and , in fact , sometimes we make very , very substantial changes that are really multiyear bets .
Lastly , IStartedSomething claims that during the Ballmer - Gates keynote speech at the D6 conference today , Windows 7 will make its first public appearance .
“ Whether or not we ’ll actually see a live build of Windows 7 or purely a technology demo of a specific feature remains a mystery , but it ’s sure exciting , ” the website states .
In light of the rather tight - lipped approach both Sinofsky and Flores have just taken , I ’m not sure whether this claim holds any water – but who knows .

OpenMoko announced yesterday that it has secured distribution agreements with five vendors for its unique Linux - based Freerunner mobile phone .
This will bring the device to a broader audience than it 's reached previously .
OpenMoko , which was started by FIC in 2006 , is developing a completely open mobile smartphone that runs a custom Linux platform .
The first OpenMoko handset , called the Neo1973 , was released last year and squarely targeted software developers and Linux enthusiasts .
OpenMoko followed up the Neo1973 with the consumer - oriented FreeRunner , which was announced earlier this year .
The underlying software platform has evolved considerably since then and has undergone some major changes to prepare it for the consumer market .
The OpenMoko software platform strategy has been steadily moving towards adopting lightweight e17 technologies under the guidance of lead Enlightenment developer Carsten Haitzler .
In a final push to bring consumer - ready usability to the platform , the company dropped much of its promising but incomplete GTK - based middleware and adopted an X11 port of Trolltech 's Qtopia platform .
" We have moved beyond the early adopter stage and are now ready to release the next generation Neo Freerunner to markets where we are seeing early traction , " Openmoko vice president of marketing Steve Mosher in a statement .
" These key distributors have relationships that reach deeply into markets that can leverage the features of this remarkable mobile device and advance it even further through software and exterior customization . "
Although the current version of the software shipped on the phone still has some rough edges and is primarily intended for developers , OpenMoko will provide updates via its web site and intends to gradually approach the point where the product is ready for a regular mainstream audience .
The device is is n't tied to any specific software stack , however , and end users with sufficient expertise will be able to use it to test , develop , or use alternate mobile software platforms .
German vendors TRIsoft and Golden Delicious Computers have partnered to distribute the FreeRunner in Europe .
Pulster will distribute it in Germany , Bearstech will make it available in France , and IDA systems will offer it in India .
OpenMoko will also continue to sell the phone from its web site at its suggested retail price of $ 399 and it says that additional distribution agreements for other regions will be announced at the upcoming LinuxWorld event in August .

Atheism is not another religion .
There is no head atheist , chain of command or a supernatural component .
It is a private philosophical stance , which unapologetically places ultimate value on the primacy of reason .
Atheism does not have churches or celebration days .
Atheists are individuals who pay their taxes , donate to charities , and are volunteers in society to the same extent as everyone else .
Atheists have family , friends , acquaintances , careers , pets , hobbies , and so on , and although popular rumour has it that atheists have cranial horns and sacrifice babies , this is untrue .
Their essential distinction is that atheists have no invisible means of support .
Some people are under the common misconception that atheism equates with Stalinism , Nazism , communism and so on .
This is , of course , mischievous nonsense designed or used as propaganda for consumption by easy ears .
Dictatorial social and political systems result from the tyrannical desires of deranged individuals and accommodating circumstances .
Religious and non-religious people alike rightfully despise them and any mayhem these ideologies create .

Freely chosen atheism in democracies is the antitheses of forced compliance with narrow political agendas .
In fact , atheism promotes informed decision making as the best possible way of governance .
This ensures that to the highest extent achievable in human affairs , there is an assurance of equality , compassion and justice before the law .
Where societies do not rely on well - informed choice , as in authoritarian regimens like fascism , suffering is unavoidable .
It is also the case that faith - driven doctrines cause similar predicaments .
One needs only to watch the international and national nightly news on television to be convinced .
Reliance on ancient literature as a guide to establishing mores is problematical .
There are a number of creeds and creeds within creeds , all containing conflicting messages with numerous interpretations inevitably leading to divisiveness , injustice and conflict .
On the other hand , atheism does not endorse acts of violence , encourage others to do so , or attempt to subvert those in disagreement .
The explanation is simple .
Reasoned argument and not belligerence is the hallmark of atheism .
Atheism is the default ethical position of humanity .
It does not slavishly follow a set of immutable “ sacred ” rules among the many on offer .
We are all born atheists , with a percentage indoctrinated personally or culturally by one of the thousands of religions , which exist or have existed .
The brand of religion thus adhered to is overwhelmingly dependant on specific location and tradition .
Atheists have no wish to override properly constructed democracy by aggression , by unrepresented interference in politics or by using pre-existing notions .
Atheism considers that the only method to secure positive outcomes is to have full regard for all the available evidence , and not just that in favour of a particular ideology .

This does not mean that atheism is a state of perfection or an infallible inoculation against idiocy .
But its majority consensus favours reaching better conclusions more so than by inflexible adherence to fashionable dogma .
Unfortunately , it is here where the harm of religion overshadows any good or perceived benefit .
A regrettable product of religion is intolerance of different outlooks , particularly where they do not fit a demanding preordained worldview .
Religions tend to compel or attempt to implement their opinions onto whole populations to the detriment of arbitrarily selected groups .
It is all very well to have “ respect ” for alleged revelation , but it is not acceptable to expect others who do not , to live by its dictates .
A study of freely chosen atheism in educated secularised nations demonstrates it to be the mechanism encouraging and nurturing happiness , prosperity , equality , compassion and justice .
In contrast , those places on the planet where religion is inseparable from politics or where antiquated religious ideals form the basis for behaviour , the same is not true .
Western Europe exemplifies this point very decisively .

On warm days , a topless Kimberly Parrott casually walks her Lab cross , Underdog , in the parks of New Westminster and Burnaby .
Sure , she gets stared at .
Shocked - looking moms sometimes cover their children ’s eyes , she said .
But only once has a police officer “ harassed ” the software engineer and mom .
The officer slowed down his patrol car , she recalled , and leaned out the window .
“ Ma’am , you want to put something on ? ” he asked .
Parrott said , “ No , thank you .
I ’ve got something on , ” referring to her shorts .
Parrott explained to the officer that she was perfectly free to bare her breasts on the streets of Vancouver ’s suburbs .
After calling in , she said , the officer conceded that she was right and she continued on her way , naked on top , in the sunshine .
“ I think women have big , big hang - ups about exposing any part of their body , ” Parrott told the Georgia Straight in a phone interview from her home office , explaining why she ’s normally the only topless dog walker around .
“ I wish I could take their hands and say , ” ˜It ’s okay .
You ’re not a slut if you do it . ’ ”
Even if you are a slut , there ’s no limit to go - nude events this summer .
( See this sidebar for details . )
Naked is in .
Or at least it ’s not out .
In recent decisions , B.C. courts have stood behind the right of naturists to bare all , virtually anywhere , from the parks of Maple Ridge to Surrey ’s Newton Wave Pool .
The Lower Mainland is home to Wreck Beach , the lesser - known Crescent Rock Beach in White Rock , and a mind - boggling number of pro-naturist event - organizing groups .
One can swim nude in public pools , bowl nude , camp nude , yacht nude , and even dance nude in a barn .
Oh , those wacky naturists .
But beyond the aesthetic thrill of bouncing one ’s bits in the surf , public nudity in Vancouver is a measure of progress , according to Parrott .
First , it ’s about physical freedom .
Second , she said , it ’s a resistance to mainstream - media - driven propaganda about what bodies are supposed to look like .
“ I ’m very lucky to have in my past a woman who put on one of these newfangled bathing suits at the turn of the century , ” Parrott said .
“ She was marched off and put in jail .
How far we ’ve come in 100 years .
If people continue to say ” ˜Look , bodies are n’t shameful ! ’ and teach their kids that there ’s nothing wrong with nudity , then maybe in my lifetime ” ¦the children will be able to say , ” ˜There ’s nothing shameful about my body . ’ ”
Are we there yet ?
On June 7 , 200 cyclists rode naked through the streets of downtown Vancouver in the World Naked Bike Ride .
Parrott , who helped organize the ride through NIFTY ( Naked Iconoclasts Fighting the Yoke ) , said the riders received applause and smiles only .
So , Vancouver may be “ there ” in spirit , if not in law .
Those participating in the WNBR were still committing an offence under Criminal Code Section 174 , according to Vancouver lawyer David Butcher .
However , the chances of being charged with public nudity in Vancouver are extremely low , he said .
That ’s because the prosecution would have to prove that the community is not tolerant of public nudity , he explained , and get the consent of the attorney general to proceed with a case .
“ It appears that our community is accepting of the naked bike ride , ” Butcher , who represented nudist Linda Meyer in a groundbreaking 2000 Maple Ridge case , told the Straight .
“ Trying to measure that [ community tolerance ] is very hard . ”
¦Prince George , for example , has much more conservative traditions than Vancouver .
I do n’t know if there are any traditions in Vancouver . ”
Just because no one is booing does n’t mean there ’s tolerance , says Dave Quist , the executive director of the Institute of Marriage and Family Canada .
Born on the West Coast , the spokesperson for Canada ’s conservative family lobby said the Lower Mainland does have a tradition of modesty .
“ If we could poll 1,000 people across the Lower Mainland , we would find a smattering who would say , ” ˜Yup , I ’m all for naturists ’ rights , ’ but I think you ’d still find a considerable number of people who would say , ” ˜No , I ’d not be comfortable with that , ’ ” Quist told the Straight in a phone interview from the highway between Calgary and Red Deer .
“ I recognize their right to go do that [ be naked ] , but I do n’t want their rights to interfere with my rights not to be offended , not to have my children see that , and so that ’s where we run into conflict . ”
Quist noted that even if naturists believe that public nudity is nonsexual , the rest of the population does n’t necessarily see it that way .
And sexualized flesh is something that ’s prevalent in our culture , he argued , and detrimental to it .
“ You ca n’t look at car commercials or a beer commercial , and many other things that are advertised , without a scantily clad man or woman , ” he explained .
“ When we do n’t have any modesty left , we characterize sex and sexuality as being just a crass thing without talking about intimacy or love , or the very nature of what intimacy is intended to be .
So when we lose modesty , we lose a lot of the other things that go with it . ”
Surrey is far from being as nudity - friendly as Vancouver , according to the president of the Surrey United Naturists , Don Pitcairn .
He explained that the city has refused to officially recognize Crescent Rock Beach as a clothing - optional zone , which leaves skinny - dippers vulnerable to public complaints and police intimidation .
That ’s despite the area ’s having been used by naked swimmers since at least 1947 , he said .
“ The City of Surrey has a long history of opposing any form of nude recreation , ” he said .
Pitcairn noted that in 1972 , the GVRD and the District of Surrey used red tape to harass the Sunny Trails Nudist Club almost out of existence .
Later that decade , he recalled , officials tried to shut down nude entertainment in the city ’s bars .
More recently , after just one complaint , city hall ordered Crescent Rock Beach ’s clothing - optional signs to be taken down .
In May 2007 , nude swimmers went to court to defend their right to rent Newton Wave Pool — and won .
Now , Pitcairn ’s SUN has threatened to take Surrey ’s World Oceans Day Festival organizers to the B.C. Human Rights Tribunal for barring the naturists ’ group participation in the June 8 event .
“ Surrey is 20 years behind the times , ” Pitcairn said , recalling Vancouver alderwoman Bernice Gerard ( 1977 to 1980 ) , who would conduct walks on Wreck Beach to shame naturists into putting their clothes back on .
“ Surrey , anything to do with nude recreation , they just stonewall , put up their defences . ”
Even Parrott admits that though she does her part in normalizing nudity around the Lower Mainland , it ’s far from normal .
For the naked bike ride , which sought to raise awareness of fuel consumption and climate change , the shock associated with nudity worked in the cyclists ’ favour , she said .
“ When you ’re doing any kind of protest , you can raise your voice and have signs and everything , but to get exposure , you have to rattle people , ” she said .
“ And , well , unfortunately in this society right now , nothing rattles people more than seeing a lot of people nude . ”
For the greater good of society , public nudity is worth pursuing , according to Brian Ferris , a clinical psychologist in private practice in North Vancouver .
All this bare skin is a good sign of the city ’s mental health , he said .
Vancouver has a playfulness drought , Ferris believes , and being naked in a group not only is playful but can break down feelings of social isolation .
“ Most recreations for adults are like golf — work hard , try hard , ” the psychologist told the Straight from his office .
“ There ’s no silliness .
I think it ’s time that the world was more silly .
And nudity is one of the ways you can be silly . ”
¦The people having fun are not the ones to worry about .
The people you have to worry about are ” ¦the people who are really serious and feel threatened .
When people are frightened , they ’re not playful .
When people are laughing and having fun , they do n’t do harm to others .
The world needs more play .
The world needs more laughter and fun . ”
In North America , public nudity is mainly about pleasure , according to UBC sociology lecturer Chris MacKenzie .
However , he said , in the Germany of the 1920s , it was “ a bit of a social movement , a panacea to the early urban - industrial social pathologies that were cropping up all over the place ” ¦a way to get the working and middle classes to connect with nature .
Not in an ecological sense but in generating some solidarity in the face of some of the problems that urban living was creating . ”
Although the naked bike ride was a consciousness raiser , and various local fundraising efforts regularly rely on titillation to draw attention to themselves , MacKenzie thinks the practice may be getting a little tired .
“ It ’s losing its novelty , ” he said .
“ Will it stop ?
Probably not . ”
As for recreational naturists , “ It seems that nudity is not the main attraction .
It ’s the social aspect of getting together , sunbathing , skinny - dipping . ”
In other words , pleasure .
So with all this legal freedom , groovy nude events , 100 years of naturists pushing the limits , and the seemingly limitless tolerance of Vancouverites for naked spectacle , why is topless dog walker Parrott still such a rarity ?
“ I wish I could identify that , ” she said .
“ There ’s so many mores . ”
¦If women cover their child ’s eyes , I think that ’s kind of sad .
Why not take the opportunity to explain to your kids , ” ˜Those are breasts , and just like that guy over there , she ’s got her top off . ’
Have a discussion about body parts .
“ Like , I ’m not going to go to an opera house top - free .
I ’m a clothing - optionalist .
We believe that everyone has the right to wear as much or as little clothing as they want without being thrown in jail . ”

BEAVERTON , Ore. – When Senator Barack Obama arrived at a software and technology plant here today , holding a town meeting with a few dozen Oregon voters , he came armed with a prepared speech about Senator John McCain .
In a span of less than 10 minutes , Mr. Obama mentioned his prospective Republican rival no fewer than 10 times .
( “ Senator McCain is running for president to double - down on George Bush ’s failed policies , ” Mr. Obama said , a statement that drew essentially no reaction from his small audience . )
But these voters had issues on their minds , from health care to the rising costs of college to the burgeoning federal deficit .
One man , though , raised a question that suddenly is weighing on the minds of many Democrats .
He put the question in basketball terms .
“ Since having good teammates that can play ball is advantageous to you , ” the man said , “ what ’s your thought of having Senator Clinton as your running mate ? ’
“ Were you put up to that by one of those reporters back there ? ” Mr. Obama said , shaking his head and smiling .
“ I have not won this nomination yet .
I think it would be presumptuous of me to suggest that she ’s going to be my running mate when we ’re still actively running . ”
Mr. Obama could have stopped there and called on his next questioner , but he did n’t .
“ We do not have this nomination locked up , so we ’re still competing .
She ’s going to do very well in West Virginia and Kentucky – she will win those states in all likelihood by significant margins .
We feel like we ’ve got a pretty good shot here in Oregon .
We ’re going to be campaigning in Montana and South Dakota and Puerto Rico .
Until I ’m the nominee , I do n’t want to speculate on running mates . ”
Before he concluded , he outlined three qualifications for hiring – or appointing – people : Competence , integrity , independence .
“ I will say that she has shown herself to be an extraordinary candidate and an extraordinary public servant .
She is hard working , she is tough , she is very smart , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ So I think she ’d be on anybody ’s shortlist of the vice presidential candidates , but beyond that , I do n’t want to offer an opinion . ”
O.K. , no opinion offered .

Washington -
To the many challenges facing the fledgling Iraqi government , Congress may soon add this : Recognize the State of Israel and establish diplomatic ties with Jerusalem , or else risk losing some of the billions in aid that Baghdad receives from the United States .
A nonbinding resolution demanding Iraqi recognition of Israel was introduced June 5 in the House of Representatives and has already gained the support of more than 60 congressmen , including several leaders of the Foreign Relations Committee .
The resolution puts Congress far out in front of the Israeli government and the White House , both of which to date have refrained from raising the issue .
An Israeli source said that while Jerusalem expects every United Nations member state to recognize Israel ’s right to exist and would like to have full diplomatic ties with all Arab states , the issue of Iraq “ was not on the agenda ” at present .
Congressional involvement in establishing Iraqi - Israeli ties came about in large part through serendipity .
Rep. Alcee Hastings , a Florida Democrat and a strong supporter of Israel , joined House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on a visit last month to mark the country ’s 60th anniversary .
The congressional group left Israel for a day trip to Iraq , at the end of which it returned to Tel Aviv from Baghdad .
“ As we got on the C - 130 taking us back , we were advised we ’d need to land in Amman , Jordan , touch down and then take off again to Israel , ” Hastings told the Forward after returning to Washington .
The reason for the brief landing was diplomatic : Iraq , like most other Arab countries , does not allow direct flights to Israel .
“ This offended me deeply , ” Hastings said , adding that he had encountered a similar problem in the past , when traveling to Libya from Israel .
Upon returning to the United States , the Florida congressman drafted a resolution calling on Iraq to change its stance toward Israel , starting with official recognition of the Jewish state .
“ Although the United States has provided Iraq with almost $ 50 billion in security and economic assistance to date , none of which has been repaid , the government of Iraq refuses to recognize the existence of Israel , the most reliable ally of the United States in the Middle East region , ” the introduced resolution states .
The resolution also calls on the White House to “ use its influence to persuade Iraq and other countries with which the United States has diplomatic relations to recognize the right of Israel to exist and to establish diplomatic relations with Israel . ”
While the current resolution is nonbinding , Hastings said he also would consider “ more substantive ” measures if Iraq does not change its approach to Israel .
Such measures , he said , could include attaching the demand for recognition and diplomatic ties to one of the major funding bills .
The Bush administration , according to congressional staff members , has not yet provided lawmakers with its view on the proposed resolution .
Historically , the State Department and White House have tended to oppose congressional legislation perceived as constraining the administration ’s ability to determine foreign policy .
An Israeli official said that Jerusalem had not requested Hastings ’s congressional resolution and had not raised the issue in talks with members of Congress .
According to a congressional staff member , pro-Israel lobbyists on Capitol Hill were also not involved in the initiative .
A spokeswoman for the Iraqi Embassy in Washington did not comment on the congressional resolution .
On June 10 , Hastings began seeking co-sponsors for his proposed resolution .
By the end of the day , nearly five dozen lawmakers , both Democrats and Republicans , had signed on .
Many of them , according to Hastings , were surprised to learn that Iraq does not recognize Israel .
Critics of the resolution , for their part , argue that it would be counterproductive and would only undermine efforts to strengthen the central Iraqi government led by Nouri al - Maliki .
“ From all the Arab countries who do not have ties with Israel , Iraq is the last one we should be asking to do this , ” said political scientist Shibley Telhami , Anwar Sadat chair for peace and development at the University of Maryland .
“ Iraq is the most vulnerable of all Arab states . ”
But the situation in Baghdad notwithstanding , Hastings believes that the Iraqi government should be called to task .
“ Right is right and wrong is wrong , ” the Florida congressman said .
“ And this is just not right . ”

John McCain says that it is n’t too important when American troops leave Iraq , that the main thing is to ensure there are n’t troop deaths .
He said that the US has troops in a lot of places , including South Korea .
( Via via Veracifier ) .
Contrast the Arizona senator ’s glib comment with reporting about the real Iraq :
‘ There have been hundreds of unit homecomings across North Carolina in the past six years , as troops returned from Iraq and Afghanistan .
Few , if any , though , were as emotional as the 1132nd Military Police Company ’s Tuesday .
The 1132nd lost four men in action in three attacks this spring , all in less than a month .
More than 20 troops were wounded , some of them badly .
The unit ’s dead accounted for nearly half the state Guard total of nine killed in action in Iraq .
The losses were n’t just bad luck .
The unit was doing a particularly dangerous job in a bad place at a bad time .
It was training Iraqi police officers on the edge of the Baghdad slum called Sadr City , a vast stronghold of the Shiite insurgents loyal to anti-American cleric Muqtada al - Sadr .
The insurgents waged a campaign of attacks against U.S. forces this spring . ‘
Then there is that , you know , problem about it costing $ 12 bn. a month to keep US troops in Iraq .
That may be chump change to McCain .
But most of us feel like we were sold a lemon on the pretense it was a Lamborghini and we are n’t making any more payments on it .
There are also problems about that Korea thing he keeps trotting out .
McCain does n’t seem to follow the news too closely .
I do n’t think the South Koreans are very happy with the US these days , so maybe if McCain were more in touch he would n’t use an old Cold War analogy .
Then there is the problem that after a bombing , Baghdad looks like this :
Whereas Seoul is like , nice :
Do you notice how Iraq and South Korea are not actually very much alike ?
Do you really think they will become alike in the next 4 years ?
Could Republicans please stop using John Gaddis ’s brain - dead “ analogy , ” which never made any sense to begin with ?
Bushra Juhi of AP reports ,
“ Iraqi police say a roadside bomb has killed five people riding minibuses in Baghdad .
An officer says the bomb exploded near a bridge in the mostly Shiite Hurriyah neighborhood around 10 a.m. Wednesday .
He says a woman and 7 - year - old boy are among the dead , and at least 10 other people are wounded .
Meanwhile , police say two mortar rounds hit a busy street in the central Baghdad area of Karrada , killing a civilian and wounding five others .
The officers spoke on condition of anonymity out of security concerns . ”
In any other city in the world , these two attacks ( there was at least one more , plus 4 bodies found ) would be front page news .
And , note that even the report of them came from Iraqi police too afraid to give their names to the press !
When police are themselves so insecure and exposed to reprisals that they they have to issue crime reports anonymously , it is not a good scene .
Ned Parker of the LAT reports that some in the al - Maliki government–and senior members of the Islamic Mission ( Da ’wa ) Party and the United Iraqi Alliance coalition of which it is a part– are seriously considering asking US troops to leave the country .
They believe they can now handle security on their own , and that the Bush administration ’s demands that they surrender a great deal of national sovereignty in the proposed Status of Forces agreement are unacceptable .

Brash Machine
My local ATM has become aggressively informal .
At first it was just small things , like saying " Sure " and " No , thanks " instead of " yes " and " no " when asking if I want a receipt .
But now it 's completely out of control .
Now it 's all , " Howdie - ho , neighbor !
Hot enough for ya ?
Well golly gee willikers , what can I do you for ? "
Obviously some bank honcho thinks that patrons will respond favorably to this folksy , conversational style , but I find it repellant .
I do n't even like it when actual - human colleagues call me " Matt , " so I do n't really need a freakin ' machine chumming up to me like we 've just spent the evening polishing off a half - rack of Coors .
And it seems to be worse every time I go there .
At this point , pretty much every question and menu option has been meticulously phrased to be as laid - back as possible , and they 've even revised some of the older , breezy responses to make them more casual .
God knows where it will end .
