A current star of the YouTube universe is a self - described " high school teacher in the process of burning out " in Independence , Ore. , just southwest of Salem .
Greg Craven , a 38 - year - old science teacher at Central High School in Independence , posted his homemade video to YouTube four months ago .
Since then , " The Most Terrifying Video You 'll Ever See " has been viewed 2,782,360 times .
That 's earned Craven the # 23 spot on YouTube 's list of most viewed videos in the news and politics category , just behind U2's " One " video and far out front of a clip called " Is Bush an Idiot ? "
The nearly 10 - minute video shows Craven , in close - up shots and standing at a white board , stating his case for why we should act now to address global warming .
But Craven 's YouTube video is only part of his story .
On Saturday , read The Oregonian 's profile of Craven on PDXgreen , The Oregonian 's green blog .

Congress Defies Bush on CIA Tape Probe House will continue investigation despite administation request to drop it .
WASHINGTON , Dec. 15 , 2007  -- House Intelligence Committee chairman Silvestre Reyes told ABC
News today that he will ignore the Bush administration 's request to drop its investigation of why CIA interrogation tapes were destroyed .
" This is an administration that frankly does not have a good track record of policing itself , " Reyes said .
" We intend to go forward and issue subpoenas next week because we are a whole equal branch of government . "
After telling Congress to get out of the way , the Justice Department took the highly unusual step of telling the same thing to a federal judge .
In 2005 , Judge Henry Kennedy ordered the government not to destroy any evidence of mistreatment or torture at the detention center at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
The Administration says that because the destroyed tapes were interrogations of two suspects in secret CIA prisons , not at Guantanamo , the judge should not interfere .
" This is becoming increasingly bizarre , " said Jonathan Turley , a professor at George Washington University Law School .
" The Justice Department insists it will essentially investigate itself and then tells the court that because it is investigating itself it wo n't turn over evidence of its possible criminal misconduct .
It 's so circular , it 's maddening . "
An investigation could be embarrassing to politicians in both parties who received classified briefings five years ago on interrogation tactics , possibly including waterboarding .
Some former CIA officers say Congress and the White House want the information obtained from suspected terrorists , but refuse to take the heat when the harsh methods are leaked .
And now CIA officers could face criminal charges .
" The CIA guys say we were told to do this ... told to treat detainees this way .
And we were told it was legal , " said Thomas Blanton , director of the National Security Archives .
" Now we find out we were wrong .
Now we 're taking the blame . "
When CIA agents saw politicians starting to distance themselves from the agency , some bought legal insurance policies .
That now looks it might have been a smart investment .
In 2002 , the CIA videotaped the interrogations of two terror suspects , including top al Qaeda operative Abu Zubaydah .
The tapes showed what the CIA calls " enhanced interrogation techniques , " methods which critics call torture .
In February 2003 , the CIA says it told the leaders of congressional intelligence committees about the tapes and that it planned to destroy them .
On Nov. 2 , 2005 , the Washington Post detailed the CIA 's secret prison program known as " black sites . "
It was November 2005 that the CIA destroyed the tapes .
CIA director Michael Hayden said the tapes were destroyed because " they were no longer of intelligence value " and that they posed " a serious security risk " because if leaked , they 'd reveal the identity of covert CIA agents .
I know ya’ll heard of wormholes , tunnels in the fabric of the cosmos that connect one region of the universe to another .
These ai n’t just the fanciful dreams of impressionable young astrobods : wormholes represent real solutions of Einstein ’s equation of general relativity .
If general relativity is correct , wormholes ought to be out there somewhere .
But how to spot ’em ?
It ’s easy to imagine that a wormhole , being a kinda hole in spacetime , would be indistinguishable from a black hole .
Turns out that ai n’t the case .
Alexander Shatskiy , an astrothinker from the Lebedev Physical Institute in Moscow , says wormholes are fundamentally different from black holes because they have no event horizon .
He ’s even worked out what a wormhole should look like .
The key difference is that light entering one end of a wormhole comes out at the other but in a highly characteristic way .
The angular intensity distribution of this light has a minimum at the center , regardless of wavelength .
This allows background stars to shine through giving the wormhole the appearance of a semi- transparent hollow sphere ( see image above ) .
Where to look ?
Shatskiy suggests that the next generation of supersensitive radio telelscope interferometers should have the resolution capable of distinguishing black holes from wormholes in active galactic nuclei .
So the message to all you radio astronomers out there is : keep ’em peeled .

Revealed : Pakistan hosed away scene after Bhutto attack John Byrne
Published : Saturday December 29 , 2007
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This May have violated law by skipping autopsy Despite official reports by Pakistan 's interior ministry claiming that the government had intercepted congratulatory messages sent by al Qaeda surrounding the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto , a motley of strange occurrences has sparked new suspicion of the government 's official story .
On Friday , doctors at Rawalpindi General Hospital , where she died , said that Bhutto had been killed by shrapnel to the head from an explosion , not by two bullets that Bhutto supporters cited in the aftermath of the attack .
Bhutto , 54 , was killed as in the aftermath of a shooting and suicide bombing as she left a political rally in the city of Rawalpindi .
The government soon changed their story , saying she 'd been killed by hitting the sunroof of her LandCruiser after she 'd stood up to wave to a crowd .
Doctors said there were no bullet marks on the former prime minister 's body , and released a limited x-ray of what they said was her skull .
More alarming , however , to Bhutto supporters was the fact no autopsy was conducted prior to burial .
The official line -- according to Pakistan 's interim prime minister Mohammadmian Soomro -- was that Bhutto 's husband had insisted no autopsy be performed .
But according to veteran lawyer Athar Minallah who spoke to McClatchy Newspapers Friday , " an autopsy is mandatory under Pakistan 's criminal law in a case of this nature . "
" It is absurd , because without autopsy it is not possible to investigate , " Minallah told McClatchy 's Saeed Shah and Warren Strobel in a little publicized piece .
" Is the state not interested in reaching the perpetrators of this heinous crime or there was a cover - up ? "
Autopsies are generally not conducted in Islam unless ordered by a court , because the religion calls for burial as quickly as possible .
It 's unclear whether Bhutto 's circumstances would have warranted an exception .
According to the reporters , " the scene of the attack also was watered down with a high - pressure hose within an hour , washing away evidence . "
Shah , who reported from the scene Thursday , wrote in a second piece that police rangers charged with protecting her " abandoned their posts " shortly before the bombing , leaving just a handful of Bhutto's own bodyguards protecting her .
" Police officers had frisked the 3,000 to 4,000 people attending Thursday 's rally when they entered the park , but as the speakers from Bhutto's Pakistan People 's Party droned on , the police abandoned many of their posts , " Shah wrote .
" As she drove out through the gate , her main protection appeared to be her own bodyguards , who wore their usual white T - shirts inscribed : ' Willing to die for Benazir . ' "
Some of Bhutto's supporters were suspect of the " sunroof theory . "
A " senior official " of Bhutto's Pakistan People 's Party called the claim " false , " saying he 'd seen at least two bullet marks on her body after the attack .
" It was a targeted , planned killing , " BPP 's Babar Awan said .
" The firing was from more than one side . "
Another newspaper also asserted witnesses saw her shot .
Multiple reports said Bhutto had shown disregard for her personal safety by waving to the crowd .
" In her enthusiasm , she got carried away , and exposed herself in ways " she should n't have , a former State Department official told Shah .
Pakistan indicated Saturday it would delay January elections because of turmoil caused by Bhutto 's death .
Protests and looting have left at least 38 people dead .
Updated to include background on autopsies as regards Islam .
If Bill James were to assemble a Ken Phelps All - Star Team in the Year
2000 , there is a good chance that Billy McMillon would be named as
captain of the squad .
Despite having the ability to help most major - league
teams , McMillon has languished in Triple - A for the better part of the last
five seasons .
On August 1 , the Detroit Tigers recalled McMillon from Toledo after
they released Luis Polonia .
At the time of his recall , McMillon was
leading the International League with a .345 batting average and a .446
on - base percentage .
We caught up with him prior to a recent game against
the Seattle Mariners .
Baseball Prospectus :
It ’s nice to see you up with the Tigers and
playing well in limited action .
Has Phil Garner given you any indication as
to how he plans to use you for the remainder of the season ?
Billy McMillon : I think my role for the remainder of the season ,
barring injury to someone else , is going to be pretty much like it ’s been
before : playing against right - handers and not playing against left - handers .
That means DHing , and when he feels that Juan Gonzalez or Bobby
Higginson needs a day off on defense then I may play in the field .
But
only if there ’s a right - hander pitching .
It ’s kind of a tough balancing act because Rich Becker and
Wendell Magee have been doing well and he has to try to give
everybody sufficient playing time .
BP : How would you best describe your approach at the plate ?
What do
you try to do to be successful as a hitter ?
McMillon : I know it ’s going to sound simple , but I try to hit the
ball with the fat part of the bat and concentrate on hitting the ball up
the middle of the field .
I feel that if the ball is over the plate and I
have that approach , then I ’ll be able to hit the ball to all fields .
That ’s
one of the things you need to do to be a successful hitter : use all parts
of the field .
That ’s what I try to do .
BP : Throughout your career , you ’ve drawn your fair share of walks .
Have you ever encountered pressure from coaches to be more aggressive ?
McMillon : I think that one of the things that has helped me is that
with the help of coaches and teammates I ’ve developed a hitting philosophy .
That philosophy calls for getting on base , be it by a base hit or a walk ,
and trying to do basic fundamental - type things like moving a runner over
when he ’s on second base .
I have n’t had reason to deviate much from that .
I think with the amount of success that I ’ve had that it ’s kind of hard for
someone to say , " Do it this way " .
They recognize the fact that I
have an idea what I ’m doing up there and they let me do it .
BP : The Tigers are the third team you ’ve been with .
How does the
Tigers organization compare with that of the Marlins and Phillies ?
McMillon :
When I was with the Marlins , I did n’t appreciate what I
had there .
They were really disciplined and structured , almost to the point
where players did n’t like it .
I think that had a lot to do with us not
being able to see the results of doing things the right way early in our
career ; the dividends would be cashed in later .
They stressed punctuality
and doing the little things .
In Philadelphia , they got away from that a
little bit .
So far , what I ’ve noticed here in Detroit is that they have that fine line
that I ’ve wanted all along .
There is some structure as far as stressing
discipline and the like , but also a lot of freedom to experiment and do
what you need to do .
I actually think that this is the best kind of fit ,
not only for me , but for anybody .
I ’m not the type of person that ’s going to cause trouble .
So , when I was
with the Marlins , if they said , " Do X , Y and Z " , I had no problem
doing it .
In my mind , I might have said , " Why are we doing
this ? " , but I did it .
When I was in Philadelphia , I often wondered ,
" Why are n’t we told to do X , Y and Z ? " .
Here , I ’ve found the
balance that I wanted .
For example , they want you to move runners over and
be on time .
But , to a degree , it ’s your decision .
In that regard , it ’s been
a really good relationship .
BP : Some players have talked about not getting much useful
instruction in the Phillies ’ system .
Do you feel the same way ?
McMillon : I guess the best way for me to answer that is to say that
I drew on my past and what I was told by previous coaches , especially
hitting coaches .
I studied my tapes and films , which were teaching aids for
me .
Hitting is what is going to get me to and keep me in the big leagues
and , in that regard , I did n’t benefit a lot from the instruction I got over
there .
I had a pretty solid base and that got me through that time .
With
the aid of video I was able to make the minor adjustments that I needed to
make throughout the season .
BP : You were in the Phillies ’ organization for about two - and - a- half
seasons and posted some pretty good numbers , especially last year .
Do you
feel that you had a fair opportunity to show what you could do as a
ballplayer ?
McMillon :
No , I do n’t think that I did .
It was very promising when I
got traded over there in 1997 .
They gave up a legend in Philadelphia
( Darren Daulton ) to get me .
I think that I did well enough to deserve a
better chance .
I was with the Phillies for almost two months in ’97 and hit
.292 . I certainly thought that was enough to warrant , if not a shot at the
everyday left field job , at least a backup job .
But that was right before
the Phillies got Bobby Abreu and Doug Glanville , so I got
squeezed out .
Sometimes what a player does is not enough .
Often , people think you can do
better just by going outside of the organization , which is what
Philadelphia did by getting Abreu and Glanville .
I ’m not knocking that
decision because both of those guys are solid baseball players , but I think
I could have contributed .
I think they squandered my talent down in Triple - A .
Even last year , when I had such a solid year–good batting average , driving
in runs , scoring runs –I did n’t even get a September callup .
It ’s
frustrating .
I was n’t even on their 40 - man roster .
To me , it seems like you
ca n’t argue with a solid season .
BP : You mentioned that you were squeezed out in Philadelphia .
If you
go back a little further , the Marlins brought in Moises Alou just
when you were arriving from Triple - A Charlotte .
So , in both those
situations you were kind of the odd man out .
With that history , it ’s curious to me that you signed with the Tigers as a
minor - league free agent in January after they made a big splash by trading
for Juan Gonzalez in November .
What prompted you to make that decision ?
McMillon : I knew the starting three outfield positions were
basically set , with Higginson , Gonzalez and Juan Encarnacion , but I
thought the fourth and fifth outfield spots were pretty much wide open .
I
knew that they had Luis Polonia , but I thought it would be a great
opportunity to be a reserve outfielder here .
It was a better situation than
any of the other offers I had at the time .
I felt that if I reported in
shape and had a good spring I would have a very good chance of making the
team .
BP : Some of the members of this year ’s coaching staff at Toledo
called you one of the most professional , hard - working players that they had
ever been around and were extremely impressed with your approach towards
the game .
How have you kept your positive attitude despite not getting many
breaks the last few years ?
McMillon :
That ’s a question of character .
My parents did a really
good job of instilling a strong work ethic , a never - give - up , never - quit
attitude and the strength to persevere .
I would n’t play this game if I did n’t think that I could contribute at this
level .
Sometimes getting back to the majors is a tough road .
The last time
I was in the big leagues was ’ 97 .
That ’s almost three years I ’ve been in
the minor leagues .
It ’s humbling .
And Toledo is a tough place to play .
I
really had to motivate myself to go there and do extra work or whatever I
needed to do .
Sometimes it ’s just not fair .
BP : Let ’s end on a lighter note .
Earlier in the year when you had an
18 - game hitting streak , I understand you pulled a Howard Hughes and quit
clipping your fingernails .
Good thing it did n’t go 35 games .
McMillon : ( laughing )
That ’s one of the things that I never want to
do : get into a situation where I ’m superstitious , because so much of this
game is out of your control .
That ’s just something I noticed one day and
thought , " Hey , I have n’t cut my fingernails and I ’ve been hitting .
Do n’t cut your fingernails " .
But when the streak was snapped , I do n’t
think I even got to the shower before I clipped them .

PARIS ( Reuters ) - France formally suspended on Thursday the commercial use of genetically modified ( GMO ) seeds in the country until early February and ordered a biotech safety study .
The future of GMOs has long been the subject of heated debate in France -- Europe ’s top grain producer -- and the country ’s reluctance to use GMO crops compares starkly with the United States , which is far more tolerant of the technology .
The French agriculture ministry said it had charged a newly set - up committee with assessing the environmental and health implications of using GMO seeds reliant on the MON 810 technology developed by U.S. biotech giant Monsanto .
“ As a result , there is a need to suspend the end -use of MON 810 maize seeds and related sales while awaiting the results of this mission , ” it said in a circular .
Thursday ’s formal suspension until February 9 at the latest , when parliament is slated to vote on a new biotech law , only concerns MON 810 maize , as it is the sole GMO technology permitted for cultivation in France and the European Union .
Stressing that the suspension was temporary , Monsanto slammed France ’s action .
“ While remembering its desire to respect French law , Monsanto thinks that such a decision is a scandal bereft of scientific foundation and incoherent with the environmental benefits of this technology , ” the company said .
Seed makers also decried the move in a statement , echoing Monsanto ’s complaint that there was no scientific justification .
NO IMMEDIATE IMPACT
France ’s move came as Germany announced it had lifted a temporary sales ban on MON 810 technology after Monsanto agreed to additional monitoring of its cultivation in Germany .
France ’s suspension will have no immediate impact on farmers using the pest resistant GMO seeds given that the country ’s maize harvest is in its final stages and new sowings will not take place until April , 2008 .
Pro-GMO farmers have urged Paris to speed up plans to create a higher GMO authority and pass a biotech law well before April in the hope that the dispute can be settled and MON 810 seeds can be bought well in time for the next sowings .
Those harboring fears over the potential impact of GMO crops on peoples ’ health and the country ’s bio-diversity hope a new authority will find ways to counter European Union decisions on GMO and permanently ban their use in France .
We first covered breaking the commodity 27MHz radios used in wireless keyboards , mice , and presenters when [ Luis Miras ] gave a talk at Black Hat .
Since then , the people at Dreamlab have managed to crack the encryption on Microsoft ’s Wireless Optical Desktop 1000 and 2000 products ( and possibly more ) .
Analyzing the protocol they found out that meta keys like shift and ALT are transmitted in cleartext .
The “ encryption ” used on each regular keystroke involves XORing the key against a random one byte value determined during the initial sync with the receiver .
So , if you sniff the handshake , you can decrypt the keystrokes .
You really do n’t have to though ; there are only 256 possible encryption keys .
Using a dictionary file you can check all possible keys and determine the correct one after only receiving 20 - 50 keystrokes .
Their demo video shows them sniffing keystrokes from three different keyboards at the same time .
Someone could potentially build a wireless keylogger that picks up every keystrokes from every keyboard in an office .
You can read more about the attack in the whitepaper ( pdf ) .

WHEN Rena Wilson Jones and her husband , Drew , were building a house 10 years ago in a subdivision near the edge of Urbana , Ill. , they knew the property was likely to be windy , bordered as it was by open fields to the north and west .
But they did not realize how fierce the winds would be until construction of their house was under way .
In the decade that followed , the wind drove Ms. Wilson Jones crazy from November through April , she said , whipping across her yard and making it difficult to work in the garden .
At times , it was hard to walk outside .
Eventually , the couple decided to capitalize on their affliction .
Last summer , they installed a 56 - foot wind turbine in their yard to draw electrical power from the wind , which sometimes gets up to 40 miles per hour .
They did the work themselves over a weekend , digging a four - foot - deep hole for the foundation and raising the $ 13,000 turbine with a winch on their Jeep .
It was spinning by early September , and their electricity bills dropped sharply , from $ 90 to $ 10 for November , one of the windier months .
“ Now , the faster the wind goes , the happier I am , ” said Ms. Wilson Jones , a director of nursing at Community Blood Services of Illinois .
Until recently , wind turbines were used primarily by those who lived outside the range of local utility lines , or who wanted to live completely off the grid .
Now , reductions in their size and cost , along with improvements in their efficiency , are allowing suburban homeowners with no dissident leanings to speak of to install them in growing numbers , with concerns over rising energy costs and global warming driving the demand .
Controversial Fashioniser Nicholas Morley sent models down the catwalk on Saturday night with clothing that spoke out against convicted drug smuggler Schapelle Corby .
The slogan tees , now a major trend in world fashion circles and often used for relaying cultural and political messages , were this time emblazoned with ‘ Four Kilo Anti-Hero . ’

Police also raided the home of the IT worker 's father
A flat on Teesside and several properties in Amsterdam were raided as part of an Interpol investigation into the members - only website OiNK .
The UK - run site has leaked 60 major pre-release albums this year alone , said the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ( IFPI ) .
A 24 - year - old man from Middlesbrough was arrested on Tuesday morning .
' Extremely lucrative '
The IT worker was led from his home in the town 's Grange Road and is being questioned on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud and infringement of copyright law .
At the same time his employer - a large multi-national company - and his father 's home were also raided .
Within a few hours of a popular pre-release track being posted on the OiNK site , hundreds of copies can be found
IFPI spokesman
A Cleveland Police spokesman said : " This extremely lucrative and creative scheme consisted of a private file - sharing website being set up .
Membership was by invitation only .
" The site allowed the uploading and downloading of pre-release music and media to thousands of members . "
An IFPI spokesman said : " Once an album had been posted on the OiNK website , the users that download that music then passed the content to other websites , forums and blogs , where multiple copies were made .
" Within a few hours of a popular pre-release track being posted on the OiNK site , hundreds of copies can be found further down the illegal online supply chain . "
The site 's servers , based in Amsterdam , were seized in a series of raids last week .
It followed a two - year investigation by music industry bodies the IFPI and the British Phonographic Industry ( BPI ) .
I 'm not sure if this is enforceable , but it 's a good ruling :
A federal magistrate ordered the White House on Tuesday to reveal whether copies of possibly millions of missing e-mails are stored on computer backup tapes .
The order by U.S. Magistrate Judge John Facciola comes amid an effort by the White House to scuttle two lawsuits that could force the Executive Office of the President to recover any e-mail that has disappeared from computer servers where electronic documents are automatically archived .
In their lawsuits , the National Security Archive and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington suggest the e-mails were improperly deleted from White House computer servers .
Over 5 million White House e-mails are missing , CREW alleged .
Recently , the group said it has been told by reliable sources that the actual figure of missing e-mail is over 10 million .

Also , the Federal Records

Django template utilities
In the course of working on a couple personal projects ( which will be released eventually ) , I found myself factoring out a lot of common code and making it more and more generic , until one day I realized I had a whole separate application just waiting to be documented and bundled .
So here it is : template_utils , a collection of generic and useful tags , filters and other tools related to Django templates .
Full documentation is on the project wiki at Google Code , and distributed with the download .
Even though I ’m using most of the code already in my own projects , I ’m still labeling this a 0.1 release and giving it a development status of “ beta ” ; feedback and bug reports ( there ’s also an issue tracker over there , please do n’t post bug reports in comments here ) are appreciated .

Roland S. Martin : Sen. Barack Obama 's win in the Iowa caucuses proves he 's electable .
( CNN ) --
You may find a bunch of political operatives who will suggest that they always believed a black man named Barack Obama would blow away his competitors in Iowa and would destroy the inevitability of a former first lady who is a member of the U.S. Senate .
If that 's the case , just walk away because they are lying .
I was there on that frigid February day in Springfield , Illinois , when Obama , standing in the shadows of the old Capitol where Abraham Lincoln delivered his famous " House Divided " speech , announced his candidacy for president .
While the senator 's soaring rhetoric was warmly received , it was assumed that , if he could just survive the first two states , maybe he would n't embarrass himself .
But the game has changed , and all of a sudden , there is a sense that Obama could win this thing .
Watch Martin discuss what difference Iowa has made »
Yet even after getting dusted by nine points in Iowa and watching Obama walk away with more female voters than herself , Hillary Clinton continues to assert that it will be impossible for Obama to get elected in November against a Republican challenger .
When I asked Obama about that in an interview for my radio show on WVON in Chicago and for CNN , he could n't help but laugh .

" Look at what happened in Iowa , " the senator said .
" We had Republicans who crossed over to vote for me .
We had more independents caucusing for me than anybody .
That 's the reason why the polls show I 'm the only Democrat that beats every Republican .
" What I think they are suggesting is that being engaged in this brutal brawl with the Republicans , that that 's somehow the recipe for Democrats to win .
I disagree .
The strategy is to pick off Republicans and independents by having a positive agenda for change . "
He added , " You ca n't say someone 's not electable when they keep on winning elections . "
But there is something else going on here .
Obama is the first candidate of his generation truly to be an agent of change who inspires , motivates and ignites the passion in a large segment of Americans who had ignored politics because it was unseemly and did n't move people to action .
My e-mail inbox and my talk show lines filled up with people who say that listening to Obama empowers them to get involved , that he is able to connect with them on an emotional and spiritual level that is reminiscent of John and Robert Kennedy and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr .
Sure , for a significant segment , Ronald Reagan represented that kind of hope in 1980 .
Gary
Hart had the potential to do that , until his personal issues derailed his campaign for the 1988 election .
And Bill Clinton touched the hearts and minds of the baby boomers in 1992 .
But this appears to be something different .
Obama seeks to serve as a bridge between the divisions in America that exist between young and old , haves and have - nots , liberals and conservatives , Republicans and Democrats .
It 's reminiscent of Lincoln 's speech and King 's book , " Why We Can't Wait , " a compilation of his letters from the Birmingham jail .
At the end of the day , Obama is trying to speak to the core of America that says we can overcome all the barriers that exist between us if we simply are willing to trust in one another .
Now he takes his campaign to New Hampshire , another predominantly white state , where there are a ton of independents who could vault him to the top of the field .
Will these New Englanders buy the hope of Obama and send him to South Carolina with another victory ?
Will African - Americans who fear whites wo n't vote for Obama now see his Iowa win as validation that those fears are unfounded ?
Simply put , will America be willing to walk away from what some say is a sure thing of a Clinton in the White House and embrace a man who says we can do all things if we just believe enough in ourselves ?
It all might sound like New Age mumbo jumbo .
But the more Obama speaks and the more goose bumps that are raised , the more he makes the eight years Bill Clinton spent in the White House seem like ancient history and an Obama White House as the dawn of a new day for America .

12,000 more Iowa GOP voters were expected than showed for the Straw Poll - a rejection of the field ?
Does the low turnout and surprising finish of Gov. Mike Huckabee signal an end to a generation of strident anti-abortion politics ?
There were 12,000 winners of the Iowa Straw Poll in Ames this weekend , those being the 12,000 GOP voters that were expected to attend but did n't , according to Iowa Independent , possibly signaling what many other polls report , they are n't excited about the entire GOP field .
Most Americans are paying little attention to the Iowa results , so wo n't know that the media generated from this event is the result of a tiny number ( 14,302 ) of votes being cast .
For those people who are paying attention , questions about the validity of an event like this are paramount .
One other outcome could be that the strident anti-abortion politics of the far right is put in check .
Low turnout events , like the State Fair Straw Poll , are tailor made for single - issue candidates and causes , and in fact were the strategic vehicle the far - right used to take over many moderate GOP precincts and eventually state parties starting in the late 1970's and 1980's .
That the abortion issue became so prominent leading up to this event and yet the anti-abortion movement 's Chief Inquisitor , Sam Brownback , could n't muster more than 2192 votes , speaks volumes .
The surprisingly low turnout , half of what was expected , makes this event all the more questionable as a way to sort the field , especially given that much of the field was n't playing along : Rudy Giuliani and John McCain made it clear they were n't spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to get a couple thousand votes .
Fred " can I be president without running "
Thompson , says he 'll be in Iowa next week and Newt " show a little leg " Gingrich was at the straw poll speaking , but not yet on the ballot .
Romney , who spent $ 2 million for just over 4000 votes walks away the expected winner .
The only way Romney could have made real news in Iowa was by losing after all the money he spent .
But his home town newspaper , the Boston Globe , uses the word " trounces " in the headline and talks about the vote in percentage terms without mentioning that the total number of voters would only fill one - third of Fenway Park .

Mike Huckabee is the real winner , to the extent there is a " winner " , because his campaign spent almost nothing , talked about a broad range of issues and got more votes than the single issue candidates .
Mike Huckabee may have found Cinderella 's slipper at the State Fair in Ames .
As an ordained minister with a more prevention oriented anti-abortion message combined with support for improved maternal health care and child support , he may represent a new , more moderate wave of anti-abortion politics .
His campaign style is clearly more positive and he more likable than many anti-abortion candidates .
Sam Brownback , wildly spinning what has to be a disappointing , and expensive , third place finish , claims that he is now " clearly in the top tier " — true if he is talking about the Ames straw poll which is now over .
In every other poll , he 's still in the bottom tier and those polls do n't punish people for not coming to the State Fair , as Iowa Republicans did McCain , Giuliani and Thompson .
Brownback was all abortion all the time , using the most negative campaign tactics and spending aggressively to take on Romney on this one issue .
His third place finish , seriously calls into question the effectiveness of abortion - only politics moving forward .
Putting an end to a generation of the most vitriolic anti-abortion , anti-woman , anti-contraception and anti-sex campaigning , which corresponded with a rise in the personalization of politics and a lowering of civil discourse , would make the national political dialog the biggest winner of the Ames Straw Poll .
Like Brownback , Tom Tancredo parlayed single issue focus , immigration , into a State Fair top tier finish , so Brownback and Tancredo can leave the Iowa State Fair feeling like 4H King and Queen .
At the end of the day they are both politicos and have to realize the money did n't buy the love they needed , and that people in Iowa and the rest of the country expect more than single issue focus from people who want to be President .
For the record , here are the results from the GOP Iowa State Fair Poll at which " voters " paid $ 35 to vote , and were wined , dined and transported by the candidates :

Wow , what an exciting time to be watching the Amazon Cloud Platform evolve .
We ’re just beginning to think through the recent SimpleDB announcement when Amazon launches DevPay .
Lucid Era CEO
Ken Rudin says land grabs are all about a race to the top of the mountain to plant your flag there first .
It seems like Amazon has hired a helicopter in the quest to get there first .
Google , Yahoo , and others are barely talking about their cloud platforms and here is Amazon with new developments piling up on each other .
And unlike some of the developments announced by companies like Google , this stuff is ready to go .
They ’re not just talking about it .
What ’s DevPay all about , anyway ?
Simply put , Amazon are providing a service to automate your billing .
If you use their web services to offer a service of your own , it gives you the ability to let Amazon deal with billing for you .
It ’s based off the pricing model for the rest of the Amazon Web Services like EC2 and S3 , but you can use any combination of one - time charges , recurring monthly charges , and metered Amazon Web Service usage .
You have total flexibility to price your applications either higher or lower than your AWS usage .
In addition , they ’re promising to put everything they know about how to do e-commerce ( and who knows more than Amazon ? ) behind making the user experience great for your customers and you .
It ’s not a tremendous big step forward , but it ’s useful .
It ’s another brick in the wall .
There are companies out there providing SaaS infrastructure for whom billing is a big piece of their offering , so obviously it is a problem that people care about having solved .
What are the pros and cons of this particular approach ?
Let ’s start with the pros .
If you are going to use Amazon Web Services anyway , DevPay makes the process dead simple for you to get paid for your service .
It ’s ideal for microISV ’s as a way to monetize their creations .
The potential is there for interesting revenue that ’s tied to usage in the classic SaaS way .
What about the cons ?
Here there are many , depending on what sort of business you are in and how you want to be percieved by customers .
I break it down into two major concerns : flexibility and branding .
Let ’s start with branding , which I think is the more important concern .
It ’s not clear to me from the announcement how you would go about disassociating your offering from Amazon so that it becomes your stand alone brand .
You and your customers are going to have to acknowledge and accept that the offering you provide is part of the Amazon collective .
Resistance is futile .
This is the moral equivalent of not being able to accept a credit card directly , and instead having to refer customers to PayPal .
It works , but it detracts a from your “ big time ” image .
If having a big time stand - alone image is important for you , DevPay is a non-starter at this stage .
It ’s not clear to me that Amazon would have to keep it that way for all time , but perhaps they need to protect their own image as well , and would insist on it .
Second major problem is flexibility .
Yes , Amazon says you can “ use any combination of one - time charges , recurring monthly charges , and metered Amazon Web Service usage ” .
That sounds flexible , but it casts your business in light of what resources it consumes on Amazon .
Suppose you want a completely different metric ?
Perhaps you have another expense that is not well correlated with Amazon of some kind that has to be built in , for example .
Perhaps you need to do something completely arbitrary .
It does n’t look to me like Amazon can facilitate that at the present .
Both of these limitations are things Amazon could choose to clean up .
So far , the impression one gets is that Amazon is just putting a pretty face on the considerable internal resources they ’ve developed for their primary business and making them available .
What will be interesting is to see what happens when ( and if ) Amazon is prepared to add value in ways that never mattered to their core business .
Meanwhile , they ’re doing a great job stealing a march on potential competition .
As a SaaS business , they should be quite sticky .
Anyone that writes for their platform will have a fair amount of work to back out and try another platform .
DevPay is another example .
It will create network lock - in by tying your customer ’s business relationship in terms of billing and payment to Amazon , and in turn tying that to your use of Amazon Web Services .
For example , that same lack of flexibility might prevent you from migrating your S3 or EC2 usages to , say , Google .
There does n’t look to be a way for you to build the Google costs into your billing in a flexible way .
We ’ll see the next 5 to 10 years be a rich period of innovation and transition to Cloud Computing Platforms .
Just as many of the original PC OS platforms disappeared ( CP / M anyone ? ) after an initial flurry of activity , and others have changed radically in importance ( it no longers matters whether you run PC or Mac does it ? ) , so too will there be dramatic changes here .
The beneficiaries will be users as well as the platform vendors , but it ’s going to take nimbleness and prescient thinking to place all your bets exactly right .
The good news is the cost of making a mistake is far less than it had been in the era of building your own datacenters !

Terrorist watch list ineffective , prone to misuse , say privacy advocates RAW STORY
Published : Saturday August 25 , 2007
Print This Email This Questions have arisen over the United States government 's use of its terrorist screening database , reports the Washington Post today .
While the database " flagged " people as suspected terrorists about 20,000 times in 2006 , few were arrested or barred from entering the country as a result of being on the list .
Gathering data from an increasing number of resources , including airline data , government agencies use the database in situations such as a traffic stop or a border crossing .
While the government has proven secretive on the individuals in the database and the data it has amassed , there are plans to share the data with " private sector groups . "
Data amassed is kept for 99 years .
From a civil liberties standpoint , privacy advocates are alarmed by the massive amounts of data being collected on the thousands of people being added to this list when relatively few arrests are being made as a result .
" This really confirms the long - standing fear that this list is inaccurate and ultimately ineffective as an anti-terrorism tool , " says David Sobel of the Electronic Frontier Foundation , also citing the high possibility of " false positives . "
Rick Kopel , deputy director of the Terrorist Screening Center , on the other hand , calls the list " one of the best things the government has been able to accomplish since 9/11 . "
Jayson P. Ahern , deputy commissioner for U.S. Customs and Border Protection , says that the database needs to be handled as it is to focus on " potentially dangerous individuals " who " fly beneath the radar . "
TSC spokesperson Michelle Petrovich says that one must be a " known or suspected terrorist " to be added to the 235,000 - record database , which includes financing terrorist activities , belonging to a terrorist organization , or otherwise provides support to a terrorist or terrorist organization .
While people are not told when they are under suspicion , it 's not always difficult to venture a guess .
American citizen and Ohio resident Abe Dabdoub has been detained 21 times at the Canadian border , having been handcuffed the first four times .
" For national security reasons , " Dabdoub says , he is not told by officers why he is being detained .
American citizens on the list are questioned and released if no arrest warrants are found .
Says FBI spokesperson Paul Bresson , " A lot of times it 's not to our advantage to make an arrest .
We do n't want the subject to know what we know . "
Possible misuse of the database is alleged not only in an ACLU lawsuit on behalf of ten Muslims who say they were added without cause , but by Colorado activist Francisco " Kiko " Martinez , who has been detained twice during traffic stops .
Martinez won a $ 106,500 settlement from authorities that , while not an official admission , Martinez says proves that he should n't have been on the list to begin with , and was only added due to his political activities .

US presidential candidates pledge support to Pakistani dictator
By Patrick Martin
31 December 2007
The response of the leading US presidential candidates to the December 27 assassination of former Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto has been to pledge continued American support to the Musharraf military dictatorship , with little more than lip service to the democratic rights of the people of Pakistan .
While offering a variety of criticisms , either of US government policy or of their rivals for the presidential nomination , both Democrats and Republicans embraced the basic framework of the Bush administration ’s approach , which views the Musharraf regime as the most reliable guarantor of the interests of US imperialism in the region .
Not one of the candidates so much as mentioned the likelihood that the military regime itself organized the murder of Bhutto , either on direct orders from Musharraf himself or by sections of the military - intelligence apparatus , which maintains close ties to Islamic fundamentalist groups .
The Republican candidates cited the apparent suicide bombing as another example of terrorist attacks going back to 9/11 , and each sought to posture as the future commander - in - chief most determined to continue the Bush administration ’s “ war on terror . ”
Former New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Senator John McCain of Arizona , who have focused their campaigns on terrorism and the war in Iraq , respectively , were the most fervent in seeking to whip up popular fear for their own political benefit .
Giuliani rushed out a statement calling the Bhutto assassination a “ reminder that terrorism anywhere — whether in New York , London , Tel Aviv or Rawalpindi — is an enemy of freedom . ”
His campaign also unveiled a new television commercial including footage of the 9/11 attacks .
McCain openly sought to exploit the event politically , raising the Pakistani events repeatedly in campaign appearances in Iowa .
He boasted of his personal acquaintance with Bhutto and Musharraf , declaring that Bhutto ’s murder “ may serve to enhance those credentials or make people understand that I ’ve been to Waziristan , I know Musharraf , I can pick up the phone and call him . ”
He told reporters in New Hampshire that he continues “ to believe Musharraf has done a pretty good job , done a lot of the things that we wanted him to do . ”
McCain called the Pakistani dictator “ personally scrupulously honest , ” although he heads one of the most corrupt regimes on the planet , in which top military officers routinely end their careers as multimillionaires .
Another leading Republican , former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney , issued a self - contradictory statement asserting that no one knew who was responsible for Bhutto ’s assassination , while at the same time blaming “ global , radical , violent jihadism . ”
The Republican frontrunner in Iowa , former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee , provided the most parochial response to the Bhutto killing , attempting to link it to the issue of illegal immigration in the United States , an issue on which he has been under fire from his rivals for being insufficiently reactionary .
He claimed that unrest in Pakistan was particularly troubling because “ we have more Pakistani illegals coming across our border than all other nationalities , except those immediately south of the border . ”
Huckabee followed up this bizarre assertion — the total number of Pakistanis detained for illegal entry into the US was only 660 over the most recent four - year period — by warning , “ the immigration issue is not so much about people coming across to pick lettuce or make beds , it ’s about people who can come with a shoulder - fired missile and can do serious damage and harm to us . ”
On the Democratic side of the presidential contest , there were equally brazen efforts to use the Bhutto assassination to score points based on past experience in national security matters .
Former senator John Edwards announced that he had spoken with Musharraf on the telephone after the killing , while Senator Joseph Biden , chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee , cited his own past declarations that nuclear - armed Pakistan is “ the most dangerous nation on the planet . ”
One Democrat , New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson , called for Musharraf to step down and urged the Bush administration to halt all military aid to Pakistan .
He went so far as to link Bhutto ’s murder to Musharraf ’s declaration of martial law , but when questioned by reporters , Richardson endorsed the consensus view that Al Qaeda terrorists , and not Musharraf , were responsible for the assassination .
Richardson said , “ Some of my Democratic opponents have misplaced faith in Musharraf .
Like the Bush administration , they cling to the misguided notion that Musharraf can be trusted as an ally to fight terrorism . ”
This formulation suggests that Musharraf ’s main offense was an inadequate military effort against Taliban and Al Qaeda militants in the mountainous Afghanistan - Pakistan border region , not his brutal suppression of the democratic rights of the Pakistani people .
The two Democratic frontrunners , Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama , each used the Bhutto assassination to argue that the Bush administration had become too preoccupied with the war in Iraq to conduct an effective foreign policy in Afghanistan , South Asia or the world in general .
Clinton noted her past acquaintance with Benazir Bhutto , and criticized the Bush administration for a policy that “ put way too much emphasis on Musharraf instead of dealing with broader Pakistani society . ”
But she declined to endorse Richardson ’s call for the removal of Musharraf .
Clinton ’s husband , former president Bill Clinton , addressed the issue in apocalyptic language , telling a meeting in Iowa Saturday that unforeseen catastrophes like the Bhutto killing made it necessary to select “ a leader who is strong and commanding and convincing enough ... to deal with the unexpected . ”
“ There is a better than 50 percent chance that sometime in the first year or 18 months of the next presidency , something will happen that is not being discussed in this campaign , ” he said .
“ And if you ’re not ready for that , then everything else you do can be undermined .
You need a president that you trust to deal with something that we will not discuss in this campaign . ”
Obama cited the Bhutto assassination to bolster his argument that Ms. Clinton was too closely associated with the Bush administration ’s foreign policy because of her vote in 2002 to authorize the war in Iraq .
“ I ’ve been saying for some time that we ’ve got a very big problem ” in Pakistan , Obama said .
“ We were distracted from focusing on them . ”
The war in Iraq had “ resulted in us taking our eye off the ball ” in terms of the struggle against Al Qaeda , he concluded .
Despite his posture as a candidate of “ change , ” Obama ’s position is virtually identical to that espoused by the Democratic presidential candidate in 2004 , John Kerry , who argued that the war in Iraq was a diversion from the more important “ war ” against Al Qaeda and terrorism , which a Democratic administration would wage more effectively than the Republicans .
Last summer Obama caused a brief political stir when he advocated a US invasion of Pakistan to capture Osama bin Laden and destroy Taliban and Al Qaeda forces hiding out in the border region .
All of the major presidential candidates , Democrat and Republican alike , stand on a common platform of defending American imperialism .
Some Democrats , like Richardson and Obama , emphasize diplomacy and dialogue ; others , like Clinton and the Republicans , are more open supporters of military action .
But their fundamental goal is the same : upholding the strategic and economic interests of the American financial aristocracy .
Richard Clayton , a security researcher at Cambridge University , knows how to spot unsolicited junk mail - but even he had to look twice at what arrived in his inbox recently .
The mail invited him to put a link to bustem.com from his website .
When he looked at bustem.com , he found a collection of security articles written by people he had n't heard of .
As an academic and author for the security blog lightbluetouchpaper.org , Clayton has an eye for good writing - especially security writing .
What he found on bustem.com did n't make him very happy .
" I had a look at it and I was n't very impressed , " he says .
" There were spelling mistakes , ridiculous bits of grammar , words missing from sentences and so forth . "
Web credibility
He traced bustem.org to Privila , an Illinois - based company that uses unpaid interns to produce large amounts of content that it then uses on its websites .
The company , which expects a minimum commitment of 150 hours or 50 articles from each intern over a 15 - week period , retains ownership of the content they produce .
Bustem.com is n't the only site in Privila 's network , according to Clayton 's colleague Steven J Murdoch , whose research last month turned up a network of almost 300 sites connected to Privila - up from 153 in April .
Privila 's public mandate is to " preserve the value and credibility of information on the web " .
Executives would not comment on the business model , and interns approached by the Guardian said they were bound by a non-disclosure agreement , but the websites it operates have something in common other than identical visual design : they all carry advertisements from either Google or Yahoo !.
Google 's advertising business has two main strands .
Its Adwords service is aimed at companies who want their advertisements to appear on participating web sites .
The websites that display the ads are part of a programme called Adsense .
Google 's website indexing system analyses each Adsense website and tries to display advertisements that are relevant to its content .
Every time a visitor to an Adsense website clicks on an Adsense advertisement , the owner of the site gets some of the money that the advertiser pays to Google .
The internet is replete with sites that post content optimised purely to drive ad traffic rather than having any value of its own .
The internet marketing community even has a term for them : made for Adsense ( MFA ) .
But the value of online content is a subjective issue .
Who is to say what is an MFA site , and what is n't ?
" There 's a fine line between clever search engine optimisation techniques and sites built purely to attract search engines , " muses Paul Moore of AdsBlackList.com , which operates an MFA blacklist .
Sites ( not associated with Privila ) that he calls MFA include mobiledownloads4u.com , which last week was serving up nine Google ads , in a premium position above a single page of unattributed mobile phone - related article content .
He highlights Myfirstnewsite.org as another , which contains content identical to the second paragraph of text at infobuy.
info/?p=107 .
Some MFA sites are obvious , says Clayton , because they 're generated by machines that create gibberish solely to fool the search engines ' indexers .
But many MFA sites use content that is clearly written by people .
Where do you draw the line ?
" Most of the articles are pretty inane , and generally you get the feeling that if you click on the ads , you 'll go somewhere better , " he says .
There is a market for the bland content used by many MFA sites , says Andy Beard , an internet marketer who maintains links with what he calls the search engine optimisation " blackhat " community .
Beard has dabbled in the private label rights business - a community of writers and brokers who produce , rehash and distribute articles for customers who need to fill sites with content quickly .
" People got the idea that the content does n't have to be 100 % unique .
Someone could modify an article slightly so that it still appears as unique content to the search engines . "
Sites using this content have to make at least part of them unique , because they want to avoid the same content appearing on multiple sites and decreasing their search ranking , says Beard - but search engines can often be fooled by articles that are partly the same .
Such sites will spin single articles , sometimes producing hundreds of different versions of the same article .
The process is so systematic that a market for automatically spinning software and services has arisen .
Spunwrite , for example , divides up customers ' articles into snippets that the service 's hired writers then rewrite into multiple versions .
The matrix of snippets can them be reassembled into many different combinations .
Software such as WebSite Content Wizard professes to help article spinners do it themselves at home , and allows them to insert relevant keywords into their text to keep their Google rankings up .
Collections of articles are sold in packages , for as little as $ 1 per 500 - word piece .
Customers spin them into thousands of articles designed to draw traffic to sites laden with adverts or other profitable payloads such as email collection forms or credit card payment systems .
Would - be writers
But who writes the seed content in the first place ?
Canada - based Dave Markel uses sites like Rentacoder.com or elance.com to source original articles .
Via these sites , he recruits would - be writers who want to turn a quick profit .
" I started paying between $ 5 and $ 7 per 500 - word article .
I was using the emerging markets - Pakistan , India and Romania .
But you could tell that they were taught English as a second language , " he says .
" So I started looking at the US , Canada , Britain , and Australia .
Now I pay between $ 10 and $ 15 per article , but I do n't have to do nearly as much editing . "
Markel says that his writers are stay - at - home mothers , students and others wanting to write for money .
The same applies to companies not in the private label rights business who are trying to create a more branded market for amateur content .
Suite101.com , for example , publishes articles from its 900 writers only on its own subdomains , rather than putting it on large numbers of apparently unrelated sites , as Privila does .
It also pays its authors a commission on the Google ad revenue from their articles , and relinquishes online copyright to the author after a year .
But is the content any good ?
Editing and review is done mostly after the content is published online , rather than before , admits editor - in - chief and former Globe and Mail writer Joy Gugeler .
" Stuff slips through , but we 're trying to tighten the net . "
Helium.com also pays writers a cut of advertising revenue .
It asks readers to rank articles by reading two alongside each other and voting on the best one , says CEO Mark Ranalli .
eHow focuses on step - by - step how - to articles , and contributors get paid according to their ranking by readers , says general manager Gregory Boudewijn .
These sites all manage their content quality with varying degrees of success .
Clayton pokes fun at examples of naive content that he found on some of them ; one of the steps in an eHow.com guide to working as a reporter abroad is " go to a country " .
But the sites are at least trying to deliver financial rewards to writers rather than using them for free .
Background checking
Ben Edelman , an expert investigator of spyware affiliate networks , argues that the content used in many sites designed more explicitly for MFA purposes is far from useful for advertisers .

That was n't enough for Adsblacklist.com 's Moore , who removed all sites under his control from the Adsense program last week .
He cites frustration with the number of MFA sites that he believes make it through Google 's filtering system .
" Because it 's becoming so difficult to identify these sites , a lot of them are allowed into programs like Adsense without enough background checking , " he says .
The debate over whether the copy is there purely to fill the space between the ads has been raging in print publishing for years .
Internet publishing has taken this to a new level .
Content 's eligibility as MFA ad fodder comes down to the quality of online writing , which sits in a spectrum from insightful reporting and well - crafted , thoughtful prose at one end through to machine - generated nonsense at the other .
Both of those are recognisable for what they are .
But for people like Clayton and Edelman , it 's the stuff in the middle that is causing consternation .

I just wanted to follow up on Brian ’s awesome post detailing Sony BMG ’s plans to sell DRM - free music through Amazon as part of a Super Bowl promotion by making a few additional points :
Digital music sales are quite literally the only bright spot in an ailing business –whereas digital downloads rose by 50 percent in 2007 , sales of physical CDs , particularly full albums , continue to tank .
This is a logical progression of the business as it moves towards a singles - driven model .
Unless you have the clout of Jay - Z and can force digital retailers to sell your album only as a single piece and not individual tracks , the era of the album ( or “ CD ” ) may be coming to a close , at least in terms of vendor sales .
CDs will probably continue to sell like hotcakes on tour , particularly promotional CDs .
Artists who have experimented with bypassing the major labels and selling tracks directly to fans have met with mixed results .
Nine Inch Nails ’ Trent Reznor offered fans the chance to download tracks from fellow artist Saul Williams for free , or to buy higher - quality versions for $ 5 .
The majority went for the free version , once again proving Mike Masnick ’s theory that you can compete with “ free ” only if you add value enough to the product to make it worth the cost .
As Masnick points out , Saul Williams probably has a lot more publicity now from this experiment , so when the album comes out , he may get a lot more in the way of listeners .
Speaking of artists who have tried to bypass typical channels to sell their music directly , Radiohead ’s Thom Yorke makes the very valid point that artists often see next to nothing in terms of real profit from their via - download sales , because their contracts were negotiated to nickel - and - dime every last bit of money away from them , or simply do n’t address e-music sales at all .
Much like the writers in Hollywood striking to win rights for profit from content on the Internet , downloadable music means the artists should be able and willing to renegotiate contracts that cut out the middleman and get the profits where they belong .
Sony BMG is the lone holdout record company that has not committed to sales of DRM - free music .
For the company to ignore a revenue goldmine that could come from competing with Apple ’s notorious “ walled garden ” of iTunes and undercutting their price model is , simply put , bad business .
Sony already has a tarnished reputation thanks to the CD rootkit scandal , and even its preeminence in the DVD format wars and sales of the PS3 have n’t completely erased that issue from the public ’s mind .
To cheat itself out of profit through legal music sales just to prove a point is financially unwise at best , but this is the music industry we ’re talking about .
This is an exciting and fascinating time to be a music lover , though I ’m sure it ’s an intensely aggravating and disheartening time to be in the music business .
And in order to remain a business–one that ’s viable and competitive –the industry is going to have to dramatically readjust its models of success , from committing fully to selling MP3s without any copy protection , to giving artists more profit and control off e-music sales on the back end , to ending the practice of drumming up new revenue streams by suing people into oblivion .
You ca n’t fight the future , as I often say .
8 - tracks , albums , VHS tapes , and many brick - and - mortar chains have passed or are passing into history , but music itself endures and thrives .
The medium and the format may change , but the art lives forever .
In order for the business to endure and thrive along with the art , the industry needs to stop treating customers like criminals and give them what they want .
Years ago , an online gaming legend named Dennis Fong won a Ferrari 328 convertible in an online gaming competition .
I remember watching him as a teenager in awe as he did things other gamers never could .
He was a favorite for the competition and I ’d say sweeped it .
Then he won the Ferrari of the man who built the game he dominated .
It was a teenage nerd ’s fairy tale come true .
Maybe someday we could also win a car like that .
Only to realize of course , that there was no way we could actually AFFORD the car once we had it .
Fong did n’t sell the car because he was more fortunate than most run of the mill gamers .
Having had additional gaming success and fantastic connections with budding online websites , he had more revenue available than typical college students waiting tables to pay for school .
Although , I also do n’t believe he got to ever drive it full time either .
Insurance , Gas , and Tires , would quickly eat up those funds .
So what happens in reality when you see someone win a new life , a new house , and the American Dream , on television ?
CNNMoney covered the winnings of the Cruz family in HGTV ’s annual Dream Home Sweepstakes .
They won $ 250,000 , a GMC Denali SUV , and a gigantic , fully furnished , barn - inspired mansion on an acre of lakefront property in the East Texas town of Tyler .
But what happens once the excitement is over and the bills for all those new toys come in ?
As the Cruzes toured the 6,000 - square - foot , three - story structure – more than seven times the size of their modest home outside Chicago – each feature seemed more fantastic than the one before : the massive great room with its 30 - foot ceilings and six - foot - wide fireplace ; the master bedroom suite – in effect , a separate cottage connected to the main house by a breezeway , replete with a hot tub ; the indoor elevator and the outdoor pool and fireplace ; the guest house by the lake .
As they passed through each room , Shelly found herself touching everything – running her fingers over the granite - topped island in the kitchen ; turning the knobs on the his - and - hers showerheads in the master bathroom ; opening the doors of the laundry room ’s two washers and two dryers .
“ I feel like I ’m looking at someone else ’s house – this ca n’t possibly be ours , ” Shelly said .
Added Don : “ I ’ve fantasized most of my life about living in a big house , but my dreams never came close to this . ”
But a year later , the Cruzes are learning , painfully , that there can be such a thing as too big .
Too big indeed .
Think about where you live for a moment .
Think about cooling and heating bills , water bills , landscaping and upkeep bills , and the other costs of owning .
Don , 41 , and Shelly , 38 , have never slept in the master bedroom–it ’s too secluded .
At night , Don obsessively checks a live video feed of Donald ’s room , two floors away from the bedroom they occupy , to make sure his son is okay .
The biggest problem , though , is that the Cruz family can’t afford their new bounty .
Don , a stay - at - home dad , and Shelly , an administrative assistant who ’s gone back to school to become an accountant , are quickly running through their winnings as they struggle to pay thousands a month for electricity , household help and other outsize bills for their outsize home .
On top of that , they had to take out a loan to pay off a $ 672,000 tax bill on their winnings .
Most people will never have to worry about the unexpected fallout from what looked to be a huge windfall .
But like the Cruzes , millions of Americans may soon find themselves struggling to pay the bills for a house that ’s bigger than they really need and suddenly more expensive than they can afford .
Ah yes , taxes .
Take a look at The Price Is Right and all the prizes being won .
Again , it seems like a dream come true for most , until you realize that you ’re the one that has to pay for them :
Do I have to pay taxes on any money or prizes I win ?
You do n’t have to , just like the IRS does n’t have to throw you in jail for not paying your taxes ( but they ’ll do it anyway ) .
Yes , you must pay taxes on your winnings .
If you win cash , the producers will typically deduct local taxes from that amount and give you a check for the difference .
If you win a prize , you ’ll get a 1099 and either have to pay the taxes yourself or forfeit your prize .
Contrary to popular belief , you cannot simply take the cash value of the prize .
Car winners also pay their own vehicle tag and registration fees .
But back to our story .. so what happened with the Cruz family ?
It was when Don first got the tax bill that he knew that the dream was over .
With no viable plan to pay for the upkeep on the house , let alone the tax bill , there was only one solution .
That night he huddled in the great room with his wife and son , knees touching , and told them they ’d have to sell .
Donald asked why .
But when he saw his father crying , he stopped asking .
The next day , they put the Dream Home up for sale .
Cruz originally tried to sell on his own , putting up a Web site , Doncruz.net , and listing the house for $ 5.5 million .
But he went several months without a serious offer and recently hired a broker .
But some agents in the area say he ’s aiming too high .
They say the house is worth $ 2.5 million and may go for a lot less since million - dollar homes are rare in that part of Texas .
The Cruzes say they will be sad to leave once a deal is made , but confess that they ’re also a little relieved .
The Dream Home , they admit , is just too big .
They miss their cozy quarters in Batavia .
“ With only one room to gather in you are forced to spend time together , ” says Cruz .
“ I miss that . ”
So next time you hear someone winning something spectacular , remember that everytime you win something , so does Uncle Sam .
Curious about the Extreme Home Makeover show I used to watch a good bit last year , some googling turned up a few related and very interested links .
I was once a computer science major .
It lasted a week and did not involve taking any actual computer science courses .
Then I came to my senses and studied literature and philosophy instead .
That decision has affected my life in two significant ways : 1 ) I still can't properly allocate memory in C , and 2 ) I face the prospect of a lifetime filled with low - paying jobs .
From a financial perspective , this did n't look like such a boneheaded decision a few years later when the dot - com crash and subsequent mass migration of programming jobs to south Asia caused comp -sci students to bolt from their programs like horses from a barn fire .
The Chronicle of Higher Education noted this development back in 2005 , saying , " New data show students ' interest in the discipline is in a free fall .
The number of newly declared computer - science majors declined 32 percent from the fall of 2000 to the fall of 2004 . "
Students worried that good jobs were being outsourced or would otherwise be unavailable , and enrollment in computer science programs dropped .
But , given the massive drop - off in the number of comp - sci students and the robust growth of IT in the US , the inevitable has now happened : computer science degrees are now worth some serious cash .
A recent study of post - college careers from the National Association of Colleges and Employers ( also noted by the Chronicle ) found that computer - science grads saw their average starting salary offers grow by 4.5 percent last year alone .
The new average salary for a job right out of college is now $ 53,051 .
That 's the highest amount this decade .
Every discipline is seeing raises , though humanities grads tend to receive offers in the $ 30,000s .
Even the humble English major , the one who has to put up with the endless array of cracks about flipping burgers to pay the rent , saw a 1.7 percent increase last year to $ 31,924 .
Apparently , fast food pays more than it used to .
As salaries rise , especially in the better - paying disciplines , we may see the interest in comp - sci degrees surge again , possibly depressing wages and driving majors back out of the programs .
For now , though , computer science looks like a well - paid place to be .
As for English majors , well , if they value the cash , they can always write more about technology than about Cervantes .
Marshal Mitrofan Ivanovich Nedelin , commander in chief of the Soviet Union 's Strategic Rocket Forces ( b.1902 - d.1960 ) Photo : rau-rostov.narod.ru
1960 : The attempted launch of a prototype R - 16 ICBM ends in disaster when the Soviet rocket blows up on a launchpad at the Baikonur Cosmodrome , killing over 100 engineers , technicians and military personnel .
The accident is now known as the Nedelin catastrophe , after Marshal Mitrofan Ivanovich Nedelin , commander in chief of the USSR's Strategic Rocket Forces , who was among those killed .
Coming as it did at the height of the Cold War , the disaster was kept a closely guarded secret for years .
The details did not become known in the West until the 1990s .
An electrical malfunction in the rocket , which was already fueled and sitting on the pad , led to the accident .
It was Nedelin himself , impatient to get the show on the road , who ordered the technicians to fix the problem without first defueling the rocket .
An errant radio signal triggered the firing of the second stage , causing the rocket to explode .
The cream of the Soviet Union 's rocket engineering talent was wiped out in an instant , along with the unfortunate Nedelin , who had set out a deck chair to watch and supervise the repair work .
The R - 16's designer , Mikhail Yangel , survived only because he had slipped into a nearby bunker for a smoke just before the explosion occurred .
Marshal Nedelin had been handpicked a year earlier by Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev to create the Strategic Rocket Forces , the USSR 's answer to the U.S. Strategic Air Command .

Matthew Yglesias writes :
Matthew Yglesias : Horatio Alger's IQ :
One thing that always occurs to me when these race / IQ blowups occur is that this issue is kind of in the neighborhood of a different point that does n't merely recapitulate the race science of yore , does seem to me to have real policy implications , and is really well - supported by the data .
This is the fact that IQ test results are meaningfully predictive of various indicators of success in the United States and the main factors that influence how people score on these tests all happen in childhood or earlier ( in the fetal environment , in the genes , etc. ) .
This then becomes one of several available lines of argument that the image of the United States as a magical place where hard work always pays off and the rewards go to those willing to put in the effort is wrong .
What 's more , the imagine of the United States as a fallen version of that magical place — a country that could become magical if we just improved urban high schools or adopted a better student loan system — is also wrong .
Better high schools and better student loan systems are things worth doing on their own terms , but absolutely nothing one can do changes the fact that where people end up is substantially out of their hands ...
This seems to me to be substantially wrong .
The inheritance of inequality is strikingly large in America today : if the father 's lifetime was 100 % above the American average for his day , the son 's lifetime income will on average be 65 % above the American average for his day .
That 's a lot of inherited inequality .
Is this unequal distribution of wealth , income , and status in the United States today the result of the fact that a genetic elite has risen to the top in an IQ - driven meritocracy ?
No .
This high degree of inherited inequality is n't because high IQ genetic eliteness genes are being passed down from fathers to sons .
As Samuel Bowles and Herbert Gintis ( 2002 ) , " The Inheritance of Inequality , " report :
The direct effect of IQ on earnings ... presented in Bowles , Gintis , and Osborne ( 2002a ) ... is 0.15 , indicating that a [ one ] standard deviation change in the cognitive score , holding constant ... remaining variables ... changes ... earnings by about one - seventh of a standard deviation ....
An estimate of the causal impact of childhood IQ on years of schooling ... is 0.53 ( Winship and Korenman 1999 ) .
A rough estimate of the direct and indirect effect of IQ on earnings ... is then ... 0.15 +( 0.53 ) ( 0.22 ) = 0.266 .... h is the heritability of IQ ....
The value cannot be higher than 1 , and most recent estimates are substantially lower , possibly more like a half or less ....
[ C ] ouples tend to be more similar in IQ than would occur by random mate choice ....
[ The ] genetic correlation of parent and offspring [ is ] ( 1 + m ) /2....
Using the values estimated above , we see that the contribution of genetic inheritance of IQ to the intergenerational transmission of income is ( h2 ( 1+ m ) /2) ( 0.266 ) 2 = .035 ( 1 + m) h2 .
If the heritability of IQ were 0.5 and the degree of assortation , m , were 0.2 ( both reasonable , if only ball park estimates ) and the genetic inheritance of IQ were the only mechanism accounting for intergenerational income transmission , then the intergenerational correlation [ of lifetime income ] would be 0.01 , or roughly two percent the observed intergenerational correlation [ of lifetime income between parents and children ] ...
If inherited genetically - based IQ were the source of the extra edge that the children of the rich get in our society , than we would expect a parent with 4 times average lifetime full - time earnings -- say $ 200,000 a year -- to have a kid with a lifetime average income of $ 51,500 instead of the average of $ 50,000 .
But it is not $ 51,500 .
It is $ 150,000 .
I agree with Matt that " where people end up [ in our society ] is substantially out of their hands " ( although not by any means completely ) : luck and inheritance of many kinds of things are incredibly important .
But this does not mean that equality of opportunity is a mirage .
For most of the things that are out of the hands of the individual are not out of our collective hands at all .
Genetic influence on IQ is one of the big things that are out of our collective hands -- and it turns out it is really not that big a thing at all .
I 've already detailed in previous posts how HD - DVD is far - outselling Blu-ray on laptop computers and how Toshiba will make available a notebook with onboard HD - DVD for under $ 1,000 this holiday shopping season .
Look for other big price breaks from the other major HD - DVD laptop makers , including Acer , Gateway , HP and Samsung .
The fact is , Blu-ray 's top argument is its penetration in the marketplace thanks to its inclusion in Sony 's Playstation .
The numbers on their face seem impressive : Home Media Magazine says Blu-ray sold 2.6 million discs between January and September , compared to 1.4 million HD - DVD disks during that time .
Blu -ray revenue is beating HD - DVD revenue by better than 2 to 1 .
But momentum is clearly swinging HD - DVD 's way .
I got an email this morning from a PR firm representing key HD - DVD companies pointing me to a recent NPD survey showing that an astonishing 60 % of Playstation3 owners were n't even aware the console had a Blu-ray player in it !
That same email points to how successful the movie " Transformers " has been on HD DVD , its exclusive platform release , selling a 100,000 copies its first day , 190,000 in its first week .
" Shrek 3 , " all five " Harry Potter " films and " The Bourne Ultimatum " will be released by mid- December .
Chalk this up as yet another reason to watch Microsoft , one of the key backers of HD - DVD .
And another rough issue for Sony , backing Blu-ray , which still has some key partners in Disney , 20th Century Fox and Lions Gate .
HD - DVD enjoys Paramount , Dreamworks and Time Warner .
This is about momentum , just as it is with Sony 's Playstation .
And once again , Microsoft and the HD - DVD folks have it .
And Sony 's looking for a way to re-capture it .
A strategy for ending the war would include real efforts to hold Iraq ’s government to verifiable measures of political conciliation — and make clear to Iraq ’s leaders that they cannot count on America ’s indefinite and unquestioning protection .
A real shift in strategy would have included an effort to deal with the massive problem of refugees .
Nine months after the surge began , ever more Iraqis are being driven from their homes — and Mr. Bush never even mentioned them last night .
If Mr. Bush were serious about ending the war , rather than threatening Iran and Syria , he would make a serious effort to persuade them that they too have a lot to lose from a disintegrating Iraq .
And he would enlist the help of the leaders of Britain , France and Germany for serious negotiations .
Then , perhaps , Mr. Bush ’s promise from January to stanch the flow of men and weapons into Iraq from Iran and Syria would not have sounded so hollow .
Once again , it is clear that Mr. Bush refuses to recognize the truth of his failure in Iraq and envisions a military commitment that has no end .
Congress must use its powers to expose the truth and demand a real change in strategy .
Democratic leaders , forever parsing polls , are backing away from proposals to impose a deadline for withdrawal and tinkering with small ideas that mostly sound like ways to enable the president ’s strategy of delay .
The presidential candidates , as well , have a duty to take Iraq head - on .
Some Democrats have started to talk in some detail about how they would end the war , but the burden is not just on the war critics .
Republicans like Rudolph Giuliani and John McCain , who love to proclaim their support for the president and hide behind the troops , need to explain their vision as well .
What do they think would constitute victory in Iraq , and how , precisely , do they intend to achieve it ?
After all , it seems the burden of ending the war will fall to the next president .
Mr. Bush was clear last night — as he was when he addressed the nation in January , September of last year , the December before that and in April 2004 — that his only real plan is to confuse enough Americans and cow enough members of Congress to let him muddle along and saddle his successor with this war that should never have been started .

Citigroup is expected to announce a series of drastic steps on Tuesday , including the elimination at least 4,000 additional jobs , a steep cut in its stock dividend and another big investment by foreign investors , in a bid to bolster its finances in the face of deepening losses .
Beginning what is expected to be a grim week for financial company earnings , Citigroup is likely to announce a write - down of $ 18 billion to $ 20 billion , the biggest yet by a major bank or Wall Street firm , said a person briefed on the situation .
Such a big loss , the result of soured mortgage - related investments , could wipe out the bank ’s profit for all of 2007 and plunge it into the red .
As part of a plan to shore up Citigroup , the chief executive , Vikram S. Pandit , is expected to announce the start of a new round of job cuts that many analysts say will accelerate in the coming months .
The first reductions , of about 4,000 workers , will come on top of 17,000 job cuts announced last spring .
Citigroup is also expected to turn to wealthy foreign governments again and announce the sale of a $ 12.5 billion stake to the Kuwait Investment Authority and several others , including Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi Arabia , people briefed on the situation said .
In November , the company sold a $ 7.5 billion stake to a Middle Eastern fund , the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority .
The US - born player was a fierce critic of his government
Fischer 's career
The US - born player , who became famous for beating Cold War Soviet rival Boris Spassky in 1972 , died of an unspecified illness , his spokesman said .
He was granted Icelandic citizenship in 2005 as a way to avoid being deported to the US .
Mr Fischer was wanted for breaking international sanctions by playing a match in the former Yugoslavia in 1992 .
He also had alienated many in his homeland by broadcasting anti-Semitic diatribes and expressing support for the 11 September 2001 attacks in New York .
The reclusive player - who had renounced his US citizenship - had lived undetected in Japan for a number of years before moving to Iceland .
Tributes
Mr Fischer died in Iceland on Thursday , his spokesman Gardar Sverrisson said .
The nature of the illness was unknown but Mr Fischer had been reportedly seriously ill for some time .
Spassky said he was " very sorry " to hear of Mr Fischer 's death , the Associated Press reported .
Russia 's Garry Kasparov , a former world champion , said that Mr Fischer 's ascent through the chess world in the 1960s was " a revolutionary breakthrough " for the game .
' Match of the century '
Mr Fischer was born in Chicago in 1943 , but was brought up in New York 's Brooklyn .
HAVE YOUR SAY
He should be remembered for his wonderful 1972 victory over Spassky , rather than the sad and prolonged end - game of his personal life Philip Hollywood , UK
He became a US chess champion at 14 and then the youngest grandmaster a year later .
He achieved world fame after playing a world championship match in Iceland in 1972 , beating title - holder Spassky .
The so - called chess " match of the century " came to be seen as a proxy for the Cold War , as the Soviets had held the world title since World War II .
Mr Fischer , the individual who had triumphed over the might of the Communist system , became an American hero .
The 1972 match made chess fashionable , even sexy , some experts say .
He lost the world chess crown in 1975 after refusing to play against his Soviet rival Anatoly Karpov .
US critic
The eccentric US genius then simply disappeared , declining all lucrative sponsorship deals .
He resurfaced briefly in 1992 , to play a re-match with Spassky in Yugoslavia in defiance of international sanctions .
Mr Fischer then vanished again , though it later became clear he had been living for a number of years in Japan .
He hit world headlines again after the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US .
In an interview to a radio station in the Philippines , he described the attacks as the " wonderful news " .
In another interview Mr Fischer accused the media of trying to " poison the public against me " .
" They constantly use the words eccentric , eccentric , eccentric , weird .
I am boring .
I am boring ! " he said .
He had also been strongly criticised for making anti-Semitic comments .
Mr Fischer was granted Icelandic citizenship in March 2005 , after spending several months in detention in Japan .

I think it was a slip of the tongue .
How many times have each of us slipped up and used the wrong word or even name before ?
Frost either understood it to be a slip - up or just did n't realize it in the first place .
I remember seeing video of Ted Kennedy talking about Barak Obama , and he accidentally called him Osama bin Laden .
Does that mean there is some conspiracy where bin Laden is actually the one who is in the Senate and who is running for the Democrat nomination for President ?
No , of course not .
Now I do n't know whether bin Laden is dead or alive .
I do n't know whether it was al Qaida , the Taliban , the ISI , or even the CIA who killed Bhutto .

Take rights from women ' showing skin ' at work

Booze - infused office Christmas parties can be threatening affairs , according to Fox News guest Marc Rudov .
But men should be more concerned than their female coworkers .
" We live in an era when men have to rely on the sanity and the mood of a woman rather than the U.S. Constitution for his protection , " he told the host of Fox 's Your World .

ED NOTE : The BRAD BLOG 's Emily Levy sat down with Dennis Kucinich on Sunday , just before serving as a hand - counter for votes in the first Democratic San Mateo County Presidential Straw Poll .
Results of that poll are below .
Kucinich spoke about his plans to force a vote in the U.S. House on the Impeachment of Dick Cheney ; on having officially removed his name as co-sponsor of Rep. Rush Holt 's flawed Election Reform Bill ; his interest in hand - counted paper ballots ; and concerns about e-voting systems .
As it turns out , however , his wife Elizabeth may have stolen the show with an impassioned speech on what America must do to restore " a rigged and a fake political system , " which , she told Levy , is " very , very undemocratic . "
===
Candidate Kucinich was surrounded by supporters after his speech to Democrats in San Mateo County , just south of San Francisco , over the weekend .
One asked the U.S. House Rep ( D - OH ) about the failures of the current Congress to protect the Constitution .
" If Congress did the right thing , " he answered , " they would be talking … about impeachment . "
At that point , I broke in with a question :
EMILY LEVY : What do you think it 'll take for more of your colleagues to do the right thing ?
What do you think it 'll take for more of your colleagues to do the right thing ?
REP .
DENNIS KUCINICH : The American people : an outcry .
That 's what we ought to be talking about .
EL : What do they hear ?
What do they hear ?
I mean , I hear the American people screaming .
How come they can't hear ?
DK : They are n't .
You 're exactly right .
You know , I introduced House Resolution 333 because I heard from the American people and they said they wanted some response to make Dick Cheney accountable for the statements that he made that took us into a war based on lies .
And the statements he made that would take us into a conflict against Iran .
Again , more lies .
The President is now openly invoking the specter of World War III with respect to Iran .
He ought to be held accountable also .
I 'm the only member of Congress who stepped forward on the issue of making Dick Cheney accountable .
And now we have 21 members who 've joined me .
That 's a step in the right direction .
But I 'm going to go beyond that .
I 'm going to call a privileged resolution , at which point , would force a vote --- at least if it 's only on a procedural motion --- members are going to have to confront this issue of impeachment .
They 're not going to escape it .
This is a question of defending our Constitution .
It really is .
( In a follow up phone call with the Congressman last night , I asked when he intended to introduce the privileged resolution in the House .
He said it would happen in " the next few weeks , " but could n't be more specific .
Now back to San Mateo ... )
Kucinich burst into laughter when I showed him the teabag tag hanging from my shirt pocket .
I praised his ingeniously deadpan appearance on The Colbert Report .
He searched around in his jacket pocket for his mini-Colbert but was unable to produce the little guy .
While I waited for my turn to speak with Kucinich alone , I spoke with his wife , Elizabeth , who was " enjoying the last day of my twenties . "
( Happy birthday , Elizabeth . )
I asked her the question that was really on my mind : Knowing what he knows about the theft of the last two presidential elections , why would her husband run for president ?
After she said , " Are you kidding ? " several times with increasing alacrity , I asked if I could turn on my voice recorder ...
ELIZABETH KUCINICH :
We can not put ourselves in a default position that the people of America lose .
Again and again and again and again .
We have a rigged and a fake political system here which is very , very undemocratic .
And the reason why it 's undemocratic is ' cause the people who should be voting feel so disempowered that they do n't vote .
We can not put ourselves in a default position that the people of America lose .
Again and again and again and again .
We have a rigged and a fake political system here which is very , very undemocratic .
And the reason why it 's undemocratic is ' cause the people who should be voting feel so disempowered that they do n't vote .
If everybody came out and just voted in their own enlightened self - interest , if everyone who wanted health care voted in the U.S.A. , Dennis would get in .
If anyone who wanted to get out of Iraq , if just they voted , then Dennis would get in .
If everyone who wanted a change in agriculture and our environment and our climate change policies came out and voted , if they voted for their candidate , who is Dennis , Dennis would get in .
If everyone who wanted to vote came out to vote for trade , if they wanted a change in NAFTA or the WTO and to rewrite trade agreements based on workers ' rights , human rights , environmental principles , if they came out and voted , Dennis would get in .
It 's time really .
We 've got a courageous person who stands out for a choice and it's really time for the American people to have the courage to come and stand with him and to vote for him .
EL : And how do you encourage people to vote when they do n't believe that their votes will be counted accurately ?
EK : You can't give up your democracy .
If that ... if such an overwhelming amount of people come out , they cannot fudge the issue .
They cannot fudge the percentage that would come out .
And we just have to make sure that so many people come and vote that it would be impossible to rig such an election .
My brief interview with Kucinich revealed a couple of useful nuggets .
The full interview is transcribed below .
Here are the highlights :
EL : Last June Last June you announced that you were going to drop your co-sponsorship of HR811 , the Holt [ Election Reform ] bill .
You 're still listed on Thomas 's website , on the House website , as a cosponsor .
Are you still a cosponsor ?
DK : I took my name off .
EL : You did .
DK : Absolutely .
I went to the floor of the House and removed my name .
I found myself wondering how many of the other listed co-sponsors may have withdrawn their names .
In February 2007 , Maxine Waters told me she would remove her name , yet the Thomas site continues to list her as a co-sponsor as well .
Other Reps. have also indicated they no longer support the bill .
Perhaps that 's why it has n't come up for a full house vote , as Majority Leader Steny Hoyer had indicated would happen in early October .
I asked Kucinich what he is doing , as a Congressional representative or as a candidate , to ensure that there wo n't be massive disenfranchisement of voters of color , poor and working class voters in the 2008 elections .
" The electronic systems have deprived all voters , whatever their race , color or creed , of the integrity of the election system , " he replied .
He called upon the Department of Justice and civil rights groups to provide monitors at polling places in all communities of color .
When I asked Kucinich about what should be done in Georgia , which uses paperless , easily - hackable , Diebold touch - screen voting machines statewide , he stated , " I have a real problem with any state that has all Diebold .
Because you can't guarantee that technology .
And I think the only way to stop that is for citizens of that state to file a lawsuit claiming that their right to vote is being undermined by this technology which is unproven . "
Such a lawsuit is underway in Georgia , having been filed by VoterGA in 2006 .
Atlanta Progressive News updated readers on that suit in August 2007 .
Diebold 's touch - screen voting systems have , time and again , been shown by computer scientists and security experts to be exceedingly vulnerable to tampering [ PDF ] , viruses and out - and - out error .
Kucinich remains the only presidential candidate who has called for hand - counted paper ballots .
In the last Congress he introduced HR 6200 , " The Paper Ballot Act of 2006 , " which would have required the use of hand - counted paper ballots in Presidential Elections .
In answer to a question by election integrity advocate Jennifer Kidder at Sunday 's San Mateo event , Kucinich said he plans to re-introduce the bill in the current Congress .
The 761 paper ballots used in the San Mateo Democratic Presidential Straw Poll over the weekend were hand - counted in less than an hour by teams of volunteers .
The top two vote - getters in the poll were John Edwards ( 29 % ) and Dennis Kucinich ( 23.6 % ) .
Barack Obama received 22.5 % of the votes and Hillary Clinton 16.8 % .
Even as a write - in , Al Gore ( 3 % ) placed higher than Richardson , Biden , Dodd or Gravel .
Full results with county breakdowns are available at the San Mateo County Presidential Straw Poll 2008 website .
The complete transcript of my interview with Dennis Kucinich follows below ...
Interview with Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH )
San Mateo , California ,
10/21/07 EMILY LEVY : Last June you announced that you were going to drop your cosponsorship of HR811 , the Holt bill .
You 're still listed on Thomas 's website , on the House website , as a cosponsor .
Are you still a cosponsor ?
REP .
DENNIS KUCINICH : I took my name off .
EL : You did .
DK : Absolutely .
I went to the floor of the House and removed my name .
EL : That 's good to know .
And we 'll need to find out why they have n't updated their website .
DK : I 'll ask about that .
EL : Okay .
And I 'm wondering what actions you 're taking , either as a Congressional representative or as a candidate , to ensure that there wo n't be mass disenfranchisement of voters of color and poor and working class voters in the elections in 2008 ?
DK : Well , you know , besides making sure we have paper ballots where every vote 's going to count and every vote will be counted , the electronic systems have deprived all voters , whatever their race , color or creed , of the integrity of the election system .
Furthermore , I think that we need to insist that the United States Justice Department provide monitors and that all civil rights groups also provide monitors in all communities of color to make sure that there 's no , first of all , in anticipation of the election , to make sure that each and every county election board is adequately staffed , that there 's a sufficient number of polling places , that the hours are guaranteed to be kept open , that the polling places are accessible and well - staffed , I mean these are the mechanics of an election .
EL : Absolutely .
DK : But you have to pay attention to the mechanics of the election in order to make sure that the election 's going to be run right , and then on the day of the election you need officials there to make sure that it 's proceeding the way it was set up , it was supposed to be set up .
EL : And what would you do , what would you suggest , say , for Georgia , where they not only have all electronic voting , it 's all Diebold and no paper trails , where there 's not going to be any evidence of ...
DK : I have a real problem with any state that has all Diebold .
Because you can't guarantee that technology .
And I think the only way to stop that is for citizens of that state to file a lawsuit claiming that their right to vote is being undermined by this technology which is unproven .
EL : Great .
And could you explain for those of our readers who do n't understand why you would take your name off a bill that claims to be a paper ballot bill , which is the Holt bill , HR 811 , and speak out in favor of paper ballots ?
DK : Well , actually , it 's my legislation to create paper ballots .
That came before the Holt bill .
And so the Holt bill , after talking to people across the country , they pointed out their concerns and the deficiencies of the bill and asked me to take my name off it and I agreed to do that .
And I did .
EL : And do you consider the Holt bill a paper ballot bill ?
It talks about paper …
DK : I would n't describe it as that .
I mean , I think that it goes far beyond that , I want a simple bill to make paper ballots the way that elections are , the form of ballot for all presidential and federal elections .
EL : Okay , great .
And as the representative from Cleveland , in Cuyahoga County , you were , it was your constituents who were among the most cheated in the 2004 --- well , we all were , in the whole country , but some of the biggest problems in the country happened right in Cuyahoga County .
And I 'm wondering how it looks to you like the plans that Jennifer Brunner has as the new SoS ...
DK : I would hope that the , that Jennifer Brunner is going to -- actually , she won her seat because of the irregularities in the election .
People were so upset with the office of Secretary of State that they elected someone who promised reform .
She won on a policy of election reform .
So I would hope that Ohio , having suffered so grievously from the deficiencies in election system , will , with the new Secretary of State , have an election system that will protect the integrity of the elections .
I 'm sure it will .
EL : And one more question about voting and I have one separate question .
How would you encourage people to vote when they do n't have confidence that their vote will be counted accurately ?
Why should people still vote ?
DK : Because there 's no other way that we 're going to change the system .
I mean , the fact of the matter is if people vote in massive numbers , I can win the presidency , if they vote for what they want .
And when you have a small number of people voting , then the election 's always going to be in doubt .
But if we have a big turnout and people , let 's just say , are going to vote for me because they want health care , it changes the country .
If they want peace , it changes the country .
People have to vote in their own self - interest .
If you ’re participating in Better Budget Challenge # 2 , then perhaps you ’d like to see a run-down of a few budgeting tools .
Lynnae at Being Frugal recently did some in - depth reviews on some programs .
I really enjoy her blog , and I hope she wo n’t mind that I ’m linking back to a bunch of her reviews .
If you ’ve recently reviewed a budgeting software tool , let me know and I might update my list to include you .
Here ’s just a few options available :
Kacie ’s pick :
MINT
Mint is simple to set up and easy to use .
You add your bank and credit account information , and then with each transaction , the Mint software categorizes your purchases .
You may have to adjust these categories , but it ’s easy to do .
Some cool features :
The software is free
It might help you save money , by suggesting you switch banks , credit cards , and how to improve on monthly bills
Overall ,
Mint is an excellent tool for tracking your spending .
If you have multiple accounts ( such as a bank for checking , an account with ING , Paypal , and credit cards ) it ’s a great way for you to see the balances of all of your accounts at once .
Mint does n’t appear to have long - term budgeting capabilities ( such as planning for retirement , etc. ) .
It seems to be best suited for money - tracking .
Of all the budgeting programs I ’ve ever tried ( just a small number ) , this is the easiest and most useful one I ’ve used .
Visit Lynnae ’s review on Mint .
Kacie ’s husband ’s pick :
YODLEE
Yodlee is free , internet - based , and comprehensive .
It has detailed reports for short - term budgeting and expense reviews , but does not offer long - range goal setting , etc. found in Microsoft Money .
The short - term budgeting reports are still complete enough to be informative .
The interface looks really “ finance -y ” , know what I mean ?
It ’s almost intimidating for a gal like me .
I have n’t explored all of its features yet , though .
My husband really likes it and he ’s going to show me how to use it –that ’s all I can say about it right now .
Other free programs :
WESABE
Wesabe uses social networking to help you learn from others .
You ’ll find message boards that you can review to learn tips and tricks about how other people are saving money .
The tips are worth a look , but there are n’t enough features for budgeting or other financial analysis , in my opinion .
As a budgeting tool , it is n’t the easiest to use .
Click the link to see Lynnae ’s review on Wesabe .
Programs you ’ll have to pay for :
MICROSOFT MONEY
Microsoft Money offers several levels of financial programs :
Money Essentials ( Free 60 - day trial , then $ 19.99 )
Money Plus Deluxe ( Free 60 - day trial , then $ 49.99 )
Money Plus Home & Business ( Free 60 - day trial , then $ 59.99 )
Some purchases might qualify for a mail - in rebate , so be sure to investigate that if you decide to go with Microsoft .
Look at Microsoft ’s comparison chart to see if one of these programs might be right for you .
We tried Microsoft Money 2007 Deluxe for a short time .
It offers tons of financial features , including the tools needed to track your short - term spending and also make long - term projections .
There seems to be a high learning curve with this program .
Too high for me .
If you want advanced tools to help you plan for retirement , get out of debt , etc. then this program might be the one for you .
You ’ll be able to track your expenses and create all sorts of charts and graphs to see how you ’re spending .
If you just need simple features , then try somewhere else .
For me , it was just too complicated to use .
Mvelopes
Mvelopes offers a free 30 - day trial , and then after that , you ’ll have to pay .
I have n’t tried Mvelopes , but from looking at the site , you ’ll be able to set up a budget , track expenses , and possibly reduce your spending .
Visit Lynnae ’s review on Mvelopes .
She provides an extensive run-down of the program .
PEAR BUDGET
Pear Budget is still in beta .
It ’s free for the time it ’s in beta , and then they ’ll charge $ 20 or so for the year .
This software encourages you to input arbitrary amounts , so I really ca n’t recommend you use it .
It says you can change the amounts in the future , of course .
From what I can tell , you choose categories , then manually type in your receipts and categorize them .
No linking to any bank accounts or anything .
Ugh .
Sounds tedious .
If you use a cash - only budget system , this software might be good for you to use , since you ’ll have to enter your receipts somewhere .
Still , I ’m unimpressed .
Does anyone out there like it ?
QUICKEN
I ’ve never tried Quicken so I do n’t know what to say about it other than it ’s an option .
You ’ll get a 30 - day free trial , then can use their online program for $ 2.99 / month .
Or , you can download one of their many versions .
YNAB
YNAB , or You Need a Budget , seems like it was created with Dave Ramsey ’s philosophies in mind .
I do n’t know if he endorses it ( or if the people that created it follow Ramsey ) , but YNAB encourages you to get out of debt , create an emergency “ cushion , ” and live on less than you earn .
This is not a web - based program .
Instead , you ’ll download the software to your computer .
It does n’t link to your bank accounts , but if you primarily use cash , that ’s fine and dandy .
It costs $ 19.99 , and $ 39.95 for the pro version ( dunno what that is ) .
Oh , and you ca n’t pay cash for it–credit cards only , lol .
I guess credit cards are still needed in a cash budget .

In Rudolph Giuliani ’s narrative of his own life , as confided to rapt Republican voters along the presidential primary trail , he has been fighting the lonely twilight struggle against “ Islamic terrorism ” since sometime in the 1970s .
Both the former mayor and his supporters often suggest that his understanding of the terror threat is visceral and almost mystical .
Only he , among all the candidates of both parties , truly grasps the issue and possesses the fortitude to confront the threat .
As part of the same spiel touting his 30 years of experience battling terrorism , Giuliani often attacks the Clinton administration for failing to comprehend the nature of the problem following the first major attack on New York , which occurred shortly after he became mayor .
“ Islamic terrorists killed Americans .
Slaughtered Americans .
Bombed the World Trade Center .
Bombed it , ” he said in a typical speech last summer .
“ You know what the reaction of the Clinton administration at the time was ?
It was a crime .
It was another group of murders . …
Well , it was n’t just another group of murders . ”
While that description of President Clinton ’s response to the February 1993 bombing is hardly fair or accurate , the tone of curt disdain serves a specific partisan purpose , by warning that a Clinton restoration in the White House will endanger America .
His unrelenting attacks are aimed at portraying Hillary Clinton , the Democratic front - runner , as too weak to serve as commander in chief .
But his biting words also invite closer scrutiny of Giuliani ’s claims about himself .
Unfortunately , few mainstream media outlets will take up that invitation .
Although cable channels devote endless amounts of airtime to consider the authenticity of Mrs. Clinton ’s laughter , they seem unable to cover an extraordinary scoop that raises questions about Giuliani ’s authenticity .
Published in the Oct. 23 issue of The Village Voice — the New York alternative weekly that has excelled in covering the former mayor for many years — that scoop revealed the contents of his private testimony before the 9/11 Commission .
The previously sealed memoranda summarizing Giuliani ’s testimony , obtained by reporter Wayne Barrett , show profound contradictions between his stump speech and what he admitted to the commission behind closed doors .
For reasons that remain unclear , the minutes of his private testimony , marked “ commission sensitive / unclassified , ” were nevertheless to be locked away until the convenient date of December 2008 .
Nobody associated with the 9/11 Commission could explain how or why that decision had been made .
The Voice article discloses the embarrassing contents of a 15 - page “ memorandum for the record , ” prepared by a commission attorney on April 20 , 2004 , which quotes Giuliani explaining that he knew little about Osama bin Laden ’s organization until “ after 9/11 , ” when “ we brought in people to brief us on al - Qaida . ”
He recalled no such briefing earlier , which was “ a mistake , ” he acknowledged , since “ if experts share a lot of info , ” that would mean a “ better chance of someone making heads and tails … [ of the ] situation . ”
When a commissioner inquired about his knowledge of al - Qaida threats during the three years preceding 9/11 , Giuliani replied , “ At the time , I was n’t told it was al - Qaida , but now that I look back at it , I think it was al - Qaida . ”
He noted that soon after the 9/11 attacks , he had brought in Yossef Bodansky , author of the prophetic 2001 book “ Bin Laden : The Man Who Declared War on America , ” to brief him and his staff .
( In his own book , “ Leadership , ” he discloses that he read Bodansky ’s book at the urging of his wife , and covered the text in “ highlighter and notes . ”
No wonder he regards himself as an expert . )
Asked how he might apply the city ’s crime - fighting strategies to the “ war on terror , ” Giuliani said , “ Bernie knows more than I , ” a reference to former Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik , the extremely dubious character whom he almost succeeded in installing as secretary of Homeland Security .
All in all , his private testimony makes him seem clueless .
That wo n’t surprise anyone who has read “ Grand Illusion : The Untold Story of Rudy Giuliani and 9/11 , ” the 2006 book by Barrett and Dan Collins that delves into many of the errors and falsehoods behind the Republican front - runner ’s facade .
More puzzling — but alas not so surprising — is the reluctance of the mainstream media to follow up on Barrett ’s story .
When Giuliani observes that national security will be the chief concern of many voters this year and next , he is correct .
That is exactly why he deserves the scrutiny he has escaped so far .

The 2007 Patriots roster is now available on Whatifsports.com .
I decided to test out the Patriots vs. the 1972 Dolphins on a neutral site at Jacksonville Municipal Stadium .
Here is the result .......
Pats / Fins at Jacksonville :
Dolphins 30 Patriots 29
Garo Yepremian kicked the winning 39 yard field goal with no time left as the Dolphins rallied from 26 - 13 down to stun the undefeated Patriots .
Tom Brady was intercepted twice , by Doug Swift and Nick Buoniconti .
The Dolphins ran wild , with 249 yards rushing , as Earl Morrall and Bob Griese struggled in the passing game .
The box score and other stats are shown in the pictures below :
I 'll be back with results from simulations in Miami in humid weather , and in Foxboro with wicked winter storms later in the week .
I ’ve read a number of stories this week that highlight that interoperability between social networking sites will be a “ top ask ” in 2008 ( as we say at Microsoft ) .
Earlier this week I read the Wired article Should Web Giants Let Startups Use the Information They Have About You ?
which does a good job of telling both sides of the story when it comes to startups screen scraping importing user data such as social graphs ( i.e. friend and contact lists ) from more successful sites as a way to bootstrap their social networks .
The Wired article is a good read if you want to hear all sides of the story when it comes to the issue of sharing user social data between sites .
Yesterday , I saw Social Network Aggregation , Killer App in 2008 ?
which points out the problem that users often belong to multiple social networks at once and that bridging between them is key .
However I disagree with the premise that this points to need for a “ Social Network Aggregator ” category of applications .
I personally believe that the list of 20 or so Social Network Aggregators on Mashable are all companies that would cease to exist if the industry got off it ’s behind and worked towards actual interoperability between social networking sites .
Today , I saw saw Facebook disabled Robert Scoble ’s account .
After reading Robert ’s account of the incident , I completely agree with Facebook .
Why Robert Scoble is Wrong and Facebook is Right
Here ’s what Robert Scoble wrote about the incident
My account has been “ disabled ” for breaking Facebook ’s Terms of Use .
I was running a script that got them to keep me from accessing my account
…
I am working with a company to move my social graph to other places and that is n’t allowable under Facebook ’s terms of service .
Here ’s the email I received : +++++
Hello ,
Our systems indicate that you ’ve been highly active on Facebook lately and viewing pages at a quick enough rate that we suspect you may be running an automated script .
This kind of Activity would be a violation of our Terms of Use and potentially of federal and state laws .
As a result , your account has been disabled .
Please reply to this email with a description of your recent activity on Facebook .
In addition , please confirm with us that in the future you will not scrape or otherwise attempt to obtain in any manner information from our website except as permitted by our Terms of Use , and that you will immediately delete and not use in any manner any such information you may have previously obtained .
The first thing to note is that Facebook allows you to extract your social graph data from their site using the Facebook platform .
In fact , right now whenever I get an email from someone on my Facebook friend list in Outlook or I get a phone call from them , I see the picture from their Facebook profile .
I did this using OutSync which is an application that utilizes the Facebook platform to merge data from my contacts in Outlook / Exchange with my Facebook contacts .
So if Facebook allows you to extract information about your Facebook friends via their APIs , why would Robert Scoble need to run a screen scraping script ?
The fact is that the information returned by the Facebook API about a user contains no contact information ( no email address , no IM screen names , no telephone numbers , no street address ) .
Thus if you are trying to “ grow virally ” by spamming the Facebook friend list of one of your new users about the benefits of your brand new Web 2.0 site then you have to screen scrape Facebook .
However there is the additional wrinkle that unlike address books in Web email applications Robert Scoble did not enter any of this contact information about his friends .
With this in mind , it is hard for Robert Scoble to argue that the data is “ his ” to extract from Facebook .
In addition , as a Facebook user I consider it a feature that Facebook makes it hard for my personal data to be harvested in this way .
Secondly , since Robert ’s script was screen scraping it means that it had to hit the site five thousand times ( once for each of his contacts ) to fetch all of Robert ’s friends personally idenitifiable information ( PII ) .
Given that eBay won a court injunction against Bidder ’s Edge for running 100,000 queries a day , it is n’t hard to imagine that the kind of screen scraping script that Robert is using would be considered malicious even by a court of law .
I should note that Facebook is being a bit hypocritical here since they do screen scrape other sites to get the email addresses of the contacts of new users .
This is why I ’ve called them the Social Graph Roach Motel in the recent past .
O’Reilly Social Graph FOO Camp
This past weekend I got an email from Tim O'Reilly , David Recordon , and Scott Kveton inviting me to a Friends of O’Reilly Camp ( aka FOO Camp ) dedicated to “ social graph ” problems .
I ’m still trying to figure out if I can make it based on my schedule and whether I ’m really the best person to be representing Microsoft at such an event given that I ’m a technical person and “ social graph problems ” for the most part are not technical issues .
Regardless of whether I am able to attend or not , there were some topics I wanted to recommend should be added to a list of “ red herring ” topics that should n’t be discussed until the important issues have been hashed out .
Google OpenSocial : This was an example of unfortunate branding .
Google should really have called this “ Google OpenWidgets ” or “ Google Gadgets for your Domain ” since the goal was competing with Facebook ’s widget platform not actually opening up social networks .
Since widget platforms are n’t a “ social graph problem ” it does n’t seem fruitful the spend time discussing this when there are bigger fish to fry .
Social Network Portability :
When startups talk about “ social network portability ” it ’s usually a euphemism for collecting a person ’s username and password for another site , retrieving their contact / friend list and spamming those people about their hot new Web 2.0 startup .
As a user of the Web , making it easier to receive spam from startups is n’t something I think should be done let alone a “ problem ” that needs solving .
I understand that lots of people will disagree with this [ even at Microsoft ] but I ’m convinced that this is not the real problem facing the majority of users of social networking sites on the the Web today .
What I Want When It Comes to Social Network Interoperability
Having I ’ve said what I do n’t think is important to discuss when it comes to “ social graph problems ” , it would be rude not to provide an example fof what I think would be fruitful discussion .
I wrote the problem I think we should be solving as an industry a while back in a post entitled A Proposal for Social Network Interoperability via OpenID which is excerpted below
I have a Facebook profile while my fiancée wife has a MySpace profile .
Since I ’m now an active user of Facebook , I ’d like her to be able to be part of my activities on the site such as being able to view my photos , read my wall posts and leave wall posts of her own .
I could ask her to create a Facebook account , but I already asked her to create a profile on Windows Live Spaces so we could be friends on that service and quite frankly I do n’t think she ’ll find it reasonable if I keep asking her to jump from social network to social network because I happen to try out a lot of these services as part of my day job .
So how can this problem be solved in the general case ?
This is a genuine user problem which the established players have little incentive to fix .
The data portability folks want to make it easy for you to jump from service to service .
I want to make it easy for users of one service to talk to people on another service .

Jewish Council Condemns Assault Rabbi Stabbed in Germany
The stabbing of a rabbi in Frankfurt by a young man speaking Arabic has prompted Germany 's Jewish community to renew its warnings about no - go areas for minorities in Germany , and to warn that Germany 's young Muslims are becoming radicalized by hate preachers .
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Lockheed Martin Corp LMT.N has agreed to pay a former employee $ 2.5 million , more than any individual has received in the settlement of a racial discrimination case filed by the U.S. Equal Employment and Opportunity Commission , attorneys for the agency said on Wednesday .
Charles Daniels , 45 , said he was called derogatory names and threatened by four co-workers and a supervisor between 1999 and 2001 when he worked as an aviation electrician for the company in Florida , Washington and Hawaii .
Daniels , who is black , said that when he complained about how members of his six - person team were treating him , company managers said , “ That ’s just boys being boys , and that ’s the way it is here at Lockheed . ”
“ It was pretty humiliating , ” Daniels told reporters at a briefing in Honolulu .
“ To get called names is going to anger you .
It ’s going to upset you .
And it makes you frustrated because you know what the law provides . ”
William Tamayo , regional attorney for the EEOC in San Francisco , said the settlement was also the largest ever to be publicly filed in Hawaii .
A spokesman for Lockheed Martin was not immediately available to comment .
I 'm always getting criticized for writing long blogs .
" Way too verbose !
Could n't he have said all that in two paragraphs ? "
Not everyone feels that way , of course ; lots of people tell me to keep doing what I 'm doing .
But the size critics are doggedly persistent .
And I do n't think it 's just people who are slow readers .
Even friends of mine will sometimes advise me to trim my entries down , which is a surprise , since I thought most of them would have picked up on the cause and effect relationship between blog length and popularity .
Evidently not !
So , like , let 's get this out in the open : I 'm doing it on purpose .
Yes , sure , I could do with an editor ( the people kind ) , but only if said editor were on board with long blogs , because that 's the kind I want to write .
In short , I think long blogs have better survival characteristics : greater reach and greater impact .
And I 've decided to celebrate the august occasion of the 1000th kneebiter publicly maligning my style by explaining why I do it .
And yes , it 'll be long .
Set aside at least 20 minutes to read this thing .
You 've been warned !
Let 's start with the obvious .
People expect blogs to be short – at least , shorter than mine .
They expect that because it 's pretty much how everyone does it .
Short entries , and frequent .
Here 's my cat today .
Does n't he look sooo different from yesterday ?
No wonder so many people hate bloggers .
When I write my long blogs , I 'm bucking established social convention , so it 's natural that some people will whine that they 're too long .
Well , how far off cultural expectations am I ?
Doing a quick print preview in my browser shows that my last entry , formatted at about 14 words per line ( typical for a printed book ) weighs in at about ten pages .
So it 's roughly essay - sized .
I 'm not talking about those toy five - paragraph essays they made you write in high school .
I 'm talking about real - life essays by real - life essayists .
Real essays can range from three pages to 30 or more , but ten pages is not an unusual length .
If I were attempting to publish these entries as books , publishers would laugh at me .
They 're way too short to be books .
Sure , I could bundle them , but that 's beside the point .
The fact is , two different real - world audiences have entirely incompatible views on what the proper length for my writing should be .
I like to shift between writing articles and essays .
The two overlap to some extent , in that an " opinion article " can be essay - like .
But an essay attempts to be richer and deeper than an article .
Essays can take all sorts of forms – prose , poems , stage plays , screenplays , short stories , even songs .
And yes , they can take the form of blog entries .
Essays have different goals : some introduce new ideas , some aim to change minds that have been made up , some try to rally people to a cause , some just poke fun .
Regardless of the goal , I think what unites them as essays is that they strive to imprint the reader with an idea , some hopefully unforgettable perspective , even if the reader does n't necessarily agree with it .
Essays might use humor to endear you , or satire to shock you , or storytelling to entertain and lull you , or logic to convince you , or rhetoric to persuade you , but in the end they 're trying all trying to imprint you with a little piece of the essayist 's personal perspective on life .
So we 've established that my longer entries are for the most part essays in blog form , with nary a cat picture to be found .
I think the appearance of my entries in feed - readers alongside cat pictures and other non-essays is a big contributor to why so many people feel they 're too long .
If I instead herded them off into a page titled " Essays " , as essayist Paul Graham does , then my guests might arrive with more appropriate expectations .
But let 's face it – that 's more work .
Blogs are the closest thing we 've got today to a ready - made , turn - key , high - availability essay publishing system , one that permits comments , subscriptions , biographical links and the other trappings you 'd expect .
It 's not ideal – I even talked about this in my first - ever Blogger entry , but none of the issues I raised then have been resolved , doubtless because most people do n't write essays , so there is n't a pressing need .
Blogging 's the best medium I 've got today , so that 's where I publish my essays .
Amusing true side - story : I met Paul Graham at Foo Camp last summer .
After his crowd of admirers had dispersed on the first day ( he 's pretty famous ) , I came up and introduced myself .
He was very nice and polite , and he was even kind enough to venture : " I 've read some of your ... essays . "
He said the word essays with this funny pained look on his face , as if he'd just swallowed a gob of wasabi and was trying to play it off like nothing was wrong .
I think he meant well , but that expression was just priceless .
I already knew my work was n't for everyone . :)
Anyway , there 's more to the long - blog problem than mere expectations .
You can still make a valid argument that my entries are too long even for essays , or at any rate for the material I 'm covering or the points I 'm making .
And I 'll still disagree with you .
Let 's see why .
So , I have this pet theory I 'm going to foist on you .
It 's probably total hokum , and someday I may be proven as wrong as Lamarck , but for now it 's a hypothesis that fits the data pretty well .
First , let me tell you what the pet theory is about .
I talked about it a little in an essay I wrote in 2004 , You Should Write Blogs .
In the essay I outlined some unexpected behavior of an essay my friend had written and circulated at Amazon : nobody read the thing , but somehow a year later everyone knew about it , and its core message had been imprinted on everyone in the company , up to and including the executive staff .
In the intervening three years since I wrote that essay , my own blog has taken off to level that can only be described as absurd .
I 've been lampooned in web comics , discussed endlessly on Reddit Slashdotted , invited to Foo Camp and various big conferences , approached about writing books , recruited constantly , and heckled mercilessly by my coworkers , all of whom are smarter than I am , both technically and also in the sense that they do n't make public asses of themselves once a month .
It 's undeniable that I 'm doing something right , at least in terms of reach .
My blogs may or may not be any good , but they 're widely read .
So are they really too long ?
Well , people always tell me : " Steve , you 'd be doing yourself – and us – a huge favor if you just made your entries shorter . "
So I try it now and again , and I 've observed a correlation between blog size and splash size .
It 's as if you 're all in a pond , and I 'm throwing a rock into it .
Bigger rock , bigger splash .
I think you can actually stretch that metaphor one more level .
I think if I throw in a sufficiently large rock , it 'll crush you , which for most of you is an undesirable outcome .
The rock needs to be big enough to splash you and get you all wet , but it should n't kill you .
To translate that bizarre thought into non-metaphorical terms , a blog that 's too big will cause " too many " readers to drop off , for some value of " too many " .
A longer entry means that fewer people will read it immediately , although I 'd argue based on experience that longer entries that are worth reading will ultimately achieve a wider audience .
It just takes longer for them to make the rounds - sometimes months or years .
But there 's a tradeoff there .
It can be useful to make a big splash all at once , in the style of Gladwell 's Tipping Point .
So we 've got a tricky number to solve for .
Very short entries get ignored ; I 've tried that .
Longer entries can make a splash but may not have broad long - term staying power .
Very long entries tire people out , so they can take years to make the rounds .
What 's the right length for making a big splash the day it 's published ?
That 's where my pet theory comes in .
Oh , you may laugh !
Ha , ha , you might say !
But I , who know absolutely nothing whatsoever about Cognitive Science , have a pop cog-sci theory about the right length for an essay .
The right length for an essay , I believe , is exactly " one sitting " : no more , no less .
You should be able to read and absorb it fully in one go , with no breaks .
Moreover , after you finish , you should be at the point where you need to take a break .
You should want to stand up , stretch your legs , grab a coffee , play some foosball , get your mind off everything for a while .
If you do n't need a break after the essay , then it was n't long enough .
I suspect the maximum length for a " sitting " is 50 minutes , given various government studies I learned about while I was in Navy Nuclear Power School .
They determined that people absorb information best ( and concentrate best ) in school in 50 - minute intervals with 10 - minute breaks .
They 'd figured out all sorts of other stuff too : use outline form , make the students copy the outline into a notebook , repeat everything exactly 3 times , and so on , all ways they 'd found that lead to better retention of the material .
But the 50 - minute thing seemed intuitively reasonable .
Those ten -minute breaks were indispensable .
I actually think 50 minutes is the absolute upper bound for a sitting ; the optimal duration is probably lower .
But the takeaway here is that one consequence of my pet theory , which we 'll get to shortly , is that the ideal length for a blog is measured as a duration , not a word count .
Of course , that presents a problem , because duration is a function of word count and reading speed .
I need to account for different personal speeds , and some folks like to read slowly .
Heck , some do n't even read at all .
It 's one of the amazing miracles of the internet : write - only people .
They can't read but they somehow find a way to write .
You see them commenting all the time in my blogs : " I did n't actually read your entry , but allow me to comment on it all the same ... "
Lovely .
So I need to aim for something lower than 50 minutes , to make it possible for average readers , and then hope that for fast readers I 'll still have blown their entire page cache .
Being a fast reader is actually a disadvantage here .
Figured my pet theory out yet ?
I 'll bet some of you have !
My pet theory is predicated on the hopefully obvious axiom that our brain is a computer .
As a computer , even though it 's structually different from a von Neumann machine , it 's still constrained by the same laws of physics .
Hence , it probably has a multi - level cache .
I have some even more farfetched pet theories about the architecture of this cache , but whatever the architecture , caches all share the property of being limited short - term storage .
I really want to talk more about how I think this cache works , and I keep deleting paragraphs about it .
I 'm in a bind : if I talk more about it , my pond - boulder will get too big and crush people .
But if I do n't , then I 'll be accused of grossly oversimplifying .
So it goes .
Let 's oversimplify .
Your brain clearly has at least two obvious caches : your short - term memory and your long - term memory .
Your long - term memory is more complex than a cache , but behaves like a cache in the way it forgets things that are n't refreshed periodically .
The Wikipedia entry on short - term memory , linked above , says short - term memory lasts about 20 seconds .
And long - term memory , of course , is persistent and can last up to a lifetime .
My pet theory posits the existence of at least one second - level cache in your brain that holds data for a while before deciding whether to commit it to long - term memory .
That " while " varies but is at least 10 to 15 minutes .
Of course , writing the theory down like this makes all the holes in it pretty obvious , and I 'm way too lazy to try to patch them all up here .
Following the best academic tradition , I leave the hole - patching as an exercise for the reader .
In my pet theory of the brain , such as it is , your second - level cache keeps track of all your sensory input for the past few minutes .
It also serves as a scratchpad area for doing computation : if you 're trying to follow a complex argument , you need to construct a graph : idea A leads to B and C , C implies D , etc .
Even following a scene in a story requires a graph and some computation : think of a bank robbery movie scene with five people involved .
Following its progress requires a little short - term memorization and some deduction , and your mind does this for you automatically for situations up to a certain low level of complexity .
What about bigger arguments and more complex scenarios ?
Well , if the graph is too big to fit in your second - level cache , then your brain needs to swap some ideas to " disk " ( your long - term memory ) .
This is also known as " learning stuff . "
Painful , I know .
I 've been there .
So my pet theory is that if you want to make a lasting impression , then you need to fill up the reader 's second - level cache and start blowing pages ( cache elements ) out into their long - term memory .
If you want to imprint them with something memorable , you 've gotta flush it to disk .
To fill the cache you have to create a story big enough to fill their short - and medium - term memory and start spilling over into long - term memory , at which point you 're guaranteed that some of it will stick .
It wo n't be just another funny blurb that your reader sees , laughs at , and immediately forgets .
This obviously entails some effort on the part of the reader , even if they 're having fun .
You watch a 2 - hour movie and you 'll be exhausted ( or at least ready for a break ) because your brain is busy swapping stuff out .
It uses more energy because of those pesky laws of physics that led to the cache structure in the first place .
I think this whole idea scales up to N - level caching ; if you write a whole book about something , and the reader manages to get through it all , then you 've probably left them with a lot more long - term memories and patterns .
But a good essay is usually just trying to get one idea across .
One idea , one big rock in the pond : one sitting , one story .
That 's my theory .
And it 's the thesis of this essay , with the conclusion being that the relationship between blog length and popularity is actually causative .
In the spirit of filling your second - level cache , I 'd like to offer you just one detail of my pet architecture : I think our caches are only partly LRU ; I think there 's some randomness involved in which pages your short - term memory chooses to discard when you 're interrupted with new data .
In fact , if anything , they may be MRU ( Most Recently Used ) , given that when you 're having a conversation with your friend and you both get interrupted , you often can't remember the thing you were just now talking about , but you can both remember things you talked about a few minutes before .
If that 's true , then the stuff that gets swapped to disk is probably different for every reader , and may be somewhat random .
In other words , everyone comes away with some different memory of the essay .
It 's likely also in no small part a function of how well any given turn of phrase is a match for the reader 's experience .
So a good essay needs to try to say the same thing in a bunch of different ways , hoping that whenever the reader 's brain decides to latch onto something that " strikes " them more or less permanently , it 's hopefully related to the core message of the essay .
So everyone gets something different .
But I think that 's a good thing .
If the readers come away thinking about it at all , the essay has succeeded .
There 's more I could say about my style .
Expectations and page - caching theories aside , I think there 's entertainment value in a good story - essay ; you can't really weave in good jokes without some supplemental material , for instance .
And I like to tackle inherently complex topics because they 're more interesting , so it 's never as easy as summarizing with something as pithy as " Java sucks " .
It 's not that simple , no matter how people want it to be so .
So yes , there 's more I could say , but my gut tells me I 've reached the one - sitting limit .
So I 'll wrap up here .
I know I 've oversimplified .
I know I have no business talking about cog sci when I 've never even read a book on it , unless you count Gödel , Escher , Bach .
And I know that even if I 'm right , I may still sometimes overshoot the ideal length significantly .
But I 'm convinced , and I hope you are now as well , that my blog entries are successful because of their length , and not in spite of it .
It 's OK if you do n't agree with my pet theory as to why the longer ones are more successful ; I 've certainly got nothing but intuition backing me up here .
But by getting you to disagree with it , I 've left my mark .
At least you 'll remember the idea now .
Consider yourself imprinted .
This one 's on the house !
At this point I recommend stretching your legs .
Take a walk , get some fresh air , let those disk drives cool down .
You can ponder this stuff later .
It 'll still be there in your brain , like it or not .
I guarantee it .

The Internet means pornography has become more easily available
Almost 80 % of the 43 therapists in the survey said sex addiction is a problem .
Many said the obsessive use of internet pornography is now the most common form of the condition .
The counselling service Relate has also seen a " huge increase " in people who say compulsive sexual behaviour is straining their relationship .
The therapists said that in the most extreme cases people can lose their jobs or partners because of their obsession , with some spending up to eight hours a day looking at pornographic websites .
In the questionnaire , conducted for BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat , 74 % said it was becoming increasingly common to see excessive use of internet pornography as a problem in relationships .
' Severe impact '
Whereas frequent casual sex , risk - taking sex and use of prostitutes was seen as fairly common amongst sex addicts , the use of internet pornography was seen as very common - internet pornography and ' cybersex ' were often seen as anonymous , cheap and safe .
One respondent described the worst case they had come across .
" The most debilitating was a man who had to have sex 10 - 12 times every day .
Lately with internet pornography men seem to get addicted quicker " .
Christine Lacy , Relate
Sex therapy consultant said those with sex addiction problems felt their lives were : " spiralling out of control " .
She said : " In the last two years alone , Relate has witnessed a huge increase in people presenting excessive use of internet pornography , and compulsive sexual behaviour as issues affecting their relationships .
" Their partners feel betrayed and very angry and whilst many partners are supportive , in some cases they cannot continue the relationship which obviously has a severe impact on any children they may have , their jobs and their wider families . "
" Relate counsellors working with teenagers have reported that the instant availability of pornographic images on the internet and mobile phones has worrying implications for their ability to have normal sexual relationships as they grow up . "
The questionnaire was completed by 43 sex and relationship therapists from across the UK .

In your garden , there ’s a fair chance that a farmer is currently tranquilising her livestock with a chemical cocktail she secretes from her feet .
Do n’t believe me ?
Look closer …
Humans are n’t the only species that farms other animals for food – ants do it too and their herds consist of aphids .
They feed on plant sap and excrete a sweet and nutritious liquid called honeydew , which the ants drink .
In return , the ants run a protection racket , defending the aphids from predators like ladybirds .
It seems like a nice two - way partnership that suits both partners , and aphid colonies tended by ants tend to be larger than unattended ones .
But new research from two London universities suggests that ants are manipulating their herds more than previously thought .
Herding aphids
Aphid - farming ants similar problem to human farmers – their herds are likely to wander away and it ’s in the ants ’ interests to prevent this .
Earlier work showed that they sometimes bite the wings off aphids that have them or produce chemicals from glands in their jaws that subdue the development of wings in the first place .
None of that stops the several wingless individuals from just walking away , so the ants use another trick .
Thomas Oliver from Imperial College London found that the black garden ant ( Lasius niger ) secretes chemicals in its footsteps that effectively tranquilise aphids .
Ants use chemical secretions to recognise colony members and to mark trails that their sisters can follow to sources of food .
In this case , their trails sedate the aphids and stop them from walking off to another plant .
Oliver and colleagues placed aphids onto pieces of filter paper in a Petri dish and filmed their movements for five minutes .
Some of the paper had previously been walked on by ants and carried traces of the chemicals they secreted .
Compared to the controls , the aphids that walked in the footsteps of ants moved about 30 % more slowly than those walking on untouched paper .
On average , they also dispersed more slowly , taking longer to reach the edge of the Petri dish .
The ant chemicals only hindered species of aphids that are farmed by ants – a third species , with no ant partners , was unaffected .
Manipulation or partnership ?
Sedating the aphids could also stop them from leaving the host plant in indirect ways .
Aphids only develop winged forms if the colony gets crowded and individuals brush against each other frequently .
If they are sedated , they brush against each other less , and are less likely to develop forms that could fly off .
You could argue that it ’s in the aphids ’ interests to respond to the ants ’ chemicals in this way ; after all , it keeps them close to their protectors .
But it also risks increasing the colony size to the point where the host plant suffers , along with the aphids ’ health .
And staying put leaves multiple generations vulnerable to attacks from parasitic wasps that can avoid the ants ’ attacks .
While it pays the aphids to have ant guardians , Oliver thinks that the ants are definitely manipulating the relationship to get the most out of it .
They get honeydew - on - tap and they can keep their living larders away from the territories of their competitors .
When herded aphids do disperse , it ’s at the whim of the ants , who carry individuals to new host plants within the colony ’s territory .

Compression : Essential Audio Tool or Deadly Sin ?
Those of you who do not work in the audio field probably suspect correctly that many things are done behind the scenes in the studio to the recorded music we hear .
People are aware that music is layered and multi-tracked , and that some pretty fancy editing and splicing are going on , much as they do in video .
However , there is another type of audio manipulation known as compression that is unknown to the public , that is becoming rampant , almost reaching a point now where it is mandatory for something to be compressed to be considered " commercial " or even " professional . "
Compression is the process of electronically narrowing the dynamic range , or volume , of music once it has been converted into an electrical signal .
( A related process known as " limiting " only compresses the upper end to prevent loud peaks .
Compression also boosts the quite parts . )
Some types of audio equipment , such as guitar pickups , telephones , and automatically do this by nature of their inability to transmit a very wide dynamic range .
I call this involuntary compression .
The history of the recording and audio industry has been a steady widening of the dynamic range of speakers , microphones and recording devices , supposedly striving to capture real live music in all its dynamic glory .
Now , largely as a by - product of the commercialism of recorded music , it is seen as desirable to reverse this process , and to make the music as compressed as possible .
Voluntary compression .
Why ?
If you make a tape of a song , you have to set the levels on the tape recorder based on the loudest part of the song .
If there is one part that is really loud , then the overall level of the whole song must be reduced to keep the loud part from red-lining and distorting .
If the song 's dynamics are squashed so there are no loud parts , then the whole song can be loud .
In the earlier days of the vinyl industry , the challenge was to find a way for one record to be louder then another on a jukebox , so it would get attention and sell more .
Incidentally , as a result of some of the " my record is louder than yours " wars of the past , all radio stations are now required by law in the U.S. to compress everything they broadcast , as a way to prevent some music from sounding louder than others .
For this reason , listening to classical music or jazz on the radio is sort of pointless , since that is the music that is supposed to have some excitement and dynamic range .
It is also part of the reason why radio stations have never played many cassettes , because the tape hiss in the quiet parts and between the songs gets boosted .
Compression makes music more palatable , like white bread .
It is less likely to startle anyone if it makes a steady drone like a television ( which is also very compressed , by the way ) and it makes for better audio wallpaper .
The most sought - after producers and mastering engineers use compression endlessly in what they do , and when I read the audio magazines , it is THE major topic of discussion .
It seems to me that it is pointless to use the finest mikes and recording gear in the world to record real , living music , and then squash it flat as a pancake before it is released to the public .
There is a growing battle between the commercial music establishment and the so called " audiophile " market , which consists of those who have bought stereo systems and speakers that are capable of reproducing a wide dynamic range , and who now want to hear some music that showcases what their gear can handle .
As a musician , there is a non -stop pressure on me to compress my recordings .
Though it is an artificial and unnatural alteration of the music , it does have its advantages .
If you listen to music in the background at a low level , then when it is compressed , there will not be loud parts jumping out and startling you , nor will there be quiet parts that fall out and become inaudible .
If you are driving in a car , you usually have a more limited dynamic range and a lot of background road noise , and in order to hear the quiet parts you have to risk having the loud parts distort your speakers .
If you make mix tapes where you combine commercial songs with things like folk or bluegrass , you will notice that the " commercial " cuts are louder .
If you play these mix tapes in a place with ambient noise , like a restaurant , the louder , compressed songs will jump out and be noticed .
Play a sympnony in a restaurant and you will not even hear the quiet parts , and every few minutes there will be a huge volume swell that will jump out and then vanish when it quiets down .
This is why things are compressed .
If you are listening on headphones or in a situation where you are really focused on the music , the compression makes it less interesting and exciting , and you want the dynamic range .
It is almost necessary for recording to be released in 2 versions , compressed and un-compressed , letting the listener can decide if they want the real thing or not .
This will of course never happen .
Compressors are quite expensive , or else it would be easy to just install one in your audio system at home if you want and solve the whole problem of compression .
It would be great if every restaurant had a compressor running so that the CD 's they have in shuffle - play mode will all be the same volume .
I can't advise anyone of how to deal with the issue -- it is a tough personal decision , and I only write this to help people be aware of the issues and the choices .
In my own recordings , I usually do " spot compression " where the volume of the loudest peaks of the music is lowered ( just for the duration of the note or word ) in the mastering process to allow the overall level of the song to be a bit higher , and to eliminate excessive volume bumps .
I find this to be a compromise , and allows the music to have its normal dynamic life .
But I do not mix my recordings for commercial airplay , and I have this luxury .

Why I Left America The Rise Of Elitist Fascism And The Death Of American Democracy An essay in hypertext by Scott Bidstrup " The really dangerous American fascist ... is the man who wants to do in the United States in an American way what Hitler did in Germany in a Prussian way .
The American fascist would prefer not to use violence .
His method is to poison the channels of public information .
With a fascist the problem is never how best to present the truth to the public but how best to use the news to deceive the public into giving the fascist and his group more money or more power ...
The American fascists are most easily recognized by their deliberate perversion of truth and fact .
Their newspapers and propaganda carefully cultivate every fissure of disunity , every crack in the common front against fascism ...
But always and everywhere they can be identified by their appeal to prejudice and by the desire to play upon the fears and vanities of different groups in order to gain power .
They claim to be super - patriots , but they would destroy every liberty guaranteed by the Constitution .
They demand free enterprise , but are the spokesmen for monopoly and vested interest .
Their final objective , toward which all their deceit is directed , is to capture political power so that , using the power of the state and the power of the market simultaneously , they may keep the common man in eternal subjection . "
-- U.S. Vice President Henry A. Wallace , quoted in the New York Times , April 9 , 1944
Why This Essay
O
My family and many of my friends , with varying degrees of puzzlement , even astonishment , have inquired as to why .
This essay was written , in part , to explain to them .
But it was also written as an open letter to my fellow Americans , to warn them once again , as I have tried so many times in the past , as to the perils that await them .
I voted with my feet , primarily , because , as the long - time readers of this site and my activism email list are aware , I 've been the subject of illegal , judicially unauthorized surveillance and harassment by the FBI , purely and solely for my political opinions expressed on this web site , and have therefore concluded , based on what had already happened to other webmasters with sites similar to mine , that expediency required fleeing into exile .
But a contributing factor is that I believe that the American republic came to an end on the 20th of January , 2001 , the day that George W. Bush was inagurated as president in the aftermath of an election , judged by a court of law , to have been fraudulent - the first time in American history this has happened .
What I found even more alarming than the election fraud itself was the almost complete absense of outrage among the American people .
Indeed , most remained blissfully unaware of the sheer scale of the fraud that had ocurred .
As Joseph Goebbels , the Nazi propaganda minister , had suggested must be done , the people had been repeatedly lied to , so many times and so consistently , that the lie simply became conventional wisdom , that the outcome was both legal and reflected their wishes .
And so to this day , they slumber on , even after a second fraudulent election , on a truly vast scale has occurred , which has , for all intents and purposes , established a one - party state in all but name .
And the second time , there was even less outrage !
Even worse , a nascent dictatorship , unrestrained by the American constitution with its Bill of Rights , could be fairly said to have commenced on October 31 , 2001 , the day George W. Bush signed into law the seriously mis-acronymed " USA PATRIOT Act " effectively gutting the Bill of Rights , permanently , and again alarmingly , without significant opposition or protest .
And finally , in 2008 , when the American people had finally had enough to actually do something about it , they were presented with a false choice - and were allowed to vote for what they thought would be change , but were actually given a continuation of the same policy of the replacement of their civil liberties in exchange for a false promise of security .
It was the ultimate triumph of style over substance , of illusion over reality .
I 've long contended that America is headed for a fascist dictatorship , and have said so publicly , on this web site , as long ago as 1996 .
Yet , while many people , from across the political spectrum , have agreed with me in theory , they do n't seem to think that serious repression that will inevitably accompany the fascism will ever happen in their lifetimes - a clear case of denial , based on my own personal , recent experiences with death threats ( which I traced to government IP addresses ) , illegal secret searches of my home , and monitoring trucks openly parked in front of my house for days at a stretch , and even an attempt on my life after I fled into exile .
What finally convinced me I was right , and convinced me to flee into exile , was when a fellow webmaster , whose site was no more seditious than mine , even if rhetorically more inflammatory , was arrested and convincted on a trumped up terrorism charge .
The only " crime " they could pin on him was that while being searched during his arrest , the cops found an empty plastic
Coke bottle and a rag in the trunk of his car - and he was therefore indicted for possession of a " Molotov cocktail . "
He ultimately did a year and a half in a federal penitentiary , a sentence handed down by a Reagan - appointed judge , who openly said he was going to make an example out of him .
His computer , on which his web site had been running , has never been returned to him .
His real crime , of course , was outspoken opposition to the Bush regime , and his advocacy of resistance to it .
I am convinced that the only reason my site is still online is that it is running on a large commercial server with 7,000 other web sites - and confiscating the server would likely result in a class - action lawsuit - and a lot of publicity - by the other users .
" But , " my activist friends have all countered , " periods of repression have happened before in this country , and every time we 've turned it around .
Why should it be different now ? "
They are , of course , arguing that what we are going through is temporary and cyclical , and that it will eventually pass , as Americans tire of the repression and demand that their leadership reform itself , and that a true republican ( small " r " ) democracy be restored .
But apparently , unlike them , I can see the cancer of a fascist authoritarian dictatorship , slowly and quietly forming and carefully and effectively consolidating its hold on power in America .
It is a fascism that has arisen from the tombs of a thousand European fascists of the last century , but it is coming back to us , not in the black leather jackboots and bearing flags emblazoned with swastikas , but instead , this time , carrying crucifixes , waving the Stars and Stripes , and chanting the Pledge of Allegance .
A truly American brand of fascism , just as Henry Wallace , in the epigraph above , warned us about .
Yes , there have been periods of fascist repression in America before , but I can discern some very fundamental differences between the crisis at hand and the historical periods of repression in America .
And so I 'll examine some of those periods , and why , unlike those times in the past , I do not believe that this time we will be able to turn the situation around without , in all likelihood , a violent revolution as advocated by Jefferson to resolve this kind of situation .
There are several factors which my friends are ignoring , or which may not have occurred to them or about which they may be in denial , that make things very different this time .
I believe that they do n't see any of them as important , because by themselves , each factor is weak and insufficient by itself .
But added up , all together , they create a force , a synergy so powerful that no democracy could prevail against it , even one built on the underlying bedrock of cultural support the American democracy has traditionally enjoyed .
What follows was originally written in the form of a letter to a close friend , a fellow activist , who is also aware that American democracy is in serious jeopardy .
He had a difficult time accepting the reasons why I felt compelled to leave , beyond the illegal harassment I have suffered at the hands of the FBI .
He was contending , as many others have , that political repression in America is really nothing new , and I should just wait it out , and that it would change as it always did in the past .
Below is a somewhat expanded version of my response to him .
Things are different this time , very different .
First , and this is by far the most important reason , the values of the Enlightenment ( liberté , egalité , fraternité , as expressed in motto of the French Revolution and embodied in the Declaration of Independence , which were always the cornerstone of American culture , and during the first two centuries of the American republic gradually became the basis of its political culture , have been systematically ( and quite deliberately , I believe ) undermined , discredited and have been made quite unfashionable .
In their place , an attitude has been cultivated among the American public that the rich deserve to be rich because they 're somehow better than the rest of us .
The unstated but troublingly well - accepted idea seems to be that they are better because they make better decisions and / or are morally superior .
Would they still be rich if they were n't somehow better than us ?
This idea , exploiting as it does the long - cherished American value of self reliance , has taken the form of a social Darwinism , that holds that those who fail , for whatever reason , deserve to fail and are therefore unworthy of assistance , because they are incapable of making good decisions and somehow therefore deserve their fate .
This attitude has arisen as the result of a new , bizarre and twisted theory of justice promoted by the far right , the notion that always and in every case , the circumstances in which one finds oneself are entirely the result of decisions one has made .
This , bizarrely , would argue that a child born of drug - addicted parents in a rubbish tip in a Central American slum , who must scramble by himself all day for a few rotting scraps to eat , is exactly as much responsible for his circumstance , and therefore no more entitled to assistance , as the child of a Nelson Rockefeller , who can create entire fortunes for himself by expending no more effort than saying " yes " to an employee .
When egalitarianism is replaced by social Darwinism , as promoted by this bizarre theory of justice , repression of the lower classes not only is acceptable , but is even justified in the minds of the average person even when they are part of the persecuted class .
The result has been that Americans do n't even care about social justice issues as they once did .
If the rich have to step over the homeless in the street on the way to the opera , then so be it .
The belief is that the homeless are laying in the gutter because of decisions they have made - that they 're lazy and incompetent , and they could " pull themselves up by their bootstraps " if they had any " gumption . "
Any effort to improve the lot of the poor is ridiculed as " bleeding - heart liberalism " and " social engineering . "
This attitude has come to be prevalent , even among the working classes in the United States , in spite of the growing experience of those same people with increasingly rapid downward mobility in the form of lower real wages and reduced benefits , over which they have no control and which no decision they could take would halt , and which has occurred in spite of the harder work and longer working hours being put in by the average American worker , more than at any time in living memory .
So deeply have they been convinced that their circumstances are entirely of their own making , that they never seem to question why this downward mobility continues in spite of increasing worker productivity and a growing economy .
They have been told , and therefore assume it to be correct , that it is their fault for decisions they have made themselves .
This is , I believe , the primary legacy of Ronald Reagan , one of the most successful promoters of this weird theory of justice , and one of its strongest advocates .
He thereby succeeded in making elitism , and the increasing concentration of wealth , and the power and privilege that accompanies it , and the social Darwinism that morally justifies it , not only acceptable , but even fashionable .
His success in creating that fashionability is the main reason , besides the appalling corruption in his administration , why I believe historians , in the really long term - a few centuries on - will be very unkind to the man .
The fashionability of anti-egalitarian elitism is something quite new in American politics - such values have not been popular in America since before the " Second American Revolution " of 1800 , in which the elitism of the Federalist party was finally defeated after the mass of Americans had grown weary of governance under those values and threatened a second violent revolution .
Without a recognition of inherent , natural inequality of circumstance , an understanding of the vital importance of equality of opportunity and the importance of economic and social justice , there is no way that democracy can survive for long .
As Plutarch noted two and a half millenia ago , social inequality is always , and in every case , the fatal disease of every republic .
And if egalitarianism is n't valued , if people grow to accept elitism as if it were the natural order of things , the people wo n't care that democracy has vanished , because they 'll have come to regard absolute rule by the propertied elite as how things simply are and should be , based on the self - evident superiority of the propertied elite .
By fostering this attitude , the oligarchy will have succeeded in re-introducing the " divine right of kings , " and the economic feudalism of the past based on it , but in a new guise : the " natural right " to rule by the " obviously and self - evidently " superior , i.e. , the rich and powerful .
Indeed , this " natural right " is the basis of the Straussianism , better known popularly as " neoconservatism , " to which most of the major figures in the Bush II administration were adherent and which guided their policymaking - and many of these same people are still in positions of power in the Obama administration .
Neoconservatism is nothing less than a new Marxism , but a Marxism turned on its head - a kind of polar opposite - not based on an egalitarian , naturalist theory of justice , but rather the rationalization of a ruthless social Darwinism in which the propertied elites are entitled to rule by the virtue of their presumed superiority .
Neoconservatism is descendant from nothing less than Nazism , as a result of Leo Strauss ' close affiliation with many luminaries of the Nazi movement , including its theoreticians , Martin Heidegger , Carl Schmitt and others .
Although most biographies of Strauss claim he was a refugee from Nazi Germany , the fact is that his position at the University of Chicago was actually arranged for him through the influence of Carl Schmitt , Adolf Hitler 's political theoretician , and a close associate of Strauss since their university student days together at the University of Hamburg .
Many of the luminaries of the far right - Paul Wolfowitz , John Bolton , Daniel Perle , William Kristol and many other well - known and highly influential neoconservatives were acolytes of Leo Strauss and accepted his views almost as divine wisdom .
These intellectual descendants of Nazism are the men that are now , today , creating social , and in many cases , political policy in the United States .
Second , this is the first time in American history where there has been no check whatever on the excesses of the propertied interests , checks which have always been present to some degree in American politics since the founding of the republic .
It is the first time that oligarchic plutocracy has taken full control , on all three branches of government simultaneously , without any effective restraint whatever , thereby short - circuiting the system of " checks and balances " so carefully designed by the founding fathers , and generally reinforced by the knowledgability and rationality of an educated and informed voting public .
Even the press , the " fourth estate , " which always informed and educated in the past , has been subsumed into the elitist cause .
The term , " fourth estate , " comes from the French Revolution , when a free press was regarded as the essential fourth chamber of the three - " estate " legislature which ruled France .
It was recognized that the press was an essential element in informing the public - and holding the feet of public officials to the fire when they messed up or began to concentrate power in their own hands .
But in America today , that " fourth estate " serves to actually prop up and support the oligarchy , rather than to restrain it .
In the past , at least one branch , usually two of government , or at the very least , public opinion , was under the control and / or influence of people with egalitarian ideals .
The propertied interests simply could n't grab full control of the machinery of power , because the system of checks and balances or because informed public opinion prevented them from doing so .
No longer .
Nowadays , the President is an elitist , both houses of Congress are firmly under the control of the propertied interests , and the Supreme Court is evenly split - four elitists , four egalitarians and one swing vote who was appointed by the propertied elites and generally sides with them on all but the most blatantly unfair positions .
And a generally ignorant public opinion is guided by a press owned and controlled by the oligarchy , which serves its interests shamelessly and unhesitatingly .
During the post - revolutionary period , the Federalists , led by Alexander Hamilton , sought to establish rule by the propertied elite , because they believed that the " rabble " were incapable of governing themselves .
It was their influence that created many of the elitist institutions that are with us today , such as the electoral college , the rules of seniority in Congress , the difficulty of replacing unresponsive public officials , etc .
Hamilton sought to impose a series of draconian , elitist policies that , until recently , Americans would have regarded with horror , disgust and disdain .
I know I certainly did when I studied them in American history classes and civics classes in high school all those years ago .
The Federalist era ended when the people had had enough .
The Shea Rebellion and the Whiskey Rebellion , followed by the results of the election of 1800 , made it very clear that the nation was in no mood to allow a homegrown elite to rule in lieu of the British elite , with no regard for the concerns and needs of the masses .
That " Second American Revolution " as it was once called , saw the end ( at least for a time ) of the Federalist movement , and that " revolution " was made possible by a free press that informed the public of what was really happening to it and why , and what options were open to it to change the situation .
Americans were once taught in detail as to the issues and meaning of the Second American Revolution .
Yet how many Americans these days have even heard of the Second American Revolution or know what the issues were ?
The next era of repression came with the Civil War .
Again , it was a close call for the Bill Of Rights .
President Lincoln suspended habeas corpus and the constitutional requirement for civilian trials during the civil war , because of what he considered to be the urgent necessities of what was by far the greatest crises ever to be faced by the American polity .
But Lincoln appreciated the requirement that the convenience of the government must take a back seat to civil liberties if democracy is to flourish , and Lincoln was a thorough - going egalitarian .
So at the end of the war , habeas corpus was promptly re-instated .
And had he not done so , the courts had made it clear that they were quite prepared to overrule him .
During next period of repression , the first " red scares , " which led to the Palmer Raids , in the 1920's and ' 30's , there was public opinion , informed by what was then a truly free press , that created the outrage that eventually forced the courts , particularly the Supreme Court , to eventually turn things back .
The outrage among the public was the result of the fact that people understood the perils faced by democracy , because they had been schooled in civics and had understood the threat to the Bill of Rights that the Palmer Raids represented .
During the Second World War , with the memories of the Palmer Raids fresh in everyone 's minds , it was tacitly agreed that the restrictions imposed as part of the war effort were genuinely necessary for the emergency at hand , and would be turned back at the cessation of hostilities .
Which is exactly what happened - Harry Truman , for all his defects , at least was a social libertarian at heart , and understood and undertook that responsibility .
During the most recent repressive era , the McCarthy Era of the 1950's and early ' 60's , the first major voice of dissent that spoke out to turn back the tide of repression , was a journalist , Edward R. Murrow , speaking out on the then brand - new medium of information , television .
His words had deep resonance , because the American people had been educated in civics and understood the perils to personal liberty that demagoguery posed , and it was self evident that they had a crisis with which they had to deal , and what needed to be done about it .
The public outrage , led by the press , finally forced the courts and the Congress to rein in the excesses .
Yet nowadays we have neither a truly free press ( which today is owned by and serves the interests of the propertied elite ) nor do we have an educated electorate .
What percentage of Americans today have taken a high - school course in civics ?
As a result , one by one , the Federalist policies are coming back to haunt us - sedition legislation , outright loss , not just suspension , of habeas corpus , highly regressive taxation , exclusive access by the propertied elite to the machinery of power and the like , and the few dissenters are ignored , or , as in my own case , repressed .
The movement to bring back Federalist elitism is being led by a group that even calls itself the " Federalist Society " - an appellation whose connotations of elitism they openly and quite happily endorse .
President George W. Bush , failed Supreme Court candidate Robert Bork , Justices Antonin Scalia and William Rehnquist are all members , as are many of the Republicans , and even a few Democrats in Congress , as well as many well - known conservative political commentators , such as Alan Keyes .
Many are openly contemptuous of democracy for any but the propertied elite , which of course , always means themselves ( " too much democracy , " they 've often been quoted as saying ) .
Third , the propertied elites have learned well the lessons to be derived from their loss of control in the past .
They know that they can't allow a free press , nor dissent from an educated populace if they want to sieze control and remain in control for long .
They have learned the necessity of taking control of the press , so that there will be no disturbance to the deep psychological denial in which the vast majority of Americans slumber on so peacefully .
You will not see a genuine outrage this time , because the propertied elite have learned how to make outrage unfashionable , and keep it unfashionable .
That last phrase is vitally important - they have learned that to suppress dissent , it is necessary only to make dissent unfashionable , and by doing so , they can ensure that any and all voices of dissent remain marginalized .
This has enabled them to quite effectively suppress dissent in America , not through the efforts of a harsh , repressive secret police or heavy - handed censorship board , but by simple , relentless peer pressure .
In that way , they have learned from the mistakes of the Nazi and fascist propaganda machines , and have learned very well how to subvert dissent permanently , with no secret police anyone can point to as evidence of a machinery of repression .
The result in America these days is that the only voices of dissent one hears at all come from those far to the left on the political spectrum - and the propertied elites have learned how to discredit them , not by proving them wrong , but by simply ensuring that they remain shouted down through a carefully manipulated media machine that actively discriminates against them , while repeating the lies over and over .
This is new .
We 've never seen this before in America .
Each time the Bill of Rights has been threatened , from the American revolution to the present , it has been the voices of dissent that have called attention to the peril , and eventually turned the tide of repression , with the sword of liberty taken up by the press .
That can no longer happen , because the voices of dissent have been silenced through enforced unfashionability , and the self - serving press itself has become an agent of the propaganda machine with its mindlessly and endlessly repeated distortions and even outright lies .
But even this was not enough .
Beginning with Ronald Reagan , a deliberate effort has been made to propagandize the American people directly , by means of covert programs , designed to propagandize the American people directly , ( PDF file , 3.4 mb. ) which began for the purpose of building support among the American people for the intervention in Nicaragua and the violent overthrow there of a popular regime that won elections handily in a free and fair election - directly contrary to the assertion of the national value of supporting democracy and self determination abroad .
Those covert domestic propaganda programs continue , and have expanded greatly in recent years - we know they are going on , but no one is complaining , not the American people , not the Congress , not even the political parties that are being repressed and discriminated against by them .
It is all part of the new machinery for manufacturing consent and discouraging dissent - and directly controlling how people vote .
Fourth , the public education system has been carefully subverted for the purpose of ensuring that Americans end up generally undereducated and incapable of critical thinking and reasoning , so the propertied elite can rule without interference by the " rabble " or the " great unwashed " asserting their outrageous demands for the right to life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness .
By de-emphasising critical thinking and reasoning skills , Americans with all their years of education , know a lot of facts , but are generally incapable of doing independent , critical thinking that might lead to conclusions at variance with the consensus generated and maintained by an propertied elite with an ingeniously slick propaganda machine .
Civics is no longer taught , so most Americans do n't even understand the meaning of demagoguery , much less understand how to recognize it and , more importantly , neutralize it .
The numerous examples of other peoples in the world living better than Americans are carefully kept from the American people , whose world runs from the 49th Parallel to the Rio Grande , and from the Atlantic to the Pacific .
There is a whole world out there of which Americans are woefully ignorant , and from which they hear only when there is a calamaty that needs their attention .
Fewer than 14 % of Americans even hold passports .
Instruction in critical thinking and classical logic , with rigor , from the very beginning of education is why civil war soldiers were able to write letters home with far more erudition than many college graduates can write today , even though those civil war soldiers had an average of only three years of public education .
They often quoted classical Greek philosophers and pondered the philosophical meaning and consequences of their suffering .
During the Lincoln - Douglas debates , simple farmers and trades - people would sit and listen to intricate political theorizing with rapt attention for hours - and even college graduates today would hardly be able to even understand the transcripts of those debates , much less follow the reasoning .
That 's a huge difference , and a major setback for the cause of the Enlightenment and the values that underlie democracy .
The rigorous teaching of critical thinking , logic and philosophy is why Switzerland , one of the richest nations in the world , has a population three fourths of which , never went beyond the equivalent of the American sixth grade , yet nevertheless is one of the economic , scientific and cultural powerhouses of Europe , and has the admiration and respect of the rest of the planet .
The propertied elites do n't like hard questions being asked about why they are entitled to the sole exercise of power to the exclusion of the genuine participation of the masses .
Without widespread critical thinking and reasoning , there is little effective dissent , so they do n't have to worry about their privilege being questioned .
Democracy cannot be sustained for long in such an atmosphere , and the propertied elites know that and want it that way , and worked hard over the last half century to implement and maintain that policy .
They have succeeded brilliantly , and most Americans only sense a problem with their educational system , but have no clue as to what that problem actually is or what to do about it .
Fifth , the fundamentalist conservative religious elites and economic elites are conspiring to ensure that power is removed from democratic institutions and is maintained in their grasp .
It would have been inconceivable to earlier generations that a deliberate effort would be made to subvert the " wall of separation " between church and state , but now , we have a situation where the fundamentalist Christians realize that they can never evangelize their way to power , so they see the only way open to them to evangelize America is to sieze power by force , and evangelize America by codifying their religious beliefs into law and public policy .
The propertarian elites realize that they 're vulnerable to a revolt against their greed , avarice and hunger for power if their hegemony were wholly sectarian - without an obvious reason why they should be the rulers - their hubris and sense of self - entitlement would be naked and exposed to the view of the lower classes .
That 's why the unholy alliance between what has been called the " theofascists " and the " econofascists . "
By combining their influence , a synergism is formed that will be difficult , if not impossible to stop in a profoundly ignorant and predominately blindly religious nation such as America .
Sixth , there is no historical precedent for a society that has not had economic and social justice , but has remained a stable democracy over the long term .
There are plenty of examples of nations that are not politically free , but which have relative economic and social justice ( South Korea , Taiwan , communist Yugoslavia and Singapore come immediately to mind ) , and a few examples of societies that maintain an outward appearance of democracy , but which in reality remain firmly in the grip of propertied elites ( India , Brazil , and Mexico and much of the rest of Latin America are good examples ) , but it has never been shown that it is possible to maintain a genuinely politically free and open government in the absence of economic and social justice .
It never has been done , and I am convinced it never will be done .
America 's problem here is that Americans seem to have been taught that social justice and egalitarian democracy are mutually exclusive , and have been taught to accept social injustice , thinking it to be a prerequisite to democracy .
Actually , the opposite is the case - most of Western Europe stands as an example - from the French Revolution , democracy was always fragile in Europe until social justice became firmly established after World War II .
The history of Costa Rica is also an excellent example - democracy there was struggling and barely hanging on until a civil war in 1948 brought to power a man who established a constitution based on social justice and the rule of law , and careful and thorough education of the masses .
Those policies ushered in an era of stable , flourishing democracy unprecedented in Central American ( and even Latin American ) history .
As a result , Costa Ricans not only enjoy a median income five times that of their neighbors on a per-capita Gross Domestic Product that is not much higher , but their government is far more stable and secure than their neighbors as a result of adherence to that 1948 constitution .
Every president since 1948 has come to power in Costa Rica as the result of a free and fair election - a record not matched even in the United States .
The past half - century of history in Costa Rica has demonstrated that even in a poor country , transparent democracy and social justice are directly correlated - not inversely correlated as many Americans have been so skillfully deceived by their propertied elites into believing .
Seventh , democracy is inherently fragile .
While there are a lot of nations that display the many trappings of democracy , but are not truly democratic , true republican democracy is a far more fragile and ephemeral thing than most people who have no real grounding in civics will ever understand .
We 've been exceedingly fortunate in America for having a unique set of cultural factors that have enabled us to maintain , without a lot of effort , a democratic republic for two centuries , even in the face of a political system that was deliberately biased towards propertarian elitism .
There are so many ways to subvert democracy that it really does require " eternal vigilance " to maintain , even in a culture as supportive as ours has historically been ( but unfortunately is no longer ) .
But nobody is maintaining eternal vigilance in America anymore except for a few discredited , and often harassed leftists such as myself .
And now , as the result of the fact that the cultural values that support egalitarian democracy have been identified and systematically undermined by the propertied elites , and in the absence of " eternal vigilance " on the part of the masses , democracy cannot long exist , nor can genuine open , egalitarian liberty , based on equality before the law , long endure .
The most time - honored method of subverting a democracy is the rigged election .
Rigging of elections in the United States is nothing new , of course ; it is as old as the republic .
But what is new is the sheer scale of the vote rigging .
In the past , vote rigging was always done at the local or at most , regional level by corrupt local political machines .
But now it has gone national .
In 2000 , it was the use of doctored felon purge lists in Florida that robbed the Democratic candidate for U.S. president of at least 24,000 votes , and of course , the presidency - a fact that was front page news in Europe for a week at the time , but was entirely unreported in the U.S.
In Ohio , in 2004 , a variety of techniques were used to swing the vote in key precincts and counties state - wide , and skewed the total vote in that key state by at least three percent .
And again , it cost the Democratic candidate the presidency .
And now , voter suppression - keeping Democrats from even casting ballots in the first place - is a technique that has gone national , with mostly Republican secretaries of state being empowered by a new national law to simply remove from the rolls anyone they wish , for any reason they wish , at any time they wish , and without recourse - and as a result , in California , nearly 40 % of newly registered voters are in for a surprise when they try to vote .
And most of those whose names have been secretly removed from the rolls registered as Democrats .
Another vote suppression technique that is being used is to require voters to present government issued photo IDs before they can be given a ballot - a tactic that discriminates against the poor and elderly , who often do not possess government issued photo IDs .
And you have only one guess as to which party that group predominately votes for .
There is also an effort being made to make voter registration drives so onerous , difficult and the potential liability so great that no one will undertake them - because they typically register more Democrats than Republicans .
The League of Women Voters has announced that in many states , it will no longer undertake voter registration drives , for the first time in its history .
Eighth , corruption eats away at the very foundation on which democracy is and must be built , namely the rule of law .
Yet Americans have come to tolerate and accept public corruption , and the result is that the rule of law is quickly being eroded , as the governing Republicans and conservatives believe that it 's fine because their ends justify their means ( a sentiment thoroughly and rightfully abohrrent to earlier generations , even among conservatives ) .
As respect for the rule of law erodes , there is no way that democracy can survive for long .
One of the cultural changes that were made by the Reaganites was the toleration of corruption as long as it is committed by the ruling propertied elite for whom corruption grew to be considered an entitlement .
The scandals of the George W. Bush administration , in earlier generations , would have been an outrage , and people would have demanded immediate disciplinary action , if not outright impeachment of the president .
But not anymore .
The corporate media , whose corporate owners have participated in much of that corruption , have been largely silent beyond a very superficial reporting of some of it , and few realize what dangers this corruption poses to democratic values and the rule of law .
As the reasoning goes , corruption is expected of Republicans , and as long as it is conservatives that do it , it 's OK , because , as they say and Americans generally believe , they 're in favor of liberty ( even if privately they admit that they believe in it for themselves alone ) .
The current administration has made a mockery of transparency in government , even going so far as to subsidize any and all agencies and individuals within the government who are fighting Freedom Of Information Act requests .
They are classifying as " secret " reports that have nothing to do with national security or criminal investigations , and are harassing and intimidating whistleblowers on an unprecedented scale .
Getting information out of the current administration , particularly when it reflects badly on the administration , is becoming extremely difficult .
Virtually the only information appearing in the press and among the dissidents nowadays is the result of leaks .
This is new - there was never this kind of governmental opacity in the past .
Additionally , this president has not only ignored the law in many cases , but has defied the will of congress , and has even gone so far as to completely ignore a Supreme Court decision that went against him .
Only once before in all of American history has a president done that , and Andrew Jackson has been excoriated through history since as a result .
This president does it , and no one even seems to notice , much less begin drafting articles of impeachment .
Ninth , the United States has taken it as almost a god - given right in its operations abroad ( PDF file , 1.2 mb ) to subvert the rule of law , organize and operate terrorist paramilitary death squads , undermine any and all political and economic activities with which its operatives disagree , including the overthrow of democratically elected governments , hide human rights abuses , including kidnapping and murder , from journalists and the public , engage in warrantless searches and surveillance , secretly kidnap and detain people off the street and hold them indefinitely without charge or contact by families or legal help , engage in false - flag operations , create and operate secret propaganda projects designed to control public opinion , and even employ terrorists whenever it suits them , all without the knowledge and approval of the local government .
So much is this assumed to be a right of the United States government in its operations abroad , and so long has it gone on , that there is almost no political opposition to it at home anymore - though foreign populations are quite well aware of it , and angrily resent it .
But what happens when the U.S. government begins to begin to use these same tactics at home , on American citizens ?
What is to prevent it from doing so ?
But most importantly , why would they not ?
Indeed , it has been my own personal experience , that at least some of these activities are already happening domestically in the U.S .
Most of these situations are without precedence in American history , particularly in their confluence .
That 's why in the past we 've always been able to cycle between fascist repression and a relatively transparent republic , but this time we can't and I am convinced , we wo n't .
Where will it end ?
In the very long term , the most likely possible outcome is that the United States will end up in a brutally violent and extremely repressive fascist dictatorship in which the distinction between business and government is blurred if not outright abolished , and between which the propertied elites move back and forth freely , a world in which the propertied elites simply regard the general population as oxen to be put to the plow and to be exploited to the maximum extent possible .
Human rights will be completely ignored by a flag - waving , Bible - banging paramilitary elite , since the citizenry will be regarded essentially as livestock , and business will use large amounts of penal labor as slave labor for the production of cheap goods to be exported to the rest of the world , exclusively for the propertied elites ' benefit - any hint of opposition will earn a life sentence of slave labor in the camps , and ever increasing numbers of the general population will find themselves involved in the criminal " justice " system as ever more slave labor is needed .
Eventually , even the pretense of democracy will be abandoned , and the constitution will become but a fond memory .
Another possible but less likely outcome is that the United States will settle into an unstable fascist dictatorship , falling apart over the course of the twenty - first century , breaking up into a small number of under - developed , ineffectually governed , deeply repressive third world dictatorships , many , if not most of them elitist Christian theocracies , in which the difference between big business and government is often blurred and where the use of slave penal labor by business is common , but which are frequently at war with each other .
Either way , this end - state of capitalism - a merger of business and government - will be so brutal and inhumane that it will cause the rest of the world to re-examine with abhorrence its blind acceptance of market - based capitalist free - enterprise and the very premise of an American - style republic .
A third possibility , by far the least likely in my view , is that the people will rebel , and take up Jefferson 's challenge to revolution , which would end up brutal and bloody indeed , and which is unlikely to succeed .
I view this outcome as unlikely , because the fascists are already making thorough preparations to deal with dissent and rebellion - they have learned well the lessons to be derived from their loss of power in the past .
Daniel Ortega , a founder and the leader of the Sandinista movement in Nicaragua , once observed that if the United States government ever did at home what it does abroad , America would become the most repressive nation on earth .
He was right .
The American propertied elite has finally figured out how get away with doing at home what it has done abroad for many years .
And the result will become just as Ortega predicted .
America is soon going to become a seriously unpleasant place indeed for those who are not in league with the arrogantly self - serving propertied elite .
I came to understand that .
And that is why I voted with my feet .
When I first wrote this essay back in May of 2003 , after only two years of unrestrained fascist rule , I could not have imagined how rapid the decline of the American democracy into an authoritarian one - party state would be .
Nor could I have imagined how totally unopposed would be the rise of that authoritarianism .
It has truly been astonishing to watch from a thousand miles away in a foreign land .
And everything that I feared back then , has been realized , in spades , and even faster than I could have imagined it would be .
The public education system is more than ever being undermined , from a two - pronged assault - on the one side , from fundamentalist Christians who are determined to undermine the teaching of science , particularly the biological sciences , as well as critical thinking and independent reasoning skills , and replace that learning and those skills with religious doctrine dressed up as if it were scientific theory , and to encourage blind religious adherence at the expense of reasoned analysis and conclusion .
The result is statistics that speak for themselves :
As I write this ( January , 2006 ) 59 % of Americans actually believe that the prophesies in the Book of Revelations are about to be visited on Americans , and nearly all of those believe that the " righteous " will be taken up into heaven in the " Rapture " followed by a " Tribulation " of those " left behind . "
The extent to which religious doctrine has , without significant opposition , been inculcated into law is mindboggling - abortions , which technically remain legal throughout America , have , as the result of the fundamentalists forcing their religious doctrines on the rest of society , been made so difficult to obtain that doctors and hospitals across America are seeing the results of the return of back - alley and self - induced abortions , all while there is hardly a soul who questions the absolute absurdity of declaring human gametes to not be human - beings , while human zygotes are , with even more legal rights than are enjoyed by a post - partem newborn or even its walking , talking , living , breathing mother !
The other side of the assault is coming from the fascists themselves , who are increasingly successful in " dumbing down " the public education system to make its product servile , compliant and easily manipulated and used , a project which it has been working on since 1948 when the project was first overtly planned .
Again , statistics tell the story of the success of that project : " In a ' State of the First Amendment Survey ' conducted by the University of Connecticut in 2003 , 34 percent of Americans polled said the First Amendment ' goes too far ' ; 46 percent said there was too much freedom of the press ; 28 percent felt that newspapers should not be able to publish articles without prior approval of the government ; 31 percent wanted public protest of a war to be outlawed during that war ; and 50 percent thought the government should have the right to infringe on the religious freedom of ' certain religious groups ' in the name of the war on terror . "
Since 2003 , these statistics have clearly worsened noticably , as has been quite evident to me by the responses to this essay and others on my site that I have received over the years .
The New York Times has reported that many school districts are now making sobriety tests a regular feature of the school day : apparently opium derivatives are the opiate of the youth who cannot cope with the mind - numbing vapidity of an educational system deliberately calculated to rob them of their initiative and creativity .
And 90 % of that opium is coming from one of America 's new colonies - Afghanistan - and no one notices or cares .
Millions of Americans have no idea who the U.S. fought against or with in World War II , and even fewer understand what the issues were .
Few recent college graduates can define the difference between an argument and an assertion .
Geographical ignorance is appalling - one travel agent in Hawaii reports that he regularly gets inquiries as to whether taking a plane or a train to Hawaii is cheaper .
The majority of high school graduates cannot locate themselves on a map of their state .
Many cannot even identify the United States on an outline map of the world .
American universities are no longer the preferred venue for foreign students to come and get an education , as they were when I left the States just three years ago .
That honor has gone to European and Canadian universities , and increasingly , universities in China and Japan .
So many universities are having problems attracting foreign students that many are now actively recruiting abroad , while American college students find that tuition is rising with such brutal speed , and with federally - funded college loans no longer available , that a college education is no longer within reach of the middle class , and quite by design .
Working your way through college , as I did , or getting a Bachelor 's on the GI bill , is no longer even remotely possible .
Daily , their political leadership tells Americans , quite falsely , that they are the most envied people on earth , and , even more absurdly , that that envy is the source of the " terrorism problem " and the 9/11 attacks .
But what Americans are not told is that their medical system is by far the most expensive in the world ( nearly twice as expensive , per capita , as number two ) , yet is ranked 37th best by the World Health Organization , with Cuba , of all nations , offering a lower infant mortality rate than the United States .
They 're not told that one American in five has no access to health care at all , or that one child in four lives in poverty , a rate higher than some third - world nations , and that rate is rapidly rising .
They 're not told how rapidly their educational statistics are declining , how far they are behind the rest of the world , and how rapidly functional illiteracy , and especially innumeracy is increasing .
They 're not told that America has one of the highest costs of living in the world , yet all that money they 're spending on it buys a quality of life that barely makes it into the top twenty anymore .
The United States does n't manufacture much of anything anymore , but simply borrows money from abroad to buy whatever it likes from foreign manufacturers , and increasingly , service providers - to the tune of half a trillion dollars every year in new debt to finance its current consumption of everything from European airliners and Russian satellite launches , to Chinese plastic flip - flops and underwear stitched in sweat shops in Indonesia or El Salvador .
Americans never hear about how the United States now buys more food abroad than it sells - the United States , which once fed the world , no longer even feeds itself , but instead increasingly borrows money from other nations in order to buy its food - the very definition of food insecurity .
Americans are not told how this new debt not only mortgages their future , but how it is rapidly eroding America 's influence in the world as foreign nations such as China , the owners of that debt , thereby gain leverage over American foreign and increasingly even domestic economic and even political policy .
While the Chinese automobile industry is rapidly rising , the American automobile industry is in a state of near collapse , and no one seems to care or even notice .
They 're not told how legislation , much of it actually written by business itself , has subsidized the export of all those jobs .
Even Hollywood , the industry that has proudly entertained the world for generations , is about to be surpassed by the Indian film industry known as " Bollywood " in terms of both film output , theater showings and even revenues .
Already , there has been a huge rise of local entertainment ( including film ) industries in Latin America , the Far East , South Asia and in the last two years , even Africa .
While the American film and music industries are obsessing over online digital piracy and how to hijack the coercive power of government to stop it , the rest of the world is happily eating Hollywood 's lunch .
America 's arrogant and belligerent foreign policy has made America so deeply unpopular that increasingly large numbers of foreigners are unwilling to pay to watch American movies anymore , just to be reminded of how well Americans are living at their expense .
The rapid decline of the American middle class has become noticable since I left .
A surprising number of middle aged couples , looking forward to becoming " empty - nesters , " are finding themselves now raising young children again - their grandkids , because their own children cannot afford to live on their own while raising kids anymore - a situation that would have been unthinkable just a generation ago .
More and more people who used to buy a new car every other year are now finding themselves shopping for three - year old used cars and driving them until they 're worn out .
Most homes in the U.S. are now mortgaged to the their current market value and even beyond , and their owners are dependent on pulling out the equity from increasing home values to finance a lifestyle that can no longer be sustained by their shrinking real incomes .
When the real estate bubble finally bursts , and the equity is no longer there to pay back those second and third mortgage loans , there will be some serious anguish as bankrupt homeowners suddenly discover that they can no longer escape their mortgage debt burden through a declaration of bankruptcy , thanks to new bankruptcy laws .
Americans on the whole now are , for the first time in American history , spending considerably more money than they are earning in income - sixty percent more - and pulling equity out of their homes and drawing down savings to make up the difference .
The savings rate in the U.S. is gone negative , for the first time in American history .
America is no longer in first place as the preferred venue for foreign investment in the world , as it was for almost a century .
That honor has gone to Communist China , of all countries .
And just look at who is number two - it is none other than France , the country that the neo- conservatives running the U.S. love to deride as the nation with no future , because it rejects their economic and social nostrums in favor of social justice .
It would appear that the international investors know something the neo-cons do n't .
Neither are Americans told that their nation is no longer the most competitive nation on earth , and they 're certainly not told that Finland - that bastion of Scandinavian liberal ( gasp ! ) socialism - now is the world 's most competitive , as ranked by business leaders themselves .
The American dollar is dangerously poised for a currency collapse on a scale not seen in centuries .
A reader of this essay , a financial analyst on Wall Street , wrote me and said that the conditions exist for a " perfect financial storm " - the confluence of 1 ) an enormous pool of dollars held by foreign nations , which will become essentially worthless when the dollar is no longer backed by oil as it now is , 2 ) a level of consumer debt that is so large there is no conceivable way it could ever be paid back , and 3 ) a level of debt owed to the rest of the world by America that is now so huge that being forced to pay it all back could , by itself , impoverish America for most of a century .
And it is hardly just that financial analyst that is concerned , either .
Articles are beginning to appear about the looming crisis in such mainstream conservative magazines as The Economist and Forbes .
It was the subject of much discussion among heads of state and central bank officials ( and even the occasional , timid press report now and again ) in the World Economic Forum at Davos , Switzerland , in 2006 .
The death knell for the dollar may finally happen in March of 2006 when the Iranians are expected to open an oil bourse denominated in euro - something other than dollars - so bulk crude oil can be bought and sold for something other than dollars for the first time ever .
All those billions of dollars that were being held to buy oil can then get dumped on the foreign exchange markets - and with everyone selling and no one buying , you can imagine what could happen to the value of the dollar .
Additionally , the Chinese currently ( as of January , 2006 ) hold well over $ 700 billion in U.S. debt instruments - that 's one and a half percent of the entire net worth of the United States , being owned by a Communist country - and they 've made no secret of the fact that they are selling that debt as fast as they can without driving down the market .
And that 's just China .
Add to that the U.S. debt held by Japan , the Europeans , the east Asians , and the Latin Americans , and you can begin to appreciate how much of American liquidity is owned by or owed to foreigners , who are quietly ( and some not so quietly ) getting rid it as quickly as they can .
And the situation grows worse every day , as the U.S. borrows ever more , ever faster , to finance its current consumption .
Add to that all the domestic debt owed by the U.S. government and Americans privately , and you have an amount of debt approaching the entire net worth of the United States of America .
How will it ever be paid back ?
How could it ever get paid back ?
And with America 's arrogant and self - serving foreign policy of recent years , how many other countries are going to be willing to rush in and sacrifice their own self - interest to help prop up an arrogant , self - serving America and stave off disaster ?
Anti-Americanism has risen noticably in the years I have lived abroad , as this administration has thoughtlessly and carelessly squandered American prestige .
Americans used to be told that anti-Americanism abroad was the result of Communist propaganda - a lie that did n't make much sense to anyone who travelled abroad , even back during the Cold War .
But now they are told that it is the result of envy , an even more absurd lie .
I used to joke to the locals here in Central America that I am innocent , because I did n't vote for Bush , and when I first arrived , that comment always got a hearty laugh .
Now , when I make that joke , the locals take that as a serious comment , intended to distance myself from the millions of Americans who voted to re-elect an obviously disastrous failure , when they could not claim ignorance of his agenda and competence .
Anti-American grafitti , present but uncommon when I arrived , is now increasingly apparent , as the locals increasingly blame the American people themselves for Bush and the arrogance of his policies .
I find myself increasingly getting the cold shoulder from taxi drivers , bureaucrats , store clerks , bus conductors and just plain people on the street , many of whom have encountered other Americans , some of whom still mindlessly support Bush and are n't bashful about admitting it .
I occasionally find it necessary to fake a British or Australian accent and try to pass as a non-American - there is no prestige in being an American abroad anymore , only stigma , and increasingly , even overt resentment - and it has absolutely nothing to do with some weird neo -con concept of penis envy .
Only when I tell my story as a political exile , do the locals open up to me and become friendly nowadays - and some become very friendly indeed when they know my full story , because they can relate - some have become my best and most reliable friends as a result .
Where I live , here in Central America , the erosion of America 's prestige has had noticable effects even in the grocery store or hardware store .
When I arrived , American brands in the stores here were everywhere , but now they have all been replaced by local or European brands , even by American corporations which are marketing their goods here .
Recognizable American brands are becoming increasingly uncommon - and frequently sit on shelves unbought .
The Coca Cola signs , once ubiquitous in front of nearly every Latin American roadside diner and village general store , are now rapidly being painted over or taken down , even when Coca Cola is still on offer .
American - branded fast food franchises are even beginning to report declining sales for the first time , not because Latins do n't have the money , they just increasingly prefer to spend it elsewhere - on non-U.S. brands , especially local franchises .
The casual acceptance of the abandonment of adherence to the rule of law , particularly electoral law , has been truly alarming in years I have been gone .
There was at least some outrage when the rigged elections in Florida in 2000 , put George Bush Junior in the White House .
But when in Ohio , in 2004 , even more outrageous vote manipulation and egregious fraud occurred , to the extent of at least five percent of the total reported vote in that state , the almost complete silence of the American people was deafening .
It was like it was expected and inevitable , or it did n't matter , or worse , was n't to be believed .
The American people were robbed of their election - and democracy - and they did n't even seem to care .
There was n't so much as a serious call for a congressional investigation , other than from a single member of congress , John Conyers .
It was like the opposition political party , the Democrats , who had been robbed of victory , had packed up and gone home with little more than a sigh of resignation to the inevitable , or , worse , that they themselves had somehow been complicit .
When it was revealed that America routinely spies on its own citizens , in direct violation of the Fourth Amendment as well as federal law , the president not only was n't apologetic , he was openly defiant .
The Vice President has created an embarrassing spectacle with his defiance of U.S. law and treaty obligations in demanding that the administration have the right to torture detainees and deny them the most basic of human rights .
And the attorney general , the chief law enforcement officer of the land , has actually referred to human rights treaty obligations as " quaint . "
The President of the United States angrily told congressional leaders objecting to the renewal of the Patriot Act , assembled in the Oval Office , not to " throw the constitution in my face !
It 's just a goddamned piece of paper ! "
He probably does n't even remember , or more likely , considers unimportant , the fact that , twice , he has sworn an oath to uphold and protect that " goddamned piece of paper . "
The levels of official corruption are now totally without precedent in American history and are truly scandalous to those of us in the rest of the world .
The Vice President of the United States is openly funneling no -bid contracts worth millions , even billions of dollars , to a corporation he once headed , which , while he is still in office , continues to pay him a salary - and no one seems to mind or even think that is problematic .
When the issue is rarely raised , he is openly , even arrogantly defiant about it .
Members of congress dine in the finest restaurants and even vacation in upscale resorts , and then openly , without a word , hands the bills to lobbyists , who pay them without complaint - which they obviously would not do if they were not getting their expected quid pro quos , not uncommonly the passage of legislation actually written by the lobbyists ' clients themselves .
So many Republicans in Kentucky state government have been implicated in a job - peddling scandal in that state , that the Republican party actually had problems finding enough qualified but untainted people among its ranks to staff state government .
A corrupt - influence scandal in Ohio is of similar proportions .
One Ohio congressman is embroiled in three scandals at once - and not only remains in office , but runs for re-election .
Qualifications for office were never a problem for this current president who simply - and quite openly , even arrogantly - staffs government with totally unqualified cronies , as a quid pro quo for campaign contributions , or as a simple reward for friendship and loyalty .
And the Jack Abramoff scandal threatens a higher percentage of the members of Congress than did the Credit Mobilier scandal a century and a half ago - mostly because it is symptomatic of a system deliberately created by the party in power ( the infamous " K - Street Project " ) which was actually designed to peddle influence quite openly .
But what is really scary about this scandal and others related to it , is that no one seems much bothered by it or be concerned for its implications .
Those involved mostly view their crimes as that of simply getting caught .
But by far the most disturbing evidence of the corrosion of the American polity and its rapid degradation into a totalitarian dictatorship that has been noticable to me in the years I have been out of the country , is just how eager are the American people to be obediently subservient to a regime that clearly , even defiantly , exhibits serious totalitarian tendencies in its contempt for even the most basic of human rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights and treaties to which the nation is signatory , and its rapid consolidation of power into an authoritarian one - party state , arrogantly , even defiantly , holding itself above the law and the constitution .
Not only was the NSA warrantless spying scandal met with arrogant defiance , but America thoroughly disgraced itself when attempts to outlaw torture were openly , vigorously and defiantly opposed by the administration .
And now we learn that one of the latest of the Vice President 's open - ended contracts to Halliburton is actually for the construction of concentration camps in the United States , to hold as many as five million people ( large PDF document , 1.2 mb. ) , a project ominously called " endgame " by its creators , and the United States Army has been tasked with organizing and enforcing slave labor ( PDF document , 775 kb ) in those camps - and again , no one notices or cares , or thinks to question why a legitimate government honoring basic human rights would need concentration camp space for five million people - nearly twice as many as are currently housed in all the detention centers , jails and prisons of America , put together , or what business does the military have in running forced labor operations in civilian prison camps .
The congress and the courts just happily go along with it , as if it were business as usual .
The press , pursuing its own interests as allies of the nascent dictatorship , never questions it .
The people slumber on , even as new forced - labor concentration camps are being readied for one out of every sixty of them .
All this reminds me of the words of the Roman emperor Tiberius .
When he became the emperor , the Roman senate sent him a note , informing him that whatever legislation he wanted , would be quickly passed by them .
He responded that this was outrageous .
" Suppose the emperor is ill or mad or incompetent ? " he asked , returning their message to them .
When they sent it again , he responded , " How eager you are to be slaves ! "
How eager indeed .

The Twilight of American Culture by Morris Berman .
In this volume , written in 2000 , Berman makes some prescient predictions about the direction of American culture and civilization , and why it is going to lead to the fall of the American Empire .
The book is a short but alarming read .
He even begins by telling you right up front that you should not expect to be entertained - but rather frightened .

A followup to the above book , Berman analyzes at length the trends he talked about in his preceeding volume ( above ) and what this means for the fate of western civilization , but more importantly , where the trends he predicted have gone , and why the situation is even worse than he had originally thought .
Highly recommended .

PEP 3106 -- Revamping dict.keys ( ) , .values ( ) and .items ( )
PEP : 3106 Title : Revamping dict.keys ( ) , .values ( ) and .items ( )
Author : Guido van Rossum Status : Final Type : Standards Track Created : 19 - Dec - 2006
Post - History :
Abstract This PEP proposes to change the .keys ( ) , .values ( ) and .items ( ) methods of the built - in dict type to return a set - like or unordered container object whose contents are derived from the underlying dictionary rather than a list which is a copy of the keys , etc. ; and to remove the .iterkeys ( ) , .itervalues ( ) and .iteritems ( ) methods .
The approach is inspired by that taken in the Java Collections Framework .
Introduction
It has long been the plan to change the .keys ( ) , .values ( ) and .items ( ) methods of the built - in dict type to return a more lightweight object than a list , and to get rid of .iterkeys ( ) , .itervalues ( ) and .iteritems ( ) .
The idea is that code that currently ( in 2.x ) reads : for k , v in d.iteritems ( ) : ... should be rewritten as : for k , v in d.items ( ) : ... ( and similar for .itervalues ( ) and .iterkeys ( ) , except the latter is redundant since we can write that loop as for k in d . )
Code that currently reads : a = d.keys ( ) # assume we really want a list here ( etc. ) should be rewritten as a = list ( d.keys ( ) )
There are ( at least ) two ways to accomplish this .
The original plan was to simply let .keys ( ) , .values ( ) and .items ( ) return an iterator , i.e. exactly what iterkeys ( ) , itervalues ( ) and iteritems ( ) return in Python 2.x .
However , the Java Collections Framework suggests that a better solution is possible : the methods return objects with set behavior ( for .keys ( ) and .items ( ) ) or multiset ( == bag ) behavior ( for .values ( ) ) that do not contain copies of the keys , values or items , but rather reference the underlying dict and pull their values out of the dict as needed .
The advantage of this approach is that one can still write code like this : a = d.items ( ) for k , v in a : ... #
And later , again : for k , v in a : ... Effectively , iter ( d.keys ( ) ) ( etc. ) in Python 3.0 will do what d.iterkeys ( ) ( etc. ) does in Python 2.x ; but in most contexts we do n't have to write the iter ( ) call because it is implied by a for - loop .
The objects returned by the .keys ( ) and .items ( ) methods behave like sets .
The object returned by the values ( ) method behaves like a much simpler unordered collection -- it can not be a set because duplicate values are possible .
Because of the set behavior , it will be possible to check whether two dicts have the same keys by simply testing : if a.keys ( ) == b.keys ( ) : ... and similarly for .items ( ) .
These operations are thread - safe only to the extent that using them in a thread - unsafe way may cause an exception but will not cause corruption of the internal representation .
As in Python 2.x , mutating a dict while iterating over it using an iterator has an undefined effect and will in most cases raise a RuntimeError exception .
( This is similar to the guarantees made by the Java Collections Framework . )
The objects returned by .keys ( ) and .items ( ) are fully interoperable with instances of the built - in set and frozenset types ; for example : set ( d.keys ( ) ) == d.keys ( ) is guaranteed to be True ( except when d is being modified simultaneously by another thread ) .
Specification I 'm using pseudo - code to specify the semantics : class dict : # Omitting all other dict methods for brevity .
# The .iterkeys ( ) , .itervalues ( ) and .iteritems ( ) methods # will be removed .
def keys ( self ) : return d_keys ( self ) def items ( self ) : return d_items ( self ) def values ( self ) : return d_values ( self ) class d_keys : def __init__ ( self , d ) : self .__d = d def __len__ ( self ) : return len( self.__d ) def __contains__( self , key ) : return key in self .
__d def __iter__ ( self ) : for key in self .__d : yield key #
The following operations should be implemented to be # compatible with sets ; this can be done by exploiting # the above primitive operations : # # < , <= , == , != , >= , > ( returning a bool ) # & , | , ^ , - ( returning a new , real set object ) # # as well as their method counterparts ( .union ( ) , etc. ) .
# #
To specify the semantics , we can specify x == y as : # # set ( x ) == set (y ) if both x and y are d_keys instances # set ( x ) == y if x is a d_keys instance # x == set (y ) if y is a d_keys instance # # and so on for all other operations .
class d_items : def __init__ ( self , d ) : self .__d = d def __len__ ( self ) : return len( self.__d ) def __contains__( self , ( key , value ) ) : return key in self .__d and self .__d [ key ] == value def __iter__ ( self ) : for key in self .__d : yield key , self .
__d[key ] #
As well as the set operations mentioned for d_keys above .
#
However the specifications suggested there will not work if # the values are n't hashable .
Fortunately , the operations can # still be implemented efficiently .
For example , this is how # intersection can be specified : def __and__ ( self , other ) : if isinstance ( other , ( set , frozenset , d_keys ) ) : result = set ( ) for item in other : if item in self : result.add ( item ) return result if not isinstance ( other , d_items ) : return NotImplemented d = {} if len( other ) < len( self ) : self , other = other , self for item in self : if item in other : key , value = item d[key ] = value return d.items ( ) #
And here is equality : def __eq__( self , other ) : if isinstance ( other , ( set , frozenset , d_keys ) ) : if len( self ) != len( other ) : return False for item in other : if item not in self : return False return True if not isinstance ( other , d_items ) : return NotImplemented # XXX
We could also just compare the underlying dicts ... if len( self ) != len( other ) : return False for item in self : if item not in other : return False return True def __ne__ ( self , other ) : # XXX Perhaps object.__ne__( ) should be defined this way .
result = self .__eq__( other ) if result is not NotImplemented : result = not result return result class d_values : def __init__ ( self , d ) : self .__d = d def __len__ ( self ) : return len( self.__d ) def __contains__( self , value ) : # This is slow , and it's what " x in y " uses as a fallback # if __contains__ is not defined ; but I 'd rather make it # explicit that it is supported .
for v in self : if v == value : return True return False def __iter__ ( self ) : for key in self .__d : yield self .__d[ key ] def __eq__( self , other ) : if not isinstance ( other , d_values ) : return NotImplemented if len( self ) != len( other ) : return False # XXX Sometimes this could be optimized , but these are the # semantics : we can't depend on the values to be hashable # or comparable .
olist = list ( other ) for x in self : try : olist.remove(x ) except ValueError : return False assert olist == [ ] return True def __ne__ ( self , other ) : result = self .
__eq__( other ) if result is not NotImplemented : result = not result return result Notes :
The view objects are not directly mutable , but do n't implement __hash__ ( ) ; their value can change if the underlying dict is mutated .
The only requirements on the underlying dict are that it implements __getitem__ ( ) , __contains__ ( ) , __iter__ ( ) , and __len__ ( ) .
We do n't implement .copy ( ) -- the presence of a . copy ( ) method suggests that the copy has the same type as the original , but that 's not feasible without copying the underlying dict .
If you want a copy of a specific type , like list or set , you can just pass one of the above to the list ( ) or set ( ) constructor .
The specification implies that the order in which items are returned by .keys ( ) , .values ( ) and .items ( ) is the same ( just as it was in Python 2.x ) , because the order is all derived from the dict iterator ( which is presumably arbitrary but stable as long as a dict is n't modified ) .
This can be expressed by the following invariant : list ( d.items ( ) ) == list ( zip ( d.keys ( ) , d.values ( ) ) )

Set a target of being able to WALK , ONLY , at 20 - 30 minute per mile pace , NON STOP ( NO SLEEP ) for 24 - 30 hours .
Do not exceed this pace , nor train in this way more than once a week .
A POINT OF VIEW
By Lisa Jardine
Piltdown is perhaps the most infamous scientific fraud
One of the biggest responses to my pieces I 've received so far came when I wrote about experimental science - about the way science tries to arrive at the best fit between a general principle and the experimental evidence .
A number of listeners wrote reminding me that my description of scientists as men and women of integrity , painstakingly in pursuit of truth , did not quite tell the whole story .
The pressure to be first to reach a particular scientific goal has always been intense .
The rewards in terms of personal fame and financial profit can be considerable .
Consequently , some scientists have not been above falsifying the evidence in order to claim an important scientific " breakthrough " .
There are several notorious hoaxes in the history of science .
In 1912 , at a meeting of the Geological Society in London , Charles Dawson and Arthur Smith Woodward produced fragments of the skull of so - called Piltdown Man , allegedly discovered by workmen in gravel pits in Sussex .
They proposed that Piltdown man represented an evolutionary missing link between ape and man , and that it confirmed the current cutting - edge theory that a recognisably human brain developed early on in mankind 's evolution .
Consensus tends to cohere around ' safe ' projects , pushing just a little bit further the boundaries of already well - tried methods
Over 40 years later , Piltdown Man was shown to be a composite forgery , put together out of a medieval human skull , the 500 - year - old lower jaw of an orangutan , and chimpanzee fossil teeth .
The deception went undetected for so long because it offered the experts of the day exactly what they wanted - convincing evidence that human evolution was brain - led .
Several of those who wrote to me , however , chose an example of a deception with graver consequences - that of Hwang Woo-suk , a pioneer of stem - cell research , once one of the world 's most celebrated specialists in therapeutic cloning .
Until recently he enjoyed celebrity status beyond that of any pop-star in his native South Korea - his public appearances had all the razzmatazz of Hollywood , even a postage stamp was issued in his honour .
Fabrication claim
This month , 53 - year - old Hwang has gone on trial , charged with deliberately falsifying his laboratory results and embezzling millions of pounds worth of state funding .
If found guilty , he can expect a jail term of up to 10 years .
Last summer Hwang and his team announced that they had created patient - specific stem cell - derived tissue , based on cells taken from 11 separate people .
Stem cells are cells with the ability to develop into any type of tissue - say , tissue to replace a specific damaged organ .
By inserting genetic material taken from a number of individual donors , Hwang 's lab had for the first time used stem - cells to grow tissue which would match the exact genetic make - up of each one of them .
But six months later , an academic panel found that the results used to support Hwang 's dramatic claim , published in the prestigious journal Science , had been " intentionally fabricated " .
Photographs associated with the experiments had been doctored .
Material from a single source had been adulterated so that it appeared to have come from separate donors .
Here was something more serious than experimental error .
Here was a " hoax " or " fraud " designed to take in the scientific establishment at the highest level .
Stem cells could potentially be used to repair damaged or defective tissue anywhere in the body , such as the cells in the pancreas that stop producing insulin in diabetics , or the degenerating brain - cells in diseases such as Alzheimer 's and Parkinson 's - research like Hwang 's could help millions of people worldwide .
Promising results
So the expectations on the part of doctors and patients , and the government and commercial pressures on scientists working in this field are enormous .
The pressure from the South Korean government - determined to be right at the forefront of technological and scientific innovation - for some dramatic pay - off , was extreme .
After promising initial experimental results , Hwang Woo-suk and his researchers succumbed to the temptation to fake key data to make the research outcomes appear more impressive than the results justified .
One of the questions members of the scientific community are asking , is whether Hwang 's deception could , or should , have been discovered earlier .
That question , inevitably , has been directed at Science magazine , which published the two papers announcing Hwang 's supposedly landmark findings .
Hwang Woo-suk was a hero and a celebrity in Korea
It has brought into the public domain the process of " peer review " - the method of assessment used within the academy to regulate and control research activity .
In scientific research , that process is supposed to ensure that the methodology is sound , and that interpretation of data does not lead to misleading or unreasonable claims .
As one senior scientist comments : " It is good at calming down over - optimistic claims " .
But peer review is time - consuming - it involves reading the paper , producing detailed comments , evaluating its importance , and ranking it against others in the field .
It is often inclined to err on the side of caution .
Consensus tends to cohere around " safe " projects , pushing just a little bit further the boundaries of already well - tried methods and outcomes , rather than supporting those which look more " risky " .
No wonder work in new , sensitive fields like stem - cell research is increasingly being carried out in countries like China , where there is little or no regulation .
In our world of instant communication and 24 - hour news , a deliberative process like peer review can seem frustratingly slow .
Pasteur shortcut
At the outer envelope of current laboratory research , perhaps the great leap forward might be in the direction indicated by the ambitious investigator , whose impatience to arrive first at the next great scientific milestone overcomes his or her proper experimental caution .
In 1885 , Louis Pasteur demonstrated the effectiveness of his vaccine against rabies by inoculating a boy badly bitten by a rabid dog .
It now emerges that Pasteur 's public account of that experiment was carefully drafted to obscure the fact that it violated prevailing ethical standards for the conduct of human experiments - standards that Pasteur had himself just endorsed .
Pasteur suggested that he had previously tested his vaccine on a " large number " of dogs .
In fact , his laboratory notebooks reveal the patient was treated using a method that Pasteur had only recently decided to try , and that was entirely untested on animals .
Hwang was honoured by a rather unfortunate stamp
Had the truth come out at the time , Pasteur would probably have been disgraced .
As it was , the vaccine 's success was such that no doubts were ever raised .
Pasteur was a scientific gambler , whose bet paid off .
Gamblers try to force the pace of research , wagering that the experimental results they are currently fudging will come good .
By the time the breakthrough has been properly made - a rabies vaccine , a cure for Parkinson 's disease - they hope to have successfully produced the genuine evidence , achieved properly verifiable outcomes .
On the other hand , the scientific community pursues a policy of systematic self - regulating - making sure that the procedures followed are sound , and the data have not been exaggerated or manipulated .
False claims , strenuously checked and tested , will eventually fail and be rejected .
Sooner or later , Hwang 's bogus stem - cell results would have come to light , when they could not be replicated .
But financial incentives in the form of massive amounts of government funding are another matter .
Political pressure from governments , pouring money directly into work in research areas they have set their hearts on leading , surely does have the capacity to distort even the best - established procedures .
What we must be watchful for are situations were the funding of science demands a rate of return on research investment that increases intolerably the temptation to gamble .
Might the blame for Hwang 's deception lie , ultimately , at the feet of those who financed him so lavishly , and the state machine that over - inflated his reputation ?
It 's important to realise that although fraud does occasionally occur , scientific practise is generally good , and this should n't give ammunition to those who do n't trust its findings .
The key point here is that the frauds were discovered , and only gave short - lived benefits to the perpetrators .
A key factor in science is reproducability , and particularly in important work like stem cell research this should ensure that fraudsters are discovered fairly quickly .

Scientists tell the truth , politicians are interested in our wellbeing , global warming is proved , evolution is proven , I 'm a dalek .
There 's only one of the above statements with any credence - and that 's because scientists have n't met me !
Dominic , Teddington , UK
Bjorn Lomborg , author of the " Skeptical Environmentalist " , shows very clearly how funds follow fashion , and researchers whose work exaggerates the latest scare ( Global Warming , SARS , Avian Flu etc ) get more funding than those who put things in proper proportion .... no surprises where the incentives for career development are , then !
Ian , Harpenden
An excellent article but it neglects to look further at the problem with ' anonymous peer review . '
It is a running joke in academia .
Once you have been an academic in a very narrow field ( like stem cell research ) for a long time you KNOW whose work you 're peer reviewing and the writer may well be able to work out who the reviewer is , because a journal only has a few .
If the person 's a friend , academics are far more trusting and less critical .
That may well be why Hwang 's fraud could be published in an eminent journal .
In a lesser journal where the reviewer was an obscure junior lecturer the fraud may actually have been picked up on !
Dr. Ed , Oulu , Finland
As a scientist I agree that we are loosing sight of the truth in science for the reasons described above .
Recognition through press coverage comes only if the science is of interest to the general public .
The science sells better if it is alarmist or with an over inflated sense of its own self importance .
I have myself seen that press attention is only drawn if either the science is trivialized to the point of absurdity or over - egged on its importance to the point that it threatens either all of mankind or life as we know it ( depending on which particular episode of horizon you are watching ) .
Making your own research a matter of life and death gains funding .
It is because of this that the so called evidence for global warming must be scrutinized in a harsher light .
The standard of evidence needed to commit a man to jail for murder needs to be stronger due the severity of the sentence than the standard of evidence needed to try a man for a lesser crime .
The same applies here .!
Dave , Leicester
Unfortunately this does reflect the way that the majority of science proceeds .
Many papers get through peer review by simply adding citations of the reviewer 's papers - as suggested by the reviewer !
Citations are gold dust and a reviewer can be easily placated with a couple .
This is encouraged by the performance - review , publish - or - perish culture being forced on scientists by department heads .
In addition , I know many fellow scientists who have submitted abstracts for conferences without having actually done ( or finished ) the experiment related in said abstract .
They are gambling on the outcome supporting their predictions .
Unfortunately , the pressure to register early for a conference ( by offering much lower rates ) only encourages this behaviour .
Sven , Montreal , Canada
There is certainly a need to produce good results , but most scientists are well reasoned and would never defraud .
Hwang 's is an unfortunate case of a dishonest person making it into the public eye .
Can you write some stories about the good things scientific research has brought the world ?
Steve Matthews , Bristol , UK
" Might the blame for Hwang 's deception lie , ultimately , at the feet of those who financed him so lavishly , and the state machine that over - inflated his reputation ? "
Possibly however my main concern would be the ideas that might never come to light when scientists are over cautious due to worrying about the reception suvh ideas my get from their peers .

I work in a lab that competes for funding in the UK and i must say that its hard to continue doing work when the director spends all his time showing propestive funders , or current funders , around the lab .
Maybe the people who fund this should stop checking up , read the reports and papers , and let us get back to working .

A lot of research in this country is finance - led , with little interest in pure research .
Who will risk their funding by telling , say , their oil company sponsor that cars run great on chip-oil and petrochemical products are pointless ?
Peer review is of limited use , i think .
Who will send their papers to a peer who might perform a hatchet job to discredit a rival ?
I worked for a professor who only ever submitted work for peer review amongst a cosy set of supportive cohorts .

Some scientists will falsify their results .
Some doctors will murder their patients .
Some bankers will embezzle funds .
Some teachers will mistreat their pupils .
Some financiers will commit fraud .
Some journalists will misrepresent the " facts " .
All professions have members whose integrity is suspect ; the majority are reliable and trustworthy .
Spanne , Cambridge UK
As long as science remains funded in part by bodies that ultimately require the generation of revenue streams there will always be pressure and a temptation to overstate or even falsify results .
Research , including a large part of the pharmaceutical research must go back to being an adjunct to academia , where the principle reward is the pursuit and discovery of new knowledge .
The funding body ( government ) will ultimately get a return on successful discoveries through production licensing etc but this should not be the principle driving force .
Ross , Dover
In all branches of scientific research funding is a scarce commodity , with lots of groups fighting for the same funding contract .
All it takes if for one person to say they have had a ' breakthrough ' and the money is instantly theirs .
It 's no wonder scientists take a gamble .

About Us
The initiator of the creation of the FTAA was the US president , Bill Clinton , who presented his project in 1988 .
Six years later , the idea has been clarified .
According to the plans of the founders of the Free Trade Area of the Americas was to begin its work aat the end of 2005 .
These plans failed due to the strong opposition of the countries of South America , as well as the opposition of some conservative groups in the United States .
Some provisions of the agreement are already being implemented , but others are still being negotiated .
Full agreement would create the world 's largest free trade area covering 34 countries and more than 800 million people , with an economic turnover exceeding 13 trillion dollars .
For the United States , the agreement is designed to enable economic development and ensure political stability in the region .
Free Trade Area of the Americas is also a response to integration endeavors perceived in other parts of the world .
EINDHOVEN , Netherlands ( Reuters ) - A Dutch company has squeezed a display the size of two business cards into a gadget no bigger than other mobile phones -- by making a screen that folds up when not in use .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
The 5 - inch ( 13 - cm ) display of Polymer Vision ’s “ Readius ” is the world ’s first that folds out when the user wants to read news , blogs or email and folds back together so that the device can fit into a pocket .
Polymer Vision , spun out of Philips PHG .AS , whetted the appetite of gadget fans more than two years ago when it showed off a prototype .
Now the gadget is in production and will go head - to - head with Apple 's AAPL.O iPhone and Amazon 's AMZN.
O ebook reader Kindle when it hits stores mid-2008 .
“ You get the large display of e-reading , the super battery life of e-reading , and the high - end connectivity ... and the form factor and weight of a mobile phone , ” said Karl McGoldrick , chief executive of the venture capital - funded firm , in which Philips still has a 25 percent stake .
“ We are taking e-reading and bringing it to the mobile phone . ”
He would not say how much the Readius would cost , but said it would be comparable to a high - end mobile phone .
McGoldrick said his “ dream device ” , which the company planned to build within 5 years , was a mobile phone with an 8 - inch color display that could show video .
Like Amazon ’s Kindle , the Readius has a so - called electronic paper screen , which displays black - and - white text and images that look almost like they have been printed on paper .
The device -- which will also just make phone calls -- connects to the Internet using the third - generation mobile phone networks with high data speeds .
The company said it was talking to retailers as well as mobile operators to sell the device .
Like Apple ’s iPhone , the gadget offers the chance for operators to boost data usage , which is more profitable than voice revenues .
Users will be able to set up their email accounts , news sources , podcasts , audio books and blog feeds at home on their computer , and the data is then pushed to the device whenever it is updated .
McGoldrick said the company opted to use this approach -- which rules out quickly browsing the Web on the go -- because it was simpler in a mobile environment .
“ I see these devices with 50 buttons on them .
We have eight , ” he said , adding that the company plans to add a keypad to future models .
Japan 's grim reputation as one of the world 's suicide nations has been confirmed by statistics that show more than 30,000 people a year have taken their own lives since figures first began to rise in 1998 .
In 2006 , there were 32,115 suicides - 25 per 100,000 people ; nearly 100 people a day ; one every 15 minutes .
The most common hour of death is 5 am for men and noon for women , after their families have left for work or school .
Japan has roughly half the population of the US , yet the same number of suicides .
There were 5,554 suicides of people aged 15 and over in the UK in 2006 ; three quarters involved men .
Experts in Japan were puzzled when the suicide rate jumped in 1998 from 24,391 to 32,863 - a 35 per cent rise - and the annual figure has continued to stay above 30,000 .
Two theories have been put forward by the media : bullying at school and netto shinju - online suicide pacts .
The world 's first internet suicide pact involving strangers took place in Japan in 2003 .
The bodies of three young people were discovered in a van on a mountain road .
The windows were sealed with black duct tape and a burnt - out charcoal stove was found inside .
Police across Japan began to make similar discoveries : three or four bodies , victims usually in their late teens to mid-twenties , and often a burnt - out charcoal stove .
Last year the National Police saved 72 potential suicides who had made postings on the net .
But Yukio Saito , the director of a 24 - hour suicide helpline , said that until recently Japan has done nothing to stop tens of thousands of others taking their lives .
The helpline takes an estimated 720,000 calls a year at its 49 centres .

Emergency hotlines and counselling are available to students
The shooting took place at Northern Illinois University , in De Kalb , 65 miles ( 100 km ) west of Chicago .
Students ran for cover as a white male armed with two handguns and a shotgun opened fire during a science lecture .
He then turned the gun on himself .
Another 15 people were injured in the attack .
Police said there was no apparent motive .
I kept thinking : ' Oh God , he 's going to shoot me .
Oh God , I 'm dead .
I 'm dead .

Five of the victims , four women and a man , were killed in a " brief , rapid - fire assault " , university president John Peters said .
A sixth student died later in hospital , the local coroner 's office said .
The university said that the gunman was a former graduate student in sociology , but was not currently enrolled .
Earlier reports said 17 victims had been transported to Kishwaukee Community Hospital .
Police say there is no apparent motive for the attack
It is also the fourth shooting at a US education establishment within a week .
Last Friday , a woman shot dead two fellow students before killing herself at Louisiana Technical College in Baton Rouge .
In Memphis , Tennessee , a 17 - year - old is accused of shooting and critically wounding a student on Monday , and a 15 - year - old was shot at a junior high school in California on Tuesday .
' A lot of blood '
Students described a panicked rush from the lecture theatre as the black - clad gunman walked onto the stage and opened fire .
" I kept thinking , ' Oh God , he 's going to shoot me .
Oh God , I 'm dead .
I 'm dead .
I 'm dead ' , " Desiree Smith , a student who dropped to the floor near the back of the auditorium , told AP news agency .
A student named Sheila told local radio station WBBM the gunman was quiet as he turned his weapons on the students .
" He just stood on the stage in front of everybody and just started shooting , " she said .
" I saw a lot of blood .
I have blood all over my clothes . "
George Gaynor , a senior geography student , told the student newspaper that the gunman was " a skinny white guy with a stocking cap on " .
He described the scene immediately following the incident as terrifying and chaotic .
" Some girl got hit in the eye , a guy got hit in the leg , " he said .
Emergency workers were at the scene within minutes
Students warned each other by mobile phone within minutes of the shootings , and the university 's website issued alerts , warning of the possibility of a gunman on campus .
" Get to a safe area and take precautions until given the all clear , " it warned students .
The site then carried updates confirming the shooting and telling students to stay away or stay in doors .
It then said the gunman was " no longer a threat " .
Emergency hotlines and counselling are being offered for students and parents .
Mr Peters urged students to remain calm and support each other .
" We 've asked them to reach out to each other during this difficult time , and they 've done that , and I 'm proud of them , " he said .

Hope no one has lost their life .
I have visited that campus a few times - my previous father - in - law did a history degree there , and I spent some time there looking at doing a post - doc there .
It 's a very quiet campus - many students go home to Chicago at weekends , so it can be pretty dead there .

WHO owns a bright idea ?
If the technology associated with an idea is new and the opportunities it offers are valuable , it will have many authors — most of whom may argue over ownership .
When disputes over the provenance of an idea become particularly turbid , disappointed entrepreneurs will look to the courts , which often are of little help .
As Lawrence Lessig , a professor at Stanford Law School , said , “ The general rule is that ideas are free unless strapped down by contract or patent . ”
In practice , a great idea is owned by whoever expresses that idea most successfully .
Consider the case of Mark Zuckerberg , founder and chief executive of Facebook , the fast - growing social networking Web site , who is being sued by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss , twin brothers who were founders of ConnectU , another social network .
Today , Facebook enjoys much of the glamour that Google had when it was new .
As of July , more than 30 million people , mostly young and college - educated , had registered on the site , according to the company .
Facebook ’s users share information about themselves with friends , send private messages to one another and hang out in groups formed around different interests and hobbies , where they can swap Web links and files like photographs and videos .
Using this tutorial you should be able to learn how to solve a Rubik 's cube in as little as one day !
This is for the standard 3x3 Rubik 's cube .
Shorthand Abbreviations
In order to tell you how to manipulate your cube , some language needs to be established in order to guide you in the right direction .
F = Front
B = Back
L = Left
R = Right
U = Up
D = Down
Figure 1
When you see these letters in a series , it means you 're going to rotate that face of the cube clockwise , as if you were looking at that face .
The times this is most often confused is when using the L face and D face .
It takes some getting used to in order to visualize which way is clockwise , but it gets easy with practice .
The only other shorthand you will see me use is the small letter " I " .
This indicates counterclockwise spinning of the face .
The same rule applies as before , it 's counterclockwise as if you were looking at that face .
The shorthand looks like Fi , Bi , Li , Ri , Ui , and Di .
Also note that " 2 " can be placed in front of any of these to indicate that you do it " twice " or 180 degrees .
Also , now would be a good time to mention that these indicate the front / back / sides / etc depending on how you 're holding it at the time .
The " front " face does n't always have to be a certain color .
It 's all relative to how you 're holding it for that particular move .
Before we move into some of the beginner 's algorithms used , there is one main concept I want to show you .
The " middle " pieces , or the pieces that never touch an edge , are permanently in place .
They will never change position in relation to each other .
This is absolutely the most important thing to keep in mind .
That means that we will be moving the edge and corner piece around the middle pieces because the middle pieces will never actually move .
To demonstrate this , there is a picture of a Rubik 's cube disassembled .
In addition to the middle pieces , there are two other types : edge , and corner pieces .
Edge pieces have 2 colored stickers on them , and corner pieces have 3 .
Note that no matter how much you move these around , if an edge piece has a blue and orange sticker on it , it will always be the blue and orange edge piece .
That means each of the 26 pieces only has one correct place , so solving " one side " is pointless unless you have the edge pieces in the correct place .
More on this later .
Figure 2
So now onto algorithms .
The 3x3 Rubik 's cube can be solved in 7 simple steps , every time .
You can learn to follow these algorithms in a day , and memorize them with a 2nd day 's worth of practice .
What I 'm teaching you is the easiest way to remember , not the fastest .
There are a few additional algorithms that can help get your time below 2 minutes with minimal effort .
I may add these at a later date , but for now I 'm just supplying you with the easiest to follow and understand .
Step 1 - The Cross
Remember how I said the middle pieces never move in relation to each other , and edge pieces only have on correct place ?
Here 's where you can start applying that knowledge .
The ultimate goal of this first step is to create a cross ( in this case , the white side ) with the edge pieces having the matching color of the adjacent side 's center piece .
There really are n't any algorithms that can be used to simply solve this step , so it 's mostly intuitive .
I will , however , provide one algorithm that should at least help you .
Here is the ultimate goal of the first step :
Figure 3 Figure 3
Now let 's say you end up with something like this following picture .
You have two edge pieces in the right plane , but they need to be swapped .
The easiest way to move these edge pieces is to rotate them into the bottom plane , twist the bottom , and rotate them back into the top plane .
The algorithm in this case is : 2R , Di , 2 F [ which will put the green / white piece into place ] D , 2R [ puts the red / white piece in correct position . ]
This is just one example , but just remember to get the white edge piece into the bottom plate , rotate the bottom place until it 's below where it needs to go , then rotate it up to where it needs to be .
It 's mostly intuitive , but this should help .
Figure 4
Step 2 - Top Corners
Once you have your cube looking like Figure 3 it's time to solve the white corners .
There are 4 corner pieces with a white sticker on them , and 2 other colors .
First find a white corner piece in the bottom layer and line it up between the two sides it 's supposed to be between [ i.e .
If it 's a white / blue / orange piece , rotate the bottom layer until it 's between the blue and orange sides . ] and this algorithm will flip that piece up into the spot in the top layer directly above it .
For example you start with the first one ( orange on the underside of the white corner piece ) and want to flip it up .
→
Figures 5 and 6
The algorithm used here is : Ri , Di , R , D ( x1 , x3 , x5 )
Note that you may have to do this algorithm several times depending on the orientation of the white face on the bottom corner block .
If it 's facing down , you 'll have to do it three times , or if it 's facing the opposite direction then you will have to repeat it five times .
It may be tedious but once you learn how to move the pieces around there is an easy shortcut to learn .
This is fine for now .
Repeat on all 4 corners .
You may have a white corner " stuck " in the top layer already but in the wrong position or in the wrong orientation .
Just rotate the cub and perform this algorithm once to get it into the bottom layer and then shift the bottom layer until it 's below where it needs to be , then repeat the algorithm until it's in the right orientation .
Easy enough ?
I hope so .
Here 's how your cube should look .
Figure 7 Figure 7
Step 3 - Middle Edges
At this point in time it 's best to flip your cube 180 degrees so white is now on bottom and yellow is now on top .
Remember , the F / B/ U/D/L/R indicates the face you 're manipulation depending on how you 're holding the cube , they do n't correlate to any specific color .
Now we 'll be solving the middle edges .
This is an exciting step because your cube will start to resemble the finished solution .
The first thing you 'll want to do is get one of the edge pieces lined up with the middle piece below it , similar to how you solved the cross in step 1 .
There are two ways they can be lined up ( remember each piece only has 1 place it 's supposed to go . )
They are shown in the two figures below :
&
Figures 8 and 9 : Note these are not the same configuration
Figures 8 and 9 : Note these arethe same configuration
In both cases , the red will be considered the front face .
Case 1 ( Figure 8 ) : U , R , Ui , Ri , Ui , Fi , U , F .
Case 2 ( Figure 9 ) : Ui , Fi , U , F , U , R , Ui , Ri .
Repeat this for each corner piece .
If you have a middle edge piece stuck in the wrong place you can use this algorithm once to get it out , move it to the correct place , then repeat it to put it in it 's correct place .
Here is the result after you finish this step .
Figure 10 Figure 10
Step 4 - The Top Cross
This will be similar to step 1 , but we wo n't worry about lining up the correct edge pieces just yet , we 'll do that in the next step because it 's easiest to keep these parts separate .
As of now your top layer should resemble one of the following .
OR OR
Figures 11 , 12 , and 13 .
Note there can be other yellow squares present .
ORORFigures 11 , 12 , and 13 .
Note there can be other yellow squares present .
These are the only three possible configurations unless your cross is already solved , in which case you 're extremely lucky .
Regardless , whichever one you 're on determines how many times you repeat the following algorithm .
Figure 11 you 'll repeat it the most times ( about 3 ) and figure 13 you 'll only need to do it once .
Note that if you start at Figure 11 , you may have to reorientate your cube to make it look like one of the above figures .
So here 's the algorithm : F , R , U , Ri , Ui , Fi .
Repeat as necessary .
The following figure is an example of what your cube might look like .
The only important part is the yellow cross on top , also note that the edge and corner pieces are n't matched yet .
That is coming up next .
Figure 14 Figure 14
Step 5 - Matching the Edge Pieces of the Cross
This part should be fairly easy .
All we 're doing is matching up the yellow / anycolor edges up with the color of the center piece below , similar to how we did the first white cross ( Figure 3 ) .
Until you learn some of the shortcuts , you 'll just have to keep repeating the algorithm until you get everything lined up .
It should n't take more than 3 - 4 times .
First , line up at least one of the edge pieces with where it 's supposed to go , as illustrated .
Figure 15 Figure 15
With the blue face as your " Front " face , perform the following algorithm several times until every edge piece matches up similar to your first white cross .
Use this algorithm : R , U , Ri , U , R , 2U , Ri .
Repeat until all edge pieces match up with the center pieces below them .
The final result is pictured below :
Figure 16
Step 6 - Rotating the Corners
In this step we 're just rotating the corner pieces around so they 're at least in the correct position - we 'll change the orientation in step 7 and we 'll be done !
I 've found the easiest way to do this is make sure the corner piece in the " top right " position is in the correct place and use the algorithm from there , this ensures the fastest route possible is taken ( using this algorithm , anyway . )
If all pieces are in incorrect spots just start on any side , it does n't matter .
Here 's an example of a good place to start , using red as your " front " face , of course .
Figure 17 Figure 17
The algorithm used to switch the corner pieces is : U , R , Ui , Li , U , Ri , Ui , L .
Remember the corner pieces just have to be in the correct position , not the correct orientation .
If after the corner pieces are in their correct position , there is a slight chance that they will already be correctly oriented .
If that 's the case , you 're lucky .
If not , continue to step 7 !
Step 7 - Orientating the Last Corner Pieces
This last step is a little finicky and can take some patience / creativity to solve .
To keep things simple I 'm just going to teach one last algorithm , although there are at least 4 you can use to solve it faster depending on how your cube is set up at this point .
I 'll show you a couple different scenarios and you should be able to decide how to proceed from there .
First of all I 'll show you what exactly this algorithm does to help you figure it out with a little bit of intuitiveness ( yes , that 's a word . )
Here is the algorithm used in this step ( I know , it 's very long , but bear with me ! ) : L , U , Li , U , L , 2U , Li , Ri , Ui , R , Ui , Ri , 2U , R
Figure 18 : The best way I can describe what happens is the two corner pieces on the right face turn the upper - face of the corner " in-wards . "
Figure 18 : The best way I can describe what happens is the two corner pieces on the right face turn the upper - face of the corner " in-wards . "
Scenario 1 : There are two same - colored cubes adjacent to each other .
You can solve at least these two corner pieces in one move without messing anything else up .
Just use the algorithm once , easy as pie .
Figure 19 Figure 19
Scenario 2 : There are two opposite - colored cubes adjacent to each other .
Same deal as scenario 1 but you 'll need to perform it twice ( once to get them to the same color , once again to orient them correctly . )
Figure 20
Scenario 3 : One corner piece is solved , but there are 3 that are unsolved .
In this case you 'll have to use your best judgment using your knowledge .
If two corners have adjacent colors facing up , set up those two on the right face and use the algorithm in that orientation first .
If not , it 's super important to orient one of the outside corners first .
If you solve the corner connecting the other two you will have two non-contiguous unsolved corners , which will just take you longer to solve .
Scenario 4 : Two unsolved corners at opposite corners of the cube .
This is the biggest pain in the butt .
See if you can solve one of the cubes by picturing how it will be oriented after you use the algorithm ( refer to figure 18 . )
This will most likely take 3 tries until it 's solved .
So after you finish this step you should be done !
This is the first version if this tutorial .
There are likely typos which are n't a huge deal , but if you keep trying and trying and this guide is n't helping you solve your Rubik 's cube , there may be a typo in one of the algorithms .
If this is the case , please do n't hesitate to e-mail and I 'll see if I can fix it .

Seizures are caused by bursts of electrical activity
People who have more than one gene defect might be expected to be more prone to illness - but experts found the reverse .
The Baylor College of Medicine team , which carried out its research on mice , reported its findings in the Nature Neuroscience journal .
More than 450,000 people in the UK suffer from some form of epilepsy .
In the genetics of the brain , two wrongs can make a right
Dr Jeffrey Noebels
Baylor College of Medicine
There are many different types of epilepsy and the degrees of severity vary widely from patient to patient .
Scientists have long suspected that some cases are partly due to a genetic problem and are searching for the particular genes involved so that new treatments can be devised .
The two defects highlighted by this research involve the Kcna1 gene , which is involved in the transport of the chemical potassium in and out of the body 's cells , and the Cacna 1a gene , which plays a role in calcium levels .
The first of these has been linked to severe seizures in " temporal lobe " epilepsy , which affects the part of the brain involved in speech , sight , sound and memory .
Mice with defective Kcna1 genes can die suddenly as a result .
The second gene is linked to so - called " absence " epilepsy , in which patients do not jerk or move in the way most people associate with an epileptic fit but stare into space instead .
' Circuit breaker '
When mice were bred with both gene defects , far from worsening their symptoms , they suffered dramatically reduced seizures and did not die suddenly .
The researchers , led by Dr Jeffrey Noebels , said that this could help point towards new ways of treating certain types of epilepsy .
He suggested that one defect could be acting as a " circuit breaker " , halting the chain reaction of misplaced electrical signals which can cause a seizure .
" In the genetics of the brain , two wrongs can make a right , " he said .
" If you have a potassium channel defect , then a drug blocking certain calcium channels might also benefit you . "
Professor Sanjay Sisodiya , from the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery , said that this was the first instance he could think of in which two gene defects in epilepsy combined to reduce symptoms .
He said : " It 's quite exciting research - although it demonstrates just how complex the genetics of epilepsy are .
" Hopefully it will all start to come together at some point soon . "
A spokesman for the charity Epilepsy Action said : " Any research which could possibly eventually lead to new treatments is exciting and we welcome it . "
Botanists are marveling at the discovery of a towering palm tree on Madagascar that essentially flowers itself to death .
The palm has a huge trunk that reaches a whopping 59 feet ( 18 meters ) in height and is topped by fan leaves 16 feet ( 5 meters ) in diameter .
The tree is the most massive palm ever found on the richly diverse island and one of the largest known flowering plants — the trees can even be spotted on Google Earth .
Hundreds of tiny flowers that burst from the treetop are pollinated by insects and birds and develop into fruit .
As soon as the tree fruits , its nutrient reserves are depleted and the entire tree topples and dies .
The tree was discovered recently by a French plantation owner on a walk with his family , who took pictures that became circulated to amazed botanists at Kew Gardens in London .
The experts had never seen anything like it .
DNA analysis of the palms showed that they were not only a new species , but a new genus of palm .
Only three other genera are known in the next closest - related group of palms , which are scattered across Arabia , Thailand and China .
This evolutionary lineage has never before been seen in Madagascar " It is very difficult with current knowledge to explain how it could ever have reached Madagascar , " said Kew research fellow John Dransfield .
Dransfield and his colleagues , whose study of the palm is detailed in the Jan. 17 issue of the Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society , estimate that there are fewer than 100 of the newly named palms on the island .
Like many other plants and animals on Madagascar , the plants are under threat — only 18 percent of the island 's native vegetation remains intact .
Top 10 Poisonous Plants
Mystery Solved : How Plants Know When to Flower
Do Plants Have Sex ?
In the mid 1980 's after legal bars in the East Village had closed at four thirty in the morning , I would frequently head out to the after hours clubs .
The East Village at that time was a pretty lawless place , and there were absolutely no shortage of illegal bars where you could drink , drug or dance until the sun rose high in the sky the next morning .
Efficient markets favour the adept provider of services , and some of these places like " Little Lil's " were sexually oriented , so if you 'd struck out with the ladies that night you could have a few drinks and knock boots with a young working girl before heading home for the night .
In my quest for experiences I hit every sleazy after hours bar that was operating in Lower Manhattan at that time and I generally had a ball .
Sometimes I think of those days as an almost perfect exercise in American style capitalistic freedom , considering what has happened to New York City since I 've left .
Even though I should have known better , there was no after hours bar that I liked better than The Sin Club , which was on East Third Street just off Avenue C .
The Sin Club had a very heavy drug scene going but I was n’t into the drugs .
It was more the anticipation ; the sense that pretty much anything could happen there that attracted me .
The very air in that place was dense with the possibility for something happening , something extreme .
Back in those days Sunday night was the best evening to go out in the East Village .
All the folks with regular Monday through Friday jobs did most of their drinking and carousing Fridays and Saturdays , and the people that worked the bars got their first chance of the week to have fun on Sunday nights .
Needless to say , Sunday nights were wild .
They were determined to have a grand old time of it , and tried to stretch out their evening as much as possible .
Hence the demand for places to drink all night long .
As Monday morning approached the scene at The Sin Club just got crazier and crazier .
There were genuinely certifiable nuts hanging out there on a Monday morning , myself included .
But the very air of possibility that attracted me to The Sin Club allowed something to happen , something that was even some twenty years later I still think was royally fucked up , and that event was the reason I stopped hanging out there .
My last night at The Sin Club started out much like any other : gal - pal and I had been out at The Aztec Lounge , CBGB 's and Pyramid for booze , bands and dancing in that order .
I briefly headed home to drop off the babe ( she had to work the next day ) , and then set out for the after hours clubs .
I knew where I was going , and arrived at The Sin Club at about 5 AM .
The door guys knew me since I 'd been going there for maybe four years , so I did n't get too much hassle and quickly found my way to the back room .
Like always the sound was driven and intense and harshly cool ; " Three Dog Night " was playing and I still remember the lyrics to the tune " Want some whiskey in your water / Sugar in your tea /
What are all these crazy questions they be asking me ? /
This is the craziest party there could ever be /
Do n't turn on the lights ' cause I do n't want to see ... "
The owner , Wild , had a shrewd business sense , running a dance floor in the back room and dealing drugs to the patrons who were thus inclined .
Wild did n’t care what drugs you did as long as you bought your stuff from him .
Like I said , he was a shrewd businessman .
I was hanging out with a group of folks from the neighbourhood , talking with this winsome blonde that had showed a few times at my gallery .
We were getting on pretty well when this little tussle breaks out on the dance floor .
A skinny hippy type dude with long dark hair was getting all hands on with some babe who was clearly having no part of it .
They were maybe four feet away and even though I could n't hear the words their body language spoke volumes ; he wanted her to leave and she wanted absolutely nothing to fucking do with him .
She pushed him away with a loud " FUCK OFF ! " when he whips out this HUGE FUCKING MACHETE and brushes it harshly against her left cheek .
The girl – naturally – fucking freaked out , and raised her left arm to ward off his next blow .
He solidly chopped into her forearm all the while screaming obscenities .
The girl falls to the ground screaming , and he 's ranting and raving all the while .
I could n't understand a fucking word he was saying .
People around us are fucking freaking out , and the DJ notices .
He drops the music , as the house lights flare up and this babe sitting across the table across from me springs up from her seat and applies her scarf as a crude tourniquet to the girls arm .
I did the same with my leather jacket to her cheek , trying to calm her down and all the while that idiot is still ranting and raving but we both keep the pressure on the wounds as the crowd spreads out .
There was a shitload of blood on the floor and us , and while it was still spurting from the girls wounds it seemed to be slowing down .
I look up and see the asshole with the machete who looks like he 's getting ready to chop into the back of the gal who was tending to the babes arm wound .
You know I must have looked at that jerk with the machete for just one second , but that was the longest second in my life .
I tried to warn the crouching girl opposite me , but all that came out was a guttural croak .
And then behind him I see Wild with a shotgun in one arm , rushing towards us and shoving the crowd out of his way with his other arm .
He gets right behind the fuck , puts the shotgun behind his head and screamed out in this authoritative voice " THAT'S A SHOTGUN BEHIND YOUR EAR MOTHERFUCKER !! "
The guy turns , laughs then raises his arm to take a swing at Wild with the machete .
Wild never hesitated , pulling the trigger on the shotgun with it positioned roughly under the guys chin and maybe one foot away .
When I was a kid growing up in the country I messed around with shotguns a fair amount , and I can tell you that they are fearsome weapons .
If you 've loaded them with the right type of ammo , they 'll bring down a deer with just one shot ; incredibly powerful guns , and not to be underestimated or trifled with .
The guy 's head just evaporated – one second it was there and then it was gone .
His body jerked and twitched for maybe two seconds before it fell in a crumpled heap to the ground .
It was like something out of a George Romero horror film but I can tell you that this is the way it really happens .
Death is not clean and immediate like most family oriented movies would have you believe .
After the body hit the ground the legs kept twitching .
There was hair and shit and blood all over us and on the wall behind us .
It was the most bizarre and disgusting thing I 'd ever witnessed and I was absolutely frozen .
Needless to say , people were in an outright panic , crying and screaming and generally freaking out , like most folks will do in these harsh situations .
And I 'll be damned if maybe one minute later a couple of Wild 's guys do n't show up with a fucking body bag .
Like they 'd done this before and come to think about it , maybe they had .
I mean , what kind of bar keeps body bags in the back room ?
And where do you get them from ?
I do n't believe for one second that your beer distributor will supply body bags if you asked them .
Still crouched down and applying pressure to the injured girl 's cheek , I was frozen while they zipped the messy son of a bitch up in the bag .
And then I had this brief second of clarity , where I thought to myself " You know , it may not be in my best interests to be spending so much time with these folks " .
Wild took me to the bathroom and helped me get cleaned up , a job that took about thirty minutes since I was fucking caked in blood and even had some hair on me .
When I came out the place was pretty much empty and the injured girl was gone .
Wild and I had known each other for perhaps four years , and he knew I was tight so there were no warnings from him , just a " Ahm not gonna open for while now mon " as he walked me to the door .
I told him I understood , to stay safe and I stepped outside into the bright morning sun .
It was about seven AM when I left the Sin Club for the last time .
I lived south of Houston Street , and as I headed home to my cat and my sleeping girlfriend I found myself humming the tune " Mama told me not to come .
She said ' That ai n't the way to have fun son , that ai n't the way to have fun , NO UH UHH ' " .
Over and over and over again .
“ His career has been accompanied by scandals , ” went a typical report on the popular Channel One right before the December elections .
“ It was the elderly who were the first to feel the results of the work of Nemtsov ’s government on their purses .
Pensions dropped to the lowest level in all Russia ’s history .
Boris Nemtsov used to gather the press just to say that he did not care who the pensioners , deprived of money , would vote for .
According to the plans of young reformers , only the strongest were supposed to live until the next century . ”
Meanwhile , a different kind of propaganda war was being waged on the streets .
Russia has relatively conservative attitudes toward homosexuality , and all autumn long Nizhny Novgorod was blanketed with tens of thousands of leaflets saying that Mr. Nemtsov ’s liberal , pro-Western opposition party , the Union of Right Forces , ardently favored gay rights and employed canvassers with AIDS .
Neither was true .
The leaflets often included the name and phone number of a leader of the party ’s regional candidate slate , Andrei Osipenko .
Some had condoms attached and announced offers to send supporters to a gay - pride event in Amsterdam .
Intimidation and violence came next .
Businesses cut off donations after receiving threats from government officials , said Sergei Veltishchev , an organizer for the Union of Right Forces .
Someone obtained the confidential list of party members  the party officials say they suspect that it was the security services  and hundreds of menacing phone calls were made to volunteers , saying they or their families would be hurt if they helped the party .
The party was refused advertising space on everything from billboards to newspapers to television .
When Mr. Nemtsov tried to campaign in Nizhny Novgorod in the fall , no one would rent him a hall .
In November , the party headquarters were ransacked and spray - painted with profanities and graffiti that called it the “ Party of Gays . ”
A few weeks before the elections , Mr. Osipenko gave up , renouncing his party at a news conference that was heavily covered on state - controlled television and had the feel of the Stalinist - era public confessions that followed show trials .
Other party officials did the same .

Images of riots and runs on banks in Argentina greeted our New Year .
For Americans , it 's just another disaster in some distant country .
It 's just another run -of - the - mill Latin American or Third World crisis .
Nothing new , they have them all the time !
Since 1993 , beginning with China 's competitive currency devaluation , the devaluation disease has devastated country after country .
Since 1997 , the pace has quickened .
Now , the second largest economy in South America is in default , and Japan the second largest economy in the world is in collapse .
Japan is finally confronting a banking system with a negative net worth of US $ 1 trillion .
Total world indebtedness , having exploded since the collapse of the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1971 when America defaulted on its Dollar obligations , is now confronted by a global synchronized recession .
At the root of these seemingly disparate and unrelated events is a common cause , the world 's failing monetary system .
The world of competitive currency devaluations roams the financial world preying on the savers and producers .
Because America is allowed a " privileged " position , we have developed a false and unearned smugness about our economy , our markets and our Dollar .
The " superior " position which coddles America is a delusion .
All political antagonisms and conflicts throughout history revolve around economic and monetary issues .
Yet , the subject of money is rarely ever discussed by the press or Wall Street , nor is it taught in our colleges and universities .
The subject of money - real money - is the most overlooked yet most important issue confronting our welfare .
Investors are obsessed with financial assets and smitten with an almost blind faith in Mr. Greenspan and the Federal Reserve .
They ignore the analysis of money , the denominator for all their financial assets .
This is a fatal flaw , since the very foundation of all their financial assets - money - is terminally ill .
The devaluation disease which has been progressively destroying the rest of the world has reached the U.S. Dollar .
The tide of monetary history has been gradually moving against the United States .
For the past century we have had our own way with money .
The chapter is now on the last page , as the United States with its " money " monopoly , has exploited its citizens as well as the world to the point of exhaustion .
The Dollar , having lost more than 98 % of its value since the Federal Reserve was created in 1913 , is running out of victims .
All the monies of the world are dying , and gold and silver , true money , are being manipulated in an attempt to maintain the illusion of worth for an increasingly worthless dollar .
It is in the interest of the Fed and Treasury to maintain the perception that you do n't need gold anymore , that money in mutual funds is safe , and that all is well .
The perception that " all is well " is all they have left .
Reality is otherwise .
The current monetary system , facing the greatest defaults since the 1930's , is bankrupt .
The coming crisis has its origin in the nature of the international monetary system .
The Dollar , as the reserve currency of the world , forces other countries to accept its paper as " payment " for their goods and services .
In fact , the system does not permit payment having substituted a debt or credit money for what was once the role of gold .
Credit money obliterates the distinction between money and credit and that is the problem .
Wealth is real .
It is not a floating abstraction .
Jacques Rueff , in The Age of Inflation , referred to this dirty little secret of " deficits without tears " as - " The Monetary Sin of the West . "
Dollar issuance has been virtually open - ended .
Every nation in the world has suffered as they have been forced to import our inflation because it is the reserve currency .
Beginning with Mexico in 1995 , then the 1997 Asian contagion , Russia in 1998 , Brazil in 1999 and now Latin America we are witnessing the spreading tremors of our global monetary system in collapse .
As , General Charles De Gaulle in 1958 noted , the U.S. Dollar enjoys an " exorbitant privilege " , which impoverishes the world .
Our monetary system is a cruel hoax .
Having exported our inflation throughout the world , global economies have literally been trapped into its import creating financial bubbles .
Japan has been our biggest victim .
Their bubble burst in 1989 .
Since then the monies of the world are spiraling downward in a race to the bottom .
A vicious circle of economic exploitation forces one neighbor to devalue then the next .
Ironically , the process has repeatedly caused a flight to the Dollar .
Wealth has been destroyed around the globe on a scale not seen since the Great Depression .
At the heart of this is a dysfunctional monetary system , addicted to debt .
These recurring monetary crises are like the Titanic 's bulkheads , once the first was breached the ultimate sinking was inevitable as the subsequent bulkheads went in rapid succession .
These monetary firestorms are challenging Keynesian monetary theory of floating currencies and competitive devaluations .
Keynes notion that deficit spending produces economic growth and wealth is crumbling with each Argentina .
The " wealth " creation of the 1990's has consisted entirely of increases in consumer and government debts .
For a time the nominal value of paper assets rises , but nothing , absolutely nothing is added to the national wealth .
The monetary meltdown occurring all around us is proof of this .
The fact is that such pseudo - wealth discourages savings and investment promoting speculation , capital consumption and destruction .
The widening economic and monetary crises reveals the global monetary system is unjust and untenable .
The resultant accumulation of paper financial assets has created the largest pool of financial " wealth " the world has ever seen .
Currently , these financial assets are valued on the assumption that these claims , mostly debt , will be honored .
Throughout history , governments have sought the " freedoms " that paper money provided them over their citizens .
Worldwide for more than thirty years , governments have been unrestrained in their abuse of the public purse .
The problem for wealth lies in the fact that the volume of these financial assets overwhelmingly exceeds our economic capacity .
This deferred hyperinflation currently lies imbedded and unspent in our financial markets .
Greenspan 's monetary policy has created multiple bubbles .
While the NASDAQ bubble clearly has burst , others such as the Dow , continue .
The biggest bubble is the U.S. Dollar .
With a recession and a war against terrorism the Federal Reserve has dropped all pretense of fighting inflation .
And the other central banks of the world are pressured to outdo themselves and the Federal Reserve , lest their currencies appreciate against the Dollar .
As " deflationary " trends have been emerging , Greenspan has been increasingly desperate to keep pumping in the credit .
Without the moral courage , Mr. Greenspan can't stop .
The inflation has to continue so that the debt pyramid does n't collapse .
The game of competitive currency devaluation has shifted into high gear .
The Dollar bubble is not like any other .
Refuge for bubbles within the context of financial markets is simply to go to cash or find another uninflated sector .
But , when money is the bubble , there is no escape within the financial system itself .
It 's tragically ironic that the majority of the world 's savings is stored in forms that rely upon the performance of government power and integrity to maintain its value .
Does it make sense to hold wealth denominated in the currency of the world 's greatest debtor ?
With the consumer ravaged by debt and negative savings , the economic and political establishment is united to discourage savings of any kind .
Our government has no genuine concern for the rational and prudent individual .
They have declared war on the saver and the creditor .
Their whole effort is to protect the wildcat financial establishment , which is dangerously leveraged with excessive debt and derivatives .
The perverted economics of Keynes to borrow and spend without regard to the levels of debt has brought us to this moment .
Savings are not created through credit and printing presses .
They occur by consuming less than what is produced .
And the first step toward saving or consumption is always production .
The American Revolution , as the Declaration of Independence declared , was fought over the natural rights of man to life , liberty and property rights .
The American Revolution began because the British government had repeatedly violated the sacredness of private property .
While on July 4th , we celebrate the spirit of independence from tyranny , pathetically few understand how our government 's current monetary system betrays our wonderful heritage and threatens to consume our wealth .
The story of money parallels the story of civilization .
The " liberal " civilization in which most people believe we are still living started slipping away in 1913 with the creation of the Federal Reserve .
It represented a definite turning point in the development of Western Civilization , which until then had been based on a respect for contracts , property rights and monetary freedom .
In 1971 we concluded what had begun in 1913 .
The last vestige of a monetary standard and sound money was discarded .
A positive fixed standard of value was replaced by an " IOU nothing . "
Government had quietly seized the ultimate power over the wealth and lives of its citizens .
As Adams and Jefferson had warned , savings and personal wealth were left exposed to a tyrannical government and their bankers .
The game has been afoot for quite a while and is finally approaching an ending .
Of course , it is not really just a game .
It is your life , your work , your savings and most of all your future .
It is a game that is played on the backs of honest productive citizens who are swindled in order to subsidize the American socialism of the corporate welfare state .
Our Founding Fathers realized that the rights to life and liberty could not be sustained without private property .
Money is necessary to convey property in an exchange economy not only in the present but more importantly into the future .
Man needs money as an economic good to store his surplus wealth .
Real money has always been property .
Trustworthy money is the most basic element of human liberty .
Monetary debasement is the prime lever of the collectivists to enslave the individual .
It is a hidden form of confiscation making a mockery of a civil society .
Isabel Patterson , in The God of the Machine , wrote : " The crucial test of private property is the attitude of government toward money .
Devaluation ( inflation ) of currency is outright expropriation . "
The state of money decides the fate of mankind because it stands at the threshold of liberty and property rights acting as " The Gate Keeper " between liberty and totalitarianism .
The debasement of our money has been the principal avenue for the advancement of socialism in the last century .
Today , the whole world is addicted to fiat money and debt .
Debt makes sense when money supply is feverishly being expanded , since future money is always going to a discount .
The system keeps the addicts coming back , while eviscerating the saver and the producer .
The biggest addict today is the United States government .
It has made promises and incurred debts so huge that they cannot be paid in terms of money with anything close to today 's purchasing power .
The word patience takes on new dimensions when applied to gold investors .
But , who would have thought that investors would be confronted by a government criminally intent upon plundering their savings .
The evidence presented by Reginald Howe in his suit* , currently before the Federal court in Boston , alleges that our government and others have been conducting a war against gold for most of the last decade .
The reason for such behavior lies in the fact that our current fraudulent monetary system is dying .
They have run out of victims .
The Dollar as the world 's reserve currency depends on the financial markets denominated in Dollars to exist without any competition .
The continued functioning of the world 's financial system requires that there is no flight to real assets .
Any sustained rise in gold , the most liquid of real assets , would threaten it .
The choices for today 's investors are not pretty .
Greenspan has left us with a financial beast that has to be fed continually lest it implodes .
Wall Street is a fools paradise .
The world seems fixated on the Fed , expecting Greenspan to clean up the mess .
He cannot , since the monetary system administered by him lies at the root of the problem .
Survival for today 's wealth is not to be found on Wall Street or in Washington - but in the history of money and political philosophy .
Historically , wars on gold have been associated with tyranny and totalitarian reaches for power .
Looking back over monetary history , one sees that gold has always been associated with economic freedom , political stability and growth while irredeemable currencies ( paper money ) with financial tyranny .
Anthony C. Sutton wrote in , The War on Gold : " When we project earlier monetary experience to modern times it should not surprise us to learn that all totalitarian societies , from John Law's France to Hitler 's Third Reich and Stalin 's Soviet empire , have conducted a war on gold . "
Indeed , the economic freedom and independence granted by gold ownership cannot be tolerated .
Today 's culture fervently pays homage to religious freedom and freedom of the press , but not monetary freedom .
The anti-gold press love to describe those who believe in gold and the discipline of sound money as bugs or religious zealots .
Presumably , one is supposed to be intimidated or ashamed .
If you want a free gold market and free banking - free of government and central bank interference - you are a fanatic .
Those knowledgeable enough to understand economic history and our enlightened heritage realize the assault upon our liberty as a result of an irredeemable currency .
No , we are not fanatics , but we are radicals for freedom and justice just as were our Founding Fathers .
A young Mr. Greenspan wrote in his 1966 essay Gold and Economic Freedom , " Gold stands in the way of this insidious process .
It stands as a protector of property rights .
If one grasps this , one has no difficulty in understanding the statist ' antagonism toward the gold standard . "
All money managers must define some sort of investment philosophy .
But today , to ignore the issue of money is putting the cart before the horse .
The nature of money must be an integral part of that philosophy .
Normally , this should not be necessary , but we do not have free markets or free banking .
Money has been politicized .
True diversification must include real assets along with the fiduciary assets .
They have always been linked , as we are about to learn .
Today investors must understand fully the nature of wealth .
For the survival of wealth goes well beyond the field of conventional money management .
Economics and investing divorced from political ethics and the theory of money are vacuous and irrelevant .
That is the message coming from these monetary firestorms , like Argentina .
Twice before in the twentieth century we have seen such speculative extremes as today .
These two previous bull markets resulted because of a credit inflation which attempted to prevent the collapse of the then current monetary system .
Each of these periods produced an unprecedented bull market in stocks .
The gold exchange standard put in place after World War I led to the 1930's depression and the Bretton Woods Agreement after World War II and Viet Nam led to Nixon dishonoring international dollar claims to gold in August , 1971 .
The unwinding of the great bull markets of the 1920's and the 1960's also destroyed the international monetary system that had given birth to them .
As this stock mania is unwinding gold will once again emerge into a multi- year bull market just as in the 1930's and 1970's .
The progressive breakdown of world currencies has throttled economies and devastated global wealth .
We need only look to the wealth destruction in Asia , Japan , Korea , Russia and Latin America to understand our future .
In the absence of sound money fiduciary assets denominated by that fiat currency are eventually devastated .
Paper money and government bonds are not wealth .
Our enemy is ignorance .
The Federal Reserve Note is an instrument of debt , not of value .
Fiduciary assets are only indirect forms of wealth .
Honest money is the necessary foundation for financial assets and their performance .
With our monetary system in collapse , financial assets will be the " killing fields " for wealth .
In order to preserve wealth today , you must be financially independent of our current monetary system .
And that means gold , which is the most liquid of all real assets .
Gold is immune to default or devaluation .
Good Luck !

The suit filed in U.S. District Court , Boston , charges conspiracy to fix prices , securities fraud and breach of fiduciary duty , as well as charging government officials with exceeding their constitutional authority to regulate commerce and the U.S. economy .

In 1999 , Michael Lorenzini , the senior photographer for the New York City Municipal Archives , was spooling through microfilm of the city 's vast Department of Bridges photography collection when he realized that many of the images shared a distinct and sophisticated aesthetic .
They also had numbers scratched into the negatives .
" It just kind of hit me : this is one guy ; this is a great photographer , " Lorenzini says .
But who was he ?
It took many months and uncounted hours of trolling through archives storerooms , the Social Security index , Census reports and city records on births , deaths and employment to find the answer : the photographer was Eugene de Salignac , a municipal worker who took 20,000 photographs of modern Manhattan in the making .
" It felt like a real discovery , " Lorenzini says .
Still , what is known about de Salignac remains limited , and there are no known photographs of him as an adult .
Born in Boston in 1861 and descended from French nobility , he married , fathered two children and , after separating from his wife in 1903 , started working for the City of New York at age 42 .
He was the official photographer for the Department of Bridges from 1906 to 1934 .
At that point , his work — including original plate - glass negatives , corresponding logbooks in his elegant script and more than 100 volumes of vintage prints — began collecting dust in various basement storerooms .
He died in 1943 , at 82 , unheralded .
But de Salignac is now having his day : the Museum of the City of New York is exhibiting his work through October 28 , and Aperture has published a related book , New York Rises : Photographs by Eugene de Salignac , with essays by Lorenzini and photography scholar Kevin Moore .
De Salignac 's time as a city worker coincided with New York 's transformation from a horse - and - buggy town into a modern - day metropolis , and his photographs of towering bridges , soaring buildings , trains , buses and boats chart the progress .
" In this remarkable repository of his work , we really see the city becoming itself , " says Thomas Mellins , curator of special exhibitions at the Museum of the City of New York .
" During this period , New York became a paradigm for 20th - century urbanism , and that has to do with monumentality , transportation systems , working out glitches , skyscrapers , with technology — all of the things that emerge in these photos . "
De Salignac 's photograph of the Staten Island ferry President Roosevelt coming into port , made in Lower Manhattan in June 1924 with a bulky wooden field camera , typifies his ability to stretch beyond straightforward documentation .
" This is not your typical municipal photograph , " says Moore .
" There 's a sense of anticipation — that perfect moment where the boat is about to dock , and a sense of energy , a flood about to be unleashed . "
Adds Lorenzini : " It shows him thinking like an artist . "
De Salignac 's pictures have been reproduced in books , newspapers , posters and films , including Ken Burns ' Brooklyn Bridge ; though largely uncredited , his work helped shape New York 's image .
" He was a great chronicler of the city , in the tradition of Jacob Riis , Lewis Hine , Stieglitz and Berenice Abbott , " says Mellins .
" The fact that he was a city employee may have made it less likely that people would think of his work in an artistic context , but these images indicate that he really takes his place in the pantheon of great photographers of New York . "
Lorenzini still is n't satisfied .
" I 'd like to know what he did for the first 40 years of his life , to see a photograph of him as a grown man , " he says .
" Where did he learn photography ?
Was he formally trained ?
Did he consider himself an artist ? "
Information about him , and prints by him , keep trickling in .
Not long ago , a woman mailed to the Municipal Archives ten photographs of New York that she 'd bought at a Texas flea market ; Lorenzini immediately recognized them as de Salignac's .
And a cache of 4,000 de Salignac prints was recently unearthed in the Battery Maritime Building in Lower Manhattan .
" There is definitely more to the story , " Lorenzini says .
Carolyn Kleiner Butler is a writer and editor in Washington , D.C .
FORT LAUDERDALE , Fla . – Albert Einstein defined insanity as doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results .
Flailing around Florida , Rudolph Giuliani is getting different results , just not the ones he wants .
Call him a lot a things – weird , imperious , self - aggrandizing – but crazy he is not , at least by Einstein ’s notion .
For 50 days , Giuliani has had the Sunshine State nearly to himself .
In advance of the presidential primary on Jan. 29 , he ’s sucked up to the Cuban vote in Miami , pandered in Cape Canaveral about the space program , tried to scare retirees over early - bird specials in South Florida .
There he is riding in a fire truck in a Miami parade , trailed by angry firefighters who blame him for multiple failures when New York was attacked .
There he is in the Panhandle , the consummate Yankees fan trying to look down - home on the Redneck Riviera .
And every night , his campaign phone bank reaches out to the diaspora of 1.5 million transplanted New Yorkers .
Start spreading the news – quick !
Yet , the more they see of him here , the more his poll numbers tank .
Even with ol ’
Fred Thompson shuffling off the stage for a life of longer naps and witless homilies to more appreciative audiences , Rudy ’s campaign is in a meltdown .
It ’s worth stepping back for a moment to recall how far and how quickly Giuliani has fallen .
For most of the summer and well into the fall , he was the Republican frontrunner .
His campaign consisted of a hagiography : the hero of 9/11 .
His fundraising was strong .
Now the campaign is all but broke and he ’s getting his clock cleaned in some states by Ron Paul – Ron Paul !
– the 97 - pound libertarian who thinks the war on terror is bogus .
What happened ?
I saw Giuliani four years ago at a rally in Henderson , Nev .
He was on fire , the Elvis of Republicans .
George W. Bush was the president who said things like , “ You ’re working hard to put food on your family . ”
By contrast , people emerged from that Giuliani speech in Nevada saying , “ I wish he were running . ”
Based on dozens of conversations I ’ve had with Republican voters , who ’ve been casting real ballots here since January 14 , when early voting started , it seems Giuliani is not familiar with the advice that wise coaches give their better players :
Do n’t believe your press clips .
And it ’s amazing how much voters bring up his tawdry personal life .
They laugh about Rudy in drag and Rudy during his Frasier Crane period , when he lived with a gay couple and sipped late - night brandy while expostulating over the decline of good opera .
It ’s harmless .
But this is a state of full of mothers who live for phone calls from long - distance adult children , and there ’s one thing they ca n’t abide – Rudy ’s wreck of a family life .
Yes , people roll their eyes over the story of how Giuliani ’s third wife picked him up in a cigar bar while he was still married to the second Mrs. Hizzoner .
But I heard no end of condemnation over the mayor ’s estrangement from his two children .
More broadly , you can summarize Giuliani ’s problems in the line he no longer uses .
When the World Trade Center towers came down , he turned to his loyal sidekick Bernie Kerik , and said he was glad George Bush was president .
Now , that line is a triple loser .
Kerik , his police commissioner , is under federal indictment , in a sea of troubles .
Bush is despised by two - thirds of Americans , and even a majority of Republicans want to go in a different direction .
As for the big scare , give Senator Joe Biden credit for writing what may be Giuliani ’s obit : “ There are only three things he mentions in a sentence : a noun , a verb and 9/11 . ”
Yet Giuliani still wants to frighten people into voting for him .
Maybe that ’s why he hired the gothic - faced actor Jon Voight to stump for him in Florida .
What , Christopher Walken was n’t available ?
Win by narrative , die by narrative .
His other selling point was how he turned New York around .
He deserves credit , of course , for many improvements in the city .
But as crime plummeted in New York , the same thing has happened in cities across the country .
Los Angeles last year had the lowest number of homicides in nearly four decades .
Seattle just posted its lowest crime rate in two generations .
And as Michael Powell and Russ Buettner documented in a remarkable piece in the Times earlier this week , Giuliani ruled by crushing anyone who dared to cross him .
There ’s a reason Ed Koch ’s book on his fellow mayor was called “ Giuliani : Nasty Man . ”
In the glory days of the Giuliani campaign – say , before he started taking cell - phone calls from his wife in the middle of speeches – the mayor was full of cartoon bluster .
He said he would not hesitate to hit Iran , hard and fast .
He talked about victory in Iraq , hard and fast .
That was his message , and he had plenty of money to spread it .
He spent more than anyone but Mitt Romney in New Hampshire , and finished a distant fourth .
Giuliani may still eke out a win in Florida .
He is promising Floridians good insurance rates for hurricane coverage – O.K. , a niche message of the Geico school , but that ’s what he ’s down to .
Or as the mayor says , with only a hint of the swagger that brought him here : “ It ’s playing out the way we thought it would play out . ”

The UK retains its involvement in the Eiscat radars for now
That is the verdict of experts responding to UK physics and astronomy cuts made as administrators seek to plug an £ 80 m hole in their finances .
The UK is recognised as a world leader in solar - terrestrial physics ( STP ) .
The science is crucial for protecting our communications networks against powerful outbursts from the Sun .
This decision appears perverse in view of the existing and future potential [ of this ] high - impact world class research
Prof Stan Cowley , University of Leicester
Andrew Kavanagh , a space scientist at Lancaster University and member of the MIST council , said the Science and Technology Facilities Council ( STFC ) , which looks after UK astronomy , was " essentially scrapping an entire field of research in the UK " .
Flares and coronal mass ejections - large clouds of ionised gas thrown off the Sun - along with their associated shock waves are among the solar phenomena which exert an important influence on the space environment .
Cluster is Esa 's existing STP space mission
Space weather also has implications for planes crossing the Arctic on trans - polar flights .
The Earth 's magnetic field funnels energetic particles into the polar regions , exposing passengers and air crews to higher radiation levels there .
Tracking the Sun 's changing activity is vital for managing radiation doses and for protecting aircraft electronics .
It is also of economic importance , since it costs airlines to deviate from flight paths .
Spending crisis
The STFC has removed ground - based solar - terrestrial facilities from its future programmes .
The research council argues that it will continue to fund solar - terrestrial physics satellites through its subscriptions to the European Space Agency ( Esa ) .
But researchers point out that they require observations from both ground - based and space - based instruments to get the full picture .
Sources said they were not aware of any firm plans for forthcoming missions which fell into this category .
An existing constellation of Esa satellites designed to study space weather , called Cluster , has been in space for eight years and its future funding is uncertain .
Solar - terrestrial physics studies the connection between the Sun and Earth
The STFC 's delivery plan implies cuts to the funding of STP facilities and research at the universities of Lancaster , Leicester , Southampton , Aberystwyth , at University College London and at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Didcot .
The UK remains committed by an international agreement to the Eiscat project which operates radar facilities in Norway .
But a senior scientist within MIST said he was doubtful whether this would last .
The problems at STFC have emerged out of the government 's latest spending round which has left the council short of £ 80 m in the three - year budget plan to 2011 .
Scientists say the problem has been compounded by the council 's decision to claw back a further £ 40 m for unspecified developments .
To manage its way out of this crisis , the research council has announced its intention to close certain programmes and cut research grants .
Science societies and union officials have warned the damage to UK physics and astronomy will be incalculable and will lead to hundreds of job losses .
' World - class research '
Stan Cowley , professor of solar planetary physics at the University of Leicester , commented : " This decision appears perverse in view of the existing and future potential [ of this ] high - impact world class research . "
Geomagnetic data is used in oil drilling operations
In a statement , the STFC said : " In taking the decision to withdraw from the current suite of ground - based solar - terrestial physics [ STP ] facilties as stated in the STFC Delivery Plan it should be recognised that the ' ground - based ' part of the STP programme has been gradually reducing over recent years following a peer review process started in 2005 .
" Under the current budgetary constraints and the need to reprioritise its programme , the decision was taken to complete this process .
Our continued involvement in the international Eiscat facility will be considered in this light .
" Nevertheless , proposals for future facilities and projects , both ground and space - based , will still be considered under normal peer review processes . "
Transparency question
Prominent researchers from the STP community question why , when the government has invested considerable amounts of money into research and innovation , an applications - based science such as solar - terrestrial physics has been one of the first to be cut .
In its statement , MIST also expressed concern over what it described as " a lack of transparency in recent decision - making " within STFC .
STP researchers have attacked the lack of availability of records for minuted meetings concerning the decisions leading up to the funding cuts .
With many projects competing for financial support , scientists point out that the process must be seen to be open and fair .
In evidence to the House of Commons Select Committee on Innovation , Universities and Skills , Professor Keith Mason , chief executive of the STFC , defended his organisation 's record on consultation .
He added : " The period of time we are talking about is essentially a period where all the research councils are making bids to DIUS [ Department for Innovation , Universities & Skills ] for funding and one of the reasons for so - called secrecy - or at least keeping this under wraps - is that it was a negotiating situation . "
The STFC was formed as a new research council on 1 April 2007 through a merger of the Council for the Central Laboratory of the Research Councils ( CCLRC ) and the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council ( PParc ) .

The 100 + Most Controversial Films of All - Time
Movie Title Screen Film Title / Year , Director Screenshots
The Kiss ( 1896 ) ( aka The May Irwin Kiss , The Rice - Irwin Kiss and The Widow Jones )
D. William Heise for Thomas Edison
When Broadway sensations May Irwin and John Rice 's notorious lip lock was immortalized on film , people were shocked !
This most popular short film ( an Edison Vitascope film made in Edison 's Black Maria Studio ) was thought to be scandalizing .
It was the first filming of a couple 's kiss that was recreated from the two well - known stage actors ' ( May Irwin and John Rice ) performance in the hit Broadway play The Widow Jones .
The Edison catalogue advertised it thus : " They get ready to kiss , begin to kiss , and kiss and kiss and kiss in a way that brings down the house every time . "
Many disapproved and considered it inappropriate to view two physically - unattractive people magnified on the screen during an extended kiss .
As one contemporary critic wrote : " The spectacle of the prolonged pasturing on each other 's lips was beastly enough in life size on the stage but magnified to gargantuan proportions and repeated three times over it is absolutely disgusting . "
The Birth Of A Nation ( 1915 )
D. D. W. Griffith Even in 1915 , D.W. Griffith 's Civil War epic caused a stir for its stereotypical depiction of African - Americans .
This groundbreaking , landmark American film masterpiece about two families during the Civil War and Reconstruction periods was also extremely controversial and explicitly racist .
It was based on former North Carolina Baptist minister Rev. Thomas Dixon Jr.'s anti-black , 1905 bigoted play , The Clansman , the second volume in a trilogy .
Its release set up a major censorship battle over its extremist depiction of African Americans , although Griffith naively claimed that he was n't racist at the time .
Unbelievably , the film is still used today as a recruitment piece for Klan membership - and in fact , the organization experienced a revival and membership peak in the decade immediately following its initial release .
And the film stirred new controversy when it was voted into the National Film Registry in 1993 , and when it was voted one of the " Top 100 American Films " ( at # 44 ) by the American Film Institute in 1998 .
The subject matter of the film caused immediate criticism by the newly - created National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) for its racist and " vicious " portrayal of blacks , its proclamation of miscegenation , its pro-Klan stance , and its endorsement of enslavement .
As a result , two scenes were cut ( a love scene between Reconstructionist Senator and his mulatto mistress , and a fight scene ) .
In the scenes that remained , one recreated the first historic session of the legislature during Reconstruction , in which freed negro legislators were luridly and angrily portrayed as mocking the ideals of the Old South and shown as power - crazy , shiftless , lazy , idiotic , sitting shoeless ( sprawled with bare feet upon their desks ) and drinking in their legislature seats .
In another , mulatto leader Silas Lynch ( George Siegmann ) , lusting for power and miscegenation , attempted to force marriage upon Elsie Stoneman ( Lillian Gish ) - by force if necessary .
During the most famous sequence in the film , excitement was heightened by shots of the Klan alternating with shots of the endangered Elsie - the film exhibited masterful parallel editing .
Along a country road , the Klansman rode to their appointed mission - to first rescue Elsie , and then to rescue the entire Cameron family along with one of the Stoneman boys .
In a diagonally - angled shot , a long line of KKK riders came into view from the distance .
The film was thoroughly renounced as " the meanest vilification of the Negro race " and for its depiction of blacks as childlike , conniving , and sexually animalistic .
Riots broke out in major cities ( Boston , Philadelphia , among others ) , and it was denied release in many other places ( Chicago , Ohio , Denver , Pittsburgh , St. Louis , and Minneapolis , eight states in total ) .
Subsequent lawsuits and picketing tailed the film for years when it was re-released ( in 1924 , 1931 , and 1938 ) .
Ironically , although the film was advertised as authentic and accurate , the film 's major black roles in the film -- including the Senator 's mulatto mistress , the mulatto politican brought to power in the South , and faithful freed slaves -- were stereotypically played and filled by white actors - in blackface .
[ The real blacks in the film only played in minor roles . ]
L'Age D'Or ( 1930 , Fr. ) ( aka The Age of Gold , or The Golden Age )
D. Luis Bunuel
This anarchic , unique , and revolutionary avante - garde film was radical and exceptional in many ways , and created a termendous scandal in the early 1930s .
It showed a deliberate disregard for traditional narrative structures , with its outrageous images and the flaunting of many cultural and social conventions .
Buñuel 's follow - up surrealistic feature film ( his first ) to the previous year 's short Un Chien Andalou ( 1929 ) was a disjointed historically - significant film ( co- scripted by Salvador Dali ) that was denounced by the Roman Catholic Church ( for a blasphemous castle orgy scene involving a Jesus Christ look - alike rapist in the film 's ending ) .
It was censored or banned by a few governments , impounded in some cases , sparked riots in theaters , and was considered controversial ( pornographic and offensive ) .
In the plot , two passionate yet frustrated lovers , a Man ( Gaston Modot ) , a Goodwill Society delegate , and Young Girl ( Lya Lys ) , a high - society heiress , were being kept from one another and repressed by the pious bourgeois establishment for fear of them having sex together .
After an opening documentary sequence on scorpions and their habits , there were the indelible images of the lovers in mud attempting to have sex with each other during a cornerstone ceremony to celebrate the founding of Imperial Rome , the two lovers expressing their erotic impulses by sucking each other 's hands , and the sight of the sexually - frustrated young woman performing fellatio on the toes of a religious marble statue in a garden .
Other surrealistic images included : mitred , chanting arch - bishops perched on coastal rocks who turned skeletal , a milking cow in a young woman 's bed , an ox - cart driven by a horse through an elegant drawing room by two drunken peasants , some acts of violence ( a dog kicked , a beetle stomped and squished on rocks , a blind man pushed down with a foot to his stomach , a foot crushing a violin on pavement , a punch in the face , the shooting of a young boy by his father - the groundskeeper ) , bugs crawling over a party host 's face , and most surprisingly , a burning tree , a bishop , a huge wooden plow , the bishop 's staff , a giraffe statue , and pillow feathers thrown out a window by the enraged Man .
In the heretical ending , bearded and robed Duke of Blangis ( Lionel Salem ) , a Jesus look - alike , raped a young woman in a castle during 120 days of debauchery , then emerged ( without his beard ) near a crucifix adorned with five female scalps blowing in the wind .
All Quiet on the Western Front ( 1930 )
D. Lewis Milestone
The scars of WWI were still fresh when this Oscar - winning anti-war movie drew fire for portraying young German soldiers in a sympathetic light .
The Best Picture winning film was the first major anti-war film of the sound era , faithfully based upon the timeless , best - selling 1929 novel by Erich Maria Remarque ( who had experienced the war first - hand as a young German soldier ) .
The film was made only a dozen years following the end of the Great War , and the memories of the war were still fresh .
It was advertised with the brooding face of one of the young German recruits sent into World War I .
It was a critical and financial success , and probably the greatest of pacifist , anti-war films - the grainy black and white film is still not dated and the film has n't lost its initial impact .
The episodic film is still one of the few early sound films that modern audiences watch .
However , it was criticized as being propagandistic and anti-militaristic .
For its perceived anti-German message , it was denounced by the Nazi government in Berlin of the 30s and subsequently banned .
The film was told in a logical , chronological fashion , and divided into four distinct parts : ( 1 ) the pre-war education of schoolboys , and the enlistment of the young German recruits , ( 2 ) the soldiers ' arrival at the front of World War I , ( 3 ) the experiences of the cruelties and horrors of war in trench warfare , ( 4 ) the hero 's homecoming , return to the front , and ultimate death .
The film included a series of vignettes and scenes that portrayed the senselessness and futility of war from the sympathetic point of view of the young German soldiers in the trenches in the Great War who found no glory on the battlefield , meeting only death and disillusionment .
[ Note : Five years earlier , King Vidor 's WWI epic The Big Parade ( 1925 ) also depicted brutal scenes of US soldiers gunned down by snipers , and the loss of the main character 's leg when hit by German mortar fire . ]
Freaks ( 1932 )
D. Tod Browning
Though its sympathies were with the sideshow performers , this circus drama was criticized for casting real - life " human oddities . "
This MGM horror production starred real - life circus side - show performers - a cornucopia of ' human oddities ' , including Siamese twins Daisy and Violet Hilton , Prince Randian - the armless and legless " Living Torso , " Johnny Eck the ' half - boy ' ( with nothing below his waist ) , an Armless Girl ( the " Living Venus de Milo " ) , the Bearded Lady Olga Roderick , Koo Koo ( the " Bird Girl " ) and the very similar Betty Green ( the " Stork Woman " ) , and four ' pinheads ' or microcephalics , including Schlitze .
It was an out - of - the - ordinary picture not easily forgotten , causing both revulsion and fascination .
In the film 's terrorizing and shocking climax , strong man Hercules ( Henry Victor ) and aerialist Cleopatra ( Olga Baclanova ) were both pursued in parallel by the grotesque ' freaks ' with knives during a stormy night , crawling through mud in vengeful pursuit of their victims .
The film was released officially ( five months after disastrous preview showings when people fled from the theatres ) and found to be exploitative , abhorrent and " loathsome " with " unwholesome shockery , " although it also portrayed the ' abnormal and the unwanted ' as resilient and adaptable human beings with complete compassion and understanding .
Overall , it made audiences uncomfortable and engendered fright , uneasiness and animosity .
After initial preview screenings , MGM ordered Browning to edit the almost - 90 minute film .
He removed the alarming film 's most " offensive " segments ( approximately 26 minutes ) , including the original closing scene of an emasculated Hercules singing falsetto ( after castration ) in " Tetrallini 's Freaks and Music Hall . "
A " Special Message " was added to the film 's beginning to remind viewers of " misshapen misfits " from past stories .
And a final epilogue was tacked on with a ' happy ending ' between Hans and Frieda to lessen the shock of the film 's original ending -- the sight of Cleopatra ( " the peacock of the air " ) turned into a legless human chicken with one eye blinded .
However , the changes in the film did not improve the film 's box - office business and it was a major financial failure .
Tod Browning 's career , which was booming after directing Dracula ( 1931 ) , was destroyed .
MGM pulled the film from distribution a month after its release , and in 1947 , exhibition rights were sold to exploitation filmmaker / distributor Dwain Esper for the next 25 years .
It was toured for an adults - only roadshow with alternative titles ( i.e. , Forbidden Love , The Monster Show , and Nature 's Mistakes ) , exploitative taglines , such as : " Do Siamese Twins Make Love ? " and " Can a Full Grown Woman Truly Love a Midget ? "
The film was banned outright in England for 31 years ( until the early 1960s ) .
Scarface ( 1932 ) ( aka Scarface : The Shame of the Nation )
D. Howard Hawks Howard Hawks ' classic was banned in several states despite pre-release changes designed to counter claims that it glorified gangsters .
Before this film , pre-Code gangster films Little Caesar ( 1931 ) and The Public Enemy ( 1931 ) disturbed audiences .
Then , one of the boldest , most potent , raw and violently - brutal gangster - crime films ever made was released by United Artists .
This sensational production chronicled the predictable but tragic rise and fall of a notorious gangster figure .
Although it was inspired by the exploits of Chicago 's Depression - Era underworld vice lord / gangster Alfonso Capone ( nicknamed " Scarface " ) , he bore little resemblance to the finished film .
[ Note :
It also formed the basis for director Brian De Palma 's remake Scarface ( 1983 ) with Al Pacino as the scar - faced title character - who was redefined as an exile from Castro's Cuba to Florida in the early 1980s . ]
The controversial film was in the planning stages in 1930 - to be produced by versatile co-producer / director Howard Hawks and co-producer Howard Hughes .
The screenplay for the violent , action - packed , visually expressionistic film was written in eleven days by Chicago native Ben Hecht using his Chicago newspaper experiences .
A working script was readied by January 1931 , and after about three months of filming , it was completed later in the year .
Although the film was scheduled for release in January 1932 , its opening was delayed for a few more months due to Hawks ' and Hughes ' continuing squabbles with industry censors over its sensationalism and glorification of the gangster menace , and issues regarding the film 's retitling .
To give the violent , tragi - comedy film respectability , to de-glamorize the folk - hero nature of the gangster , and to appease the forces of censorship , a number of restrictions or changes were imposed before the film could be released with the MPAA seal of approval .
For example , an added sub - title was required [ its original title was simply Scarface , and the first suggested retitle was The Menace ] to illustrate that the film was not a glorification , but an indictment of gangsterism , and an apologetic , moral statement was tacked to the beginning of the film .
One of the major changes was in the ending - an alternative , moralistic , sermonizing ( and emasculated ) second ending ( substituted for a shootout ) was created to condemn the gangster as cowardly and show his sentencing and retributory punishment ( hanging ) by an effective justice system .
The film was heralded as an example of the kind of protection the Hollywood Production Code of Ethics could provide to the movie - going public when implemented in 1934 .
Due to squabbles over the film 's release and the hue and cry over its depiction of the world of gangsterism , the film ultimately did n't do well at the box office .
It was banned in several states , versions varied from state to state ( due to varying boards of censors ) and showings were delayed over a year in Chicago .
Foreign sales were also limited , and Nazi Germany permanently prohibited the film 's showing .
After Hughes withdrew it from circulation , it was rarely seen in the United States for almost fifty years , and was n't widely available until it was reissued by Universal Studios in 1979 .
[ Note : Brian DePalma 's remake with Al Pacino , Scarface ( 1983 ) , was also vilified for its violent chain - saw sequence . ]
Ecstasy ( 1933 , Czech . ) ( aka Exstase )
D. Gustav Machaty
Americans were shocked by the nudity and sexual frankness of this Czech drama about an unhappy wife searching for fulfillment .
This early , scandalous Czechoslovakian foreign erotic drama was once notorious , earth - shattering , and scandalous .
It was notable as being the first theatrically - released film in which the sex act ( sexual intercourse ) was depicted .
It was unusual at its time for depicting female sexual pleasure during orgasm ( simulated ) .
It told the story of a sexually - frustrated child - bride named Eva ( Vienna - born 20 year - old Hedwig Kiesler , or later known as Hedy Lamarr in her fifth film ) who had married a middle - aged , impotent Emil ( Zvonimir Rogoz ) , and fled in dismay to her widowed father 's estate where she was close to nature .
It was censored for its two shocking scenes - in a naturalistic locale reminiscent of the Garden of Eden : a nude swim and naked forest romp in sun-lit woods to pursue her horse Loni ( which had run off with her clothes ) , and an adulterous love - making scene ( with an obvious expression of sexual awakening , fulfillment and orgasmic pleasure on her face in a close - up ) in a cottage during a rainstorm with a handsome young engineer / surveyor named Adam ( Aribert Mog ) , who had earlier retrieved her horse and clothes .
The foreign import was blocked in 1935 by US Customs from entering the US for its obscenity , marking the first instance of customs laws prohibiting a film from entering the US .
The U.S. Treasury Department upheld a Commissioner of Customs decision to prohibit the import , although it was later imported in a censored version .
Hitler banned the film , and Pope Pius XII denounced it .
Triumph of the Will ( 1935 , Germ . ) ( aka Triumph Des Willens )
D. Leni Riefenstahl
Often called the most powerful propaganda movie of all time , Leni Riefenstahl 's gorgeous documentary glorified Nazi ideals and iconography .
Nazi Fuhrer leader Adolf Hitler commissioned dancer / actress - turned filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl to make this notorious documentary to record and celebrate the sixth Nazi Reich Party Congress held in September 1934 in Nuremberg .
This spectacular propagandistic film glorified and praised the might of the unjust and evil Nazi regime and state with masterful images , rapid cuts , a Wagnerian score , and ingenious camera angles and compositions .
This infamous , extravagant two - hour film is still considered the most powerful propaganda film ever made , with grandiose opening shots of Messianic Hitler 's arrival by plane , his heroic entrance and adulation by saluting ( " Sieg Heil " ) multitudes and uniformed party members and soldiers ( and Hitler Youth ) , and his charismatic exalted character during rousing speeches .
Director Riefenstahl was imprisoned by the Allies for four years after the war , although she continued to protest by insisting that her work was purely historical and an example of cinema verite , rather than the repellent work which it was criticized and accused of being .
Protests greeted Riefenstahl at a 1974 Telluride Film Festival tribute , and the Anti-Defamation League decried a 1975 screening in Atlanta as ' ' morally insensitive . ''
Riefenstahl herself never shook her Nazi - tainted past , and repeatedly claimed the film was more imagery than ideological .
Okay , maybe my title is paraphrasing Mitt , but not by much .
I have vocally championed Mitt Romney 's candidacy for the GOP nomination .
And will continue to do so .
Why ?
Because no one is more beatable than this guy , and he continues to be a wealth of usable material .
The latest example ?
This classic video gem of Romney showing his true compassion ( video embedded below ) .
In it , he speaks with a muscular dystrophy patient in a wheelchair who presents Romney with compelling evidence of the benefits of medical marijuana , then asks him if , as president , Romney would arrest this guy for using it .
Romney 's reaction : " I do not support medical marijuana . "
He then quickly moves away and starts shaking other hands while keeping his robotic smile in place .
Someone starts screaming , " You wo n't even talk to a guy in a wheelchair ? "
Watching his discomfort is palpable , and highly entertaining ( except for the poor guy in the wheelchair ) .

October 9 , 2007 Excerpted from Foreign Agents : The American Israel Public Affairs Committee from the 1963 Fulbright Hearings to the 2005 Espionage Scandal
★★★★ HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
Buy a Copy AIPAC was founded by Isaiah L. " Si " Kenen , springing from the American Zionist Committee for Public Affairs Kenen registered twice with the U.S. Department of Justice under the Foreign Agent Registration Act ( FARA ) as a foreign agent for Israel . [ i ]
On April 21 , 1947 he registered as an agent of the American Section of the Jewish Agency for Israel . [ ii ]
Si Kenen also registered at FARA as an agent for the " Israel Information Services " on October 12 , 1948 through May 13 , 1951.[ iii ]
Kenen changed the committee 's name from the American Zionist Committee for Public Affairs to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in 1959 , to better reflect that it , according to him , " raised its funds from both Zionists and non-Zionists . " [ iv ]
Kenen 's emphasis on a low - key , uncontroversial , and even non-descriptive organization name continued after his departure when AIPAC spawned a network of obliquely named political action committees ( PACs ) across the United States designed to sway the results of key elections .
From a historical perspective , all of the lessons Kenen learned running the American Zionist Council with funds and guidance from the Israeli government are part of AIPAC 's " institutional DNA . "
It is impossible to understand AIPAC without understanding its precursor , the American Zionist Council .
Kenen served as AIPAC 's executive director and also owned and edited the influential newsletter , the Near East Report . [ v ]
The Near East Report is now housed under a separate nonprofit corporate affiliate structure , for reasons explored later .
Kenen was an Ohio newspaperman until 1943 , when he left to become the secretary of the American Jewish Conference ; he remained there until 1948 .
[ vi ]
He was also the Jewish Agency 's information director between 1947 and 1948 at the United Nations .
This was Israel 's first UN delegation after its formation as a state in 1948 .
In 1951 , Kenen went to Washington to lobby Congress for aid to Israel , founding the American Zionist Committee , which later spun off AIPAC .
Between 1951 and March 15 , 1954 , Kenen directed legislative activity in Washington on behalf of the American Zionist Council .
The American Zionist Council restructured its lobbying activities beginning in early 1954 , when the organization 's leaders became uncomfortable using internationally sourced tax - exempt donations for lobbying on Capitol Hill .
Fred Scribner , a friendly U.S. Undersecretary of Treasury , confidentially recommended during a 1959 meeting with key Zionist organizations operating in the U.S. that they needed to restructure themselves in order to avoid problems with the Eisenhower administration , the IRS , and the U.S. Department of Justice .[ vii ]
According to UCLA scholar Steven Spiegel , opposition from the president was intense : " The tension between the Eisenhower administration and Israeli supporters was so acute that there were rumors ( unfounded as it turned out ) that the administration would investigate the American Zionist Council .
Therefore , an independent lobbying group was formed within the auspices of the American Zionist Committee . " [ viii ]
AIPAC 's original internal codename in the American Zionist Committee was " the Kenen Committee . "
Its results have been unparalleled in the history of foreign lobbying .
An AIPAC obituary declared that the State Department strenuously opposed Kenen 's earliest lobbying efforts .
The indefatigable Kenen worked members of Congress and obtained initial approval of $ 15 million in aid to Israel , despite robust State Department opposition .
This early success set AIPAC 's strategy of seeking aid to Israel not on the basis of merit , presidential administration prerogative as the maker of foreign policy , or broad State Department initiatives , but through fake grassroots efforts financed by foreign funds from Israel to " prime the American pump . "
The Israel lobbying campaign for favorable public relations and media coverage included strategically directed gifts and grants to U.S. colleges and universities for new Israel - centric " Middle East Studies " departments and unfettered lobbying with tax - exempt funds recycled from overseas into the U.S. political system .
Activity reports from this intensive campaign are documented in the first chapter .
By 1973 , Kenen was able to claim that he had boosted U.S. aid to Israel to $ 1 billion per year .
When Kenen retired in 1974 , he still retained his " editor emeritus " title at the Near East Report .
The spirit of AIPAC 's hardball and often illegal tactics would continue long after Kenen left the scene , and the results are staggering .
At the time of Kenen 's death in 1988 , U.S. aid to Israel exceeded $ 3 billion a year , the highest amount of U.S. aid given to any country . [ ix ]
It is popularly believed that the immense power of the Israel lobby sprang from broad grassroots commitment by concerned individuals across America .
However , evidence from internal American Zionist Council and AIPAC documents reveals a different history .
Many groups , including Christian religious organizations now highly active in AIPAC - directed affairs , were initially indifferent to or even suspicious of Israeli initiatives .
It took millions of dollars of Israeli government and overseas funds and decades of effort to create the public relations , lobbying , and political juggernaut that now dominates in America .
However , not all Americans welcomed the formation of Israel 's lobby .
Founder Si Kenen 's startup activities proved to be so brazen that they were put under the microscope of a U.S. Senate committee investigating the activities of non-diplomatic foreign agents in the United States .
The investigation was originally focused on Latin America , but was compelled to investigate the Israel lobby being assembled on U.S. soil .
The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations dove headlong into questions about whether the American Zionist Council , AIPAC , the Jewish Agency and Si Kenen were avoiding Foreign Agents Registration
Act declarations or filing false ones , acting as unlawful conduits to launder tax - exempt funds , and illegally disseminating Israeli government propaganda in the United States .
This investigation , conducted by Senator James William Fulbright , provides the first outside glimpse into the American Zionist Committee , Si Kenen and AIPAC .
1963 : Senator Fulbright Investigates AIPAC Arkansas Senator James William Fulbright was an internationalist thought leader in the United States Senate .
Fulbright 's record as a Southern Democrat encompassed staunch multilateralist support for the creation of the United Nations and opposition to Joseph McCarthy 's communist witch hunt .
Senator McCarthy repeatedly slandered Fulbright with the moniker " Senator Half - bright . "
Though eminently qualified , Fulbright was ultimately denied consideration for the position of U.S. Secretary of State because of his uncompromising approach to dealing with Israel .
A notable blemish on Fulbright 's legacy was his strong support for racial segregation , but the senator is perhaps most remembered among scholarly beneficiaries and American international exchange students for establishing the Fulbright Fellowship scholarship program .
Born in Sumner , Missouri , Fulbright earned a science degree from the University of Arkansas in 1925 , but became more worldly and appreciative of international education through study at Oxford University 's Pembroke College where he was a Rhodes Scholar .
Fulbright 's understanding of U.S. law and foreign agent registration requirements were anchored in his legal studies ; he earned a law degree from George Washington University Law School in 1934 .
In the same year , he was admitted to the Washington , DC bar and became an attorney in the U.S. Department of Justice anti-trust division .
This legal expertise would serve Fulbright well as he sought to understand one of the most complex and opaque chains of interlinked nonprofit corporations ever to be assembled in the United States .
Fulbright was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1942 .
He served one term and became a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee .
The House adopted the 1942 Fulbright Resolution , which not only supported the concept of international peacekeeping forces , but also put the United States on track to participate in the League of Nations , which became the United Nations in 1945 .
In 1944 , Fulbright rode a wave of increasing national fame to a Senate seat , and ultimately served five full terms .
Fulbright became a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1949 , and would go on to become the committee 's longest - standing chair , serving from 1959 to 1974 .
In 1962 , Senator Fulbright became concerned about the activities of unregistered foreign agents working to influence public opinion and policy in the United States .
His interest was piqued by a pair of articles authored by journalist Walter Pincus and Douglass Cater .
Their reporting detailed U.S. - backed Dominican Republic dictator Rafael Trujillo's attempts to use U.S. media for public relations .
They also uncovered the Guatemalan regime 's covert purchase of friendly coverage in the American Mercury , a magazine founded by H.L. Mencken in 1924 . [ x ]
Fulbright offered Walter Pincus a temporary research assignment investigating the scope and breadth of the U.S. activities of unregistered foreign agents .
Pincus worked as staff director of the two - member investigatory subcommittee , bringing on staff counsel Charles P. Sifton ( now a senior federal judge in Brooklyn ) . [ xi ]
Pincus duly documented Trujillo 's efforts to influence Kennedy administration sugar policies and other Latin American foreign agency issues through a series of overseas fact - finding trips .
However , the Fulbright hearings were not at all limited to Latin America .
They investigated ten lobbying groups suggested by Pincus that paralleled his news reports including China , West Germany , and Ghana . [ xii ]
The investigators also subpoenaed documents , developed evidence , and called witnesses from important and highly active Zionist organizations in the United States that were established and given seed money by Israeli - government - related entities .
Fulbright focused on the central funding role of the Jewish Agency in Jerusalem and New York , Israeli government propaganda and ownership of the Jewish Telegraphic Agency , and funding for publications including the Near East Report and Israel Digest .
The investigation also studied the conduits and internal financial operations of the American Zionist Council , Si Kenen , and AIPAC .
Fulbright held these 1963 Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearings on foreign agents in a series of closed sessions .
The May 23 and August 1 sessions focused entirely on Israel - related operations .
Although subsequent news accounts and books would summarize or reference the outcome of the hearings , often with errors or omissions , few ever captured the lengthy , penetrating , and captivating verbal interchanges between Senator Fulbright and witnesses from the organizations subpoenaed to testify .
A typical reference to the commission , published in 1970 by a now - defunct Dow Jones weekly newspaper , the National Observer , neatly summarized the investigation 's outcome :
In 1963 the Senate Foreign Relations Committee investigated the Jewish Agency and uncovered a " conduit operation run by an organization called the American Zionist Council .
Over an eight - year period , this council received more than $ 5,000,000 from the Jewish Agency to create a favorable public opinion in this country for Israeli government policies .
The Senate investigation closed down the conduit , but the extensive propaganda activities still go on .[ xiii ]
Contemporary readers delving into the source material for that article may be astounded by the frank , businesslike proceedings in the transcripts , now released from their dank captivity in federal government archives .
Wonderment , confusion , and angst shine through the brilliant exchanges as Fulbright presents subpoenaed evidence , analyzes data , and calls for further information , all while grilling evasive witnesses .
Modern - day members of Congress unfamiliar with Fulbright 's dialectic will be astonished to see how government oversight and subpoena power functioned in an era when the House and Senate still accommodated leadership capable of challenging issues as sensitive as the U.S. - Israel relationship .
Fulbright and the Foreign Relations Committee were ready , willing , and able to compel high - ranking figures within the Israel lobby elite to appear and explain their foreign lobbying and public relations activities .
Senator Fulbright strove to uncover details about myriad indirect payments made by the quasi - governmental Jewish Agency to AIPAC founder Si Kenen and the American Zionist Council .
The Jewish Agency was required to file periodic Foreign Agents Registration Act declarations with the U.S. Department of Justice .
Fulbright uncovered major covert initiatives designed to influence U.S. policy through media campaigns , indirectly subsidizing lobbyists such as Si Kenen and promoting Israeli government initiatives that were not being disclosed in FARA filings as required by law .
The Jewish Agency : Seed Money From Abroad
T he central role of the quasi - governmental Jewish Agency in establishing and funding initiatives through " conduits " resurfaces repeatedly in testimony to Fulbright and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
Witnesses described the Jewish Agency as an independent organization with national affiliates similar to the International Red Cross.[ xiv ]
One unknowing conduit of Jewish Agency funds , the Rabinowitz Foundation described it simply as an agency of the Israeli government , only to later retract the statement under pressure from the Jewish Agency 's New York legal counsel .
In the following select passages from the May 23 , 1960 hearing , witnesses Isadore Hamlin , the executive director of the Jewish Agency - American Section , and the Jewish Agency 's legal counsel Maurice M. Boukstein of the New York firm Guzik and Boukstein grapple with Senator Fulbright over the de facto status of the Jewish Agency .
They also attempt to define the relationship between the Jewish Agency 's American subsidiary incorporated in New York under a broad reorganization in 1960 and the executive headquarters in Jerusalem .
The Jewish Agency established its first representative office in New York in 1944 .[ xv ]
Boukstein , in later testimony , would take credit for being one of the legal " architects " [ xvi ] of the system of interlocking nonprofit corporations doing end - runs around the clear intent of the Foreign Agents Registration Act .
Testimony would also reveal a direct connection between the nascent lobby and a little - known Israeli false - flag terror attack against the United States in Egypt .
One board member of the Jewish Agency responsible for " colonization " in Israel and financing the startup of Israel 's lobby in America was instrumental in engineering a cover-up of the terror bombing campaign codenamed " Operation Susannah . "
Senator Fulbright : The Jewish Agency - American Section , Inc. , is , I understand , a New York membership corporation organized in 1960 ?
Mr. Hamlin :
It is , sir .
Senator Fulbright :
And since 1960 it has been registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 , as amended , as an agent of the Executive of the Jewish Agency for Israel in Jerusalem ?
Mr. Hamlin : Mr. Chairman , would you just repeat the date when that filing took place ?
Senator Fulbright : 1960 .
Mr. Hamlin : 1960 : that is correct .
Senator Fulbright :
The relationship between the Executive and the American Section , is this contractual or not ?
Mr. Hamlin : The American Section is part of the worldwide body called the Jewish Agency Executive .
The Jewish Agency Executive is composed of 22 individuals , of which 6 reside in the United States , and so the American Section is part of the worldwide organization .
Mr. Boukstein : May I be of some assistance , Mr. Chairman ?
Senator Fulbright : Yes .
Mr. Boukstein : The Executive , as was stated this morning , the Executive of the Jewish Agency is in Jerusalem : the American Section is exactly what it connotes .
It is the American Section of the Executive which resides in the United States and functions for and on behalf of the Executive in Jerusalem .
Senator Fulbright : I was trying to clarify the record precisely what the word " Executive " means here .
Does it mean the Executive committee of the Jewish Agency ?
Mr. Boukstein :
It is – do you want me to answer or the witness ?
Senator Fulbright :
The witness can answer .
Mr. Hamlin :
It is in essence the Executive committee .
Senator Fulbright : Of the Jewish Agency ?
Mr. Hamlin : Of the Jewish Agency ; that is right .
Senator Fulbright :
And it is composed of 22 people ?
Mr. Hamlin : Pardon me ?
Senator Fulbright : Of 22 people ?
Mr. Hamlin : Of 22 individuals ; yes sir .
Senator Fulbright : And six of those live in the United States ?
Mr. Hamlin : Correct , sir .
Senator Fulbright :
So that leaves 16 of them who live in Israel ?
Mr. Hamlin :
That is right , sir .
Senator Fulbright : Now are there any other members ?
Is this the whole body ?
Is there a board of directors other than the Executive ?
Mr. Hamlin : No , sir .
That is the governing body of the Jewish Agency , the total body .
Senator Fulbright :
It is a corporation ?
Mr. Hamlin : Yes .
Senator Fulbright : Does it have any stockholders ?
Mr. Hamlin : No , not to my knowledge .
Senator Fulbright :
It is incorporated by a special act of the Government of Israel , is that correct ?
Mr. Hamlin : The Jewish Agency , yes , was recognized by special act of the Israeli Parliament .
Senator Fulbright : Are any members of the Executive living in Israel members of the Government ?
Mr. Hamlin : Members of our Executive are members of the Government of Israel ?
Yes , sir .
Senator Fulbright : Who are they ?
Mr. Hamlin :
One member of our executive , Mr. Eshkol , is a member of the Israeli Government .
Senator Fulbright : What is his position in the Israeli Government ?
Hamlin : He is the Minister of Finance .
But , if I may add , in the Executive he has competence in one area of work , and that is the area of colonization .
Mr. Boukstein :
If I may add , a member of the Executive , Mr. Shazar , was the day before yesterday elected the President of Israel , as you probably noticed in the newspapers .
Senator Fulbright : Does this disqualify him to be a member of the Executive ?
Mr. Hamlin : Yes , it would disqualify him .
Senator Fulbright : Could you describe how the Executive – the relationship between the Executive and the American Section , how does the Executive , in other words , exercise control , if it does , over the American Section .
Mr. Hamlin : The American Section is the representative in the United States of the Jerusalem Agency – did you say exercise control , sir ?
Senator Fulbright :
If it does ; yes .
Does it exercise control ?
Mr. Hamlin : I would say that in the final analysis there would be a vote of all 22 members .
Senator Fulbright : Yes .
Mr. Hamlin :
On an issue which might bind them .
Senator Fulbright : Yes .
Mr. Hamlin :
But if my experience would indicate anything , I would say that in matters that deal with American affairs , such as we have , the Jerusalem Executive more or less depends on the opinions of their members residing in the United States .
Senator Fulbright : Does this organization have a set of bylaws ?
Mr. Hamlin : Yes .
Senator Fulbright :
Do we have a copy ?
Mr. Sifton :
We have , again , an uncertified copy and perhaps , formally , we should have a certified copy .
Mr. Boukstein .
Mr. Chairman , we will be glad to furnish it .
Senator Fulbright :
He says you will furnish a certified copy of the bylaws of the Executive .
Mr. Hamlin
Yes ; we would be glad to , sir .
Mr. Boukstein :
He will have to certify it as the secretary .
Mr. Fulbright : Yes ; that is correct .
That is of the Executive .
Now , you also have a corporation of the American Section .
It is incorporated in this country ?
Mr. Hamlin : Yes , sir ; New York State .
Senator Fulbright :
And you could supply that ?
Mr. Boukstein : I think there is a misunderstanding , Mr. Chairman .
The Executive of Jerusalem has no bylaws .
Senator Fulbright : Not in Jerusalem ?
Mr. Hamlin : I misunderstood you .
Mr. Boukstein .
I though you were referring to the bylaws of the American Section and those , of course , we will supply you .
Senator Fulbright : What are the basic guidelines for the Executive in Jerusalem ?
Under what authority does it operate ?
Mr. Hamlin :
It is the constitution of the organization .
Senator Fulbright : Does that constitution set out how it should operate ?
Mr. Hamlin : Yes .
There is a constitution and there are standing rules of the organization .
Senator Fulbright : Could we have those then ?
Those are the equivalent of the bylaws ; that is what I did not know exactly the terminology you used .
But you could make that available ?
Mr. Hamlin : Yes , sir ; I would be glad to .
Senator Fulbright :
Do you execute and prepare the registration ?
[ FARA registration ]
Mr. Boukstein : Mr. Chairman , as I am the expert on the subject , having acted for the Agency as counsel .
The constitution defines the function of the Executive .
There is no document that I am aware of that lays down the working rules , such as we would in this country refer to as bylaws of the Executive .
They act by resolution .
Senator Fulbright : Well , do they act under majority rule ?
Mr. Boukstein .
They act under majority rule by resolution .
Senator Fulbright :
Do they have subcommittees ?
Mr. Boukstein :
They have subcommittees which they appoint ad hoc or sometimes continuing subcommittees , Mr. Chairman .
But we shall search – but I am aware of the existence of no document which would be the equivalent of rules or bylaws .
Senator Fulbright :
Do they have minutes of meetings ?
Mr. Boukstein : Yes , they do .
Senator Fulbright : Could you supply us with copies of the minutes of their meetings since 1960 ?
Mr. Boukstein : Mr. Chairman , I am not so sure that would be a pertinent document .
The minutes are in Jerusalem .
They relate to all kinds of matters .
If you mean excerpts of minutes relating to activities in the United States , we will be glad to furnish them .
But I do n't think that you have any interest in minutes relating to matters of completely ungermane subjects .
Senator Fulbright : No ; we would n't request anything ungermane .
It was my understanding from testimony this morning that a very large percentage of the funds of the Executive derive from this country , is that correct ?
Mr. Boukstein :
That is correct .
Senator Fulbright : I will agree that not all of it would be .
I was interested in how this Agency operates .
I do n't know of any precedent of anything like it in any other instance , and I thought it would be interesting to the committee to understand how foreign agents in this particular field operate and what kind of principals they represent .
Mr. Hamlin : Would you like for us to give you a description of the departments and operations in Israel , sir ?
Senator Fulbright : Well , if you would care to very briefly .
Mr. Hamlin :
All right .
Do you want it now ?
Senator Fulbright :
You can do it in writing .
Mr. Hamlin :
Yes sir , we can do it in writing , as you wish .
Senator Fulbright : Are you acquainted with an organization known as the American Zionist Council ?
Mr. Hamlin : Yes , sir , I am .
Senator Fulbright : Subsequent to April 1 , 1960 , did the Jewish Agency - American Section make payments to the American Zionist Council ?
Mr. Hamlin : Yes , sir .
Senator Fulbright :
To the best of your knowledge , when did these payments begin ?
Mr. Hamlin :
If my memory serves me , I believe in 1961 for the budget of the Council .
Senator Fulbright :
The first of the year , about ?
Mr. Hamlin : I would have to look it up .
Senator Fulbright : Would you provide the committee with a record of such payments as you have made to the American Zionist Council ?
Mr. Hamlin : Yes , sir , we would .
Senator Fulbright : The American Zionist Council .
Mr. Hamlin : Yes , sir .
Senator Fulbright :
In general , what were the purposes of these payments ?
Mr. Hamlin :
The purposes of these payments were to assist the American Zionist Council carry out its Zionist educational and youth work , and its public informational activities .[ xvii ]
Boukstein's efforts to shield " ungermane " offshore operations from Senate scrutiny were purposeful .
Even with limited sworn testimony , Fulbright established a direct line of funding flowing from a key government official and an Israeli - government - founded , quasi - governmental entity – the Jewish Agency in Israel – to AIPAC 's precursor within several minutes .
Fulbright also raised several issues relevant to the Foreign Agents Registration Act .
As the recipient of U.S. donations as well as funds from other donor countries , the Jewish Agency passed funds through the American Section to entities across the United States through the American Zionist Council .
Later testimony and subpoenaed documents reveal that the American Zionist Council was washing away the appearance of foreign control in order to finance " policy research " and other public relations activities , as well as fortifying the position and financial muscle of the nascent U.S. - based Israel lobby groups so they could some day take over with no need for further foreign seed or startup funding .
Fulbright was right to be concerned about these Jewish Agency operations , for which he did not see " precedent of anything like it in any other instance , " as we detail in the final chapter .
Decades after Fulbright 's investigation , the Jewish Agency and its U.S. partners would be found by Israeli prosecutor Talia Sason to have engaged in laundering $ 50 billion toward numerous illegal overseas activities .
Although it did n't seem relevant at the time , the Jewish Agency Executive board member who was also minister of finance in the Israeli government serves as the most powerful example of why it was never in America 's best interest to have a foreign principal establishing and empowering a stealth lobby in the United States .
The minister referred to only by last name with " competence in one area of work , the area of colonization " was Levi Eshkol .
At the time of Fulbright 's inquiry , Eshkol was ending his 12 - year stint as minister of finance and would soon become the ruling Mapai Party leader .
When Prime Minister Ben-Gurion resigned in June 1963 , Eshkol was elected Mapai party chairman .
He was then appointed Prime Minister of Israel .
His previously close relationship with Ben-Gurion soon turned hostile over a single matter of burning importance to the United States .
In the summer of 1954 , Israel conducted a covert false - flag operation in Egypt known as " Operation Susannah . "
Israeli agents launched terrorist bombing attacks against U.S. -, British - , and Egyptian - owned targets in Egypt .
Since 1950 , it had been U.S. policy to pressure the British to withdraw from the Suez Canal and abandon two treaties : the Anglo - Egyptian Treaty of 1936 , which made the canal a neutral zone under British control , and the Convention of Constantinople .
Israel feared that a British withdrawal would remove a check on Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser 's military ambitions .
After Israel 's diplomatic efforts failed to convince the British to stay , Israel unleashed a false - flag terrorist operation designed to convince the British to stay while framing the Egyptians .
Israeli Defense Minister Pinhas Lavon was forced to resign because of the incident , and the scandal came to bear his name .
The break between Ben-Gurion and Eshkol occurred over Ben-Gurion 's insistence on fully investigating and learning lessons from the sordid Lavon Affair .
Eshkol was insistent that investigating the affair was a waste of time , and wished to bury it as soon as possible .
On December 13 , 1964 , he addressed the issue to the Mapai Central Committee .
" If I vote in favor of an inquiry into the Lavon Affair … We would be opening a Pandora 's box of troubles .
It will not end with this affair or with this investigation .
We 'll be spending the next fifteen years dealing with investigations into various unsolved matters . " [ xviii ]
Levi Eshkol , the Jewish Agency executive overseeing funding for the establishment of the Israel lobby in the United States , successfully quashed Ben-Gurion 's demand to appoint a judicial inquiry into Israel 's false - flag attack on America when he became prime minister of Israel . [ xix ]

After years of resisting the newsroom cuts that have hit most of the industry , The New York Times will bow to growing financial strain and eliminate about 100 newsroom jobs this year , the executive editor said Thursday .
The cuts will be achieved “ by not filling jobs that go vacant , by offering buyouts , and if necessary by layoffs , ” the executive editor , Bill Keller , said .
The more people who accept buyouts , he said , “ the smaller the prospect of layoffs , but we should brace ourselves for the likelihood that there will be some layoffs . ”
He said , “ We intend to move quickly , to get any cuts past us so that we do not spend a year bleeding slowly . ”
The Times has 1,332 newsroom employees , the largest number in its history ; no other American newspaper has more than about 900 .
There were scattered buyouts and job eliminations in the newsroom in recent years , but the overall number continued to rise , largely from the growth of its Internet operations .
Another Day , Another WordPress Hack .
Posted : 2007-10-08 20:10:13
It could have been worse .
A few weeks ago we were hit with an SMF v1.1.3 exploit just a few days after the release of v1.1.4 .
The intruder inserted a slew of hidden spam links into the main ‘ index . php ’ file .
It took me a day or two to detect the modifications .
And in this short time period forums .
devside.net , which has been online since 2003 , with a healthy Pagerank , had all it ’s pages dropped from Google [ with the exception of profiles and archives ] .
It ’s a good thing I keep the forums on their own sub- domain , which Google treats more like a separate domain than anything else .
A SE problem with the sub does not affect the main domain .
As a counter - measure to these “ exploit app weakness , get shell , d/l script , profit ” type of attacks , I have disabled most of the shell related PHP functions on the server .
And so I thought my problems where solved …
This time it ’s my fault .
I was running WordPress v2.2.2 , with v2.2.3 having been released about a month ago .
I ’ve been checking the WP dashboard , but I must have missed it , or forgotten about it .
This time the intruder exploited one of many WP weaknesses , and inserted some type of a hidden “ - 1 ″ post that was nothing more than an attachment to this particular shell - script , executed with URL ‘/ blog/?poncheg ’…

It ’s not a matter of if you are going to get hacked , it ’s a matter of when .
So keep those web apps patched !
Open source software is , roughly speaking , software released under a license that permits its users to use , modify , and redistribute the software in almost any way they see fit .
This provides users of open source software a degree of liberty that is simply not found in proprietary alternatives .
While it ’s a bit silly and idealistic to think that you can use this freedom - based model to build an entire operating system , it happened .
One of the fascinating things about open source is not just how it ’s changed the software world , but how it ’s changed the not - software world as well .
An obvious example is Wikipedia , which has open sourced knowledge itself .
In recent pop cultural news , even Radiohead has embraced the open source ethos , making its latest album , In Rainbows , available for download at a price of …whatever you feel like paying .
And now personal development has become one of the latest geek magnets .
Smart people around the world are flocking online to learn , share , discuss , and create new software for our minds , providing a wealth of new lenses through which to experience reality and engage in the pursuit of happiness .
First , there was the emergence in the last decade or so of what might be called “ Open Source Seduction ” : a culture of guys using an organically grown knowledge base of concepts and techniques to help them find , meet , and connect with beautiful women .
Over the last three years there ’s been an explosion in the amount of freely available material online related to other aspects of personal growth like setting goals , time management , productivity , exploring the nature of reality , overcoming social hang - ups , making the transition to entrepreneurship , and just about everything in between .
This blogospheric Big Bang has expanded into a universe of relatively simple ideas that anyone can learn and apply to make their life as interesting as they want it to be .
Whether your background is in architecture , making music , graphic design , or flipping burgers , I think there ’s a lot of insight into personal growth to be gained from looking at the open source software model .
Not only is 30 sleeps ( both the blog and the web app ) built entirely from open source software and all the content freely available , but the ideas themselves are part of a new zeitgeist : Open Source Personal Development .
In this article I want to examine some of the core values and best practices of open source software and use that as a model for exploring and understanding the dynamics of personal growth .
Freedom Is a Priority
In the open source software world , freedom is the substrate of productivity , progress , and happiness .
The open source ecosystem is — with some notable exceptions , of course — mostly unpolluted by the haze of proprietary smog .
A large part of the value of free software stems directly from this transparency .
In personal growth terms , the kind of freedom we prioritize is authenticity .
The life hacking community offers value by helping us figure out what we really want out of life and how to get it .
Some areas , like spirituality , offer us models of reality to play with and hack on and thus alter the way we experience our lives .
Other areas , like productivity and time management , simply increase the velocity with which our intentions come to life .
Hand Out Commit Bits Liberally
A commit bit gives a developer permission to make changes to a project .
Audrey
Tang was famously liberal in handing out commit bits for the Pugs project , which has helped drive the development of Perl 6 .
Personal growth happens fastest when we are liberal in handing out commit bits to our own repository of beliefs , tools , and techniques .
First , that means absorbing ideas from a wide variety of sources , including spiritual teachers , philosophers , intellectuals , personal development experts , and others .
Second , the only way to know if something works for you is to fully commit to it , live and breath as though it were true , and measure your results .
If you only partially commit to trying something , whether it ’s a spiritual model of reality or a time management technique , your results can easily be diluted by doubt and indecision .
If you commit fully to something and do n’t get the results you were hoping for , you can always revert the change .
Create a Culture of Contribution
The most successful open source projects are the ones that make it mind - bogglingly easy to contribute .
The Perl programming language , for example , has a universal standard for releasing your code into the wild called CPAN .
This yellow brick road was a big reason for the explosive popularity of Perl over the past decade .
In terms of improving your own life , I interpret a culture of contribution as surrounding yourself only with people who make it easy for your and their ideas to flourish .
If you want to give up alcohol , for example , it ’s going to be extremely difficult if most of the people you hang out with love to go out drinking in clubs and bars on a regular basis .
I adhere to the idea that we are the average of those we associate with , and I believe it ’s worth choosing your friends wisely .
This also means having the courage to make adjustments to keep your social life aligned with your own direction .
Do n’t Commit Changes Without Tests
Many open source projects favour Test - Driven Development .
Simply put , there are three ways you can test a piece of software : you can ask a human to do it , you can ask a computer to do it , or you can do a bit of both .
Many developers prefer to write programs that test their email software , web browsers , chat clients and so on so that when they add new features to these programs , they can quickly tell if they broke something by running their tests .
If a test fails , they wo n’t commit their change until the problem is fixed .
The parallel to an automated test in personal growth is a habit .
Making changes that last usually means adding new habits , removing old ones , or modifying existing ones .
If you want to lose weight , for example , you might need to add habits like drinking eight glasses of water per day and not eating after 7:00 PM .
If your goal is to find a better job , you might adopt the habit of sending out five CVs every day until you find a gig you like .
Practicing your habits on a daily basis ( or whatever frequency they require ) ensures that the changes you make “ keep working ” over the long - term .
Scratch Your Own Itch
Why would somebody write a piece of software in their own free time ?
Because they needed it .
Most open source projects start by someone scratching their own itch , whether it ’s because they needed a text editor that doubles as an operating system or because they wanted a web framework that optimizes for happiness .
Personal growth is all about scratching your own itch .
It ’s about breaking free from social conditioning and treating life like an amusement park of experiences .
It means living your life for your own benefit because that ’s ultimately the best way to help others .
The open source world is built almost entirely out of this brand of enlightened self - interest .
Patches Welcome
There ’s a saying in the open source world : “ Patches welcome ! ”
It ’s usually issued to those who complain about their software , even dish out harsh criticism to the developers , but do n’t offer a patch to fix the problem .
Making big strides in your life starts with taking full responsibility for every aspect of your world .
Complaining about things just creates a productivity vacuum .
When you catch yourself expressing anger , frustration , or resentment about your job , your relationship , your friends , your finances , or even global politics , realize that it ’s up to you to author the change .
Of course , sometimes there are just so many things to complain about that you could n’t possibly address all of them .
For the things you ’re unhappy with but that are n’t important enough to you to fix , accept them fully as they are .
Complaining about issues for which you choose to take no action only magnifies the negative energy in both your life and the lives of those around you .
Meritocracy
One of the great things about open source software is the meritocracy surrounding contributions .
Even the most high - profile projects will accept your changes if your work fixes a bug or does something else useful .
You do n’t have to rely on a great reputation , you just have to do good work .
( Of course , there are also some projects that drown in a sea of infighting and politics , but that ’s another story … :)
This spirit of meritocracy is particularly useful to personal growth junkies .
Any large and diverse industry is full of crappy , useless , overpriced products , and the personal development market is no exception .
There ’s plenty of snake oil out there , but do n’t let that blind you to the wealth of freely available information offered by people who have a broad range of experience under their belt , and are sharing what they ’ve learned in the hopes that others may benefit .
For example , I can vouch for everything I write because I write about what works for me in meeting women , figuring out what I want to do in life , setting goals , stimulating creativity and other areas .
But I ca n’t guarantee that it ’ll all work for you .
It ’s up to you to decide if I deserve a “ commit bit ” .
It all comes down to trial and error .
Output is God .
Release Early , Release Often
“ Release early , release often ” is the open source motto for giving birth to a new idea .
The point is to get your work out there as quickly as possible even if it ’s a little rough around the edges — even if it ’s downright bad .
This gives other hackers a chance to pick up where you left off and add missing features themselves .
Open Source Personal Development is all about inch by inch progress .
Returning to the weight loss example , even if all you managed to do this week was drink eight glasses of water every day but otherwise ate the same , that ’s much better than succumbing to the fear of failure and not starting at all .
30 sleeps itself is an exercise in releasing early and often .
The design of both the blog and the web app could be greatly improved , and I know I have a lot to learn about blog marketing , but I did n’t want to wait for perfection to make this thing real .
If there ’s something you want to change about your life , make it real in some way right now .
Even the smallest actions dwarf the biggest thoughts .
Respond to Bug Reports in a Timely Fashion
The hallmark of a good software maintainer is that they respond to your bug reports in a timely fashion , even if only to say that they ’re aware of the problem but do n’t have time to fix it right now .
This is an important lesson for personal growth .
Your emotions are your personal bug tracking system .
When something ’s wrong in your life , your feelings will let you know .
Being a good self - maintainer requires observing what ’s going on inside you and responding quickly to bugs that appear on your emotional radar .
Most of Your Time Is Spent in Maintenance Mode
Software geeks love features .
We love coming up with cool new ideas , discussing them in great detail with the development team , hacking on them …and then abandoning them a week later when we realize the idea was much harder to implement than it seemed .
While this phenomenon is n’t specific to open source software , I do think it ’s another useful comparison to draw between software development and personal development .
Most of the goals you pursue in life will involve a “ maintenance mode ” that extends way beyond your initial enthusiasm , so choose your passions wisely .
Expose yourself to a wide variety of activities and experiences and see which ones you really enjoy .
Like software , personal growth is never complete .
It ’s mostly a matter of adding new features to your life while keeping the “ bug count ” under control .
The open source model has been so successful in software development circles that non-computer geeks have taken note , including those interested personal growth .
Open Source Personal Development applies the spirit of open source software to the pursuit of happiness .
It favours the open exchange of ideas for the benefit of all , and a culture of contribution where meritocracy decides which ideas stay and which get thrown out .
With individual power comes the individual responsibility of replacing thoughts with actions , complaints with solutions , and debating over ideals with a process of trial and error that lets the results speak for themselves .
In his final State of the Union address , President George W. Bush devoted several lines to science and technology topics .
He called for research and funding to reduce oil dependency and reverse the growth of greenhouse gases .
" To keep America competitive into the future , we must trust in the skill of our scientists and engineers and empower them to pursue the breakthroughs of tomorrow , " Bush said .

But several scientists around the country are n't buying what they see as rhetoric not backed by funding .
And they are frustrated by what they view as the White House 's morality - based politics that they say ignores scientific evidence , distorts facts and leads to outright censorship of reports and scientists .
The White House responded to the criticisms point - by - point .
In email interviews this week with 21 researchers in various fields of study , LiveScience and SPACE.com found widespread criticism for Bush 's " retardation of research , " as one scientist put it , that threatens to knock the country out of its global leadership role in science and technology .
" Science has been seriously undermined by the censorship and alteration of testimony and news releases , " said Kevin Trenberth , a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research .
" Science and facts are not a factor in decisions , and ideology dominates . "
( A Democratic congressional report in December stated : " The Bush administration has engaged in a systematic effort to manipulate climate change science and mislead policymakers and the public about the dangers of global warming . " )
Benny Peiser , a social anthropologist at John Moores University in the UK , holds a more favorable view of the president .
" Bush has been as supportive and as reluctant as one would expect from a very conservative president , " Peiser said .
And Peiser disagreed with the perception that America 's heydays are over .
" Scientific research and exploration have continued to advance during Bush 's presidency , " Peiser said .
" The United States remains the top country in the world on every aspect of science and research and it is still the most popular destination for international scientists looking for a better career and future . "
Broad criticisms
Trenberth 's criticisms , however , were echoed by several researchers .
" Science establishes facts but facts can unmask bad policy , " said Ken Caldeira , a climate and ecology researcher at Stanford University .
" Thus good science has been seen as a threat by the Bush administration . "
Alan W. Harris , senior research scientist at the Space Science Institute at La Canada , Calif. , accused the White House of " systematic suppression of scientific evidence that does not support administration plans . "
Responding to the criticisms , Kristin Scuderi , Director of Communications and Public Affairs at the White House Office of Science & Technology Policy , said thousands of scientists routinely conduct their business without controversy or complaint .
" There have been rare instances of inappropriate direction by individuals at the agency level , but these have been dealt with by the agency in each case , " Scuderi said .
" It is administration policy to rely on science , and such instances reflect errors in judgment made by individuals within agencies . "
Harris has little faith that Bush 's speech will lead to any increased funding for basic research .
" Bush has proposed in his budgets to ' double the support for research , ' but this has translated into boosting budgets for research related to defense and security far more than for truly ' basic ' research , " he said .
Other scientists cautioned about a decline in U.S. science leadership that predates Bush and has worsened under him .
For example , the leadership role in particle physics , the field in which giant accelerators conjure up conditions that prevailed just after the Big Bang , has waned over the past decades , said Pran Nath , particle physicist at Northeastern University in Boston .
" The Bush administration was unable to arrest this decline , leaving Europe and Japan to assume leadership role in this area . "
" We are falling behind the rest of the world in science because we are not making a budgetary commitment to it , " said Michael Mann , a climate scientist at Penn State .
Hot -button issues
On specific hot - button issues , several researchers voiced similar criticisms .
Joshua Hart , a psychologist at Union College in New York , summarized the frustrations of many researchers .
" The administration contributed egregiously to the false impression ( among the public ) of a scientific ' debate ' about the existence and causes of global warming , " Hart said .
He also called " the retardation of research involving embryonic stem cells " one of the worst things that has happened during this administration , along with " the rolling back of funding of the social sciences . "
Scuderi , the White House spokeswoman , disagreed .
" Since 2001 the administration has acknowledged the existence of global warming and the fact that human activities have contributed to it , " Scuderi told LiveScience today .
" It only takes a quick look at NASA or NOAA websites , for example to see that they reflect the actual state of the science of global warming .
Prior to 2007 the basis for administration climate science policy was a report from the National Academy of Sciences .
After 2007 the basis for climate policy has been the IPCC reports , " referring to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
White House Office of Science & Technology Policy led the U.S. delegation to the IPCC , Scuderi said , " and has supported the IPCC process and endorsed its outcomes . "
Hart also cited " the failure to adequately understand – and consequently convey to the public – the fact that the theory of intelligent design is consensually regarded , in the scientific community , as absolute horse **** unworthy of serious consideration … thereby propagating , again , the illusion that there is substantive scientific debate on the topic ( as opposed to the matter being settled , which it is , and unfit for inclusion in our nation ’s science classes ) . "
" Intelligent Design is not regarded as a scientific topic , " Scuderi countered .
" The President 's Science Advisor has been very clear on this point .
The notion that the administration ' propagates ' anything about intelligent design is absurd . "
" A president who does not accept evolution is clearly someone who cannot change their mind in face of overwhelming factual evidence , " said Sean Carroll , a professor of molecular biology and genetics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison .
One of the best things that happened to science under Bush is " the continued growth of genome sciences , for which the administration deserves no credit , other than staying out of the way , " Carroll said .
But Ardeshir B. Damania , a genetic resources analyst at the University of California , Davis , gave the administration high marks for its support of science and technology research .
" In the war on terror the Bush administration has taken action to utilize and fund scientific research to keep the country safe , " Damania said .
He also credited Bush with supporting stem cell research that " allows scientists to do their research without compromising human life . "
In his speech , Bush called the recent discovery of a way to reprogram adult skin cells to act like embryonic stem cells a " landmark achievement . "
But other scientists worry that while the method does not require destruction of discarded human embryos , it also remains an unproven technology and could be used to further thwart funding for true embryonic stem cell research .
Not just Bush
Suppressing science to suit policy is nothing new , explains Roger Launius , a former NASA historian and chairman of the Division of Space History at the Smithsonian Institution 's National Air and Space Museum in Washington , DC .
Since the 1970s , Launius said , " some in industry and on the religious right have disliked the use of scientific studies by government officials as justification for actions that they viewed as counterproductive to their best interests . "
A broad and concerted effort to question scientific findings has affected everything from regulations on harmful chemicals and the control of tobacco to the energy issue , climate change , evolution , embryonic stem cell research , sex education and health care , he said .
" The Bush administration has been at the forefront of this effort in the first part of the 21st century , " Launius said .
" It represents a coordinated and frightening attack on the scientific consensus . "
Launius said this administration " is probably not the worst ever when it comes to a commitment to science and technology , but it probably comes close . "
One researcher who wished not to be named said " the further polarization and politicization of science " that has occurred under Bush " has been an outgrowth of partisanship that began during the Clinton administration . "
Out there
The president got few high marks from the space - exploration community , either , his pledge in 2004 to return humans to the moon by 2020 seen as withering from lack of active support by the administration .
" NASA was given a vision , but neither the budget nor the political support to make it happen , " said Joan Johnson - Freese , chair of the Department of National Security Studies at the Naval War College in Newport , R.I . " That has to be addressed by the next administration . "
Alan P. Boss , a planet - formation theorist at the Carnegie Institution of Washington , said Bush is supportive of scientific research and exploration superficially , but not in practice .
" Most of the major science priorities in the vision , such as the Mars Sample Return mission and imaging extrasolar Earths , have been drastically reduced , delayed , or eliminated because of the shortage of funds to accomplish all of the worthy tasks in the vision , " Boss said .
" The Bush administration has been supportive of the American Competitiveness Initiative , " said Craig Wheeler , president of the American Astronomical Society .
" That is good , but that support has not been translated into action and budgets . "
The ACI would spend tens of billions of dollars over 10 years on research and development , education , and to encourage entrepreneurship .
Bush established it two years ago .
" For the past two years the president has requested large increases in basic research funding in the physical sciences , " Scuderi said .
" Congress has expressed support for the ACI , but under - funded it by half in the first year and provided very little funding for it in the second year . "
Wheeler said something had to be done about the lack of vision for NASA after the Columbia tragedy .
" The problem is that the administration did not maintain focus on that issue and the result is that NASA has been tasked with far too much with insufficient budget . "
Scuderi said one of the vision 's features " is that space exploration is ' a journey , not a race ' and that it be accomplished ' step by step ' in a sustainable way based on available budgets .
NASA 's budget is substantial , both for space science and for space exploration ; its budget has grown steadily on an annual basis since the president announced the Vision for Space Exploration in 2004 , " she said .
" Currently NASA must fund both the vision and the shuttle program , " Scuderi said .
" And with the retirement of the Shuttle in 2010 — a pivotal element of the vision — NASA 's budget will have significantly more resources available to accomplish the first lunar mission . "
Others researchers , however , see the vision for NASA fading at a time when private enterprise aims high .
The vision has " effectively gutted existing programs in favor of much administrative restructuring that seems likely to be undone with a new administration next year , " said Margaret C. Turnbull , an astrobiologist at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore .
" Therefore I do n't expect the vision to develop fully , and meanwhile the other big programs have been delayed or cancelled .
Not good .
These are uncertain times for space science , and our best hopes for near - term progress may be in privately funded initiatives , like the X - prizes . "
Peiser , the social anthropologist , monitors climate change issues and various NASA projects .
He credited the current administration with having " a growing recognition of public / private partnerships and private enterprise in space exploration . "
The next president
Researchers are hoping for major policy shifts with the next president .
" The coming administration must articulate a broad vision on science in the United States , " said Pran Nath , the particle physicist .
" The science policy must be long - range .
It is not possible to undertake broad initiatives in science on four - year election cycles . "
" The next president also has to listen carefully to his or her top science advisors , allowing hard science , and not politics , to inform policy , " said Michael Mann , the climate scientist .
Several researchers compared the soaring costs of defense spending with the flat or sinking budgets for science , basic technology research and educational initiatives to spur competitiveness .
Still , there is hope .
" Our computers may be made in China , but most computers and software programs are designed in the U.S. , " said Daniel Kruger of the University of Michigan 's School of Public Health .
" We have to be careful not to rest on our laurels though , lest we slip into a predominantly service economy . "
Kruger added : " If we devoted just 10 percent of what it costs to stay in Iraq to improving the USA 's educational infrastructure , I think we would rise substantially in those international rankings of educational achievement . "
" With luck , the contrast between the lack of leadership in the U.S. and the strong focused programs in Europe and Asia will put the U.S. back in the position where someone here has to think about what they need to do to stay competitive , " said Paul Calvert , a materials scientist at the University of Massachusetts , Dartmouth .
Caldeira , the Stanford researcher said he " would like to see an administration that is willing to say :
The world is round , life evolved on Earth over billions of years , humans are causing our climate to change , we or our children will need to pay later for what we buy on credit today , and consumption on this planet cannot grow exponentially forever without running into environmental constraints . "

One of the first large cargo ships in 100 years to cross the Atlantic with the help of the wind will set off from European shores this month on a voyage which is due to make maritime history .
When the 10,000 - tonne Beluga Skysail is well clear of the land , it will launch a giant kite , which wind tunnel tests and sea trials suggest will tug it along and save 10 - 15 % of the heavy fuel oil it would normally burn .
If the journey from Bremen in Germany to Venezuela and back proves successful , it could become common to see some of the largest ships in the world towed by kites the size of football fields .
" This is a serious attempt to reduce bunker [ fuel ] costs and polluting emissions .
The kite will be used whenever it is possible on the voyage , and we are convinced it will revolutionise cargo shipping .
We would consider fitting them to all our ships , " said Christine Bornkessel , a spokeswoman for the Bremen - based Beluga shipping line , which has 52 merchant vessels .
The ship 's maiden voyage will use a 160 sq metre kite which is expected to cut fuel consumption by 10 - 15 % , but in time it will be fitted with much larger kites , possibly saving 30 - 35 % on fuel , she said .
The largest kites could be as big as 5,000 sq metres and theoretically be capable of assisting giant container ships .
Shipping is now a booming global industry , with most manufacturing being concentrated thousands of miles from consumer centres in Europe and the US .
Nearly 100,000 cargo ships transport 95 % of world trade by sea , and the world shipping industry is expanding rapidly as countries such as India and China become major players in the global economy .
But the cost of shipping or " bunker " fuel has nearly doubled in the past two years , forcing the industry to consider alternatives .
At the same time , concerns have grown about climate change and air pollution from shipping .
It is estimated that commercial shipping , which traditionally uses the most polluting fuel , uses nearly 2bn barrels of oil a year and emits as much as 800 m tonnes of CO2 , or 4 % of the world 's man-made emissions .
Shipping also pollutes the atmosphere with more sulphur dioxide than all the world 's cars and lorries .
The notoriously conservative industry has so far failed to harness renewable energy , either because conventional fuel has been cheap , or because modern cargoes , mostly carried in containers , need to remain stable on deck or in holds .
Sails or spinnakers have been proposed for merchant ships , but these can take up storage space and cause vessels to heel .
The kite system , which has been developed over 10 years with help from the German government , uses an automatic pilot , is controlled by computers and runs on a metal track around the ship .
This allows the " sail " to move around to collect wind and also prevent tilting .
The kite is not designed to replace engines , however .
There are still questions about how the system behaves in high winds and what would happen if the kite landed in the sea .
According to the company , orders have been placed with trawlers and a super - yacht .
The system could be applied to nearly two out of three boats registered at Lloyd 's register of shipping in London .
· This article was amended on Monday January 7 2008 .
In the article above we said that sails or spinnakers had been proposed for merchant ships but that these can cause vessels to keel .
We meant heel ( lean over ) .
This has been corrected .
JOURNALISM can be a risky profession .
In 2007 at least 86 journalists were killed and over 900 were slung in jail , according to Reporters Sans Frontières , a campaign group .
Iraq is the most dangerous place for the press .
Some 47 reporters lost their lives there and kidnapping was a daily threat last year .
Pakistan arrested nearly 200 media workers , while China and Cuba kept most journalists in prison .

If FOXNews has a debate , you know we 're going get Frankie " The Hair " Luntz and his focus groups telling us exactly what FOX News wants you to believe .
Kind of like how Luntz 's coining of " The Clean Skies Initiative " did n't actually contribute to clean air but added more pollution to the environment .
So in FOX / Luntz world , the clear winner at the debate was Mitt Romney , who according to these " unaffiliated Republican voters , " stands the best chance of beating Barack Obama , who has suddenly unseated Hillary Clinton as the presumptive Democratic candidate .
Why , you ask ?
" Because he has presence " and " looks good on TV . "
And yet Luntz tries to ask you not to believe your lying ears and believe that these voters are more issue - oriented and less faith - based than their Iowan counterparts .
Maybe it 's just me , but it sounds like a huge leap of faith that someone will win elections and / or be a good President ( I 'm not convinced that they thought that far ahead ) because he looks good on TV .
UPDATE : FDL has video of Paulistas confronting Frankie on his skewing of the Fox focus group .
( Originally published in 2007 )
Somebody ( Tim Ferris ?
Gandhi ? Princess Di? ) once said that if you ’re not offending anybody , you ’re doing it wrong .
You ’ll be happy to know , I ’m clearly doing it right .
When I clicked “ Publish ” on one particular post , I can honestly say I did n’t know people would be so bothered .
I had no less than five snarky emails in my inbox before the damn post hit people 's feed readers .
( Remember those ?
I 'm dating myself . )
Seriously , people were mad .
Really mad .
People were mad at my word use , people were mad that I called them cocky , people did not dig it .
( For those of you who did like it and emailed , thank you .
That was very nice of you . )
Anyway , somebody else ( Chuck Norris ?
Paris Hilton ?
The Will It Blend guy ? ) said the following , and I think you ’ll agree that it deserves some funky red type .
The absence of fear is not courage .
The absence of fear is mental illness .
When I got those emails , I was not exactly delighted .
( OK , the exhibitionist part of me was a little bit delighted . )
Am I afraid that no - one will come to my blog ?
That people will stop coming ?
That I wo n’t meet the goals I ’ve stated quite publicly to people I do n’t like and who will gleefully revel in my failure ?
Of course I am .
But I ca n’t let that water me down .
I ca n’t let that fear dominate my actions .
I ca n’t let myself become one of those writers who just rehashes everybody else ’s crap .
I have to hang out , being afraid , and going about my business anyway .
I ’d love to make this into a handy bulleted list with lots of outgoing link love .
Then everyone could “ like ” it and tweet it and I could be the linkbait queen of the world .
Sadly , I can’t .
I can tell you what I know about fear , though .
It sucks .
A lot .
It can paralyze you and sicken you and leave you cold and lonely .
I got pregnant at 17 with a man who was n’t exactly my soul mate .
I dropped out of college and people told me I would never make anything of myself .
I have been on welfare .
And I run my own business .
This is scary shit , people .
So here ’s my not - very - linear advice on fear .
First , acknowledge it .
Get to know it .
The worst thing to do with fear is pretend it ’s not there .
You ’re not fooling anyone , least of all fear itself , and by denying its existence you just look like an idiot .
Get to the root of your fear .
Analyze where it comes from .
Find out what you ’re really afraid of .
If you think you ’re afraid your business will fail , you ’re not .
You might be afraid of poverty , of humiliation , of never finding happiness , but you ’re not afraid your business will fail .
Figure out what the problem really is and stop pretending the Big White Elephant of Fear has n’t taken up residence in the corner of your home office .
For myself , I used to be almost constantly afraid .
It ’s gotten better , but here are some things that are still on the list :
I ’m afraid if I move to the country , I will become isolated .
I ’m afraid that if I ’m unhappy there , that will mean I ’m vacuous and shallow .
I ’m afraid that if we move to the city , I will be happy and Jamie will not .
I ’m afraid I wo n’t be able to enjoy it because of the guilt .
I ’m afraid of finding out five years from now that we should have had more kids .
I ’m much more afraid of actually having more kids .
I ’m afraid that now that I ’m living my dream , I will be struck by a fatal illness and not live to enjoy it .
( The dream , not the fatal illness . )
I ’m afraid that if I tell anyone that fear , then I will jinx myself and the fear will come true .
I ’m afraid that all of my gigs will fall through at the same time and I will have to go back to working for the man .
I ’m afraid people will decide that given my background ( see : pregnant teenager , college dropout ) I have no business calling myself an authority on anything .
I ’m afraid my oldest son will stay a Mormon , serve a mission , and be brainwashed to hate me .
I 'm afraid if I rest , I will fail .
Guess what , folks .
Fear is normal .
As a bloggers , artists , writers , business owners , we are afraid .
Trying to avoid fear , circumvent fear , or remove fear is an act of futility .
Fear will not go away .
Live with fear , do your thing anyway .

Boulder ’s elected leaders are expected to decide next week whether to draft and vote on a resolution calling for the impeachment of President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney .
For the past few weeks , activists have been showing up at Boulder City Council meetings , carrying signs , handing out “ impeach ” pins and asking City Council members to take up such a resolution .
Similar measures have passed in cities across the country , including Detroit and Telluride .
Liz Robinson , one of the organizers of the effort , said people hoping to see impeachment proceedings have given congressional Democrats — who won a majority in the fall of 2006 — plenty of time to act .
But since they have n’t , she said , locally elected officials should take up the slack .
“ Whether or not it ’s the city ’s business directly , like potholes , I feel this affects all of us , ” she said .
“ We ’re the ones who are paying the taxes to support this administration ’s depredations , especially the war . ”
Impeachment proceedings would be worth doing even if they only put the last few months of Bush ’s eight years in office at risk , Robinson said .
“ We need to send a message that this all matters to us , whether it ’s last - minute or not , ” she said .
The group appears to have some support among the City Council , although it ’s not clear if it has the five votes it would take to get a resolution drafted and subsequently debated .
City Councilman Macon
Cowles wrote in a memo to his colleagues that he ’ll likely make a motion at the Feb. 19 meeting asking that a resolution be drafted .
“ I believe that these citizens deserve a hearing , ” Cowles wrote to the council .
It would n’t be the first time the City Council has weighed in on matters far outside the city ’s physical boundaries .
In 2006 , the council approved a resolution calling for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq , and in 2003 , the council passed a resolution opposing the invasion .
Deputy Mayor Crystal Gray , who helped draft the 2006 resolution , said Boulder has a tradition of debating big - picture issues .
“ I ’m a believer that the council should be responsive at the level of local government to issues that the residents raise , just like the Iraq war resolution , ” she said .
But City Councilman Ken Wilson said he ’s not on board .
During a recent retreat , the City Council agreed to priorities ranging from fixing structural problems in the budget to doing better land - use planning .
That does n’t leave much time for issues over which the city does n’t have direct jurisdiction , he said .
“ We did not identify national issues as a priority for work by council and staff .
We are already seeing scheduling problems trying to address our priorities and the immediate needs of the city , ”

They say that swearing is the tool of the unintelligent , but swearing in an alien language ?
That has to make you cool , especially since it'll perplex the hell out of most people .
If you want to win that hard - to - get geek street cred , we 've got just the thing : A list of the best scifi cusses in the frakkin galaxy .
Check it out , you floops .
Advertisement
Frak , Battlestar Galactica :
Whether you spell it frack or frak , it 's currently the most used replacement for the f-bomb , courtesy of the original BSG show .
That 's right , Ronald D. Moore did n't invent this sucker , although he sure uses it a lot more than they did back in the 1980s .
Plus it rolls off the tongue nicely .
Here 's a video education on all the uses it has .
Frell , Farscape : Frell was Farscape 's own version of everyone 's favorite f-word , and used extensively on the show after appearing in the first season .
" Frell Me Dead " has become a favorite phrase among fans of the show , appearing on shirts and wristbands , and they even use the term " frellwit " on the show .
Pretty frelling cool .
Gorram , Firefly : Firefly had a whole new language of swears due to the fact that Joss Whedon assumed that in the future Chinese and English would meld together , and that 's led to some colorful swears for the show , like " Ching - wah tsao duh liou mahng " translated as " frog - humpin ' bastard . "
However , gorram strands out as a simple perversion of goddamn , and probably made the most appearances on the show .
Shazbot , Mork & Mindy :
While it never quite caught on in pop culture , Mork 's substitute for shit still exists in the Tribes video games .
Robin Williams probably made this word up himself , and it has the bonus of sounding like something a robot might do on your carpet .
Poodoo , Star Wars : George Lucas ' prequels not only gave us bad acting , but it included fart jokes and this word for Bantha shit in Episode I .
Which helps give you a single word to sum up the prequels with .
Smeg , Red Dwarf : Lister 's favorite swear word from this trapped in space show obviously seems derived from smegma ( wiki it
Farathoom , Do n't Bite The Sun : Tanith Lee 's 1976 novel was full of hedonistic pleasure domes , mutable appearances and genders , and new swear words .
Farathoom was probably the strongest , meaning " bloody fucking hell , " although " floop " meant " cunt . "
We 're not sure which one is cooler .
Shock , Spiderman 2099 : Marvel Comics went on a tear in the 1990s , offering up versions of their classic characters in the year 2099 .
My favorite was Miguel O'Hara as the semi-mutated version of spiderman , who frequently would yell " What the shock ? ! " when he would be attacked by Venom 2099 .
" I seem to be having tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle " , The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy : Arthur Dent utters this phrase , just as a freak wormhole opens up in the space - time continuum , and it ends up triggering a massive interstellar war because in the Vl'hurg tongue this was the most dreadful insult imaginable .
Just to encourage you to watch your language out there .
Smurf , The Smurfs :
It just occurred to me that since Gargamel created Smurfette in his home laboratory , she 's got herself a quasi - spot in scifi .
Couple that with the fact that the Smurfs use " smurf " as a verb , noun , adjective , and everything else under the sun , and probably more than one Smurf has banged his thumb with a hammer and yelled out " SMURF ! "
Or if Jokey Smurf leaves an exploding box in your house , you 'd probably tell him to Smurf Off .

Flattery will get you everywhere .
Giving praise is often neglected .
When was the last time you took the time to call someone to thank them about a service they performed for you ?
Or , in this generation , emailed a nice testimonial ?
It helps negotiate : Flattery is infantry on the march for negotiation .
Actually it is the best , and oldest , trick in the book to bag the best deals while shopping .
It breaks the ice : Sometimes , a little flattery goes a long way in getting to know new people .
Surprising how much nicer people can get when their ego is pampered .
It lifts spirits :
When a friend has a bad hair day or is feeling down , a bit of flattery does the trick .
Instantly , it makes him / her feel better .
The queue moves :
In a supermarket on a Friday evening , a little flattery can help you jump the queue and stave off varicose veins .
Makes light of excess baggage : A minor compliment accompanied with a smile could help you save some precious dollars at the airport !
Gets help when the tyre goes flat : A damsel in distress plus a little flattery .
Result ?
A good samaritan to help and the happy prospect of keeping freshly manicured nails in tip top condition .
Read ( Do n’t miss the last one )
Reduces muscle strain at the baggage claim :
You can get help for lifting off your heavy suitcases with the aid of flattery , especially if you ’re not travelling light .
Peace and happiness with in - laws :
Pay your mother - in - law that all - important compliment on her culinary skills and watch those brownie points jump right off the scale .
Lunch break remains yummy :
When you visit any public office for a minor task during your lunch break , a smile and some sweetness can help you get back to work on time .
Spouse wows !
Flattery at full throttle with your spouse is pure investment .
Just guard from going OTT ( over the top ) .

CNN shows smuggled footage of bloody Myanmar crackdown David Edwards and Muriel Kane

This CNN has obtained exclusive footage smuggled out of Myanmar ( formerly Burma ) which provides the first solid proof of rumored atrocities against those protesting against the military dictatorship .
The footage shows blood on the streets , protesters being beaten by soldiers , a demonstration being dispersed , and men said to be plainclothes intelligence offices loading those arrested onto trucks .
CNN is also reporting that by now most signs of the crackdown have been eliminated , with the blood being washed away and the protesters arrested or simply disappeared .
Even worse , reports are trickling out that Buddhist monks have " all but disappeared " in parts of the capital city , and there are rumors of massacres .
An international aid worker who just left Burma told CNN of seeing bodies left lying in the street as a deliberate message to the crowd .
" To see Burmese people display any kind of anger was incredible to me , " she said .
" These are people who are peaceful , gentle , turn - the - other - cheek people .
...
It 's difficult for a Westerner to grasp how significant that is .
...
This is huge . "
The anonymous worker stated that she saw no weapons or violent behavior of any kind among the protesters .
She believes that outrage at what has been done to the monks " will spur the people on to larger demonstrations , " but added that the West also needs to start using whatever leverage it has against the dictatorship .
The following video is from CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 , broadcast on October 2 , 2007 .

The Best Undiscovered Nintendo NES Games
Usually , when you get a new - to - you console or you boot up an emulator for the first time ( try NesterDC , for instance ) , you can usually find or remember the major games to check out .
But what happens when you need something different to play ?
This is where the “ Hidden Gems ” come in .

Featured Game : Chip and Dale Rescue Rangers
“ Games based on children ’s cartoon shows have n’t always sucked .
Back in the late 80’s and early 90’s , Capcom produced a great deal of entertaining games with licensed Disney themes for the Nintendo Entertainment System .
Many of them were quite challenging , but Chip and Dale Rescue Rangers is one of the titles that I feel had the best balance of fun and challenge in a platformer .
While it ’s not a big challenge if you are a platformer junkie , it is still fun and is a great game for mid-range players …
The most important feature to me is the 2 - player simultaneous gameplay .
In fact , the game is n’t terribly exciting when you play it by yourself .
However , you have a buddy team up with you , the game can be a blast .
Not only are you able to pick up and throw objects , but you can also pick up and throw your partner if you so choose — and that is when much of the hilarity ensues .
Aside from hijinks that tossing your partner can bring , picking them up and carrying them can be part of your strategy — which may be helpful at times if your partner is a newbie .
Bottom line is that teamwork can be both fun and strategic . ”

Featured Game : Clash at Demonhead
“ You are Bang , a secret agent of some kind ( apparently , details about your history & mission have been cut from the English translation of this game .. any Japanese speakers want to write me and fill in the blanks ? ) .
While relaxing on the beach with your girlfriend Mary , word comes from HQ that Professor Plum has been kidnapped and is being forced to make a doomsday bomb !
As if that ’s not bad enough , there ’s also a very powerful demon preparing to fill and / or end the world with his ( her ? ) nasty eggs .
The demon is in no way related to the doomsday plot , but you ’ll end up resolving both problems and , as a result , saving the world from TWO separate catastrophes .
You ’ll also learn several valuable life lessons and even the secret history of mankind ….
It ’s hard for words to do justice to Clash at Demonhead .
The dialog is great , and the story is convoluted and entertaining .
Best of all , the game has STYLE – genuinely absurd videogames are far and few between , and none are as dramatic and action packed as Clash At Demonhead . ”

Featured Game : Nightshade
“ When it comes to obscure , seldom - seen NES games , I doubt one could find many equalling Nightshade in terms of the “ what ’s this now ? ” factor … .
The game ’s bizarre storyline ( told with fabulously hyperbolic narration ) involves a fledgling super - hero , who , decked out in a trenchcoat and fedora , sets out to free the noirish Metro City from the clutches of the evil Sutekh , Egyptian
super - villian extraordinaire .
You see , Sutekh has recently slain the vaguely ‘ Noid-ish ( as in the Domino ’s pizza mascot , star of his own fairly wretched NES game ) formerly reigning superhero of the city , Vortex .
You , as Nightshade , must wander the city ’s streets , searching for clues , defeating villains , and attempting to gain favor with the denizens of Metro City .
As the game opens ( after a brief expository sequence ) you have just been tied to a chair by Sutekh , who has left a bomb waiting to blow you to smithereens .
Utilizing a ( surprisingly well - executed ) graphic - adventure format , the game allows to to perform the standard “ use/move/talk/fight/etc. ” actions , yet the interface is far , far less clumsy than in Deja Vu .
Though a main problem with computer - to - NES game ports such as the latter involves lacking control , Nightshade is much simpler to get the hang of .
You control Nightshade with the control pad ( as opposed to pointing and clicking with a cursor like Maniac Mansion ) , and press
the Select button will bring up a command menu .
Here you can examine , pick up , use , or do of the things any traditional adventure game hero can do . ”

Featured Game : Street Fighter 2010
“ First up is a game I personally believe gets an unfair rep , Street Fighter 2010 for the NES .
Now , I ’ll be honest , it ’s quite possibly the worst “ Street Fighter ” game ever made ( perhaps second to Street Fighter the Movie the Game ) , but if you completely ignore the title , this is one of the better games to come out during the end of the original Nintendo ’s lifespan .
Gameplay - wise , this is a platformer , though extensive levels filled with cannon - fodder bad guys is cut back in exchange for one boss battle after another , to give it the appearance of a fighting game .
However , as you can probably guess , there is no two - player option .
But really , Street Fighter 2010 pretty much just cuts out all the crap and gives us what we play these games for directly , the boss battles .
Some of the bosses are more fun than others .
You ’ve got a robot that swarms you with flying killer drones , a guy in a bad super hero costume that causes earthquakes , a big rock guy who can swing from the ceiling , an evil plant , and my personal favorite , an electric - wielding monster whom you fight in a level filled with active dynamos .
The environments in which you fight the bosses varies .
Some are merely empty rooms with a handful of platforms for you to dodge around on , while others are extensive vertical mazes with traps and power - ups hidden to make things extra interesting . ”

Featured Game : The Guardian Legend
“ Guardian Legend is a unique game in which you play as a female character that can transform into a spaceship as she battles to save earth from the evil forces of the planet Naju .
The basic gameplay can sort of be described as Zelda meets Blaster Master meets Zanac .
Guardian Legend ’s gameplay is divided into both an adventure mode and shooting stages , which sets it apart from almost any other game I ’ve played .
The adventure mode uses a grid - based system ( a la Legend of Zelda ) in which you walk around freely as the Guardian ’s human form .
Although these segments are very easy , I liked exploring them , and I ’m glad the areas were n’t overly large and confusing .
When I first beat the main adventure mode of The Guardian Legend , I came away from it with basically the same impression that I had of Section - Z .
This was a good game to play for the experience , but it did n’t really blow me away .
But upon completing the second quest , and after replaying it several times , I realized that Guardian Legend does have some qualities that make it superior .
The adventure mode is fun to replay , and it ’s nice that the programmers went the extra mile by giving you the all - shooter mode , too .
This gives the game decent replay value , and is enough to etch it more solidly in my mind as a game that deserves recognition . ”

Featured Game : Crystalis
“ SNK ’s action RPG classic , Crystalis , basically takes everything that made the original Legend of Zelda for the NES so good , and makes it exponentially better .
The original Zelda was pretty much the template for the genre , so one would expect the formula to be improved as more and more Action RPGs graced the big grey box .
Well , Zelda II : the Adventure of Link was a big let - down to many a Zelda - fan , if mostly due to the side - scrolling point of view .
Crystalis is everything the Zelda sequel should ’ve been , and my personal favorite Action RPG made for the NES .
Basically , if you ’re looking for old fashioned , historically significant , GOOD Action RPG , then Crystalis should be number 1 on your list .
It was re-released for the Gameboy Color , though I ’ve heard many a complaint about the quality of the port .
Having not played that version , myself , I ’ll have to rely on someone else to fill in that gap .
Never - the - less , you can find the NES cartridge on Ebay , used , for a relatively cheap price , or some of you unscrupulous net - savvy so - and - sos can find ‘ another means ’ to play the game .
OR , you can just wait for the Wii to make it downloadable .
Either way , there are PLENTY of ways for you to play this game .
And you really should , too .
Every time Crystalis goes un-played , Baby Mario cries . ”

“ [ Wario ’s Woods is ] a fantastic puzzler that could easily trump some current generation games .
The use of Mario characters is just a ruse , as the true value of this title lies in the frenzied action that takes place around you : as the pieces fall , you attempt to match up 3 of a kind or more .
It ’s not a speed test though , as the pace of the game is slow ; the test comes from the quality of your choices .
You can easily destroy one or two monsters at once , but what about five or six ?
This is where the gameplay becomes more complex …
In the grand scope of things , Wario ’s Woods is a fun game .
It offers up some challenging puzzles and can keep even the shortest of attention spans .
In contrast , the game is simplistic in look and sound ; depending on the person it may add to nostalgia , or hinder enjoyment .
For a gamer looking for a classic puzzler on the Virtual Console the question remains as to whether Wario ’s Woods is any good .
The answer is a resounding yes . ”

“ This charming little game challenges you to solve increasingly complex puzzles in a series of castle rooms .
You control Lolo , a loveable blue ball with arms , legs , and two big eyes .
Each stage requires both quick reflexes and thoughtful strategy .
You need to carefully slide blocks , avoid monsters , and efficiently use power - ups in order to open the single chest in each room .
The rooms are a single screen in size .
You can the view the layout of each room before starting , so use the opportunity to plan your strategy .
To solve most puzzles , you ’ll need to perform a series of moves in a specific order , and if you mess up , you may not be able to correct your mistake .
At that point you can hit “ Select ” to forfeit play and start the stage over .
When you run out of lives , you are provided a password and can immediately continue where you left off .
Once you get started , it ’s easy to get caught up in Lolo ’s addictive gameplay .
Some of the puzzles of quite ingenious , and the graphics are n’t bad either .
I especially love the gorgeous castle at the beginning of the game .
The controls are crisp and responsive , and the heroic music is very good .
Lolo ’s fun and innovative gameplay earned it legions of fans , prompting two sequels . ”

Featured Game : Galaxy 5000
“ I remember playing Galaxy 5000 in my childhood , and while I do n’t like typical racing games , I do like games where you get to drive vehicles around and blow crap up .
Galaxy 5000 should be considered to be the NES gameplay predecessor of the SNES classic Rock and Roll Racing .
The graphics are quite good for an NES game , and the sound effects are nice too .
Galaxy 5000 takes place in the year 5000 ( duh ) .
You enter races on each planet in your groovy spacecraft , earning money for accomplishing various feats .
Feats like blowing your opponents up , and winning the race .
There are nine racetracks , one for each planet , and you race each track four times .
Normally this would be boring , but the obstacles and bonuses change during each race , meaning the game really has 36 racetracks , not bad for an NES game .
The levels are nicely designed and the 3D landscape is not seen in many NES games , especially racers .
It adds an extra dimension to the racing , since you can only kill opponents who are on the same 3D level as you are . ”

Featured Game : Super Dodgeball
“ Super Dodge Ball as made by Technos , who also released one of the best fighting games for the NES , River City Ransom .
The characters in the NES version of Super Dodge Ball look almost exactly like the characters from River City Ransom ( the screenshot on the right is from the NES version ) .
Let ’s talk about gameplay .
At first , you ’ll probably be very confused .
Like River City Ransom , you have two buttons : pressing them both together makes you jump , tapping in a direction twice makes you run .
On offense , the A button passes the ball to a teammate , and the B button throws the ball at your opponent .
On defense , the A button makes you duck ( to avoid incoming throws ) and the B button lets you catch an incoming throw .
Catching balls thrown by your opponent is tough , as it requires perfect timing to do . ”

Featured Game : North & South
“ Players take control over either the yankee pigdog Union armies or the slavery - loving Confederate rebels in North & South , a Civil War simulation released in 1990 .
Each side takes turns strategically moving their armies across the map , hoping to wipe out the opposition and take over their bases .
The more bases you own , the more money you get when the train rolls into town .
The more money you have , the more armies you can buy to help crush the enemy .
The real fun comes when two opposing forces meet and the game switches to the battle mode .
Here , you control three facets of a Civil War army , cannons , foot soldiers , and the calvary , as they rush across the battlefield trying to wipe the other out .
Last army standing wins the war and goes on to fame and fortune and a future of bullying lesser nations like Iraq and Canada .
I should also mention that when I initially rented this game , back in the days when Vanilla Ice was topping the charts and Los Angeles had football teams , it became a neighborhood sensation .
We had North & South tournaments .
For the few days I had it , kids would be crammed into my bedroom fighting over who gets to be the rebels .
Good times .
If you and a friend are looking for a fun multiplayer strategy game , or if you still think the South Will Rise Again , you should definitely check out North & South . ”

State Department Inspector General Howard J. Krongard , who has been accused of improperly interfering with investigations into private security contractor Blackwater USA and with other probes , resigned Friday .
In a brief public statement , the longtime corporate lawyer pointed to his recent battles with congressional Democrats and said they explained the reason for his departure .
“ I have nothing further to say at this time , ” wrote Krongard , whose job made him the department ’s chief internal watchdog .
In a separate resignation letter to President Bush , he said that he was troubled by “ inherent structural and conceptual defects ” in the inspector general ’s job .
He also expressed concern about the “ grave threat to public service posed by current rancor and distrust ” among political parties , the government , the media and interest groups .
Krongard , 66 , has been accused by current and former members of his staff and by congressional Democrats of thwarting investigations of waste and fraud in Iraq .
Among those are allegations of arms smuggling by Blackwater , the North Carolina - based security contractor that protects U.S. diplomats in Iraq and has been accused of using excessive force against Iraqi civilians .
Rep. Henry A. Waxman , ( D - Beverly Hills ) , chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , has said that Krongard interfered to shield the administration from embarrassment on politically sensitive issues .
Last month , Krongard recused himself from investigations regarding Blackwater after it was revealed in a dramatic appearance at a House committee hearing that Krongard ’s brother was on a Blackwater advisory board .
Krongard had denied that his brother , Alvin B. Krongard , a former No. 3 official at the CIA , was connected to Blackwater until he was confronted at the hearing with paperwork indicating that his brother served on the board .
Krongard had also withdrawn from an inquiry into the construction of the new U.S. Embassy complex in Baghdad .
And he battled subordinates ’ accusations of abusive treatment .
Gonzalo Gallegos , a spokesman for the State Department , said : “ We thank him for his dedication to public service and wish him well in the future . ”
Krongard grew up in a family of modest means in Baltimore and moved from one success to another in life .
He was an All - American lacrosse goalie at Princeton University , also studied at Harvard Law School and Cambridge University in England , and distinguished himself as a lawyer .
But his two years as a federal agency watchdog have proved different .
His confrontations with Congress brought out unflattering information about his family relations , including that he once sued his daughter and son - in - law over a home loan .
Waxman welcomed the resignation .
“ Mr. Krongard ’s decision removes an enormous distraction from the inspector general ’s office and will allow the office to focus on its important oversight responsibilities , ” Waxman said in a statement .
“ The committee will certainly take this new development into account . ”
Krongard ’s departure is the second at the State Department linked to Blackwater .
Richard J. Griffin , the assistant secretary of State for diplomatic security who made key decisions regarding the department ’s oversight of Blackwater , resigned in October .

Judge Rejects Patriot Act Challenge
AP via SFGate ^ |

Posted on by SmithL
New Haven , Conn . ( AP ) --
A federal judge rejected a former sailor 's claim Thursday that the government illegally intercepted phone calls and obtained e-mails it is using against him in a terrorism - support case .
Hassan Abu -Jihaad 's attorneys had claimed elements of the USA Patriot Act used to obtain the evidence were unconstitutional , and cited a ruling by a federal judge in Oregon striking down key portions of the law .
U.S. District Court Judge Mark Kravitz , however , said he disagreed with that ruling , and noted that other courts have found that the law does not infringe on constitutional rights .
Authorities allege that Abu - Jihaad leaked a document describing the location and vulnerabilities of a Navy battle group to suspected terrorism supporters in London .
He pleaded not guilty in April to charges of providing material support to terrorists and disclosing classified national - defense information , and is to stand trial Feb. 25 .
The 31 - year - old Phoenix man 's attorneys argued that the Patriot Act allows authorities to conduct searches and electronic surveillance under relaxed standards and secret procedures even if the primary purpose is to gather evidence of domestic criminal activity .
Kravitz , however , wrote that the balance the Patriot Act strikes " between an individual 's important interest in privacy and the government 's legitimate need to obtain foreign intelligence information remains reasonable and one that complies with the Fourth Amendment , " which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures .

“ [ Judge ]
Aiken ruled that the Patriot Act cannot be used to authorize secret searches and wiretapping to gather criminal evidence  instead of intelligence  without violating the Fourth Amendment . ”
How can searches wiretapping to gather criminal evidence be “ unreasonable ” if the act of search and wiretapping was compelled by legally obtained intelligence info ?
Was this a consequence of Sandy Gorelich ’s “ wall ” forbidding intelligence agencies from talking to law enforcement ?

A strong majority of Americans opposes President Bush ’s decision to send more troops to Iraq , and about half of the country wants Congress to block the deployment , a Times / Bloomberg poll has found .
As he seeks to chart a new course in Iraq , Bush also faces pervasive resistance to and skepticism about the U.S. commitment -- more than three - fifths of those surveyed said the war was not worth fighting , and only one - third approved of his handling of the conflict .
And in a striking measure of people ’s declining trust in Bush , half said they believed he deliberately misled the U.S. in making his case for invading Iraq .
This is Bush ’s weakest showing on these questions in a Times poll .
Advertisement
Asked about the president ’s recent announcement that he would dispatch an additional 21,500 troops to Iraq , three - fifths said they opposed the move , whereas just over one - third backed it .
Even Bush ’s political base showed signs of cracking :
About one - fourth of Republicans said they did not believe the war was worth fighting , and a roughly equal number opposed the troop increase .
“ I want us to get out ; I want us to leave , ” said poll respondent Beth Anderson , a Republican from Belle Center , Ohio , who has a son in the Army .
Anderson , an X - ray technician , added : “ I think I was one of the biggest , ‘ Yes , we need to go over there ’ ....
And then , little by little , it just got to be too long and too much , and the cost is , wow , awful . ”
Advertisement
The poll ’s findings drive home the extent to which Iraq has politically weakened Bush , whose reelection just more than two years ago stirred dreams among his advisors of cementing an enduring GOP electoral majority in Washington .
The results also underscore the immense challenge confronting Bush :
The public ’s loss of faith in the war ’s direction , his handling of the conflict and questions about his credibility all make it more difficult for him to rally support for the new direction he argues is necessary to turn the tide .
The Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg poll , supervised by Times Poll Director Susan Pinkus , surveyed 1,344 adults nationwide by telephone Saturday through Tuesday .
It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points .
With attitudes about Iraq weighing heavily against him , Bush ’s overall job approval rating stood at 39 % , with 59 % disapproving .
Those figures are comparable with what had been Bush ’s worst showing in a Times poll -- last winter , his approval rating was 38 % , with 58 % disapproving .
Advertisement
On Iraq , 33 % approved of Bush ’s handling of the war , with 65 % disapproving .
The sole ray of light for Bush in the poll may be signs of public ambivalence about how Congress should respond to his plans on Iraq .
Despite the widespread opposition to the troop escalation , Americans divide more closely on whether lawmakers should try to stop it .
The public clearly wants Congress to address the issue in some fashion : Forty - five percent of those polled said Iraq should be Capitol Hill ’s first priority , more than double the next - closest issue ( dealing with healthcare , which drew 20 % ) .
A narrow majority -- 51 % -- wants Congress to try to block Bush from sending more troops to Iraq , with 25 % saying lawmakers should deny funding for the increase and 26 % saying they should find other legislative measures to stop him .
Forty - one percent said Congress should not attempt to stop Bush , and the rest were unsure .
Advertisement
Carl Edwards , a welder from Morganton , N.C. , expressed the divided beliefs of many when he said he wanted Congress to try to prevent the new deployment , but worried about hurting troops already in the field .
“ They should stop sending funds to [ Bush for more troops ] , but not cut the military funds down to where it is hurting the soldiers , ” he said .
Americans divide in similar proportions when asked whether Congress should attempt to require Bush “ to begin withdrawing the troops already in Iraq . ”
Exactly half said Congress should take steps to begin removing troops ( 42 % opposed such an effort ) .
Advertisement
On the other hand , 48 % were against Congress establishing a mandatory deadline for the withdrawal of all troops , whereas 45 % said Congress should set such a deadline either by terminating funding ( 17 % ) or through other legislative means ( 28 % ) .
Despite the conflict about Congress ’ role , responses to a succession of questions showed that a solid majority wanted the U.S. to begin extricating itself from Iraq rather than expanding its military commitment .
When asked how the U.S. should proceed , 30 % said it should maintain troops in Iraq “ for as long as it takes to win the war . ”
By contrast , nearly two - thirds wanted troop withdrawals to begin within the next year , with 46 % saying the process should start over that period and 19 % saying all troops should be sent home immediately .
Advertisement
Similarly , 60 % agreed the U.S. should withdraw “ most ... troops from Iraq by early 2008 while keeping military training forces there to assist and train Iraq troops . ”
Opposing that idea were 31 % .
These results closely tracked the reaction to Bush ’s decision to deploy more troops to Iraq -- 60 % opposed it and 36 % supported it .
“ It ’s just too little , too late , ” said Charles Davis , a market research analyst and Democrat from New York .
Dale Sibley , a salesman in Clinton , Miss. , typified those who backed Bush ’s decision to send more troops .
Advertisement
The deployment might create greater stability in Iraq and allow the U.S. to bring home its forces faster , said Sibley , a Republican .
“ I think [ U.S. troops ] have got to get the job done a little better before they can turn it over to the Iraqis , ” he said .
Part of Bush ’s problem is that relatively few of those polled shared Sibley ’s opinion that a troop increase would meaningfully improve conditions in Iraq .
Twenty - seven percent said more U.S. troops would translate into less violence in Iraq ; 24 % said it would increase violence ; and 43 % said it would have no effect .
Kevin Steelman , a truck driver from Yadkinville , N.C. , was among the skeptics .
“ It ’s going to be a never - ending battle , ” he said .
“ I do n’t foresee a big change by sending more troops over there . ”
Another key element of Bush ’s revised plan for Iraq -- a public works program for the country -- drew a more mixed but still skeptical response .
Advertisement
Though 55 % said they did not believe the U.S. had a moral obligation to pay for Iraqi reconstruction , respondents divided closely on whether a public works program would discourage young Iraqis from joining the insurgency :
Thirty - eight percent said it would and 43 % said it would not , with the rest uncertain .
Most of those polled said that rather than Bush ’s plan , they would prefer that the administration follow the direction charted last month by the independent Iraq Study Group .
That panel , led by James A. Baker III , secretary of State during the presidency of Bush ’s father , and former Rep. Lee H. Hamilton ( D - Ind. ) , proposed that the U.S. begin withdrawing troops from Iraq during the next year and talk with Iran and Syria about promoting stability in the region .
Asked to choose between that approach and Bush ’s new plan , 53 % said they preferred the study group ’s recommendations -- nearly double the 28 % that favored the president ’s proposal .
Advertisement
“ If [ Secretary of State Condoleezza ]
Rice has to go Iran or Syria and talk , and there are 1,000 or 2,000 lives of American soldiers saved , that is cheaper than letting those soldiers die , ” said Democrat Daljit Bajwa , a real estate broker from La Habra .
Asked whether Bush “ deliberately misled Congress and the American people ” with his prewar claims that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction , 50 % said they agreed with that statement , and 44 % said they did not .
But for most Americans , finding a way forward in Iraq apparently seems daunting enough without reopening arguments about the past -- half of those polled said they did not want Congress to hold hearings to investigate Bush ’s prewar claims .

Most important , none of the factors that led to success in history ’s classic counterinsurgency campaigns are present in the fight against the Taliban .
In British Malaya in the 1950s , for example , success depended on direct imperial control of the government , a powerful and cooperative local administration , large numbers of troops , active support from much of the population , a detailed understanding of local culture and politics , control of the borders and strong political support at home .

In Afghanistan , by contrast , the American - led coalition is not the government and has to operate in tandem with an Afghan civil service , military and police force that are at best ineffective and at worst actively undermine coalition operations .
The dominant Pashtun tribes in the south and east are suspicious of foreign troops and are reluctant to side with them against the Taliban , who are from their own ethnic group .
Coalition - backed governments have been unable to prevent the insurgents from taking sanctuary and receiving armaments and money from across the porous borders with Pakistan and Iran .
American and European voters will not send the hundreds of thousands of troops the counterinsurgency textbooks recommend , and have no wish to support decades of fighting .
Worst of all , an increased foreign troop presence will help the Taliban , who are unable to deliver government services and often live parasitically off the people , and whose best selling point is that they are fighting for Afghanistan and Islam against a foreign occupation .
If we commit more troops we will find it very difficult to withdraw them later without losing credibility .
Our best hope in Afghanistan is to continue to manage the country through a light civil and military presence .
Southern Afghanistan will remain unstable for some time to come .
Although we cannot change this , we can contain the situation .
We can prevent Qaeda units from using the area as a base from which to attack the United States , and we can prevent the Taliban from again mobilizing conventional forces or capturing major northern cities like Kabul and Mazar - i- Sharif .
This will not require large numbers of troops .
If the Taliban tried to raise another conventional army , it would be an easy target for coalition forces and air power .
The most efficient and sustainable way to protect American soil from a terrorist attack is not to deploy tens of thousands of troops to occupy rural areas of Afghanistan , but to invest in intelligence to identify the few radicals who want to attack Western targets , and use special forces operations to eliminate them .
We can do much more to show people the benefit of cooperating with the coalition .
Projects in hostile areas , where the local population is not working with us and where a minority wants to attack us , are not a constructive use of our limited resources .
Our best hope is rather to focus on the many secure and welcoming parts of Afghanistan ’s center and north .
Efforts to jumpstart local economies led by members of those communities are more effective , more relevant and more sustainable than those dictated by outsiders .
We have a great opportunity in the north , center and west of Afghanistan to lead development projects for which Afghans will still be grateful 50 years from now .
For most people , the name “ E. coli ” is synonymous with food poisoning and product recalls , but a professor in Texas A&M University ’s chemical engineering department envisions the bacteria as a future source of energy , helping to power our cars , homes and more .
By genetically modifying the bacteria , Thomas Wood , a professor in the Artie McFerrin Department of Chemical Engineering , has “ tweaked ” a strain of E. coli so that it produces substantial amounts of hydrogen .
Specifically , Wood ’s strain produces 140 times more hydrogen than is created in a naturally occurring process , according to an article in “ Microbial Biotechnology , ” detailing his research .
Though Wood acknowledges that there is still much work to be done before his research translates into any kind of commercial application , his initial success could prove to be a significant stepping stone on the path to the hydrogen - based economy that many believe is in this country ’s future .
Renewable , clean and efficient , hydrogen is the key ingredient in fuel - cell technology , which has the potential to power everything from portable electronics to automobiles and even entire power plants .
Today , most of the hydrogen produced globally is created by a process known as “ cracking water ” through which hydrogen is separated from the oxygen .
But the process is expensive and requires vast amounts of energy – one of the chief reasons why the technology has yet to catch on .
Wood ’s work with E. coli could change that .
While the public may be used to hearing about the very specific strain that can cause food poisoning in humans , most strains are common and harmless , even helping their hosts by preventing other harmful bacteria from taking root in the human intestinal tract .
And the use of E. coli in science is nothing new , having been used in the production of human insulin and in the development of vaccines .
But as a potential energy source ?
That ’s new territory , and it ’s being pioneered by Wood and his colleagues .
By selectively deleting six specific genes in E. coli’s DNA , Wood has basically transformed the bacterium into a mini hydrogen - producing factory that ’s powered by sugar .
Scientifically speaking , Wood has enhanced the bacteria ’s naturally occurring glucose - conversion process on a massive scale .
“ These bacteria have 5,000 genes that enable them to survive environmental changes , ” Wood explained .
“ When we knock things out , the bacteria become less competitive .
We have n’t given them an ability to do something .
They do n’t gain anything here ; they lose .
The bacteria that we ’re making are less competitive and less harmful because of what ’s been removed . ”
With sugar as its main power source , this strain of E. coli can now take advantage of existing and ever - expanding scientific processes aimed at producing sugar from certain crops , such as corn , Wood said .
“ A lot of people are working on converting something that you grow into some kind of sugar , ” Wood explained .
“ We want to take that sugar and make it into hydrogen .
We ’re going to get sugar from some crop somewhere .
We ’re going to get some form of sugar - like molecule and use the bacteria to convert that into hydrogen . ”
Biological methods such as this ( E. coli produce hydrogen through a fermentative process ) are likely to reduce energy costs since these processes do n’t require extensive heating or electricity , ” Wood said .
“ One of the most difficult things about chemical engineering is how you get the product , ” Wood explained .
“ In this case , it ’s very easy because the hydrogen is a gas , and it just bubbles out of the solution .
You just catch the gas as it comes out of the glass .
That ’s it .
You have pure hydrogen . ”
There also are other benefits .
As might be expected , the cost of building an entirely new pipeline to transport hydrogen is a significant deterrent in the utilization of hydrogen - based fuel cell technology .
In addition , there is also increased risk when transporting hydrogen .
The solution , Wood believes , is converting hydrogen on site .
“ The main thing we think is you can transport things like sugar , and if you spill the sugar there is not a huge catastrophe , ” Wood said .
“ The idea is to make the hydrogen where you need it . ”
Of course , all of this is down the road .
Right now ,
Wood remains busy in the lab , working on refining a process that ’s already hinted at its incredible potential .
The goal , he said , is to continue to get more out of less .
“ Take your house , for example , ” Wood said .
“ The size of the reactor that we ’d need today if we implemented this technology would be less than the size of a 250 - gallon fuel tank found in the typical east - coast home .
I ’m not finished with this yet , but at this point if we implemented the technology right now , you or a machine would have to shovel in about the weight of a man every day so that the reactor could provide enough hydrogen to take care of the average American home for a 24 - hour period .
“ We ’re trying to make bacteria so it ’s does n’t require 80 kilograms ; it will be closer to 8 kilograms . ”

Within the next month , the Pentagon will submit its 2009 budget to Congress and it ’s a fair bet that it will be even larger than the staggering 2008 one .
Like the Army and the Marines , the Pentagon itself is overstretched and under strain  and like the two services , which are expected to add 92,000 new troops over the next five years ( at an estimated cost of $ 1.2 billion per 10,000 ) , the Pentagon ’s response is never to cut back , but always to expand , always to demand more .
After all , there are those disastrous Afghan and Iraqi wars still eating taxpayer dollars as if there were no tomorrow .
Then there ’s what enthusiasts like to call “ the next war ” to think about , which means all those big - ticket weapons , all those jets , ships , and armored vehicles for the future .
And do n’t forget the still - popular , Rumsfeld - style “ netcentric warfare ” systems ( robots , drones , communications satellites , and the like ) , not to speak of the killer space toys being developed ; and then there ’s all that ruined equipment out of Iraq and Afghanistan to be massively replaced  and all those ruined human beings to take care of .
You ’ll get the gist of this from a recent editorial in the trade magazine Aviation Week & Space Technology :
“ The fact Washington must face is that nearly five years of war have left U.S. forces worse off than they have been in a generation , yes , since Vietnam , and restoring them will take budget - building unlike any in the past . ”
Even on the rare occasion when  as in the case of Boeing ’s C - 17 cargo plane  the Pentagon decides to cancel a project , there ’s Congress to remember .
Contracts and subcontracts for weapons systems , carefully doled out to as many states as possible , mean jobs , and so Congress often balks at such cuts .
( Fifty - five House members recently warned the Pentagon of a “ strong negative response ” if funding for the C - 17 is excised from the 2009 budget . )
All in all , it adds up to a defense menu for a glutton .
Already , Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has said that 2009 funding is “ largely locked into place . ”
The giant military - industrial combines  Lockheed Martin , Northrop Grumman , Boeing , Raytheon  have been watching their stocks rise in otherwise treacherous times .
They are hopeful .
As Ronald Sugar , Northrop CEO , put it : “ A great global power like the United States needs a great navy and a great navy needs an adequate number of ships , and they have to be modern and capable ”  and guess which company is the Navy ’s largest shipbuilder ?
There should be nothing surprising in all this , especially for those of us who have read Chalmers Johnson ’s Nemesis : The Last Days of the American Republic , the final volume of his Blowback Trilogy .
Published in 2007 , it is already a classic on what imperial overstretch means for the rest of us .
The paperback of Nemesis is officially out today , just as global stock markets tumble .

Going Bankrupt
Why the debt crisis is now the greatest threat to the American republic
by Chalmers Johnson
The military adventurers of the Bush administration have much in common with the corporate leaders of the defunct energy company Enron .
Both groups of men thought that they were the “ smartest guys in the room , ” the title of Alex Gibney ’s prize - winning film on what went wrong at Enron .
The neoconservatives in the White House and the Pentagon outsmarted themselves .
They failed even to address the problem of how to finance their schemes of imperialist wars and global domination .
As a result , going into 2008 , the United States finds itself in the anomalous position of being unable to pay for its own elevated living standards or its wasteful , overly large military establishment .
Its government no longer even attempts to reduce the ruinous expenses of maintaining huge standing armies , replacing the equipment that seven years of wars have destroyed or worn out , or preparing for a war in outer space against unknown adversaries .
Instead , the Bush administration puts off these costs for future generations to pay  or repudiate .
This utter fiscal irresponsibility has been disguised through many manipulative financial schemes ( such as causing poorer countries to lend us unprecedented sums of money ) , but the time of reckoning is fast approaching .
There are three broad aspects to our debt crisis .
First , in the current fiscal year ( 08 ) we are spending insane amounts of money on “ defense ” projects that bear no relationship to the national security of the United States .
Simultaneously , we are keeping the income tax burdens on the richest segments of the American population at strikingly low levels .
Second , we continue to believe that we can compensate for the accelerating erosion of our manufacturing base and our loss of jobs to foreign countries through massive military expenditures  so - called “ military Keynesianism , ” which I discuss in detail in my book Nemesis : The Last Days of the American Republic .
By military Keynesianism , I mean the mistaken belief that public policies focused on frequent wars , huge expenditures on weapons and munitions , and large standing armies can indefinitely sustain a wealthy capitalist economy .
The opposite is actually true .
Third , in our devotion to militarism ( despite our limited resources ) , we are failing to invest in our social infrastructure and other requirements for the long - term health of our country .
These are what economists call “ opportunity costs , ” things not done because we spent our money on something else .
Our public education system has deteriorated alarmingly .
We have failed to provide health care to all our citizens and neglected our responsibilities as the world ’s number - one polluter .
Most important , we have lost our competitiveness as a manufacturer for civilian needs  an infinitely more efficient use of scarce resources than arms manufacturing .
Let me discuss each of these .
The Current Fiscal Disaster
It is virtually impossible to overstate the profligacy of what our government spends on the military .
The Department of Defense ’s planned expenditures for fiscal year 2008 are larger than all other nations ’ military budgets combined .
The supplementary budget to pay for the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , not part of the official defense budget , is itself larger than the combined military budgets of Russia and China .
Defense - related spending for fiscal 2008 will exceed $ 1 trillion for the first time in history .
The United States has become the largest single salesman of arms and munitions to other nations on Earth .
Leaving out of account President Bush ’s two ongoing wars , defense spending has doubled since the mid-1990s .
The defense budget for fiscal 2008 is the largest since World War II .
Before we try to break down and analyze this gargantuan sum , there is one important caveat .
Figures on defense spending are notoriously unreliable .
The numbers released by the Congressional Reference Service and the Congressional Budget Office do not agree with each other .
Robert Higgs , senior fellow for political economy at the Independent Institute , says , “ A well - founded rule of thumb is to take the Pentagon ’s ( always well publicized ) basic budget total and double it . ”
Even a cursory reading of newspaper articles about the Department of Defense will turn up major differences in statistics about its expenses .
Some 30 - 40 percent of the defense budget is “ black , ” meaning that these sections contain hidden expenditures for classified projects .
There is no possible way to know what they include or whether their total amounts are accurate .
There are many reasons for this budgetary sleight - of - hand  including a desire for secrecy on the part of the president , the secretary of defense , and the military - industrial complex  but the chief one is that members of Congress , who profit enormously from defense jobs and pork - barrel projects in their districts , have a political interest in supporting the Department of Defense .
In 1996 , in an attempt to bring accounting standards within the executive branch somewhat closer to those of the civilian economy , Congress passed the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act .
It required all federal agencies to hire outside auditors to review their books and release the results to the public .
Neither the Department of Defense nor the Department of Homeland Security has ever complied .
Congress has complained , but not penalized either department for ignoring the law .
The result is that all numbers released by the Pentagon should be regarded as suspect .
In discussing the fiscal 2008 defense budget , as released to the press on Feb.
7 , 2007 , I have been guided by two experienced and reliable analysts : William D. Hartung of the New America Foundation ’s Arms and Security Initiative and Fred Kaplan , defense correspondent for Slate.com .
They agree that the Department of Defense requested $ 481.4 billion for salaries , operations ( except in Iraq and Afghanistan ) , and equipment .
They also agree on a figure of $ 141.7 billion for the “ supplemental ” budget to fight the “ global war on terrorism ”  that is , the two ongoing wars that the general public may think are actually covered by the basic Pentagon budget .
The Department of Defense also asked for an extra $ 93.4 billion to pay for hitherto unmentioned war costs in the remainder of 2007 and , most creatively , an additional “ allowance ” ( a new term in defense budget documents ) of $ 50 billion to be charged to fiscal year 2009 .
This comes to a total spending request by the Department of Defense of $ 766.5 billion .
But there is much more .
In an attempt to disguise the true size of the American military empire , the government has long hidden major military - related expenditures in departments other than Defense .
For example , $ 23.4 billion for the Department of Energy goes toward developing and maintaining nuclear warheads ; and $ 25.3 billion in the Department of State budget is spent on foreign military assistance ( primarily for Israel , Saudi Arabia , Bahrain , Kuwait , Oman , Qatar , the United Arab Republic , Egypt , and Pakistan ) .
Another $ 1.03 billion outside the official Department of Defense budget is now needed for recruitment and reenlistment incentives for the overstretched U.S. military itself , up from a mere $ 174 million in 2003 , the year the war in Iraq began .
The Department of Veterans Affairs currently gets at least $ 75.7 billion , 50 percent of which goes for the long - term care of the grievously injured among the at least 28,870 soldiers so far wounded in Iraq and another 1,708 in Afghanistan .
The amount is universally derided as inadequate .
Another $ 46.4 billion goes to the Department of Homeland Security .
Missing as well from this compilation is $ 1.9 billion to the Department of Justice for the paramilitary activities of the FBI ; $ 38.5 billion to the Department of the Treasury for the Military Retirement Fund ; $ 7.6 billion for the military - related activities of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ; and well over $ 200 billion in interest for past debt - financed defense outlays .
This brings U.S. spending for its military establishment during the current fiscal year ( 08 ) , conservatively calculated , to at least $ 1.1 trillion .
Military Keynesianism
Such expenditures are not only morally obscene , they are fiscally unsustainable .
Many neoconservatives and poorly informed patriotic Americans believe that , even though our defense budget is huge , we can afford it because we are the richest country on Earth .
Unfortunately , that statement is no longer true .
The world ’s richest political entity , according to the CIA ’s World Factbook , is the European Union .
The EU ’s 2006 GDP ( gross domestic product  all goods and services produced domestically ) was estimated to be slightly larger than that of the U.S. However , China ’s 2006 GDP was only slightly smaller than that of the U.S. , and Japan was the world ’s fourth richest nation .
A more telling comparison that reveals just how much worse we ’re doing can be found among the “ current accounts ” of various nations .
The current account measures the net trade surplus or deficit of a country plus cross - border payments of interest , royalties , dividends , capital gains , foreign aid , and other income .
For example , in order for Japan to manufacture anything , it must import all required raw materials .
Even after this incredible expense is met , it still has an $ 88 billion per year trade surplus with the United States and enjoys the world ’s second highest current account balance .
( China is number one . )
The United States , by contrast , is number 163  dead last on the list , worse than countries like Australia and the United Kingdom that also have large trade deficits .
Its 2006 current account deficit was $ 811.5 billion ; second worst was Spain at $ 106.4 billion .
This is what is unsustainable .
It ’s not just that our tastes for foreign goods , including imported oil , vastly exceed our ability to pay for them .
We are financing them through massive borrowing .
On Nov. 7 , 2007 , the U.S. Treasury announced that the national debt had breached $ 9 trillion for the first time ever .
This was just five weeks after Congress raised the so - called debt ceiling to $ 9.815 trillion .
If you begin in 1789 , at the moment the Constitution became the supreme law of the land , the debt accumulated by the federal government did not top $ 1 trillion until 1981 .
When George Bush became president in January 2001 , it stood at approximately $ 5.7 trillion .
Since then , it has increased by 45 percent .
This huge debt can be largely explained by our defense expenditures in comparison with the rest of the world .
The world ’s top 10 military spenders and the approximate amounts each country currently budgets for its military establishment are :
1. United States ( FY08 budget ) , $ 623 billion
2. China ( 04 ) , $ 65 billion
3. Russia , $ 50 billion
4. France ( 05 ) , $ 45 billion
5. Japan ( 07 ) , $ 41.75 billion
6. Germany ( 03 ) , $ 35.1 billion
7. Italy ( 03 ) , $ 28.2 billion
8. South Korea ( 03 ) , $ 21.1 billion
9. India ( 05 est. ) , $ 19 billion
10 . Saudi Arabia ( 05 est. ) , $ 18 billion
World total military expenditures ( 04 est. ) , $ 1,100 billion
World total ( minus the United States ) , $ 500 billion
Our excessive military expenditures did not occur over just a few short years or simply because of the Bush administration ’s policies .
They have been going on for a very long time in accordance with a superficially plausible ideology and have now become entrenched in our democratic political system where they are starting to wreak havoc .
This ideology I call “ military Keynesianism ”  the determination to maintain a permanent war economy and to treat military output as an ordinary economic product , even though it makes no contribution to either production or consumption .
This ideology goes back to the first years of the Cold War .
During the late 1940s , the U.S. was haunted by economic anxieties .
The Great Depression of the 1930s had been overcome only by the war production boom of World War II .
With peace and demobilization , there was a pervasive fear that the Depression would return .
During 1949 , alarmed by the Soviet Union ’s detonation of an atomic bomb , the looming communist victory in the Chinese civil war , a domestic recession , and the lowering of the Iron Curtain around the USSR ’s European satellites , the U.S. sought to draft basic strategy for the emerging cold war .
The result was the militaristic National Security Council Report 68 ( NSC - 68 ) drafted under the supervision of Paul Nitze , then head of the Policy Planning Staff in the State Department .
Dated April 14 , 1950 , and signed by President Harry S. Truman on Sept. 30 , 1950 , it laid out the basic public economic policies that the United States pursues to the present day .
In its conclusions , NSC - 68 asserted , “ One of the most significant lessons of our World War II experience was that the American economy , when it operates at a level approaching full efficiency , can provide enormous resources for purposes other than civilian consumption while simultaneously providing a high standard of living . ”
With this understanding , American strategists began to build up a massive munitions industry , both to counter the military might of the Soviet Union ( which they consistently overstated ) and also to maintain full employment as well as ward off a possible return of the Depression .
The result was that , under Pentagon leadership , entire new industries were created to manufacture large aircraft , nuclear - powered submarines , nuclear warheads , intercontinental ballistic missiles , and surveillance and communications satellites .
This led to what President Eisenhower warned against in his farewell address of Jan. 17 , 1961 : “ The conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience ”  that is , the military - industrial complex .
By 1990 , the value of the weapons , equipment , and factories devoted to the Department of Defense was 83 percent of the value of all plants and equipment in American manufacturing .
From 1947 to 1990 , the combined U.S. military budgets amounted to $ 8.7 trillion .
Even though the Soviet Union no longer exists , U.S. reliance on military Keynesianism has , if anything , ratcheted up , thanks to the massive vested interests that have become entrenched around the military establishment .
Over time , a commitment to both guns and butter has proven an unstable configuration .
Military industries crowd out the civilian economy and lead to severe economic weaknesses .
Devotion to military Keynesianism is , in fact , a form of slow economic suicide .
On May 1 , 2007 , the Center for Economic and Policy Research of Washington , D.C. , released a study prepared by the global forecasting company Global Insight on the long - term economic impact of increased military spending .
Guided by economist Dean Baker , this research showed that , after an initial demand stimulus , by about the sixth year the effect of increased military spending turns negative .
Needless to say , the U.S. economy has had to cope with growing defense spending for more than 60 years .
He found that , after 10 years of higher defense spending , there would be 464,000 fewer jobs than in a baseline scenario that involved lower defense spending .
Baker concluded :
“ It is often believed that wars and military spending increases are good for the economy .
In fact , most economic models show that military spending diverts resources from productive uses , such as consumption and investment , and ultimately slows economic growth and reduces employment . ”
These are only some of the many deleterious effects of military Keynesianism .
Hollowing Out the American Economy
It was believed that the U.S. could afford both a massive military establishment and a high standard of living , and that it needed both to maintain full employment .
But it did not work out that way .
By the 1960s , it was becoming apparent that turning over the nation ’s largest manufacturing enterprises to the Department of Defense and producing goods without any investment or consumption value was starting to crowd out civilian economic activities .
The historian Thomas E. Woods Jr. observes that , during the 1950s and 1960s , between one - third and two - thirds of all American research talent was siphoned off into the military sector .
It is , of course , impossible to know what innovations never appeared as a result of this diversion of resources and brainpower into the service of the military , but it was during the 1960s that we first began to notice Japan was outpacing us in the design and quality of a range of consumer goods , including household electronics and automobiles .
Nuclear weapons furnish a striking illustration of these anomalies .
Between the 1940s and 1996 , the United States spent at least $ 5.8 trillion on the development , testing , and construction of nuclear bombs .
By 1967 , the peak year of its nuclear stockpile , the United States possessed some 32,500 deliverable atomic and hydrogen bombs , none of which , thankfully , was ever used .
They perfectly illustrate the Keynesian principle that the government can provide make - work jobs to keep people employed .
Nuclear weapons were not just America ’s secret weapon , but also its secret economic weapon .
As of 2006 , we still had 9,960 of them .
There is today no sane use for them , while the trillions spent on them could have been used to solve the problems of social security and health care , quality education and access to higher education for all , not to speak of the retention of highly skilled jobs within the American economy .
The pioneer in analyzing what has been lost as a result of military Keynesianism was the late Seymour Melman ( 1917 - 2004 ) , a professor of industrial engineering and operations research at Columbia University .
His 1970 book , Pentagon Capitalism : The Political Economy of War , was a prescient analysis of the unintended consequences of the American preoccupation with its armed forces and their weaponry since the onset of the Cold War.
Melman wrote ( pp. 2 - 3 ) :
“ From 1946 to 1969 , the United States government spent over $ 1,000 billion on the military , more than half of this under the Kennedy and Johnson administrations  the period during which the [ Pentagon - dominated ] state management was established as a formal institution .
This sum of staggering size ( try to visualize a billion of something ) does not express the cost of the military establishment to the nation as a whole .
The true cost is measured by what has been forgone , by the accumulated deterioration in many facets of life by the inability to alleviate human wretchedness of long duration . ”
In an important exegesis on Melman ’s relevance to the current American economic situation , Thomas Woods writes :
“ According to the U.S. Department of Defense , during the four decades from 1947 through 1987 it used ( in 1982 dollars ) $ 7.62 trillion in capital resources .
In 1985 , the Department of Commerce estimated the value of the nation ’s plant and equipment , and infrastructure , at just over $ 7.29 trillion .
In other words , the amount spent over that period could have doubled the American capital stock or modernized and replaced its existing stock . ”
The fact that we did not modernize or replace our capital assets is one of the main reasons why , by the turn of the 21st century , our manufacturing base had all but evaporated .
Machine tools  an industry on which Melman was an authority  are a particularly important symptom .
In November 1968 , a five - year inventory disclosed ( p. 186 ) “ that 64 percent of the metalworking machine tools used in U.S. industry were ten years old or older .
The age of this industrial equipment ( drills , lathes , etc. ) marks the United States ’ machine tool stock as the oldest among all major industrial nations , and it marks the continuation of a deterioration process that began with the end the Second World War .
This deterioration at the base of the industrial system certifies to the continuous debilitating and depleting effect that the military use of capital and research and development talent has had on American industry . ”
Nothing has been done in the period since 1968 to reverse these trends and it shows today in our massive imports of equipment  from medical machines like proton accelerators for radiological therapy ( made primarily in Belgium , Germany , and Japan ) to cars and trucks .
Our short tenure as the world ’s “ lone superpower ” has come to an end .
As Harvard economics professor Benjamin Friedman has written :
“ Again and again it has always been the world ’s leading lending country that has been the premier country in terms of political influence , diplomatic influence , and cultural influence .
It ’s no accident that we took over the role from the British at the same time that we took over the job of being the world ’s leading lending country .
Today we are no longer the world ’s leading lending country .
In fact we are now the world ’s biggest debtor country , and we are continuing to wield influence on the basis of military prowess alone . ”
Some of the damage done can never be rectified .
There are , however , some steps that this country urgently needs to take .
These include reversing Bush ’s 2001 and 2003 tax cuts for the wealthy , beginning to liquidate our global empire of over 800 military bases , cutting from the defense budget all projects that bear no relationship to the national security of the United States , and ceasing to use the defense budget as a Keynesian jobs program .
If we do these things we have a chance of squeaking by .
If we do n’t , we face probable national insolvency and a long depression .

THE FDA IS SUED By Byron J. Richards , CCN January 9 , 2008 NewsWithViews.com
The New Year brings a surprise for the FDA ï¿½ a lawsuit filed by Public Citizen seeking to force the FDA to do its pretended job of protecting American citizens from the dangers of drugs .
Of course , the real FDA job , as prioritized by top FDA management , is to protect the sales of Big Pharma and create new market opportunities for Big Pharma and Big Biotech while using Americans for experimental purposes .
The current suit revolves around the dangers of toxic fluoride - containing antibiotics .
The two brand names involved are Johnson & Johnsonï¿½s Levaquin and Bayerï¿½s Cipro .
The German company , Bayer , has a long and colorful history of injuring Americans while its executives laugh all the way to the bank .
These dangerous antibiotics cause ruptured and damaged tendons .
Public Citizen had petitioned the FDA for a clear black box warning , rather than a warning buried deep in the fine print that no person fighting an illness would have the energy to read .
The FDA refused to force the drug companies to make the warning clear , knowing that such a warning would reduce sales of the drugs and open the companies to lawsuits by those who have been injured .
Now the FDA will get a chance to defend its pro Big Pharma anti-American position in court .
Happy New Year , FDA .
Hopefully this is the start of a new trend .
Here are some of the other top headlines featuring the ineptitude going on in our health care system .
Pfizer ï¿½ Lipitor Suit Moves Forward while Officials Flee the Law in Nigeria Lipitor for lowering cholesterol ( a statin ) is the best selling drug of all time .
A newly unveiled lawsuit based on information provided by a top former Pfizer exec now turned whistleblower is showing that this stroke of marketing genius was based on blatantly illegal marketing and pushing the drug on Americans who really did not need it .
As the poster child for the statin scam Pfizer has likely damaged the health of millions of Americans .
Now there is an attempt to hit them where it counts , in the pocket book .
Meanwhile , the morality of Pfizer continues to shine around the world as three top executives try to flee the law in Nigeria after killing and injuring children while conducting drug experiments .
Such brutal experimentation in third world countries is common practice by Big Pharma , where regulation is lax and bad results commonly donï¿½t show up in the scientific literature and are not included as part of the drugï¿½s history when it is presented to the FDA for approval .
Pfizer is facing 2 billion in damages in the Nigerian case and some of its top executives are literally on the run from the law .
Hopefully the judge on the Lipitor case will take note of the flight risk and hold top Pfizer execs without bail .
The recent Lipitor ads featuring the inventor of the artificial heart , Dr. Robert Jarvik , are now drawing the attention of lawmakers looking into the illegal nature of these ads .
Corn ï¿½ When is Food No Longer Food ?
Farmers growing corn for ethanol are no longer farmers in any traditional sense ; they are part of the oil industry .
It is now being reported that the millions of pounds of nitrogen - based fertilizer needed to grow the corn are entering the Mississippi and going out into the gulf wherein they create a 7,900 - square - mile ï¿½dead zoneï¿½ void of oxygen wherein fish , crabs and shrimp suffocate and hostile algae grow .
Idiots on Capital Hill , with the full support of the Bush administration , just passed a bill that will dramatically boost ethanol use , making this problem much worse for years to come .
There are other side effects in the agricultural market , such as driving up the cost of food as it is now more expensive to feed animals .
Then there is the issue that this means big profits for genetically modified seed producers like Monsanto .
The issue of the safety of GMO foods like corn has never been verified and is an incredibly dangerous experiment on our entire food supply and the health of humans .
Maybe it is a blessing in disguise that corn can be used for fuel .
It is no longer safe to eat .
Letï¿½s just hope that winds donï¿½t blow too much corn pollen into the neighboring crops and cross -contaminate what is left of a real food supply .
Dietary Supplement Trade Group Promotes Food Coloring Use The International Alliance for Dietary / Food Supplement Associations ( IADSA ) is actively supporting the use of food coloring in dietary supplements , guidelines that are being written up for the proposed Codex guidelines that pose a grave threat to free access to dietary supplements in America .
ï¿ ½Our aim is to ensure that the adopted levels are both safe for consumers and consistent with those widely used by the global food supplement industry , ï¿½ said David Pineda , IADSA ï¿½s Director of Regulatory Affairs .
Excuse me Mr. Pinhead , food coloring comes from coal tar and is a poison .
It has no business being in dietary supplements in any amount .
The only people who put it in dietary supplements are big drug companies that make vitamins ( Bayer - One - A - Day and Wyeth ï¿½ Centrum ) .
I wouldnï¿½t put food - color containing vitamins in my body even if they were the last supplements left on earth - which is the goal of Codex .
It is obvious that IADSA and Codex are nothing but European drug company efforts to control the sales of nutrients in America and around the world , ensuring that garbage synthetic vitamins are sold as natural and junk chemicals are allowed in products .

When will the traitors in the U.S. trade groups wake up .
The Natural Products Association ( NPA , formerly NNFA ) is a member of IADSA and has supported the IADSA / Big Pharma positions .
NPA is leading its members down a booby - trapped path that has nothing to do with the principles of natural health .
NPA is failing to warn its members regarding the extreme dangers CODEX poses to Americans .
Spotlight Shines on Ineptitude of Medical Sinus Treatments
The Journal of the American Medical Association has just published a double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled study showing that the use of antibiotics and nasal steroids is ineffective at treating sinusitis .
Each year there are 25 million visits to a doctor in the United States to treat sinus problems ; the overwhelming majority are viral in nature .
Despite repeated warnings of germ resistance from antibiotic prescription overuse , U.S. physicians still prescribe an antibiotic at least 85 percent of the time .
Now there is iron - clad scientific proof that this strategy does not work .
What is not discussed in this study is the rampant epidemic of Candida Albicans that is caused by this flagrant malpractice of medicine .
Physicians routinely cause life - long infections with Candida Albicans which seriously deteriorate the health and quality of life of their patients who receive repeating doses of antibiotics .
It is now also quite clear that repeated doses of antibiotics in infants is a cause of the epidemic of asthma in children ( mostly as a side effect of Candida infection ) .
It is becoming painfully obvious to everyone that medical doctors cannot be trusted to do a competent job and are guilty of practicing medicine with a useless license .
Thankfully , many natural remedies can easily take care of sinus problems without damaging a personï¿½s health for life .
Common Diabetes Drug Causes Bone Loss ï¿½ Medical Profession in a Funk
The commonly used and much maligned diabetes drug , Avandia , just took another spill down the stairs .
A new mouse study shows that the drug weakens bones and is likely to cause osteoporosis in the millions of users in the United States .
The drug was shown to get directly in the way of healthy bone function , causing accelerated bone loss and slowed bone growth .
Senior study author Ron Evans , not wanting to step on GlaxoSmithKlineï¿½s toes , had this to say about Avandia ï¿ ½We do not recommend that people stop their treatment .
You must balance the benefits against the complications .ï¿½
So how do the millions of people taking this drugs balance the risks against the benefits ?
Well maybe they go to the FDA website where they will find that in May the FDA warned of ï¿½a potentially significant increase in the risk of heart attack and heart - related deaths in patients taking Avandia .ï¿ ½
Yes , that is a 43 % increased risk .
So now we have a drug that causes serious bone disease and heart disease .
The FDA has left it on the market so that you the consumer and your too - busy doctor can sort out if this poison is right for you .
The drug - pushing quick - fix paradigm of Western Medicine , existing almost solely to prop up the profits of multi-national drug companies and rape the American public of wealth , is a scam gone wild .

Praise GOD / praise GOP -- where 's the 501 ( c ) 3 line ?
by Jeremy Hooper
The Family Research Council , Focus on the Family , and the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention have launched a new site called iVoteValues.org , on which they basically recommend that churches come as close to the line of losing their tax - exempt status as possible by taking an active role in the next election .
They do everything BUT explicitly demand that churches campaign and vote for conservative candidates .
Look , just check out this resource page :
( click image for full view )
News links to far right sources like The Washington Times , Fox News , and CNS ( with CNN and USA Today thrown in for good measure ) ; links to the most conservative commentary sites on the face of the planet ( again , with Time and Newsweek token - ly thrown into the mix ) ; links to " Christian perspectives , " but only those ones who politically stand in opposition to gays and liberals .
And all are described as " the kind of resources you need to equip your church to make an impact on your culture as the Salt of the earth and the Light of the world . "
Hell , we 're kind of shocked they 've stopped short of recommending that pastors insert " Vote GOP " after every " Amen " !
Now , they may not be overstepping any true legal bounds or encouraging churches to do so by encouraging them to utilize this new site ( the law regarding 501 ( c ) 3's is murky and often unenforced on both sides ) .
However , let 's be honest here : the message on their sites is not meant to lead parishioners into the process so that they can equally weigh the merits of both Hillary Clinton and Mike Huckabee .
There is an obvious one - party agenda at work , and there is obviously some version of campaigning going on .
In this code word - laden , media - saturated , double - talking world , there are many ways to say " vote for so and so " without actually saying it .
On iValuesVoters they are saying it , yet behind the veil of " values " and " family " and all of the usual suspects .
And they are sending it out as a national rally cry to a network of millions upon millions of tax - exempt churches , the links of which are given skewed , Democracy - harming messages under the guise of fair and reasoned political participation .
So yea , we seriously think sites like this call into question whether the calls these kids are issuing in order to deny gays ( among others ) benefits and protections ( or the employment of the advice ) could threaten the benefits that their outlets and enterprises currently enjoy under 501 ( c ) 3 protection .
Sure there is stuff like this on both sides .
However , the deliberate attempt to rally the vast network of churches would seem to be a situation unique to the far right .
Quite frankly , it scares the hell out of us ( though not in the way they want it to ) !
i Values Voters [ iVV ]
Your thoughts
Churches should not feel constrained from political action for fear of loosing their tax - exempt status .
The Lord will provide what is needed , and the lure of tax - exemption is merely Satan 's bait to keep the Church ineffective .

GLENN BECK
Honest Questions with John Hagee
Aired October 12 , 2007 - 19:00:00 ET
THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT .
THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED .
( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE )
GLENN BECK , HOST ( voice - over ) : Dynamic , outspoken , controversial .
Pastor John Hagee , one of America`s most popular evangelists , as well as one of Israel`s most vocal supporters .
JOHN HAGEE , EVANGELIST : From the shock and the devastation ...
BECK : From his mega-church in San Antonio , his message can be heard on television and radio throughout America and throughout the world .
HAGEE : He will set his throne on the Temple Mount in the city of Jerusalem .
BECK : He`s also a best - selling author .
His newest book , " In Defense of Israel " , warns of the impending nuclear threat caused by Iran .
And it makes the case that the U.S. must act now .
HAGEE : Undercutting the brave and heroic efforts of our military forces in Iraq .
BECK : Could the threat from Islamic extremists be a sign of the end times ?
And is the apocalypse almost upon us ?
The Reverend John Hagee joins me for an hour of honest questions , tonight .
( END VIDEOTAPE )
BECK : Hello , America , and welcome to the program .
We`ve got a guest tonight .
Some people say that he speaks his mind and he says the things that nobody is willing to say anymore .
Others say he`s a crazy man .
Tonight , you decide for yourself .
He`s Pastor John Hagee .
Welcome to the program , sir .
How are you ?
HAGEE : I`m delighted to be here , Glenn Beck .
It`s a pleasure .
BECK : Thank you .
I want to talk to you tonight about the things that people in the sane world just don`t say , and that is we`re living in the end times .
You believe that .
HAGEE : I do indeed .
And I believe the Bible is very specific to the fact that we do live in the end of days .
BECK : OK .
I want to get into the -- I want to get into the top ten things of , you know , what makes you say -- I mean , because people have been saying that forever .
HAGEE : Yes .
BECK : They`ve been saying , oh , you know -- the apostles said if Jesus is coming back -- they thought he was coming back right away .
We`re 2,000 years down the line , and he still hasn`t come back .
So what makes you think that we`re living in the end days ?
HAGEE : Well , there are ten Bible signs that we`re living in the end of days .
The Bible is the most phenomenal book that`s ever been written , because when it was written 25 percent of it was prophetic , telling the future .
And these signs about the end of days do not require a theological knowledge .
So people who are watching this show , say , " Well , I don`t have Bible knowledge . "
You -- if you read a newspaper , you`re going to get this .
The first sign is the knowledge explosion .
Daniel 12 , the fourth chapter , God said to Daniel , " I want you to shut up the book until the time of the end . "
That`s a very important phrase .
The end of days , when men shall run to and from and there will be a knowledge explosion .
From the Garden of Eden until the 20th century there was no knowledge explosion .
In transportation people rode horses just as David , Julius Caesar , George Washington .
And then came the car , the jet , put people on the moon .
We are that generation that`s having the knowledge explosion .
The same thing has happened in communication .
From the Garden of Eden to the 20th century there was no differentiation .
Then we came to the ability of telegraph , telephone , television , teleroaming ( ph ) .
You can reach somebody on an airplane ...
BECK : Right .
HAGEE : ... talking to them .
And now in the field of medicine , from the Garden of Eden to the 20th century , now with medicine we`ve had to redefine death because we can literally keep someone alive on stimulants indefinitely .
BECK : OK .
So the first sign is ...
HAGEE : The knowledge explosion .
BECK : Knowledge explosion .
Second sign .
HAGEE : Second sign is the rebirth of Israel .
This is a very obvious sign .
BECK : How did -- how did the people early on miss this one ?
I mean , that`s a very important sign , and that didn`t happen until Israel was re- established .
So how did everybody else say , " Oh , yes , forgot about that one " ?
HAGEE : Well , it had to do with the time that they were living in and the theological environment in which they were raised .
My father , who was a Bible preacher , in the middle `40s made this statement : " If the state of Israel is not reborn , we have a reason to believe the Bible is not true . "
And believe me , for my father , who was a Bible scholar , that was a monumental statement .
And the Bible speaks , when the disciples came to Jesus and said , " Give us the signs of the end of time .
When will the end of the world be ? "
And I want to say when we talk about the end of the world , it`s the end of the world as we know it .
BECK : Right .
HAGEE : For someone to say that the world is going to end , that`s simply not right .
BECK : Right .
HAGEE : The world is going to exist forever .
BECK : Right .
And it becomes 1,000 years of unbelievable peace and everything else .
HAGEE : Peace .
BECK : But you`ve got to -- and we`ll get into this a little later .
You`ve got to go through horrific times to get to that 1,000 years of peace .
And I`ve often thought , you know , when September 11 happened , I thought how quickly we will forget this .
Remember how great we were , and we united with everybody else .
And it didn`t take too long before we forgot .
So for us to live this way for 1,000 years , what must it be like ?
To teach us to be humble and remember and respect each other and everything else .
It must be an incredible event .
We`ll get into that later .
HAGEE : Yes , we will .
That`s called the tribulation period .
BECK : Yes .
HAGEE : That happens after these ten signs .
The rebirth of Israel .
Jesus said in Matthew 24:32 that look at the fig tree , and when it blooms again you will know that my coming is nigh at hand .
BECK : OK .
That`s Israel ?
HAGEE : That`s Israel .
And then the third is the birth of nuclear warfare .
Now , this was not something that was possible in the 1900s .
BECK : I don`t remember seeing nuclear war ...
HAGEE : In the middle `50s .
BECK : Where was nuclear warfare in the Bible ?
Where do you find that ?
HAGEE : Zachariah the 14th chapter in the fourth verse .
The Bible says , " And this is the plague that God shall pour out on every nation that comes to fight against Jerusalem .
That their flesh shall consume away while they stand on their feet .
Their eyes shall be consumed in their sockets .
And their tongue shall be consumed in the mouth . "
That is a perfect picture of what happens to the human body in a nuclear blast .
If you saw the videos of Hiroshima , that`s exactly what happened .
The H - bomb can produce heat of 150 million degrees Fahrenheit in a millisecond .
And that`s why the flesh can melt off of the body before your body can hit the ground .
But it`s a perfect description of nuclear warfare .
BECK : OK .
Hang on just a second .
America , happy Friday so far ?
Enjoying it ?
Good .
OK .
So the next sign is what ?
HAGEE : Then -- then the disciples said , " Tell us what the signs will be . "
The first one that Jesus gave was the sign of deception .
Said that you will be living in a time when you should not allow any man to deceive you .
Take heed that no man deceive you .
And we are living in a world of deception .
BECK : I have -- you know , we were just talking about this today in the office with a couple of my producers .
I said , look how the darkness doesn`t understand the light .
Look how people can`t even agree on the truth anymore .
HAGEE : Exactly right .
BECK : You don`t -- you don`t see anything the same anymore .
There -- we don`t even understand each other .
And I have never seen that in my life .
It`s an amazing phenomenon .
Is that what -- you believe that`s what he was talking about ?
HAGEE : Exactly right .
We have come to a point in our existence where we refuse to take responsibility , we refuse to be accountable for our actions , we don`t have the courage to say this is good and this is evil , this is right , this is wrong .
And therefore , we live in this fog of political correctness , where everything is perpetual deception .
BECK : OK .
Next sign .
HAGEE : Then he talks about famines .
And then he talks about pestilence .
A pestilence is a medical physical disease that medical science cannot stop .
For instance , right now I have a very dear friend who`s working in Washington on a serum for the bird flu .
And this is a very serious person , a very responsible person .
And he looked me in the face and said , " John , I want to tell you that bird flu will come to America .
We are not ready for it .
And when it comes , " he " said , many , many people are going to die because we`re not ready for it . "
BECK : Right .
I have to tell you I was up on the bird flu thing , and I -- you know , I`m concerned about the bird flu , as well , but it takes -- it`s a giant " if " .
It `s got to jump over to people .
And if it does , then it`ll be -- then it`ll be a horrific thing .
HAGEE : Yes .
BECK : But we`ve gone through this .
But you could have said that about the bubonic plague .
You could have said that about the influenza before World War I .
It killed millions of people .
HAGEE : Four of my father`s brothers died with that .
BECK : OK .
So what is the difference here ?
You`re just saying that - - you`re just saying that all of these other things are here .
HAGEE : All of these things line up together .
BECK : OK .
HAGEE : This -- there has never been another generation where you had the knowledge explosion , the birth of Israel , the birth of nuclear warfare , universal deception , famines , pestilence .
And then he goes on to say earthquakes .
Earthquakes are -- have been something in the Bible that God has used from time to time to communicate with people who are spiritually deaf .
Moses had a pastoral problem .
About 20,000 people didn`t like him as the leader .
God said , " Get those people in front of the tent of meetings , and I want to talk to them . "
And they got in front of the tent of meetings , and God opened the ground and buried them .
The message was Moses is my man ...
BECK : OK .
We haven`t really seen an increase in earthquakes , though .
HAGEE : I believe that the specific record of the number of earthquakes has dramatically increased every century from the 15th century .
I do have those numbers , and they have virtually doubled in the 20th century from the 19th century .
But the point that I`m making out here is that when we reach the end of days there is going to be an earthquake that is going to be , in vernacular words , the mother of all earthquakes , where the mountains are going to be reduced , where the islands of the sea will disappear , where I believe that the geography of Jerusalem and Israel are going to be reshaped , where the water flows from beneath the Throne of God down to the Dead Sea and the 12 trees are therefore the fruit for the ages to eat , by which they will have perpetual health .
BECK : Do you believe that global warming is a possible sign ?
HAGEE : I don`t believe in global warming .
BECK : You don`t believe the earth is getting warmer ?
HAGEE : No .
BECK : Really ?
HAGEE : No .
BECK : No changes ?
HAGEE : No .
BECK : OK .
So what is the -- what is the next sign ?
I mean , you know , I believe it`s getting warmer .
Science tells us it`s getting warmer .
I don`t believe man is causing it .
I don`t believe that -- maybe man is causing it .
I`m not convinced of that .
I definitely don`t think we can solve it .
But I mean , the earth is constantly cycling .
We`ve seen forever that it gets colder and warmer and colder and warmer .
HAGEE : I`m certainly for clean air and clean water , but I have books in my library written by very responsible people up into the middle 80s were talking about the ice age , where Canada was supposed to be a block of ice right now .
And now we`re talking about global warming , and I think the Kyoto Treaty is really nothing more than something to manipulate the economy of the United States .
BECK : It`s global -- it`s global socialism .
Quickly , we`ve only got a minute .
So give me the next one .
HAGEE : The next one is international television .
Now , how does that work out ?
In the book of Revelation in the 11th chapter , you have two witnesses that antichrist has killed , and the Bible says the world is going to see him them in one hour .
How in heaven`s name could they see two dead people in the streets of Jerusalem at one time ?
That was not true in 1950 .
That was not true in my grandfather`s generation .
It `s only true in our generation .
BECK : I remember -- I remember people saying that when we saw Tiananmen Square .
HAGEE : Yes .
BECK : Remember the guy standing with the tank ?
And the whole world stopped to watch that on the other side of the planet .
HAGEE : Yes .
BECK : And I remember people saying that very thing : this is a sign .
HAGEE : Absolutely .
BECK : One of the signs .
OK .
And is that all ten ?
HAGEE : And the last one is the sign of the scoffer .
Second Peter says , " There will come in the last days scoffers saying where`s the sign of his coming , the coming of Christ ? "
The very fact that there`s skepticism , so much skepticism , saying you people are crazy , believing in this , is a literal sign that Christ is going to appear .
BECK : OK .
When we come back , we`re going to show you some eerie similarities in the ways that Christians and Muslims see the end of days , and are they upon us ?
Also , what does it look like ?
What can we do ?
Et cetera , et cetera .
Coming up .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
HAGEE : He`s coming , ready or not .
He`s not in heaven saying , " Let`s make a deal . "
He`s in heaven saying , " This is the deal .
I am king of king and lord of lords , and I am returning on time for the chosen place ! "
( END VIDEO CLIP )
BECK : Back with Pastor John Hagee from Cornerstone Church in San Antonio .
He`s the author of a new book called " In Defense of Israel " .
I wanted to -- everybody`s look for the antichrist .
Everybody says , " OK , end of times , is this going to be it ?
Well , then who`s the antichrist ?
Is he alive , et cetera , et cetera ? "
I have been struck by President Ahmadinejad and how many times -- and we`ll get into this later -- he refers to the promised one .
HAGEE : Yes .
BECK : He`s looking for the 12th imam to return .
HAGEE : He is indeed .
BECK : There is an army of the Mahdi .
They -- one of the things that made hair stand up on the back of my neck is when I heard that the 12th imam was going to come out of a well and then he was going to go to ancient Babylon and conquer in ancient Babylon and rule from the world in ancient Babylon .
And some of that stuff kind of sounded a little familiar to me .
I`ve had some of my researchers do some looking into the 12th imam , and it`s hard to understand the Mahdi , because there are so many sects of Islam , and so I tried to narrow it down to the kind of sect that President Ahmadinejad is from .
Would you do me a favor and tell me the comparisons , if there are any , to the antichrist for the guy that President Ahmadinejad is calling out .
HAGEE : Yes .
BECK : OK ?
First of all , the first one is he will be a descendant of Mohammed .
He will bear Mohammed`s name .
Nothing there .
Is there ?
HAGEE : Nothing at all .
BECK : He will be a devout Muslim .
The Mahdi will be a devout Muslim .
Interestingly enough , it will be a Muslim version of Jesus , who they believe is the Mahdi .
He will be the enforcer of Sharia Law when the Mahdi returns .
Jesus will be the enforcer .
HAGEE : No truth to that at all .
BECK : OK .
But I`m looking for ...
HAGEE : No Bible connection .
No Bible connection .
BECK : He will be unparalleled , spiritual , political , military world leader .
He will emerge after a period of great turmoil and suffering on the earth .
He will establish justice and righteousness throughout the world and eradicate tyranny and oppression .
HAGEE : There`s a measure of truth in that .
BECK : OK .
You want to just jot anything -- shout anything out real quick ?
HAGEE : Well , here`s the thing .
The Bible says that the antichrist is going to come as a man of peace .
It says he will destroy wondrously with peace .
That means he`s going to make peace treaties with lots of people but never intend to keep it .
BECK : OK .
HAGEE : He promises peace , but he will , in fact , lead the world into bloody war .
BECK : OK .
He will be the vice regent leader of Muslims worldwide .
He will be the supreme political and religious leader for all Muslims .
However , he will also then go to unite the Muslim world and the non-Muslim world and create one - world government .
HAGEE : There is a -- there is a very strong teaching that the antichrist will produce a one - world government .
BECK : OK .
He will lead military action against all those who oppose him .
HAGEE : That is true .
BECK : He`s referred to here many times that he`s a great warrior .
But I mean , that`s the way the Jews saw Jesus originally , too .
That`s why they rejected him .
They saw that he was supposed to be a conqueror , and he conquered through peace .
Could it be the same kind of thing here ?
HAGEE : Well , I believe that they`re looking for a warrior from day one , and they believe that , if they create the Third World War or a massive confusion on the face of the earth , that he will mysteriously and suddenly appear and come to their rescue .
BECK : Hasten it .
HAGEE : Yes .
BECK : He will invade many countries .
He will make a seven - year peace treaty with a Jew of priestly lineage .
HAGEE : He`s going to make a seven - year peace treaty with the state of Israel .
BECK : This is what -- this is what President Ahmadinejad believes of the Mahdi , the 12th imam returning , and this is also in the Bible as the antichrist ?
HAGEE : Absolutely .
BECK : He will conquer Israel for Islam and lead the faithful Muslims in a final slaughter or battle against the Jews .
HAGEE : He will attack the Jewish people , but he won`t conquer them .
And I can give you a spin on that in just a minute .
BECK : He will establish a new Islamic world headquarters from Jerusalem .
HAGEE : He`s going to set up an eternal kingdom in Jerusalem .
BECK : That is what ...
HAGEE : The Bible says .
BECK : That is what the Bible says of the antichrist .
HAGEE : Yes .
BECK : He will rule for seven years , possibly as much as eight or nine .
HAGEE : Seven only .
BECK : He will appear riding a white horse .
HAGEE : No truth to that .
BECK : He will discover some previously undiscovered ...
HAGEE : Whoa , whoa , whoa .
I take that back .
The sixth chapter of Revelation , the first seal is the rider on the white horse .
That is the antichrist .
That`s exactly right .
He does come on a white horse .
BECK : He will discover some previously undiscovered biblical manuscripts and will use to argue with the Jews that will cause some Jews to convert to Islam .
HAGEE : No truth to that .
BECK : He will rediscover the Ark of the Covenant from the Sea of Galilee .
HAGEE : There`s nothing in the Bible about that .
BECK : He will have supernatural powers from Allah over the wind , rain , and crops .
HAGEE : The Bible says that he will have the ability to understand dark sentences , which means he will have a demonic anointing to know the unknowable .
BECK : He will possess and distribute enormous wealth and amounts of wealth .
HAGEE : No Bible truth to that .
BECK : He will be loved by all the people of the earth .
HAGEE : At one point in time he will be .
BECK : OK .
Those are the -- those are the similarities between the antichrist of the Bible and what President Ahmadinejad is calling for in his U.N. speech .
HAGEE : Right .
BECK : And we`ll give you more on that here in just a second .
Back in a second with Pastor Hagee with some more incredible things .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
BECK : Well , it`s Friday .
So of course we want to talk about the end of the world .
Welcome back to the program .
We`re with Pastor John Hagee .
He`s the author of " In Defense of Israel " .
We were just talking about some of the comparisons of some of the comparisons of -- some of the things that my researchers found on the Mahdi as it is understood by President Ahmadinejad and Israel .
And I was giving you those , and you were comparing them to the biblical antichrist .
HAGEE : Right .
BECK : Do you believe that -- do you believe that we , you and I , will see these times ?
HAGEE : We will not see the antichrist .
In Christian theology the next thing that is to happen , because the signs of the time say that we are the terminal generation , is that Christ is seen to appear .
There`s not another Bible scripture that has to be fulfilled for Jesus Christ to come in what is called the Rapture of the Church .
Many people confuse the Rapture of the Church with the Second Coming .
The Rapture of the Church happens where all of the people who believe in Jesus Christ are taken into heaven .
Then the next thing that happens immediately is the appearance of the antichrist .
The appearance of the antichrist , he comes as a man of peace , as the prince of peace to the whole world .
Daniel says he will destroy wondrously with peace .
That means he`s going to make peace treaties , never intending to keep them , but he has the world in a state of peace .
He will create a one - world government .
We see something of that going on in the United Nations .
He will bring about a one - world currency .
BECK : He`ll do this all in seven years ?
HAGEE : All in seven years .
He`ll do it quicker than seven years .
Every person will have to receive his mark in their right hand or forehead , without which they can not buy nor sell .
You can not buy a loaf of bread ...
BECK : How freaked out were you when you saw the chips now that we can implant that are RFID chips that will do that very thing ?
And they`re even making them , I understand , to fuse with the body because they`re afraid of theft .
HAGEE : Yes .
BECK : So once they`re implanted in you , you can not cut them out .
HAGEE : That`s exactly right .
BECK : When I heard that , I went , oh , that`s not good .
HAGEE : All of the technology is just in place .
There will be you a one - world government , a one - world currency , a one - world religion .
This lines up with what your researchers are talking about .
The Bible then says he will understand dark sentences , which means he will have a demonic anointing to know the unknown .
BECK : What really -- what really convinces people , though , is when he`s killed and then rises again ?
HAGEE : He`s going to make a seven - year treaty with Israel and set up his image to be worshiped in Israel .
And that is where I`m convinced that a Jewish person who understands who he is shoots him , because the Bible says he`s wounded in the head and recovers wondrously , emulating the death and the resurrection of Jesus Christ .
At this point in time when he comes back to life he has the personality of a Hitler .
He now pursues the Jewish people .
The Jewish people then go to Petra , which is a place in Jordan that is a ...
BECK : I saw it in " Indiana Jones " .
HAGEE : ... natural fortress .
And that God is going to provide for them there protection from him .
And as he gets ready to pursue him , the Bible says that he , the antichrist , hears tidings from the east that disturb him .
The tidings from the east is that there are -- the Chinese army is marching up the Euphrates River , 200 million of them , and they`re moving toward the battle of Armageddon , because they want the oil that will make them a superpower .
BECK : OK .
When we come back , we`re going to talk a little bit about the Bible and Iran and Russia and where is America in all of this .
Also , something that has stuck out for me on the end days that was spoken by Condoleezza Rice .
We`ll come back in just a second .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
HAGEE : Ladies and gentlemen , the radical Islamic army is not coming to America .
It `s here .
With Iran`s nuclear power and Russia`s support of Iran , Iran intends to attack Israel and America .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
BECK : We`re back with mega- church pastor John Hagee , author of a new book , " In Defense of Israel . "
I want to talk to you about current - day politics and how it is all shaping up .
Let`s start with Russia .
HAGEE : All right .
BECK : Russia is -- unbeknownst to a lot of people that don`t look at old maps and new maps -- Russia is actually mentioned in the Bible , and so is Iran .
HAGEE : Yes .
BECK : And they are the real linking for the End Days , right ?
HAGEE : Yes , they are .
BECK : OK .
Explain that .
HAGEE : There is , in the book of Ezekiel , the 38th and 39th chapter , a description of a very graphic war that`s going to happen in the middle of the tribulation .
It is a war that`s led by Russia .
The Bible says that Russia will be a commander to the Islamic nations .
The Islamic nations are mentioned , beginning in Ezekiel 38:5 , by name , Persia , that`s Iran , and all of the nations that are coming with them .
In this ...
BECK : But it doesn`t mention Russia .
HAGEE : No , here`s how it -- here`s how it comes together , that in the 38th chapter , while the word " Russia " is not mentioned , the 38th chapter of Ezekiel says that God says to Ezekiel , I want you to prophesy against Gog and his kingdom .
Gog is the man , and kingdom is the land of Magog .
And then he gives the names of the people of which he is the prince .
They are Gomer , Magog , Javan , Tubal , and Meschech .
Now , there are people who say that Meschech is the ancient name of Moscow , but the title that I go to is Genesis 10 .
In Genesis 10 , you find the names of all of Japeth`s sons .
You can`t just pick out of the air and say , " These people are such and such . "
Genesis 10 says that these sons are the sons of Japheth .
Ethnologists -- ethnologists are people who track people who migrate and where they go -- ethnologists have said that the Japhethites went beyond the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea , which is Russia .
This is further vindicated in Ezekiel 38:5 , when God says , of this commander of the Islamic armies , you will come from the far north country .
That`s Russia .
Many people have said , " Well , maybe that`s Syria , because they are north . "
But far north from Israel is Russia .
God makes it very clear that Russia is going to ingratiate themselves to the Islamic nations .
Why ?
The Islamic nations have the oil .
Russia wants the oil .
God said , I`m going to put a hook in your jaw .
That hook is oil .
Russia has to have it to become a superpower .
That`s why Putin is flexing his muscles right now .
That`s why we`re getting back to the Cold War era again , because Russia wants the world to know they are going to be a strong superpower again .
BECK : All right .
So let me go here , because Russia has a ton of oil .
I mean , they`ve got -- they`re sitting on a ton of oil right now .
But I would connect them to the Middle East , trying to play a little game .
I see Russia as something that is -- they think they`re playing the game that we were playing with them in World War II .
" Oh , well , we`ll sit with Stalin .
We know what a monster Stalin is , but we`ll take care of him afterwards . "
And we had no idea what kind of can of worms we were opening up .
Does the Bible say that Russia knows who these other countries are down south ?
HAGEE : No , the Bible doesn`t say that at all .
The Bible says , as a matter of fact , you know , that Russia is simply a tool in the hand of God to bring this war .
Why is God doing this ?
Why is God allowing this war ?
And the reason that Ezekiel says that God is allowing this war is because God is trying to introduce to Israel the fact that he , God , the god of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , created Israel , he`s the defender of Israel , and he , in the final analysis , is going to be the savior of Israel , because he , God , is going to supernaturally destroy this army that comes against Israel supernaturally , just as he defended the children of Israel who fled from Egypt .
BECK : OK .
Condoleezza
Rice said something , I think it was last year or the year before .
She said what we`re witnessing here in the Middle East are birth pangs , and that word stuck out to me .
For one reason , it clearly means , if anybody who`s had children , birth pangs get stronger and closer together , and then there`s a nasty little event there at the end .
In human life , it ends with something nice , but there is that extraordinary pain at the end .
Does birth pangs play a role , the word " birth pangs " play a role in the Bible ?
HAGEE : The birth pangs are -- the word " birth pangs " are in the scripture .
And your analysis is absolutely accurate .
Any woman who`s had a child knows this , that once birth pangs begin , they continue , and they become more severe and closer together until the child is born .
Now , in this case , the child is the new era , or the new world order , or whatever is going -- whatever it is she`s talking about .
The new era can be many things to many people .
BECK : Ahmadinejad , one spooky dude .
HAGEE : Yes , he is .
BECK : I heard a candidate refer to him as I think a buffoon the other day .
I don`t think this man is a buffoon .
HAGEE : No , he`s not .
BECK : Who do you think he is ?
HAGEE : I think he`s a very clever man .
I think he knows exactly what he wants to do .
I think the stakes that -- the statements that he`s making to the international press are statements that he`s making from prepared speeches .
They`re not off the cuff .
He`s saying , " I`m going to wipe Israel off the map of the Earth . "
He`s said Israel is going to disappear in a sudden storm .
That sudden storm is a nuclear storm .
He said , " I can see the day , God willing , " that God being Allah , " where there will no longer be a United States of America or Israel . "
This man intends to put together nuclear weapons , and he intends to use them on Israel first , and then bring them to the United States of America .
BECK : You have met prime minister after prime minister after prime minister of Israel .
HAGEE : Yes .
BECK : I just met with Benjamin Netanyahu about a year ago , and I respect the man .
I think he`s brilliant .
He looked me right in the eye , and I mean his eyes bore holes through me , and he said , " We have a right to survive . "
And I said , " Mr. Netanyahu , you`re being set up . "
HAGEE : Yes .
BECK : Because everyone is going to say -- you`re going to attack , because you do have a right to survive , and what`ll happen is everybody will start to bring olive branches .
And Putin just did it .
He just said , " I see no evidence that Iran is building anything or has any nefarious kind of purposes with their nuclear program . "
Iran -- I mean , I`m sorry , Israel knows .
They`ll go and attack , and the whole world will say , " It`s those damn Jews again . "
HAGEE : That`s right .
That`s exactly what happened in 1981 , when the IDF destroyed the nuclear reactor in Iraq .
And that is going to happen again .
Anytime that Israel defends themselves , Israel is blamed for defending themselves .
But if they`re going to survive , they are going to have to stop this nuclear advance .
I would hope that the United States of America would join them .
Several years ago , Benjamin Netanyahu said in the offices , said in my offices , and told me that , when he was prime minister , that he carried pictorial proof to the intelligence agencies of the United States that the Russians were in Iran helping the Iranians put together missiles that had the ability to hit London , the eastern seaboard of the United States , and Jerusalem .
Now they`re trying to put together a nuclear capability to put nuclear warheads on those missiles .
And he believes that their design is to hit London , Jerusalem , and New York City in one day , to bring that chaos that will bring the 12th imam , the Mahdi , into being .
BECK : Must be nice for you .
You`re getting back on a plane this afternoon .
I have to live here .
Is there any doubt in your mind , a , that we`re not just living through another World War II ?
I mean , everybody said the same thing about Hitler .
I mean , Hitler was a bad dude , and there were a lot of signs with Hitler , as well , as just being one evil , evil dude .
Any doubt in your mind that this is the end as we know it , or is there a possibility that we`re just going to readjust here , and be able to hold things together , and conquer like we did in World War II ?
HAGEE : No .
There`s no doubt in my mind that we are living the End of Days .
None .
BECK : Any sign or anything in the Bible that talks about how disenchantment and disenfranchisement , where I feel -- I mean , you`ve got 18,000 members of your church .
Do you feel a disconnect ?
Do you feel how the people are starting to distrust everything ?
We`re disconnecting from everything .
HAGEE : There are 19,000 active members in my congregation , and I will tell you that the disconnection is very real , and especially with the government .
I have never seen the American people so disappointed and discouraged with the performance of the United States Congress .
They look at the pathetic manner in which they`ve handled the border situation .
They have not had the ability to give the American people protection .
And now , here we are in what amounts to a national security matter , because we`re trying to keep people from smuggling nuclear weapons across that border , and my mother could get across that border .
BECK : OK .
When we come back , I`m going to ask Pastor Hagee , would he vote for a Mormon ?
Next .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
BECK : We`re back with Pastor John Hagee , author of " In Defense of Israel . "
When we went to the break , I gave you a second to think about it .
Would you vote for a Mormon ?
HAGEE : I asked that exact question to the 12 leaders of my church at the Christmas banquet last year .
I said , if it comes down to a Mormon presidential candidate , would you vote for that one , or would you not vote for him because it was Hillary Clinton or someone else ?
Eleven out of 12 said , " We`ll vote for the Mormon . "
BECK : Were you the one ?
HAGEE : No , it was not me .
I said , I would vote for him , because I know him to be moral , I know him to have high principles , I know him to believe in a work ethic , I know that he has a family orientation that`s very devout , and very pure , and that is basically the social problem that`s destroying the fabric of this country right now .
The family is coming unraveled .
BECK : Did you see the speech by Ahmadinejad at the U.N. ?
Did you watch that by any chance ?
HAGEE : I just saw the front , where he was praying that the imam would manifest himself .
BECK : You should go back and watch that on the Internet .
I have to tell you , I have never broken out -- I`ve watched this guy , I`ve watched his translated speeches that he speaks to his own people .
I`ve seen this guy for years now , I`ve been following him .
I have never broken out in a cold sweat when I watched him .
I did this time around .
Because he started in -- he led with the family .
And he said , " There is a great attack happening on the family , and women are not being respected in the world . "
I mean , here`s a guy who stones women to death ...
HAGEE : Absolutely , there`s honor killings .
BECK : Right .
And he gave the most eloquent , beautiful speech about the sanctity of the family .
And I thought , if that isn`t exactly what the devil himself would do ...
HAGEE : That`s deception .
BECK : Oh , absolutely .
And people watched it -- I mean , I don`t think over here , I hope not , unless you`re at Columbia University , but people watched it and bought into it .
HAGEE : Absolutely .
BECK : That is the truth .
And that`s what the devil would do , give you the truth .
The family is breaking down , and everything else is falling apart .
HAGEE : If I had a chalkboard and about 30 minutes , I could show you that the absentee father is the basis of what`s happening in most of the crises socially of this country .
When a father , when a man goes to a woman , and they have two or three children , in marriage or out of marriage , and he walks away from that marriage , leaves the woman with the children , the woman is generally without an education that can make a living for these children , so they`re on the poverty level .
The woman then has to go to work , and it`s a very meager job .
The children are left with someone else .
They don`t have a role model .
They don`t have a core system of beliefs .
When the children become teenagers , they join the gangs , looking for the leadership that was lost in the father .
The gangs in America are pushing the drugs .
The drugs in America are pushing the prisons full .
This is all evolving back to the fact that the missing father in the American home is not there , and I say , to every man in America , being born a male is a chance , but being a man is a choice .
You should go home , be the man , provide for your wife , provide for your children .
The children are yours .
They don`t belong to the state .
Under God , you owe it to them to go home and be a good father to them .
BECK : I think that`s the first question the Lord is going to ask you on the other side of the veil .
How did you treat your wife ?
How did you treat your children ?
And if you can`t answer those positively , you are in deep trouble .
HAGEE : I`ve said to my congregation many times , if I fail as a father , I believe that I`ve failed in my life .
BECK : Let me ask you one of the most -- you were on , I don`t know , four or five days ago on the show for a quick segment , and you had mentioned that America`s not in the Bible in the End Days .
HAGEE : Yes .
BECK : It doesn`t play a significant role .
E-mail went crazy on this .
Why is America not in the Bible ?
Then it can`t be the End Times .
How could we possibly not play a role in the End Days ?
HAGEE : America`s not in the Bible , because of these things .
One , we are a brand new country .
When the Bible was written , God knew that we would be and only refers to us as the young lions of Sheba and Dedan .
Now , we came out of England .
England has the symbol of the lion .
We also -- we came from England .
So , therefore , we , by stretch , could say that`s referring to us .
Does America have a prominent place in prophecy ?
Absolutely not .
Why ?
Does that mean that we have a Democratic administration and that there`s a war in the Middle East ?
Listen .
There`s a war in the Middle East , and they say , " We`re not going back for any reason . "
BECK : Right .
Or it could be Ron Paul .
Could be Ron Paul .
HAGEE : And , well , when you have senators having all - night sessions trying to figure out a date certain to retreat from the Middle East , that`s nothing but a pep rally for the enemies of Israel , for the enemies of America .
So we are at a point in time when we must define our core values and defend them as a country .
BECK : Is there a candidate out there that you say , " This is the man " ?
HAGEE : We are looking for a candidate that is pro-Israel .
As the national chairman of Christians United for Israel -- and invite everybody in America who wants to be supportive of Israel to come and be a part of us -- we`re looking for candidates who will stand up and speak up for Israel right now .
The candidate that has done that most has been John McCain .
I`m sure that as we get by February 15th , where it is more clearly defined who the final runners are going to be , because we have a thundering political herd right now , and after these ...
BECK : You know , I bet there`s a lot of people out there , because I was like this before 9/11 .
You know , they`ve been battling on this land for 5,000 years , I don`t really care anymore .
Let them figure it out .
Why should we care about Israel ?
HAGEE : We should care about Israel , first of all , because Israel is a democratic society , and the United States of America has always defended democratic societies .
We defended England .
We defended France from Hitler .
We are now reliving history .
It`s 1938 all over again .
Iran is Germany , and Ahmadinejad is Hitler .
And Ahmadinejad has very clearly said that he intends to attack Israel .
Therefore , Iran is the snake in the Middle East that`s attacking Israel .
They have two terrorist armies , one on the north , one on the south , Hezbollah and Hamas , that are filled with weapons , bristling , waiting for a war to attack Israel .
BECK : All right .
HAGEE : We must stand by Israel .
BECK : I`ve got to tell you , this guy`s nuts .
And I only say that because he`s saying all this stuff almost word for word of what I`ve been saying for a while .
Back in a second with the lightning round .
Hopefully , that`s just a metaphor .
I`m just saying .
Pastor Hagee , playing Nostradamus for us next .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
HAGEE : Lightning flashes from east to west .
It means the storm is over .
I assure you , when Jesus comes to Earth again , the storm is going to be over !
Hallelujah for the lamb of God !
( END VIDEO CLIP )
BECK : Pastor Hagee , here we go .
Yes or no .
You ready ?
Lightning round .
HAGEE : I hope I`m ready .
BECK : Is the anti-Christ alive today ?
HAGEE : I believe he is .
BECK : End of the world as we know it in five years , 10 years , 20 years ?
HAGEE : I don`t think we`ll get past 20 years .
BECK : Putin , is he part of the biblical prophecy ?
HAGEE : I believe that he`s the man that`s going to cause Russia to unite the Islamic nations against Israel .
BECK : I think he`s done most of it already .
Worst U.S. president in history ?
HAGEE : Jimmy Carter .
BECK : I just want to shake your hand on that one .
Most evil world leader aside from Ahmadinejad ?
HAGEE : Oh , I`ll pass on that .
BECK : OK , divide Jerusalem if it would guarantee Middle East peace ?
HAGEE : Absolutely not .
I would not give Jerusalem -- giving Jerusalem to the Palestinians would be like giving it to the Taliban .
BECK : Is there more evil today in the world than any other time in history ?
HAGEE : I believe that Israel -- that evil is more apparent today , and I think that it is more practiced in our society than ever .
Yes .
BECK : What is the single most important rule in life to follow ?
HAGEE : I believe that every person must come to a saving knowledge of the lord , Jesus Christ , because the Bible and the lord , Jesus Christ , are the foundations of faith .
BECK : What TV show would Jesus watch ?
HAGEE : He probably wouldn`t .
BECK : Wrong answer .
I mean , wrong answer .
HAGEE : GLENN BECK !
BECK : There you go , and you heard it .
Sir , it has been a pleasure meeting you and a pleasure having you on the program .
The book is " In Defense of Israel , " and it is much more than what we have talked about here .
Thank you very much , sir .
HAGEE : It `s been my pleasure .
BECK : You bet .
HAGEE : Bless you for what you do .
BECK : Thank you .
We`ll be back .
Thank you .
America , good night .

One of the jurors in the trial , which last Thursday awarded $ 222,000 in punitive damages against a Minnesota mother of two , spoke in an interview with Wired ’s Threat Level about the decision they made .
The juror , Michael Hegg , a steelworker that claims he has never been on the Internet , said it took just five minutes to reach the verdict .
However hours were spent deciding , or ‘ bickering ’ as to how much to award to the plaintiffs in punitive damages , no actual damages were awarded , because none were sought .
Hegg ’s statement , that “ we wanted to send a message that you do n’t do this , that you have been warned , ” sends a message of it ’s own , that the double - talking tactics of the industry groups is working .
Potentially more serious though , are the hints given by him that it was never going to be a fair trial .
For someone who has never been on the internet , he , for instance , responded to claims of spoofing , and of possibly being a zombie system as “ Spoofing ?
We ’re thinking , ‘ Oh my God , you got to be kidding . ’ ”
We discussed these statements with Andrew Norton , spokesperson for the Pirate Party of the US , which was not happy with some of the actions in this trial .
“ The attitudes and responses of this jury member shows that , whilst the litigation strategy may be a ‘ Money Pit ’ , the misleading PR campaigns are having an effect , to the point where they are undermining the ability to allow anyone a fair trial for these alleged offenses .
It ’s also clear from what he has said that the jury disregarded some of the facts presented to them by witnesses , such as the hard drive in question was replaced because it was faulty , not in relation to the trial . ”
He also added , “ This jury clearly came into the trial with its mind made up , undoubtedly thanks to propaganda such as the “ You would n’t steal a … “ advertising campaign that has been running for a number of years , which incorrectly associates downloading with theft . ”
The Jury also ignored a lot of precedent in other similar cases , or was not made aware of it .
This is highlighted by Hegg ’s assertion that the Kazaa screenshot , showing millions of Kazaa users , sharing hundreds of millions of ‘ songs ’ ( potentially oblivious that a small percentage of those users and a large percentage of those files were the agents of the plaintiffs , and their fake files ) established that Kazaa ’s raison d’Ã ªtre was for file - sharing , something no - one has ever questioned .
His logical leap , however , that file - sharing is copyright infringement is one not shared by courts elsewhere , ( affirmed in trials such as Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios , Inc. , 464 U.S. 417 ( 1984 ) and A & M Records , Inc. v. Napster , Inc. , 239 F.3d 1004 ( 2001 ) amongst others . )
Yet , the biggest surprise of all , and one that could come back to haunt the RIAA , is that no actual damages were claimed .
This may have been because it would have been hard to establish an actual figure , backed up sufficiently to the courts requirements , but will make it hard to claim , in future , that they are losing money .
If Ms. Thomas , with all the evidence they had against her caused them no actual financial damage , then it will be hard for them to claim anyone else has cost them either .
Of course , when your misinformation strategy means you get the punitive damages anyway , does it really matter ?
I n Belgium , you can buy jam in returnable jars , and once I finished my jar , and was cleaning it , and in the glass at the bottom was " 3/8 L " .
And this sort of threw me , because I was a big metric fan , and the great advantage of the metric system was that it got rid of all those silly fractions .
So why were they using them here in metric - land ?
Then I figured the jar was only so big , so it took up less space to print 3/8 L rather than 0.375 L.
But there was another possibility .
That being that although the metric system looks good on paper , people / society finds fractions useful .
So ok , we have the metric system for important stuff , but for certain situations , fractions will be used .
So then , I 'm slowly picking up some Dutch , and we go out for beers , and Filip is always asking for " A Pincha " , and I find out that actually he 's saying " a pintje " , meaning " a small pint " .
So here we are in metric land , and people are ordering their beers with English terms !
This is really throwing me , and I say , yeah but Filip , it 's not a pint , it 's 250 milliliters !
Why do you call it a pint ?
You 've got the metric system , why do n't you use it ?
Why do n't you order in metric ?
You do n't need those silly English measurements , you have New and Improved Metric units .
When you go into a cafe , instead of shouting " Een Pintje Alstublieft " you should say , two - hundred - and - fifty - milliliters alstublieft . "
He just gave me a strange look , and mumbled something about it being too hard to say .
And ok , maybe giving the precise amount of milliliters is a bit extreme , but he could at least say , " A quarter liter alstublieft . "
But then maybe even that would be too difficult after lots of beer , so maybe just giving that one unit a name makes sense .
But then that means that something screwy is going on .
Not only are the Europeans turning the metric system back into fractions , but they 're giving names to them !
We change everything into metric , then people find it more useful to use fractions , and then they give names to these fractions , and before you know it , we 're back where we started from !
Then I got fired from my job in Brussels , or was asked to resign , or whatever you want to call it , I had LOTS of free time and not much to do .
I read what I could find , but since my French and Dutch were so bad , this consisted of reading cookbooks .
So I was reading these cooking books , and it was weird , because these recipes would have " half a cup " of one thing , and an " eet - lapel " or " koffie - lapel " of something else .
I said , " Hey Filip , what 's an eet - lapel ? "
And he told me it's an eating spoon ( which is really a soup spoon ) , and a koffie lapel is a coffee spoon , like the English teaspoons .
And I say , " But hey , we 're in metric - land !
Dat gaat niet ! "
And he says , " Of course we use the metric system , but in that one case , they 're just writing it that way for the easiness of the people . " ( i.e. , to make it easy on everyone ) .
So then I go to my mother - in - law - to - be , and I say , " Hey , these recipes call for cup of something , how much is that exactly ? "
And she pulls out her cup that she drinks coffee from to show me , and I say , " Yeah , but are n't different cups sometimes different sizes ? "
And then she said , " Ja zeker ! "
And she took me to her china cabinet and showed me all the different cups she has and all the different sizes there are .
And then I said , " Yeah but Francine , does n't this like , ever become a problem in knowing exactly how much to use ? " and she shrugged her shoulders and nodded !
So that means the European kitchens are less precise than American and English .
They just take any old cup , any old spoon !
So where is the advantage of being metric ?
Then Filip says , yeah , but MOST recipes do n't call for volumes , they call for weights , and this is true .
BUT , how do you WEIGH a teaspoon of basil ?!?
How about a quarter teaspoon of nutmeg ?!?
And now he 's going to baking school , and you should see him trying to weigh out his salt on our scale that I only use for weighing mail .
It 's so sad !
Then I get out my Joy of Cooking , and all these crazy units sort of start to make sense , to fit together .
There are even conversions between weight / volume and length like in the metric system .
A pint weighs a pound , and is 3 inches cubed .
Half a pint is a cup , half of that is half a cup , half of that is a quarter cup , half of that is 2 tablespoons , and half of that is one tablespoon , and all these units in an ENGLISH kitchen can be measured out .
Then I start to realize that for length there is a similar problem in the metric system , in that you can't divide a meter continuously by 2 without getting fractions .
In the English system , the rulers are divided by quarters and eighths and 16ths , but the metric ruler is divided into units of ten , so any fraction of that you just have to guess .
It is IMPOSSIBLE to divide a meter by three , because you get 0.333333333 etc meters ; using the metric ruler , a third on a metric meter does n't exist !
So then I start to think , hey , THAT'S why there are 12 inches in a foot , you can divide all sorts of ways , by 2 , by 3 , by 4 , by 6 , no problem !
Cool !
We have this friend who is a carpenter , and I see him , and I say , " Hey , Freddie , when you have a board a meter long , how do you divide it into 3 ? "
And he sort of gives me a funny look , and says why would he want to do that .
And I say , well , " How does that work ?
Because in the metric system , a third of a meter is n't marked on your ruler so what do you do ?
Do n't you ever have a board of one meter that you have to divide by three ? "
And he says , " No . "
And I 'm sort of crestfallen , and then he adds , we do n't buy boards by the meter , the standard lengths they sell are in 120 centimeters .
!!!!!
SO now there is a NEW unit of measurement , call it the - standard - length - that - carpenters - buy - their - wood - in , and it is 120 centimeters !
The THICKNESS of the wood is even in a number that is easily divisible , that is , 2.4 centimeters , and they call that a thumb !
How long before the length of 120 centimeters has a name all to itself , and how long before some lunatic is going to come along , and say , " Hey , this - here is darn CONFUSING having that - there unit being 120 centimeters , and this - here unit being 2.4 , we need a NEW measurement system , one where everything is in units of ten ! "
So this is getting really interesting , and I head to the library , and look up measurement , and ALL THROUGH HISTORY , societies have used units of measurements that are evenly divisible at least 3 ways .
Now we have this great metric system , and we can only divide by 2 and 5 without getting a fraction .
Progress ?
Whassat ?
Ok , and then there is the temperature thing .
I always liked science because it was the one field of study that would be consistent throughout the world .
I always found it a waste of time to study French or botany , because if , for example , you were on a desert island , these French words or plant names would n't do you any good .
Science on the other hand was ( WAS , past tense ) a kind of ultimate truth for me , and this desert island thing used to be a kind of test as to whether something was valuable .
And it appears I 'm not alone , because last time I was in America , I was voicing my opinion on the metric system , and someone said , " If I were on a desert island , I 'd use a system that was divisible by ten . "
And I said , " But would your number system be based on ten ? "
The ONLY advantage of the metric system is that it can easily be written because we write our numbers in base ten .
But that does n't mean that if you were on a desert island YOUR number system would be in base ten .
In fact , if you were on a desert island , and you needed a ruler , you would n't be ABLE to generate a precise system on base ten , because you 'd have to estimate where to put the markings on the ruler !
What you 'd have to do is take your ruler , and divide it in half , and that in half , and put the markings THERE , and you 'd end up with a ruler divided into 16 or 32 or 64 or something , but not ten !
And for thermometers , it seems that is precisely what Fahrenheit was up to .
Fahrenheit was playing around and playing around and finally set ice water at 32 , and body temperature at 96 , so that there were 64 divisions between the two .
That way , no matter where you are in the world , you can re-generate his thermometer .
You stick the thermometer in ice water , and mark it there .
Then you stick it under your tongue , and mark it there .
Then you get a string , and fold it in half 6 times , and you have the 64 divisions between 32 and 96 !
It was only after Fahrenheit died that body temperature was changed to 98.6 .
And this being because the boiling point of water was later deemed more reliable than body temperature .
So boiling water was set at 212 , and that made 180 " degrees " between it and the freezing point of water .
But whoever made that change was probably completely ignorant of the problems Fahrenheit had gone through calibrating his thermometers .
Then the French Revolution came around , and a bunch of intellectuals were sitting around .
And these intellectual types , they are n't sitting in labs , or making things , DOING measurements , they just looking at the measurements on paper .
So to them , all these fractions were a pain in the ass , and they decided that everything should be changed .
So they spent SIX YEARS deciding how long a meter should be , and then passed all sorts of laws REQUIRING everyone to use the measurements ; people were FINED for not using them !
So then we had a new thermometer , in degrees Celsius .
Then hot air balloons were getting popular and Boyle and Charles were playing around and trying to figure out how temperature affects volume and pressure of gases .
But there was one hitch , that is , they wanted to be able to divide by the temperature of the gas .
This was a problem whenever the temperature was zero .
So eventually a number was found that could be added to the measured temperature so that all their equations would work out nicely , and this new temperature was called Kelvin .
Then a bunch of intellectuals came around once more , and decide that these gas laws , instead of being a TOOL , used to DESCRIBE the properties of gas , that these laws were some kind of ultimate truth .
And then they decided that since the equations wo n't work at zero Kelvin , that nothing can possible exist at that temperature !
And now that 's what they teach us in physics class !
I HATE that !
If the fields of science and history even overlapped a little bit , we MIGHT be able to move in a direction we refer to as " progress " , but the way it is now is completely ridiculous .
Any praise for the metric system hits a raw nerve with me .
The metric system is a symbol to me of the division of the ruling class and the people doing all the work .
The ruling class ( no pun intended ) makes all these rules that are completely impractical , and everyone else has to sort of make due , find their way around it .
The metric system also symbolizes to me this blind faith we have in science , that science is some kind of ultimate truth , instead of a tool we use to make life easier for ourselves .
And because of this blind faith we have , " science " ends up making life harder , less practical for ourselves .
JERUSALEM , Dec. 4  Israel today took a darker view of Iran ’s nuclear ambitions than the assessment released by United States intelligence agencies yesterday , saying it was convinced that Iran was pursuing nuclear weapons .
It said Iran had probably resumed the nuclear weapons program the American report said was stopped in the fall of 2003 .
“ It is apparently true that in 2003 Iran stopped pursuing its military nuclear program for a certain period of time , ” Defense Minister Ehud Barak told Israeli Army Radio .
“ But in our estimation , since then it is apparently continuing with its program to produce a nuclear weapon . ”
Israel led the reaction around the world today to the new intelligence assessment released in the United States on Monday that Iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 .
Iran welcomed the report .
“ It is natural that we welcome it , ” the Iranian foreign minister , Manouchehr Mottaki , told state - run radio .
“ Some of the same countries which had questions or ambiguities about our nuclear program are changing their views realistically . ”
First world countries are addicted to their disposable , aka “ landfill ” diapers .
According to Planet Trash , “ Americans alone go through around 18 billion disposable diapers a year . ”
A Canadian company wants to turn all those dirty diapers into a cost - effective , diesel fuel .
Using the process of pyrolysis to convert diapers to diesel , a facility is going to be built in Montreal .
Pyrolysis , also known as thermal cracking , involves heating the dirty diapers in a closed environment that lacks oxygen .
This closed system does not produce any emissions .
Luciano Piciacchia , an engineer and vice - president with Amec ’s Quebec office , explains ,
Then you ’re bringing it to the next level which is breaking the carbon chains down … and ( in the end ) they will resemble the fuels which are what we ’re going to end up producing .
The company plans to begin collecting soiled diapers from area hospitals .
“ One of the beauties of the diaper is that it is going to be a very consistent input , ” compared to trying to make fuel from other kinds municipal waste .
According to cnews ,
The initial plan is to convert about 30,000 tonnes of diapers , about one - quarter of the diapers that end up in landfills in Quebec yearly .
Piciacchia says that number of diapers will translate into about 11,000 tonnes of diesel fuel .
The preliminary economic analysis pegs the cost of the fuel at 50 cents per litre .
The company hopes to have the dirty diaper fuel facility up within 18 months .
The diaper diesel can be used in any industrial application , but it probably wo n’t be suitable for cars .
Thank goodness , can you imagine the exhaust fumes ?

Sex abstinence programmes are popular in the US
The Oxford University team reviewed 13 US trials involving over 15,000 people aged 10 to 21 .
They found abstinence programmes had no negative or positive impact on the rates of sex infections or unprotected sex , the British Medical Journal said .
Abstinence programmes are popular in the US and have supporters in the UK .
A UK branch of the US Silver Ring
Thing was set up four years ago to promote sexual abstinence among young people .
Abstinence - only programmes do n't work because they provide no safety net for those young people who do have a sexual relationship - and research shows that many do

However , such groups have so far failed to gain the foothold they have in the US where a third of the President 's HIV budget is given to abstinence programmes .
The latest study , which included trials comparing young people attending abstinence - only programmes against those receiving no sex education , raises questions over whether they work in developed countries .
Researchers found none of the abstinence - only programmes had an impact on the age at which individuals lost their virginity , whether they had unprotected sex , the number of sexual partners , the rates of sexually transmitted diseases or the number of pregnancies .
One trial did show a short - term benefit with participants reporting that they were less likely to have had sex in the month following one abstinence - only programme .
But the researchers said this finding was offset by six other trials that showed the programmes had no effect on the participants ' recent sex lives .
Another trial even showed that participants in abstinence - only programmes were significantly more likely to report pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease , compared to participants using the usual services .
However , other studies did not show this .
Effective
This compared to programmes that promote the use of condoms which greatly reduce the risk of HIV , the BMJ reported .
Lead author Kristen Underhill said : " Our analysis suggests that abstinence - only programmes that aim to prevent HIV are not effective .
" This finding has key implications for policy and practice , especially in the US , where abstinence - only programmes receive both federal and state funding . "
Genevieve Clark , of the Terrence Higgins Trust , said : " Young people need to know that they can say no to sex , just as they need to know how to protect themselves from pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections if they decide that a sexual relationship is right for them .
" But abstinence - only programmes do n't work because they provide no safety net for those young people who do have a sexual relationship - and research shows that many do . "
And Ivan Blake , of the young people 's sexual health charity Brook , added : " There are even studies which show they can make things worse as people do not have the knowledge or confidence to have safe sex . "

It should n't matter if you support any of these candidates .
Disney 's ABC network is acting in an anti-democratic , anti-American way .
We must send them a message .
Disney has contributed to four Dem candidates .
Disney 's ABC network is only allowing those four Dem candidates to participate in the New Hampshire debate and disallowing the participation of Dennis Kucinich and Mike Gravel , and on the Republican side , is excluding Duncan Hunter .
Who the hell is Disney / ABC to tell American voters who they should listen to ?
They had threatened to exclude Ron Paul , but apparently , he met their arbitrary performance criteria in Iowa .
Back in 1992 , Bill Clinton only pulled 3 % in Iowa .
I wonder if they would have excluded him from a New Hampshire debate , given their current attitude .
This is taking media interference in the election process to an intolerable , obscene new level .
How do you spell a -d - v-e - r - t - i-s - e - r b-o-y - c-o- t -t ?
Recently , Ron Paul supporters were encouraged to sell their stock in Fox News Corp ( Paul Supporters Fight Back -- Dump Fox News ) .
How effective we could be if only we were sitting on vast hordes of Disney stock !
Until recently , corporations were legally forbidden from influencing elections in any way .
Only a few years ago , the FCC had a mandate to regulate .
This move by ABC is not the first .
NBC blocked Mike Gravel from their Philadelphia debate .
But this is the worst case yet .
It should not be allowed to stand .
AP reports ,
Democratic presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich filed a complaint with the FCC on Friday after ABC News excluded him , fellow Democrat Mike Gravel and Republican Duncan Hunter from its prime - time debates on Saturday .
Kucinich argued that ABC is violating equal - time provisions by keeping him out of the debate and noted that ABC 's parent Walt Disney Co. had contributed to campaigns involving the four Democrats who were invited .
" ABC should not be the first primary , " the Ohio congressman said in papers filed at the Federal Communications Commission .
The AP article also reported ABC 's rationale .
The network set rules to narrow the field .
Candidates had to meet at least one of three criteria : place first through fourth in Iowa , poll 5 percent or higher in one of the last four major New Hampshire surveys , or poll 5 percent or higher in one of the last four major national surveys .
Disney / ABC has no right to set these arbitrary criteria .
If Dodd and Biden had not withdrawn from the race , ABC could have been rejecting five legitimate candidates .

The last two questions are really easy , but for those of you who have n’t yet thought of how computers count , it ’s really simple .
Computers count inside their case , with no oversight , just like they are told to do , unless of course , they malfunction or are hacked .
You have courageously spoken out against touch screen voting .
But , in case this is the first time someone else reading this has thought about how votes are counted on computers , they do n’t understand that computers count in secret , or they think that fears about votes being counted on computers are unfounded , take a minute and think about three things : ( 1 ) How does a computer count votes ?
( 2 ) Do computers sometimes malfunction ?
and ( 3 ) Do you have any security measures on your computer to protect against hackers ?
Senator Edwards : I heard your call for eliminating touch screen voting machines .
Of course , being from South Carolina you are certainly aware of its use of the notoriously unreliable iVotronic touch screen voting machines .
Last Friday afternoon , I looked into South Carolina ’s use of these infamous voting machines , and I discovered that it ’s PROHIBITED by South Carolina ’s Constitution .
Some of the key information from my article " South Carolina Elections Are UNCONSTITUTIONAL !?! " published on Monday January 14 , 2008 on OpEdNews.com follows .
Article II , § 1 of the Constitution of South Carolina states , " the ballots shall not be counted in secret . "
Although there is case law which supports the right to have votes counted in public , this is the election integrity jackpot , a Constitutional provision prohibiting counting votes in secret !
No more need to refer to case law , evidence , or logic to argue against secret vote counting , at least in South Carolina .
The cat is out of the bag .
The people know about these problems , and they are becoming more and more aware of the damage that has resulted from them .
Those few of you who still think that we can trust having our votes counted in secret will be happy to know that your view is shared by many powerful and influential people .
For example , Joseph Stalin said , " Those who cast the votes decide nothing .
Those who count the votes decide everything . "
If you want to roll back the evolution of civilization from citizen influence over government to a form of feudalism , then you might as well quit reading now .
South Carolina is the best opportunity to make a case against allowing computers to count the votes in secret .
I ’ve discussed this with two leading election law advocates who have also brought election contests , Paul Lehto and Andi Novick .
They both think that this is the best opportunity to act that they have seen .
The South Carolina Constitution prohibits secret vote counting !
The election reform community EXPECTS one of the Presidential candidates to take action .
I ’ve already heard from four , now five , radio shows that want me to come on as a guest speaker this week to discuss this issue .
I ’ll be on two shows tonight .
This was discussed on Voice of the Voters last night .
Congressman Kucinich has a lot of support in the election reform movement , and he might take action on this .
He came out against the Holt bill after meeting with me last summer .
Now , we have a new Holt bill which is better , but it still has some shortcomings .
Congressman Ron Paul has been a consistent defender of Constitutional rights .
It would seem like he would jump on this case .
Maybe he is working on it , but he did n’t ask for a recount in New Hampshire .
Also , he ’s running out of time , and he does n’t have your legendary trial skills and legal team .
You could sit back and wait to see whether someone else takes legal action , then join in or sit by and just speak in support of another ’s effort .
If so , you lose the opportunity to take the lead and grab the spotlight in the effort to stand up for the rule of law and the right to have our votes counted accurately .
Most importantly , if you act before the Republican primary , you can make it a non-partisan issue .
You would be working to help make sure that even Republicans ’ constitutional rights are respected .
Certainly , that would make the Daily Show as well as all of the late night shows .

It will be really short post about using set of free tools to implement fully functional flash video streaming server .
So , what we are going to get at the end of our setup ?
We are going to get some type of completely free streaming support that is available with Macromedia ’s non-free Flash Communication Server ( Flash Media Server ) ( FCS ) . 🙂
First our step as in any video streaming technology will be to prepare some videos for streaming by converting them to specific video format called “ Flash Video ” ( flv ) and adding some meta - information there to make stream rewind posible .
There lots of small articles in Internet , that saying “ just use ffmpeg tool and everything will be fine ” , but I should say “ no ” to these articles authors .
Ffmpeg sucks because it supports only small subset of input video formats and we do n’t want to do any transcoding of original video to some video formats that ffmpeg can handle ( it takes lots of resources , etc ) .
So , my choice for video transcoding is really cool free software called mplayer , that has converting utility mencoder and can handle almost any original format and convert video file to flv format very quickly .
First of all you will need to get mplayer sources from mplayer we site and compile them .
I will not describe how to do it because there are lots of articles about this process , but I want to get your attention to simple fact :
Try to minimize set of disabled video codecs in compile time by installing all required libraries from your distribution repositories or from sources , because more codecs you will have , more videos you will be able to handle ” .
When you ’ve installed your mplayer / mencoder tools , you will need to install Ruby language interpreter to be able to run flvtool2 software .
Please , ensure , that you have 1.8.4 + version of Ruby .
Next step is to install flvtool2 – tool , that allows us to inject meta- information to video files to make possible video stream rewinds in flash players .
You can get it from its home page , but I would suggest you to install this software from SVN repository as described on its home page .
Small notice : current version of flvtool2 has really annoying bug , that prevents it from working with mencoder generated flv files .
When you are trying to use it , you ’ll get something like this :
1
/usr/local/lib/site_ruby/1.8/flv/amf_string_buffer.rb:163 : [ BUG ] Segmentation fault
To solve this problem you can go to lib / flv/amf_string_buffer.rb file in flvtool2 source tree and change line 163 from
write [ ( time.to_i * 1000.0 ) ] . pack ( 'G ' )
to
write [ ( time.to_f * 1000.0 ) ] . pack ( 'G ' )
I want to say BIG THANKS to Dmytro Steflyuk for this fix .
So , as for now you are ready to convert your movies from any video format to flv .
You can use following set of command to produce file for streaming :
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12

$ mencoder \\

v4mv:cbp:last_pred=3 -vop scale=320:240
....
....
$ flvtool2 - UP dest_file.flv
...
This set of commands will convert orig_file.ext
file to dest_file.flv and will add meta flash information there .
Last thing you should do is to get Lighttpd web server from their site and install it .
Then , enable flv-streaming module in its config and you ’ll be able to use any flash player , that understands flash streaming idea to create your own Youtube and to get your our own billion of US dollars . 😉
And to thank author of this article , you can simply support it on digg.com .
Notice : Read my new article about flash streaming “ Flash Video ( FLV ) Streaming with Nginx ” to learn , how to implement streaming server with nginx .
" " Most elite tactical combat group , the Delta Force .
Michael Sugrue / Getty Images
Consider a special operations force that 's trained to the highest level in the United States military .
The force is armed with cutting - edge weaponry , well - funded and answers only to one man .
How can a group -- trained as professional assassins and approaching the status of mercenaries -- be reeled in if the U.S. government wo n't even confirm that the group exists ?
Does such a force make the United States safer or more vulnerable ?
It 's questions like these that swirl around the United States ' most elite tactical combat group , the Delta Force .
Delta Force is often referred to as Special Forces Operational Detachment - Delta .
It 's also known as the Combat Applications Group ( CAG ) .
While it often draws its ranks from the Army Special Forces ( the Army Green Berets ) and shares Fort Bragg , N.C. , headquarters with them , it is n't an Army Special Forces detachment .
Delta
Force is a unit unto itself , composed of members from all branches of the military .

They 're not called soldiers , but operators and are said to shun the traditional philosophies of military life .
They wear civilian clothes .
They work for whomever needs them -- for the Army , the FBI and the CIA .
Mark Bowden , author of the book " Blackhawk Down " -- for which he interviewed several Delta Force members -- famously said of the operators , " They are professional soldiers who hate the Army " [ source : Military.com ] .
It must be said that neither the United States government nor the military officially acknowledges the existence of Delta Force .
To this end , almost all of the information contained in this article is unsupported by any official reports from the United States .
It 's only in recent years that vague references by the government to the group 's existence have been allowed to go uncensored .
These references have turned up in transcripts from Congressional hearings and biographies of high - ranking military leaders .
But it 's nearly impossible to keep a force so deadly and made up of the stuff of legends entirely under wraps .
Since its inception in 1977 , stories of the Delta Force 's exploits and missions have leaked out , little by little , eventually forming a brief sketch of the unit .
In 1993 , Delta Force came under the microscope when its operators were among those who fought and died in a failed operation to remove a Somali warlord .
And in Operation Urgent Fury in Grenada in 1983 , reports of two missions by Delta Force -- one failed and one successful -- have become common knowledge [ source : SOC ] .
But the group has been criticized for undertaking missions that are on the fringe of regular laws governing the military .
This causes some to worry that Delta Force has more power and less accountability than any military organization in a free democracy should .
Delta
Force is funded out of secret government accounts , away from the public eye , and is believed to answer only to the president .
But others claim that its purpose -- maintaining the United States ' role as a leading power and as the world 's police force -- necessitates the lack of restrictions and accountability surrounding its activities .
In the next section , we 'll look at how the Delta Force is structured .
Neil Gaiman gives an excellent little monologue about H.P. Lovecraft and the Cthulhu mythos .
He rightly mentions a fact a lot of Lovecraft fans gloss over : that H.P. was a downright amateurish writer a lot of the times .
What most people are fans of is not Lovecraft , but Lovecraft ’s ideas , his vision of humanity being weak and helpless and surrounded by malevolent cosmic evil .
Yes , there are gods .
We are not alone in the universe .
But our gods hate us .
And , as Gaiman puts it , we ’re totally screwed .

The High Court has refused an application for the extradition to the US of a Co Cork couple to face charges of kidnapping their grandson .
Tim and Ethel Blake , both 60 years old , from Lower Midleton Street , Cobh , are wanted in the US for the alleged aggravated kidnapping of their now 11 - year - old grandson in July 2004 .
Their grandson is now back living with his mother in Winthrop Harbour near Chicago in Illinois .
This morning Mr Justice Michael Peart refused an application for the couple 's extradition , in what he described as a very unusual case .
He said he was rejecting all but one of the grounds put forward by the couple in opposition to their extradition - that of proportionality of the minimum sentence they would face if convicted of the crime in the US .
The Blakes showed little reaction when the judgement was given in court .
Afterwards , outside the court , their solicitor said on their behalf that they were relieved that it was over , and added that it had been a difficult time .
He said they were looking forward to getting back to Cobh and getting on with their lives .
The couple also thanked all those who had helped and supported them .
Family dispute
The Blakes ' grandson had lived with them at their home in Cobh until he was aged more than four .
In 1999 the Blakes travelled with their grandson to the US to see their daughter , who is the boy 's mother .
Once there , however , his mother refused to let the boy go back to Ireland , and so he remained in the US .
The Blakes were concerned about the conditions in which their daughter was living at the time .
In 2001 they sought and were granted guardians of their grandson , who was made a ward of court by the Cork Circuit Court .
But they were subsequently unsuccessful in getting an order in the US courts allowing them to bring their grandson back to Ireland .
In July 2004 the Blakes travelled again to visit their grandson and daughter in Illinois .
When they returned they brought the boy back with them .
They were subsequently accused of kidnapping and if they had been convicted in a US court faced a mandatory minimum sentence of six years , and a maximum sentence of 30 years .
Their grandson was subsequently sent back to his mother in the US in November of 2004 .
During the extradition hearing earlier this month , the High Court was told by counsel for the State that the case was a ' very emotional ' matter arising out of protracted family differences .
But the State argued the problems could not be taken into account in the extradition hearing , which was both ' legitimate and relevant ' .
In response , counsel for the Blakes argued that neither the couple 's grandson , nor his mother now wanted to see them extradited .
The boy 's mother had written to the US authorities pleading with them not to prosecute her parents , the court was told .
The couple 's counsel also argued that extraditing them would be a breach of their constitutional rights .
A 17 - year - old girl reported Saturday that four neo -Nazis attacked her and carved a swastika into her skin .
Police were investigating the teenager 's allegation that the men attacked her after she tried to help a 6 - year - old girl from the former Soviet Union who was being harassed by the group in the eastern town of Mittweida .
The four suspects allegedly threw the teenager on the ground and three of them pressed her down while the fourth one carved a swastika on her hip with a scalpel - like knife , police said .
The incident occurred November 3rd , but the 17 - year - old girl did not report it immediately , police said .
The younger girl confirmed the attack , they said .
The identities of the suspects and the two girls were not revealed , and there have been no arrests .
One 19 - year - old suspect was briefly detained , then released , police said .
In the eastern German town of Cottbus , meanwhile , a court convicted a far right political activist of using the stiff - armed Nazi salute , which is banned in Germany , and sentenced him to six months in prison .
During the trial , 71 - year - old former lawyer Horst Mahler , a strategist for the far - right National Democratic Party , confessed to giving the Nazi salute when he reported to prison a year ago after a conviction in a separate case .
He has appeared in court frequently over the years , and this was his fifth conviction for either displaying banned Nazi symbols or denying the Holocaust , the court said .
In 2003 , a Mainz court found Mahler guilty of condoning a crime for saying the September 11th , 2001 attacks in the United States were justified and fined him several thousand dollars .

Answers :
1. United States oil production has been increasing at about 2 % per year since 1960 .
Answer : False
Above is a graph ( Figure 1 ) of US oil production .
The blue line shows US 48 states total production ; the red line shows the US total , including Alaska .
A person can see from this graph that oil production for the United States reached a peak in 1970 , then began declining .
The addition of oil from Alaska allowed production to reach a second lower peak in 1985 , after which it began to decline again .
The current rate of decline is about 2 % per year .
In most areas , oil production initially rises , then declines after about 50 % of the available oil in the area has been recovered .
For example , Figure 2 shows a graph of production from the North Sea ( that is , near Norway and Great Britain ) .
Production grew for several years , then reached a peak and began declining in 1999 .
If the United States does additional drilling in new locations , such as Alaska National Wildlife Refuge , or Jack 2 , or along the outer continental shelf near Florida , geologists expect that US oil production ( Figure 1 ) will show a modest increase for a few years , but will not approach the level of production seen in 1970 or 1985 .
2. Saudi Arabia is currently the largest producer of oil in the world .
Answer : False .
Saudi Arabia was the largest producer of oil up until 2005 , but its production recently has been declining .
Russia is now the largest producer of oil .
In 2006 , Saudi Arabia produced 9,152,000 barrels per day while Russia produced 9,246,000 barrels per day , based on March 2007 US Energy Information Agency data .
Saudi Arabia is the still the largest oil exporter .
While Russia produces more , its population is greater , so it has less to export .
3 . Each country publishes information about its reserves .
This gives us pretty good information about future oil production .
Answer : False
There are three reasons the published reserve numbers give very poor information about expected future production :
1. Reserve numbers appear to be seriously overstated for some countries , based on geological information from other sources .
This is particularly an issue for Mideastern countries , such as Saudi Arabia and Iran .
Questions have also been raised with respect to Russia ’s reserves .
Since reserve data is unaudited , there is no direct way of checking the accuracy of the reported amounts .
2 . Even if oil is theoretically available , the amount of production in any one year may be very low because of technical issues .
If oil is very thick , as in the Oil Sands of Canada and in Venezuela , it may be impractical to recover more than a very small percentage in any one year , because of the large inputs of heat ( usually from natural gas ) and fresh water required .
Oil that is in very deep water , or that is in an area near icebergs , may also be difficult to recover very quickly , because of the need for special equipment .
3 . Even if the oil is in the ground , a country can choose to delay production until later .
We are used to countries producing as much oil as they can sell .
If it becomes clear that there will be an oil shortage in future years , countries may decided to husband their resources ( keep part of their oil in the ground , in case they need it later ) .
4 . The following were the largest oil producing countries in 2005 : Saudi Arabia , Russia , United States , Iran , China , Mexico , Norway , and Venezuela .
Of these , which showed declining production in 2006 ?
Answer : c. Six of the eight : Saudi Arabia , United States , Iran , Mexico , Norway , and Venezuela , as shown in Figure 3 below .
The fact that six of the eight largest oil producers have declining oil production in the first 10 months of 2006 is of concern because oil production in an area tends to rise for several years , and then decline year after year , once geological limits are reached .
The fact that these six countries are showing declining production could mean than many ( or all ) of them have reached the point of geological decline , and thus can be expected to show declining production in the future .
It is also possible that some of the declines in production are due to temporary situations , such as intentional reduction of production or equipment breakdowns .
On the exhibit , we note that the United States , Mexico , and Norway have all indicated that their production declines are for geological reasons , and thus can be expected to continue .
The situation is less clear for Saudi Arabia , Iran , and Venezuela , all of which are members of OPEC .
The reason the comparison in Figure 3 is made for the first 10 months of 2006 , rather than the whole year , is because OPEC announced a reduction in production as of November 1 , and cutting off the data at October 31 eliminates this potential distortion .
Thus , this exhibit shows that even before the announced cutbacks , the three large OPEC producers ( Saudi Arabia , Iran , and Venezuela ) were all showing declining production .
5 . Increases in Canadian oil production as a result of developing the Canadian Oil Sands can be expected to offset declines in oil production elsewhere .
Answer : b. False
If we look at production from the Canadian Oil Sands , we find that it is only a tiny percentage of world production — 0.8 % of world production in 1998 , rising to 1.2 % of world production in 2005 , after billions of dollars of investment .
Oil from the Oil Sands is extremely difficult to produce .
Production requires large inputs of fresh water and natural gas , both of which are in short supply .
There is also a shortage of workers and housing for workers .
There is discussion about eventually replacing part of the natural gas with nuclear energy , but this will not overcome all of the difficulties .
Given how low production is today , and how slow it has been to scale up , it seems unlikely that production will ever be large enough to offset a significant oil production shortfall elsewhere .
Production of Oil Shale in the Western United States is expected to be even more challenging than Oil Sands production .
The concentration of potential fossil fuel is much lower in Oil Shale than in Oil Sands , so even more production problems of the type encountered with Oil Sands can be expected .
Given the slow progress with Oil Sands , Oil Shale seems even less likely to offset a major oil shortage .
6 . If oil production in an oil - exporting country declines by , say , 5 % per year , oil exports are expected to decline by a similar amount .
Answer : b. False
When a country increases its oil production , its internal usage tends to rise even faster than exports , as the population grows and some of the wealth filters down to the citizens of the country .
When the oil production starts to decline , residents expect to continue their standard of living .
As a result , countries tend to keep their own consumption at close to the same level , and reduce exports .
This pattern was true for the United States when its production began to fall , and it seems to be happening in a number of other countries .
Given these considerations , if a country ’s oil production decreases by 5 % , we should expect that country ’s exports will decrease by more than 5 % .
7. Geologists are in agreement that worldwide oil production can be expected to continue to rise , at least until 2030 .
Answer : b. False
We have already seen evidence that in a given area , oil production tends to rise for a number of years , then decline .
Most geologists believe that on a worldwide basis , production will also eventually begin to decline .
Opinions vary as to when the decline will begin .
Typical dates are between 2007 and 2012 , although some believe the decline will not begin until 2020 or later .
One reason why geologists are predicting a decline in production is the fact that oil discoveries ( excluding Oil Sands , Oil Shale , and other “ unconventional ” sources ) began declining over 40 years ago .
The fields that have been found recently , including the much publicized Jack 2 field , tend to be fewer and smaller than the fields found years ago .
While geologists generally believe that oil production will begin to decline in only a few years , governmental agencies , like the US Energy Information Agency , are projecting that oil production growth will continue until at least 2030 .
Some of the independent oil companies are also projecting long - term growth in production .
Economists have had a surprisingly large say in this discussion .
Their view is that it does n’t matter whether oil production begins to decline or not .
They believe that oil is like any other commodity , and that substitutes will be found .
They also believe that scarcity will lead to higher prices which will lead to greater production and / or demand destruction , so that declining oil production will never be a significant issue .
8 . If worldwide oil production were to decline at 2 % per year for several years , this could easily be accommodated with little disruption .
Answer : b. False
One might think that a 2 % decline in world oil production could easily be accommodated , but several issues arise :
In recent years , worldwide oil usage has been increasing by about 2 % a year .
Much of this increase in demand is from China and from other oil - producing countries that have previously had a low standard of living .
Because we are used to a 2 % annual increase in oil worldwide oil usage , the 2 % a year expected decrease needs to be compared to the prior increase of + 2 % per year .
This amounts to a change of - 4 % , relative to what we are accustomed to — quite a big decline .
If worldwide production oil decreases by 2 % per year , the amount of oil available to importers is likely to decrease by more than 2 % a year , for reasons discussed in the answers to Question 6 .
Because the United States ’ own production is dropping at 2 % a year , in recent years our imports have been increasing at 5 % a year , to keep up with demand .
If imports suddenly become less available , US supplies are likely to drop by much more than 2 % a year .
The US economy and the world economy use very large amounts of debt .
When the economy is growing by several percentage points per year , there are enough funds available that most debtors can repay their debts with interest .
If , because of oil shortages , the economy ceases to grow , or if it begins shrinking by a few percentage points a year , it is not clear this system can continue .
There are likely to be many defaults on loans , and long - term loans , including mortgages , may become very difficult to obtain .
Once it becomes clear there are likely to be oil shortages in the future , the behavior of countries is likely to change .
We are already seeing oil producing nations , like Russia and Venezuela , unilaterally adjusting oil contracts to terms that are more favorable to themselves , because of their new , greater power .
If it is clear that prices will be higher in the future , oil producers have an incentive to hoard their supplies for the future .
Some countries with inadequate supplies may choose military approaches for obtaining oil , if the alternative is economic decline .
9 . If there is a worldwide shortage of oil , the richest countries can be expected to get the majority of the oil , and within those richest countries , the wealthiest people can be expected to get the largest share .
Answer : b. False
For reasons discussed previously , oil exporting countries are likely to get a disproportionate share of the remaining oil , since they are likely to meet their own needs first .
With oil shortages , oil producing countries find themselves with more power , and are able to rewrite contracts on terms more favorable to themselves .
Thus , it seems likely that the amount of oil available to oil - importing countries will decline disproportionately to the overall decline .
Within countries , governments are likely to allocate oil to what they consider their country ’s most basic needs first – most likely agriculture , the military , and perhaps emergency services .
If there is a shortage to begin with , once these allocations are taken off the top , the remaining amount of oil available to consumers is likely to be considerably lower than the total demand .
It is possible the remaining oil will be sold to the wealthiest individuals , but if elected officials are involved , rationing may be more likely .
10 .
If we know that a major oil shortage is on the horizon , we can make necessary changes ( develop alternative fuels and plug in electric vehicles , for example ) in a five year period .
b. False
The US Department of Energy commissioned a study titled Peaking of World Oil Production : Impacts , Mitigation , and Risk Management , by Robert Hirsch , Roger Bezdek , and Robert Wendling , published in early 2005 .
This study indicated that if existing technology is used , it would take at least 10 years to begin to mitigate a decline in oil production .
Twenty years would produce a much better level of mitigation .
The reason mitigation is expected to take so long is that there is so much infrastructure in place that uses the current technology .
If a decision is made to increase fuel efficiency standards for cars , for example , it takes many years before this decision has a significant impact .
First , it takes several years for manufacturers to begin making new models , then many more years before enough autos are sold to comprise a significant share of the US total .
If liquid fuel is made from coal ( a technology that has been around since World War II ) , it takes several years for factories to be built and new coal facilities to be developed .
Because of these considerations , it is difficult to make any major change very quickly .
If we are talking about developing new technologies , like plug - in electric vehicles or cellulistic ethanol , we should expect even longer lead times , since new technologies need to be developed and tested , before they can be implemented on a large scale .
11 . Even after oil production in an area declines , there is still a substantial amount of oil remaining in the ground .
Answer : a .
True
Even after production ceases , a substantial amount ( typically 50 % to 75 % of the oil originally in place ) remains in the ground .
New production techniques have been developed over the years , but these have generally had only a minor impact on the percentage of oil in place that can be produced .
If one looks at the graph of the production for the US - 48 states shown in Figure 1 above , or the production for the North Sea shown in Figure 2 , one can discern little impact of new techniques in the last few years .
Some believe that the primary impact of new techniques has been to remove oil more quickly , rather than to significantly raise the percentage of oil that can be recovered .
Given that there is still a substantial amount of oil is the ground , there is a possibility that new techniques will be developed that will be able to remove a much larger portion of the oil in place in an economical fashion .
If this can be done , an oil shortage can perhaps be avoided for quite a few more years .
12 . Technological solutions will overcome the likely oil shortfall .
Answer : c. We ca n’t know yet .
Since there are many people working on the problem , and since there is still a lot of oil in place , there is a possibility that solutions will be found to the likely shortfall in oil production .
There are many issues that make the problem particularly difficult , however :
There is a very long lead time for any new technology to be implemented .
It appears likely that there will be a shortage of natural gas in North America , in roughly the same time frame as the expected decline in worldwide oil production .
Global warming is becoming a serious enough issue that it is questionable whether we should burn the additional fossil fuels that are in the ground , if we can get them out .
We have a large world population and limited fresh water and top soil , limiting the amount of biofuels that can be produced .
The above issues all relate to the fact that we live in a finite world and are approaching its limits .
Researchers will need to understand all these various issues , in addition to the problem of oil shortages , to avoid trading one problem for another .

Algae oil is an interesting sustainable feedstock for biodiesel manufacturing .
It is an alternative to popular feedstocks , like soybean , canola and palm .
Ultrasonication improves the extraction of oil from the algae cells and the conversion to biodiesel .
In comparison to traditional oil - seed crops , algae yields much more oil per acre .
While soybean typically produces less than 50 gallon of oil per acre and rapeseed generates less than 130 gallon per acre , algae can yield up to 10,000 gallons per acre .
In particular diatoms and green algae are good sources for the production of biodiesel .
Like other plants , algae stores energy in the form of lipids .
There are various methods for extracting the oils , such as pressing , hexane solvent wash and ultrasonic extraction .
Ultrasonic Extraction
Intense sonication of liquids generates sound waves that propagate into the liquid media resulting in alternating high - pressure and low - pressure cycles .
During the low - pressure cycle , high - intensity small vacuum bubbles are created in the liquid .
When the bubbles attain a certain size , they collapse violently during a high - pressure cycle .
This is called cavitation .
During the implosion very high pressures and high speed liquid jets are produced locally .
The resulting shear forces break the cell structure mechanically and improve material transfer .
This effect supports the extraction of lipids from algae .
The table to the right shows typical power requirements for various volume flows .
The ultrasonic system is generally integrated inline .
The ultrasonication reactor can be easily retrofitted into existing facilities , improving algae extraction .
Flow Rate Power 20 – 100L / hr 1 kW 80 – 400L / hr 4x1 kW 0.3 – 1.5 m³/hr 4x4 kW 2 – 10 m³/hr 6x16 kW 20 – 100 m³/hr 62x16kW
Ultrasonic Preparation for Cold Pressing
In particular for the purpose of pressing , good control of the cell disruption is required , to avoid an unhindered release of all intracellular products including cell debris , or product denaturation .
By breaking the cell structure , more lipids stored inside the cells can be released by the application of outside pressure .
Ultrasonic Solvent Extraction
The high pressure cycles of the ultrasonic waves support the diffusion of solvents , such as hexane into the cell structure .
As ultrasound breaks the cell wall mechanically by the cavitation shear forces , it facilitates the transfer of lipids from the cell into the solvent .
After the oil dissolved in the cyclohexane the pulp / tissue is filtered out .
The solution is distilled to separate the oil from the hexane .
For the sonication of flammable liquids or solvents in hazardous environments Hielscher offers FM and ATEX - certified ultrasonication systems , such as the UIP1000 - Exd .
Ultrasonic Enzymatic Extraction
Strong synergetic effects can be observed when combining enzymatic treatment with sonication .
The cavitation assists the enzymes in the penetration of the tissue , resulting in faster extraction and higher yields .
In this case water acts as a solvent and the enzymes degrade the cell walls .
Biodiesel from Algae Oil
The application of ultrasonication to the production of biodiesel from algae is not limited to the extraction of oil from algae .
Biodiesel is made from algae oil by a chemical conversion process called transesterification .
Despite the use of heat , mechanical agitation and catalytic chemicals , this conversion takes approx .
4 to 6 hours .
Ultrasonication improves the mixing and increases the chemical reactivity of the reactants .
This reduces the time needed for the chemical conversion by up to 90 % leading to a whole new perspective on biodiesel making .
Instead of pumping from batch to batch , the reactants are mixed continuously and subsequently pumped through a reactor column .
A residence time of approx .
1 hour is sufficient for the conversion to complete .
A centrifuge separates the glycerin from the biodiesel .
After washing and drying of the biodiesel , it is ready to be used .
Other benefits include a more complete transesterification of the tri-glyceride molecules , meaning that more oil is actually converted into biodiesel .
Also , it requires less alcohol and catalyst – reducing production costs and improving the environmental effect .

LONDON , Dec. 10  Some rock bands accelerate their tempos when they play their old songs decades after the fact .
Playing fast is a kind of armor : a refutation of the plain fact of aging , all that unregainable enthusiasm and lost muscle mass , and a hard block against an old band ’s lessened cultural importance .
But Led Zeppelin slowed its down a little .
At the O2 arena here on Monday night , in its first full concert since 1980  without John Bonham , who died that year , but with Bonham ’s son Jason as a natural substitute  the band found much of its old power in tempos that were more graceful than those on the old live recordings .
The speed of the songs ran closer to those on the group ’s old studio records , or slower yet .
“ Good Times Bad Times , ” “ Misty Mountain Hop , ” and “ Whole Lotta Love ” were confident , easy cruises ; “ Dazed and Confused ” was a glorious doom - crawl .
It all goes back to the blues , in which oozing gracefully is a virtue , and from which Led Zeppelin initially got half its ideas .
Its singer , Robert Plant , does n’t want you to forget that fact : he introduced “ Trampled Underfoot ” by explaining its connection to Robert Johnson ’s “ Terraplane Blues , ” and mentioned Blind Willie Johnson as the inspiration for “ Nobody ’s Fault But Mine . ”
( Beyond that , the band spent 10 luxuriant minutes each in two other blues songs from its back catalog 
“ Since I Been Loving You ” and “ In My Time of Dying ” ) .
Ahmet Ertegun , the dedicatee of the concert , would have been satisfied , sure as he was of the centrality of southern black music to American culture .
Ertegun , who died last year , signed Led Zeppelin to Atlantic Records ; the show was a one - off benefit for the Ahmet Ertegun Education Fund , which will offer music students scholarships to universities in the United States , England , and Turkey , his homeland .
" " Protesters demonstrate water boarding to volunteer Maboud Ebrahim Zadeh , Nov. 5 , 2007 , in front of the Justice Department .
The demonstration was protesting the nomination of Michael Mukasey for Attorney General .

In October 2007 , Attorney General nominee Michael Mukasey drew criticism for his refusal to characterize water boarding , a controversial interrogation technique considered by many to be illegal , as torture .
Mukasey , a retired federal judge nominated by President Bush , dodged the question in his confirmation hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee , stating that " if [ water boarding ] amounts to torture , it is not constitutional , " but never explicitly condemning it [ source : NPR ] .
His response prompted several senators on the committee to declare that they would oppose Mukasey 's nomination as Attorney General unless he denounced water boarding as a form of torture .
Nevertheless , Mukasey was confirmed and served under President Bush .

Mukasey 's nomination was n't the first time the Bush administration faced controversy over what it considered appropriate interrogation techniques of terror suspects .
In an October 2006 radio interview , Vice President Dick Cheney was asked if a " dunk in the water " was an acceptable form of prisoner interrogation .
When he answered in the affirmative , many people took that to be an endorsement of water boarding .
Human rights groups immediately seized on the statement as indicating support for torture , and Cheney 's spokespeople released statements saying that Cheney was not endorsing water boarding when he made that remark .
Water boarding has been around for centuries .
It was a common interrogation technique during the Italian Inquisition of the 1500s and was used perhaps most famously in Cambodian prisons during the reign of the Khmer Rouge regime during the 1970s .
As late as November 2005 , water boarding was on the CIA 's list of approved " enhanced interrogation techniques " intended for use against high - value terror suspects .
And according to memos released by the U.S. Department of Justice in April 2009 , water boarding was among 10 torture techniques authorized for the interrogation of an al - Qaida operative .
In a nutshell , water boarding makes a person feel like he or she is drowning .
Water boarding as it is currently described involves strapping a person to an inclined board , with their feet raised and their head lowered .
The interrogators bind the person 's arms and legs so no movement is possible and cover the person 's face .
In some descriptions , the person is gagged , and some sort of cloth covers the nose and mouth ; in others , the face is wrapped in cellophane .
The interrogator then repeatedly pours water onto the person 's face .
Depending on the exact setup , the water may or may not actually get into the person 's mouth and nose ; but the physical experience of being underneath a wave of water seems to be secondary to the psychological experience .
The person 's mind believes they are drowning , and the gag reflex kicks in as if they were choking on all that water falling on their face .
So what do intelligence professionals think of this technique ?
Huckabee : ' The Likelihood Is That McCain Will Win ' Fresh off a win in Iowa , Huckabee has to " convert " voters in the Granite State .
HENNIKER , N.H. , Jan. 4 , 2008  --
Six out of the 10 caucus - goers who handed Mike Huckabee his David versus Goliath victory over multi-millionaire Mitt Romney last night were Huckabee 's fellow evangelicals .
That will not be the pool of voters in far more secular and libertarian New Hampshire , where many take the state motto " Live Free or Die " literally .
Flying to New Hampshire this morning , the candidate joked about plans to carve out a victory in the Granite State .
" We 're gonna have to go convert a lot of people in New Hampshire in the next five days , " he joked .
" A big tent revival out on the grounds of the Concord state capitol ?
We 'll get 'em all converted to the evangelical faith and then we 'll win .
How 's that ?
That would work . "
All joking aside , Huckabee has serious business ahead in the coming days .
To a packed gymnasium at New England College in Henniker , N.H. , Huckabee delivered his first address to the vastly different GOP voters of New Hampshire since his astounding victory in the Iowa caucus .
He did not mention his opposition to legal abortion .
He did not mention his opposition to same - sex marriage .
He did not discuss his evangelical faith as openly as he did when he cut his way from Council Bluffs to Davenport , Iowa .
Social issues are viewed differently in Dover than they are in Des Moines .
A majority of New Hampshire voters support abortion rights , and just three days ago , New Hampshire became the fourth state in the nation to enact a law allowing same - sex couples to affirm their relationship legally through civil unions .
Huckabee 's stump speech emphasized nothing new — he gave voice to economic populism , a strong military , unifying the country and eliminating the IRS by creating a national consumption tax .
But after he rocked it out on his bass guitar playing with Mama Kicks and suggested his celebrity trail - mate Chuck Norris be his secretary of defense , there were some issues left undiscussed .
His campaign , in many ways , still faces an uphill battle .
Huckabee is in fourth place in New Hampshire , according to the latest polls , well behind Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz. , and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney , in a dead heat for first , and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani .
" With the short period of time , the likelihood is that McCain will win , " Huckabee acknowledged .
" Huckabee 's big challenge here is McCain 's base , which includes conservative Republicans and independents and Romney 's money , " said Jennifer Donahue , the senior adviser for political affairs at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics .
" Romney can pay to play as long as he wants . "
Huckabee 's success has been fueled up to this point by charm , message and evangelicals .
He will need to broaden his appeal to New Hampshire 's fiscal conservatives , who will be wary of the net tax increase he oversaw as governor .
Ed Rollins , Huckabee 's campaign chairman , acknowledged they need to build a campaign infrastructure .
" Historically , when momentum catches up with a lack of organization , it does a campaign in , " said Rollins .
" And we have thought about that . "
Until now , Huckabee and McCain have had something of a nonaggression pact , praising each other in a joint mission to defeat Romney .
Huckabee called McCain " an American hero , " but that policy of positivity will be tested as well .
" It 's politics , " said Chip Saltsman , Huckabee 's campaign manager , " and you know , it may get a little rougher too , but there 'll be a lot of respect between the two people and the two campaigns . "
A cordiality that may last only as long as Romney does .

Hate Crime In Cicero
By Margaret Lyons in News on Dec 28 , 2007 8:44 PM
Felipe Rivera of Cicero has been charged with aggravated criminal sexual assault , sexual assault , aggravated battery and a hate crime for allegedly beating , raping and sodomizing a man .
Rivera and the victim met at a party on 1200 block of South 50th Avenue , and Rivera thought the victim winked at him .
Rivera followed the victim to the outer staircase of a basement apartment , where he removed the victim 's pants and raped him , authorities said .
Afterward , Rivera punched the victim in the head , leaving him semi-conscious , then inserted a metal broom handle in the victim 's rectum , sources said .
Rivera then went to his mother 's house , where she called the police because she has an order of protection against him .
In a video - taped confession , Rivera said he attacked the man because he hates gay people " ' and this is what they get , ' " according to police .
The victim is in stable condition .
There were 7,722 reported hate crimes in the US in 2006 , and 5,646 reported criminal sexual assaults in Illinois .

12/10 TRENTON , N.J. ― A Rider University student has claimed she was gang - raped by a group of men , including several off - duty New Jersey state troopers .
The Mercer Co. prosecutor 's office would only confirm that a 25 - year - old student was sexually assaulted last week at a house in Ewing Township , but sources say six troopers have been suspended with pay as the investigation continues .
The Associated Press was reporting that six troopers in all were suspended .
Sources also say that the woman says she and a friend met the troopers -- including a detective and an academy instructor -- at the KatManDu Bar in Trenton on Thursday night .
The two women went to the home of one of the troopers and that 's where she claims she was gang - raped early Friday morning .
Students at the university say the KatManDu bar is a popular club and that on Thursday nights , female college students get in for free .
"
You just run into people and everyone starts talking to you and you have the opportunity to meet everybody , " says Rider student Jennifer Strumph .
" It 's not hard to run into people and make new friends and have guys hitting on you .
" Sources say the second woman was asleep when the alleged rape occurred and has not been able to corroborate the allegations .
Investigators are still in the very early stages of the case .
" Once aware of the allegations , aggressive steps were taken to ensure full and complete cooperation with the investigation .
The superintendent has directed all appropriate resources to support the Mercer County Prosecutor 's Office , " Capt .
Al Della Fave said in a statement .
No charges have been filed in this still unfolding case .
Researchers in Finland are reporting successful use of an unlikely fertilizer for farm fields that is inexpensive , abundantly available , and undeniably organic -- human urine .
Their report on use of urine to fertilize cabbage crops is scheduled for the Oct. 31 issue of ACS ' Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry .
Despite the ' yuk ! ' factor , urine from healthy individuals is virtually sterile , free of bacteria or viruses .
Naturally rich in nitrogen and other nutrients , urine has been used as fertilizer since ancient times .
Urine fertilization is rare today .
However , it has gained attention in some areas as farmers embrace organic production methods and try to reduce use of synthetic fertilizers .
In the new study , Surendra K. Pradhan and colleagues collected human urine from private homes and used it to fertilize cabbage crops .
Then they compared the urine - fertilized crops with those grown with conventional industrial fertilizer and no fertilizer .
The analysis showed that growth and biomass were slightly higher with urine than with conventional fertilizer .
There was no difference in nutritional value of the cabbage .
" Our results show that human urine could be used as a fertilizer for cabbage and does not pose any significant hygienic threats or leave any distinctive flavor in food products , " the report concludes .
The Argentine - born musician is believed to be the first person in the world to possess both passports after receiving his new documentation at the end of a piano concert of Ludwig van Beethoven sonatas , which he performed in Ramallah in the West Bank at the weekend .
" Under the most difficult circumstances he has shown solidarity with the Palestinian people , " Mustafa Barghouti , the Palestinian MP and presidential candidate said at the charity concert to raise money for medical aid for children in the Gaza Strip .
Barenboim , 65 , who is musical director of the Staatsoper in Berlin and Milan 's La Scala opera house , established his West - Eastern Divan orchestra with the American - Palestinian intellectual Edward Said in 1999 following a workshop in Germany .
The orchestra's aim is to bring together musicians from Israel and Arabic countries to exchange ideas and perform together .
Barenboim , who is a regular and lively commentator on the Middle East conflict , said he was " moved and very , very happy " to receive the citizenship , adding that he accepted it because it " symbolises the everlasting bond between the Israeli and Palestinian people " .
In a pointed reference to US president George Bush 's recent comments on the Middle - East conflict in which he talked of Israel 's " occupation " of the West Bank , Barenboim added : " Now even not very intelligent people are saying that the occupation has to be stopped . "
Barenboim is considered a controversial figure by many in Israel , but less for the sympathy he openly shows towards the Palestinians and more for his promotion of the music of the 19th century anti-Semitic German composer Richard Wagner which he has conducted in Jerusalem .
He criticised the Israeli government after he was forced to cancel a piano concert in Ramallah after Israeli authorities said they could not guarantee his safety .
More recently he held a press conference to protest the Israeli authorities ' refusal to allow musicians from his Divan orchestra to enter Ramallah .
Federal budget cuts curtail key programs at Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
Congressional spending cuts to Energy Department science budgets are forcing the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center to reduce its workforce and stop work on two key projects , Director Persis Drell said Monday , Jan. 7 , during an all - hands meeting of SLAC employees .
SLAC is a federally funded research facility , operated by Stanford .
The laboratory 's major high - energy physics experiment , known as the B - factory , or BaBar , will end in early March , seven months earlier than scheduled , significantly reducing the scientific yield from the successful experiment .
All work at SLAC related to the International Linear Collider stopped on Jan. 1 as a result of a 75 percent reduction nationwide in funding for research and development of the project .
SLAC will reduce its workforce by about 15 percent , the equivalent of 225 full - time positions , Drell said .
Of these , 125 are due primarily to the cuts in funding to the particle physics programs .
The remaining 100 layoffs , many of which will be voluntary , had already been planned as part of an effort to shift the mixture of skills within the lab .
Those 100 vacancies eventually will be filled by people with the skills needed for the Linac Coherent Light Source , or LCLS .
That project , the backbone of future research at SLAC , is fully funded and continues to move forward .
" The highest priority for the future of this laboratory is the successful completion and operation of the LCLS , " Drell said , adding that " both project and operations budgets have been protected and as a direct consequence our future as a laboratory is protected . "
The workers being laid off will likely be notified in early February , and will continue working through early April .
" As a new laboratory director , delivering news of a major layoff — the largest layoff by far in the history of the lab — is certainly not the way I would have chosen to start my term , " Drell told her workers .
" The next weeks and months as we work through this will be stressful for every one of us at the lab .
We all will be affected .
While I cannot reduce the magnitude or the impact of the coming layoff , I can acknowledge how painful this will be and ask that everyone be respectful of and be aware of the stress that their colleagues are experiencing in this challenging period .
The HR department will have support resources available to the lab community throughout this period . "
The Linac Coherent Light Source remains on track to become the world 's first operational hard X - ray free - electron laser .
It will open new scientific frontiers nationally and internationally .
Construction is under way , with operations scheduled to begin in late 2009 .
In addition , the LCLS Ultrafast Science Instruments project gets significant new funding in FY08 .
The Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory ( SSRL ) user facility , a synchrotron light source , will continue operations but with some reduction in operating hours due to budget shortfalls .
The facility produces beams of X - rays used by 2,000 scientists to study the structure and functions of a broad range of materials , from proteins to semiconductors .
The shortfall will reduce the number of experiments carried out from 1,300 in FY07 to about 1,000 in FY08 .
The laboratory 's new photon science institutes , PULSE and XLAM , will have to scale back their plans for growth in FY08 .
PULSE , the Photon Ultrafast Laser Science and Engineering Center , designs experiments for the LCLS and studies ultrafast atomic - scale processes .
The X -ray Laboratory for Advanced Materials studies the atomic - scale properties of new materials .
Both centers are jointly operated by SLAC and Stanford University .
Despite the budget cuts , SLAC will remain a leader in scientific research with a strong , diverse set of programs .
The lab continues its pioneering work in photon science , particle astrophysics , accelerator research and particle physics .
" We will emerge from this challenging year with a scientific program at the laboratory that is refocused to align with new funding realities , " Drell said .
" With the strong commitment and support of the lab management to the SLAC Improvement Initiative , the programs will be better and more effectively supported by the management and operations functions at the lab .
We will have the strong support of Stanford University throughout this process .
The university is an important participant in the SLAC improvement initiative .
We are actively looking at new areas of scientific collaboration with the main campus . "
DECATUR , Ga.  Parents at an elementary school here gathered last Thursday afternoon with a holiday mission : to prepare boxes of food for needy families fleeing some of the world ’s horrific civil wars .
The community effort to help refugees resembled countless others at this time of year , with an exception .
The recipients were not many thousands of miles away .
They were students in the school and their families .
More than half the 380 students at this unusual school outside Atlanta are refugees from some 40 countries , many torn by war .
The other students come from low - income families in Decatur , and from middle - and upper - middle - class families in the area who want to expose their children to other cultures .
Together they form an eclectic community of Buddhists , Christians , Hindus , Jews and Muslims , well - off and poor , of established local families and new arrivals who collectively speak about 50 languages .
“ The fact that we do n’t have anything in common is what we all have in common , ” said Shell Ramirez , an American parent with two children at the school .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A bidder on Thursday offered $ 4.71 billion for a key slice of wireless airwaves being sold by the government , triggering a condition that the spectrum be accessible to any device or software application .

After 17 auction rounds , the bidding for the “ C ” block of 700 megahertz spectrum surpassed a $ 4.64 billion minimum set by the Federal Communications Commission .
As a result , the winner of the airwaves will have to abide by the open- access conditions , which had been sought by Internet search leader Google Inc GOOG.O and adopted by the FCC before the auction .
There were no further bids on the C - block airwaves in the subsequent round of the auction , a development that could mean the bidding on the C - block airwaves is over .
Bidders were given a handful of waivers at the start of the auction that allow them to sit out a round and still remain eligible to rejoin the bidding later .
But Stifel Nicolaus analyst Rebecca Arbogast said all the bidders ’ waivers have probably been used .
The bidders ’ identities are being kept secret , under FCC rules , until the entire auction ends .
However , analysts have said the most likely bidders for the C block airwaves are either Verizon Wireless or Google .
Verizon Wireless is a joint venture of Verizon Communications Inc VZ.N and Vodafone Group Plc VOD.L .
The C block is one of five pieces of 700 - megahertz spectrum being offered in auction .
The 700 - megahertz signals are valuable because they can go long distances and penetrate thick walls .
The airwaves are being returned by television broadcasters as they move to digital from analog signals in early 2009 .
Companies qualified to bid also include major wireless carriers like AT&T Inc T.N , as well as possible new competitors like Google , satellite TV provider EchoStar Communications Corp DISH.O and Cablevision Systems Corp CVC.N .
The open - access requirement on the C block is aimed at spurring more competition in the wireless business .
Currently , U.S. wireless carriers restrict the models of cell phones that can be used on their networks .
They also limit the software that can be downloaded onto them , such as ring tones , music or Web browser software .
AT&T and Verizon have been moving away from that restrictive stance in recent months .
The auction is due to continue until there are no more bids .
The top bids on Thursday morning totaled $ 13.69 billion for all five spectrum blocks .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Most New Yorkers and visitors to Times Square know of The Naked Cowboy .
The Naked Cowboy is part of the scenery at New York City 's Times Square .
For the past 10 years , he 's the guy you 've seen on the sidewalk , with the great body , strumming his guitar and singing , dressed in a cowboy hat , cowboy boots and underwear -- and nothing else , even in the dead of winter .
As a native New Yorker , I will admit that at times , it has been my guilty pleasure to walk or drive by The Cowboy to see if he can bear the elements .
To my amazement , he 's always there and pretty naked -- in rain , sleet , snow , heat or bitter cold .
I 've even taken pictures .
Watch The Naked Cowboy in his natural habitat »
Well , it seems that Mars Inc. , the makers of M&Ms , also knows about Robert Burck ( The Cowboy 's real name ) .
Burck sued Mars this week for $ 6 million in federal court in New York .
The allegations : trademark infringement under the Lanham Act and violation of his right of publicity under New York Civil Rights Law § 51 , arising from a video billboard for M&Ms .
The video ad depicts an M&M frolicking around New York , in what kind of looks like Times Square , in what kind of looks like The Naked Cowboy 's outfit -- briefs and nothing more than a smile .
There have been plenty of jokes about the lawsuit , and I 'm especially fond of the ones found on The Wall Street Journal Law Blog on Thursday , such as :
" If his lawyers ' briefs are as tight as his , he will certainly win . " -- Acepilot
" Thought this was about a naked cowboy .
If the plaintiff is wearing briefs then he is not naked .
No case . " --
Akex
" I 'm going to sue Burck .
I walk around in my underwear all of the time -- he is ripping me off ! " -- woz
All jokes aside , I think he may have a case .
In order for him to show trademark infringement , The Naked Cowboy has to be trademarked ; has to prove that Mars , without his consent , infringed upon the trademark ; and has to show there 's a " likelihood of confusion " between his trademark and the allegedly infringing mark -- in this case the naked M&M .
To state a claim under New York 's civil rights law , Burck has to show that Mars used his name , portrait or picture for purposes of trade or advertising , and without his written consent .
Surprising to some -- at least to me --
The Naked Cowboy 's name and likeness are in fact registered trademarks owned by Burck .
According to the complaint , Burck has licensed The Naked Cowboy name and / or likeness to companies for the purposes of advertising and endorsement .
Mars , Inc. , had no immediate comment .
His character is part of the USA Network 's " Characters Welcome " campaign ; he appeared in a music video for the song " Rockstar " by the multiplatinum artist Nickelback ; and he 's featured singing in the video game " True Crime : New York City at Times Square . "
He also has appeared in several movies and television programs , including " Starship Dave , " " Survive This , " " Mulva : Zombie A** Kicker , " " Steve Harvey 's Big Time , " " New York Minute , " " Creature Feature , " " Lonely Planet , " " Troma 's Edge , " " American Icon " and " The Howard Stern Show . "
He even appeared in a Chevrolet commercial that debuted during Super Bowl XLI .
And this is n't the first time a pseudo - celebrity ( sorry Cowboy ) has sued and won .
Remember Vanna
White ?
She was awarded $ 403,000 when Samsung used a robot , wearing a blond wig , jewelry and a dress , that turned letters on a game board similar to White 's role on " Wheel of Fortune , " the TV game show .
Still laughing ?
I 'm not .
At the end of the day , this lawsuit may be the end of the era of the " naked " cowboy .
I predict he will be able to afford some very nice duds .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Late - night TV comedian David Letterman ’s show returned on Wednesday touting itself as the “ only show on the air ” with union - backed jokes after a two - month hiatus in support of striking screenwriters .
Some 10,500 members of the Writers Guild of America have been on strike against the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers ( AMPTP ) demanding , among other things , higher fees paid for work appearing on DVDs and the Internet .
Here is Letterman ’s satirical Top 10 List of “ Demands of the Striking Writers , ” from a transcript read by writers on Wednesday ’s show .
10 . “ Complimentary tote bag with next insulting contract offer ” - Tim Carvell from “ The Daily Show with Jon Stewart ”
9 . “ No rollbacks in health benefits , so I can treat the hypothermia I caught on the picket lines ” - Laura Krafft from “ The Colbert Report ”
8 . “ Full salary and benefits for my imaginary writing partner , Lester ” - daytime television writer Melissa Salmons
7 . “ Members of the AMPTP must explain what the hell AMPTP stands for ” - Warren Leight from “ Law & Order : Criminal Intent ”
6 . “ No disciplinary action taken against any writer caught having inappropriate relationship with a copier ” - Jay Katsir from “ The Colbert Report ”
5 . “ I ’d like a date with a woman ” - Steve Bodow from “ The Daily Show with Jon Stewart ”
4 . “ Hazard pay for breaking up fights on ‘ The View ’ ” - writer and director Nora Ephron
3 . “ I ’m no accountant , but instead of us getting 4 cents for a $ 20 DVD , how about we get $ 20 for a 4 - cent DVD ? ” - Gina Johnfrido from “ Law & Order ”
2 . “ I do n’t have a joke -- I just want to remind everyone that we ’re on strike , so none of us are responsible for this lame list ” - Chris Albers from “ Late Night with Conan O’Brien ”
1 . “ Producers must immediately remove their heads from their a----” - Thurber Award - winning author Alan Zwiebel
These are some of the words of Martin Luther King Jr. :
" The nonviolent strategy has been to dramatize the evils of our society in such a way that pressure is brought to bear against those evils by the forces of good will in the community and change is produced .
The student sit-ins of 1960 are a classic illustration of this method ....
" So far we have had the Constitution backing most of the demands for change , and this has made our work easier , since we could be sure that the federal courts would usually back up our demonstrations legally .
Now we are approaching areas where the voice of the Constitution is not clear .
We have left the realm of constitutional rights and we are entering the area of human rights .
" The Constitution assured the right to vote , but there is no such assurance of the right to adequate housing , or the right to an adequate income ....
" The past three years have demonstrated the power of a committed , morally sound minority to lead the nation ....
Even the presence of a vital peace movement and the campus protest against the war in Vietnam can be traced back to the nonviolent action movement led by the Negro . "
King was decidedly pro-change .
But these are some more of his words :
" The white establishment is skilled in flattering and cultivating emerging leaders .
It presses its own image on them and finally , from imitation of manners , dress , and style of living , a deeper strain of corruption develops .
This kind of Negro leader acquires the white man 's contempt for the ordinary Negro .
He is often more at home with the middle - class white than he is among his own people .
His language changes , his location changes , his income changes , and ultimately he changes from the representative of the Negro to the white man into the white man 's representative to the Negro .
The tragedy is that too often he does not recognize what has happened to him . "
Yes , this is right - wing corporate - media color - blind hero , Martin Luther King Jr. speaking about the white man and the Negro people .
He was speaking about what was , and what largely still is , not about what he dreamed might someday be .
He was for change , but not for electing just anyone who said the word , and not for letting pass the uncomfortable but necessary warning .
" A time comes , " King said , " when silence is betrayal . "
" As I have walked , " King told the crowd assembled in Riverside Church a year before his assassination , " among the desperate , rejected and angry young men I have told them that Molotov cocktails and rifles would not solve their problems .
I have tried to offer them my deepest compassion while maintaining my conviction that social change comes most meaningfully through nonviolent action .
But they asked , and rightly so , what about Vietnam ?
They asked if our own nation was n't using massive doses of violence to solve its problems , to bring about the changes it wanted .
Their questions hit home , and I knew that I could never again raise my voice against the violence of the oppressed in the ghettos without having first spoken clearly to the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today , my own government .
For the sake of those boys , for the sake of this government , for the sake of the hundreds of thousands trembling under our violence , I can not be silent . "
King could be imagined today asking a Senator who would claim to oppose the occupation of a distant land while funding that violence with enough wealth to remake the globe : " Why , Senator , will you not filibuster future bills to fund this occupation ?
Ordinary citizens are sacrificing far more than the embarrassment of attempting a legislative maneuver that might not succeed ?.
Why will you not use the power you now possess for the good you claim to endorse , prior to asking us to bestow still greater powers on you ? "
" There is nothing wrong with power , " King actually said in his final address to the Southern Christian Leadership Conference , " if power is used correctly .
You see , what happened is that some of our philosophers got off base .
And one of the great problems of history is that the concepts of love and power have usually been contrasted as opposites , polar opposites , so that love is identified with a resignation of power , and power with a denial of love .
" It was this misinterpretation that caused Nietzsche , who was a philosopher of the will to power , to reject the Christian concept of love .
It was this same misinterpretation which induced Christian theologians to reject the Nietzschean philosophy of the will to power in the name of the Christian idea of love .
Now , we 've got to get this thing right .
What is needed is a realization that power without love is reckless and abusive , and love without power is sentimental and anemic .
Power at its best is love implementing the demands of justice , and justice at its best is power correcting everything that stands against love . "
The strongest politicians do not support the waging of war against weaker peoples .
The strongest voices in the United States today oppose the occupation of Iraq , and do so out of love for the people of Iraq and the world , and do so with more than words .

After promising last week that he'd mark President Bush 's final " State of the Union " speech today by introducing articles of impeachment against Bush , Cleveland Democratic Rep.
Dennis Kucinich announced he 's postponing the effort .
Kucinich said he met with members of the House Judiciary Committee after making last week 's impeachment pledge on the House of Representatives floor , and came away " hopeful there will be an inquiry by the Judiciary Committee . "
" I will give them the opportunity to proceed before introducing articles of impeachment , " Kucinich said in a statement issued by his office .
The House Judiciary Committee 's spokeswoman did not respond to The Plain Dealer 's request for comment .
Last year , Kucinich introduced a measure to impeach Vice President Dick Cheney that has collected 24 cosponsors .
His November effort to bring the matter before the full House of Representatives won support from Republicans who wanted to embarrass House Democratic leaders , but was eventually referred to the Judicary Committee .
Kucinich told The Plain Dealer editorial board last week that nine members of the House Judiciary Committee favor his bid to impeach Cheney .
But that 's shy of a majority ; the committee has 23 Democrats and 17 Republicans .
" I do not believe that there will be an impeachment this year -- I do n't think that will happen - but I do think that the questions relating to an inquiry of both the president and the vice president are important so that our nation has a real understanding of the effort that was made , a consistent effort , to mislead the people into supporting a war , " Kucinich said .
The Roman Catholic church is the oldest and largest Christian denomination on the planet .
Although its influence in the Western world is declining , it still exercises great power over the lives of millions of people every day .
All too often , that power is used in the service of superstition , of perpetuating irrational and dogmatic beliefs about how human liberty should be restricted in order to please God .
Whatever charitable and humanitarian work the Catholic church performs must be balanced against the vast harm it has done and continues to do because of its obsession with controlling the sex lives and reproductive systems of all human beings .
This post will detail some of the more notable harms .
Denying equal rights to gays and lesbians .
The Catholic church ’s support for a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage is well - known , and shows by itself how this church has placed itself on the wrong side of history by supporting irrational and superstitious prejudice against people who do n’t conform to its narrow and restrictive model of human sexual relations .
But a slightly lesser - known fact is that the Catholic church ’s adoption agencies flatly refuse to place children with gay parents – even if this means they will have no parents and will grow up in an orphanage .
Evidently , the Catholic church considers this option preferable to a child growing up in a stable home with loving , caring parents who happen to be of the same gender .
For example , in 2006 , Catholic Charities announced its adoption services were shutting down in Massachusetts , rather than place children with gay families .
This is but another example of how the church considers adherence to its own dogma more important than the lives and welfare of human beings .
Opposing vaccination for sexually transmitted diseases .
Since the development of Gardasil , a highly effective vaccine against the common sexually transmitted disease HPV – which can cause lethal cervical cancer – numerous branches of the Catholic church have announced their opposition to giving this vaccine to children before they reach sexual maturity .
The Catholic school board in Halton , Ontario has announced plans to ban school health units from giving the vaccine to students or even discussing it with them .
The church in Scotland has also announced opposition to the vaccine , as did the California Catholic Conference ( which said the vaccine “ takes away the parental perogative for children to be chaste “ ) .
Regardless of a person ’s religious beliefs , there is no rational reason for them not to receive this vaccine .
The only purpose a person could have for opposing it for their children would be to make them afraid of getting cervical cancer if they have unprotected sex – which has the logical inference that cervical cancer would be an appropriate punishment for such sex .
Opposing emergency contraceptive use , even for rape victims .
If taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex , emergency contraception ( the “ morning - after pill ” ) is highly effective at preventing fertilization .
This is a tremendous boon to rape victims , who ’ve already suffered enough without being forced to go through the further trauma of bearing their rapist ’s child .
Yet many church ethicists , as well as the Pontifical Academy for Life , argue that Catholic physicians and Catholic hospitals should not administer EC to rape victims under any circumstance .
This is a cruel and evil position that would inflict severe emotional and physical trauma on women and deny them the right to control their own bodies in the name of obedience to unprovable religious dogma .
Dr. Marty Klein has more information in the appropriately titled Catholic Hospitals Should Stop Playing God .
Opposing abortion even when it is necessary to prevent death or grave harm to the woman .
The most prominent example of this deadly dogma is in El Salvador , an officially Catholic country that bans abortion under all circumstances and jails women who obtain them illegally .
The church intensely lobbied the government into passing this law , bussing in Catholic schoolchildren to stage demonstrations and using churches as political organizing centers .
Pope John Paul II also issued statements in support of the law .
The result is a theocratic nation where the state exerts dictatorial control over women ’s bodies .
Women who suffer miscarriages are forced to submit to invasive vaginal exams to ensure they did not obtain illegal abortions .
Even in ectopic pregnancies , which have no possibility of producing a living child , abortion is forbidden until the mother ’s Fallopian tube has ruptured and the fetus is dead – a critical , life - threatening medical emergency for the woman .
Opposing condom use , even for married couples where one member has HIV .
This particularly horrible example of the church ’s irrational opposition to condom use is most often seen in Africa , where the culture often does not permit women to turn down their husband ’s demands for sex .
Yet even if they remain monogamous , that does not protect them if the husband cheats and acquires a deadly disease such as HIV .
Since the Catholic church teaches that condom use is forbidden under all circumstances , this rules out the last remaining option and results in devastating tragedies like this one :
The typical patient is a young woman between eighteen and thirty years of age .
She is wheeled into the examining room in a hospital chair or dragged in , supported by her sister , aunt , or brother .
She is frequently delirious ; her face is gaunt ; her limbs look like desiccated twigs .
Surprisingly , the young woman is already a mother many times over , yet she will not live to see her children grow up .
More shocking still , she is married ; her husband infected her with the deadly virus .
… To preach fidelity and abstinence assumes that a woman can determine with whom she sleeps and when — a grave misunderstanding of the relations between the sexes in places where women are sometimes betrothed at birth or sold for cattle .
How can the Vatican continue to prohibit the use of a life - saving intervention amid a pandemic of unprecedented proportions ?
Attempting to stifle stem cell research .
The most notable example of this came in June 2006 , when an influential Catholic cardinal , Alfonso López Trujillo , said that stem - cell researchers should be excommunicated .
Although this threat is meaningless to non-Catholics , the important point is that it is a threat – as well as a symptom of the church ’s obvious desire to block this life - saving research by coercion and spiritual blackmail .
This story , like the others discussed here , shows why we should be glad that this irrational and medieval institution has lost the power it once had to force all people to obey its will .
Now we need to diminish its influence still further , so that it can no longer stand in the way of wise and rational policies that improve people ’s well - being and happiness .
Ordinary Skill in the Art
Based on the 2000 Knuth - Prize Lecture
Jeffrey D. Ullman
Nov. 16 , 2000 ; minor updates Aug. 30 , 2001
Usually , they then ask Don if he can recommend someone cheaper , and Don , knowing that I 'll do anything for a buck , sometimes sends them to me .
As a result , I 've gotten involved in a number of interesting cases involving software patents , and over the years , I have come to the conclusion that :
The patenting of algorithms and the software that embodies them leads to inequities as often as it protects true innovation and genuine innovators .
The standards for innovation set by the CS Theory community should be given more weight when deciding the validity of a software patent .
There should be an effort to educate the courts on the distinct nature of innovation in computer software , and to help distinguish innovation from wishful thinking or the fantasies of people who are unaware of the state of knowledge .
What is Patentable ?
Patents have been awarded since 1790 to further the useful arts .
Not technology or engineering , but ``arts . ''
We should remember that Don Knuth viewed computer programming as an art --- surely a useful art --- long before anyone accepted the idea that software could be patented .
In order for an idea to be patented , there are three tests that must be met :
The idea must be ``novel . ''
The idea must be ``nonobvious . ''
The idea must be useful .
The third of these is perhaps the easiest to tackle .
Most algorithms and most programs meet the test of being useful .
There is one subtlety , however .
An algorithm , data structure , or other idea that we might see as evidently useful is not patentable in a form disembodied from any application .
For example , we might instantly agree that binary search trees are a useful idea , but they could only be patented as part of an ``apparatus , '' e.g. , a computer program , that did something useful , such as retrieve journal citations given a keyword .
How about ``novel '' and ``nonobvious ' ' ?
Are n't they synonyms ?
Not in the world of patents .
An idea is novel if it does not appear in previous , public literature .
if it does not appear in previous , public literature .
An idea is nonobvious if it would not be discovered by one of ``ordinary skill in the art ' ' when the idea was needed .
It is interesting to observe that if you are on a program committee , these three criteria are exactly those you use to decide whether or not to accept the paper ( although the typical FOCS / STOC program committee takes a longer and broader view of what is ``useful '' ) .
However , several tricky points come up when we try to understand what is ``obvious '' to a person of ordinary skill in the art .
Among them :
What is the scope of ``an art ' ' ?
All computer science ?
A topic roughly equivalent to one course at the undergraduate level ?
The subject of a PhD thesis ?
One important criterion is that we must consider people actually practicing the art , not those thinking about the art .
Thus , an academic researcher may not be a good , or even acceptable , model for a person of ordinary skill in the art .
Apparently , a better model would be a person with a BS degree in Computer Science who writes code for a living .
In some cases , e.g. , a patent involving locking algorithms for database systems , we might take the proper model to be someone who had had an appropriate MS - level course , database systems in this example .
How obvious is ``obvious '' ?
If we posed the problem to 100 people skilled in the art , would all 100 have to come up with the solution that appears in the patent ?
Would 90 be enough ?
50 ? 10 ?
1 ? More complex --- and quite germane to what I regard as a central problem of how patents are granted and enforced --- is the question of what happens if the 100 people come up with 10 or 100 different solutions , all or most of which are at least as good as the patented idea , and yet few if any are exactly that idea .
The Purpose of Patents
The reward to the inventor includes the right to receive fees for licensing the patent to anyone who would use the idea .
But more important is limited - term freedom from competition .
This protection has another beneficial side effect : it encourages the investment needed to bring a good idea to market .
Without such protection , an investor would fear that others would steal whatever market they had developed with the new idea .
Of course many of the best ideas have been put in the public domain , shared and made available to others without reward for the inventor ( well maybe tenure , reputation , and the other pleasures of life as a research scientist ) .
Reasonable people may disagree on the matter of reward for invention , yet we cannot deny that it has been effective .
In a sense , Communism --- an intuitively appealing concept --- failed because it forgot that the best minds need to be motivated , and money works better than anything else , on average .
My personal view is that it is great that R , S , and A were able to profit from a patent for a novel , nonobvious , and useful encryption scheme , but less wonderful that pharmaceutical companies are able to profit from their inventions to the extent that poor nations are dying of controllable HIV because they can't afford what the drug companies demand .
What Goes Wrong ?
Until recently , lawyers with computer - science degrees were not considered qualified for the patent bar , and patent examiners may have had difficulty getting into the mindset of the practicing programmer .
It is unsurprising that patents can slip through without meeting the tests for patentability as a programmer would see them .
Venture capitalists look for patents when deciding whether or not to invest in a startup .
Thus , startups file patents regardless of whether or not the patent has any merit , or even whether it is likely to be granted .
The result is that there are many wild claims floating around , and these patents are like land mines .
If you do n't know whether they will be upheld , there is great risk in using the ``idea . ''
The reason is that the law penalizes violators of patents extensively , while there is no penalty for obtaining a patent that is eventually overturned .
One of the most famous recent cases in point is Amazon 's ``one - click shopping '' idea .
Now I think Amazon deserves a lot of credit for pioneering work .
Notice that Barnes - and - Noble could have become Amazon.com , but they did n't see how to do it until Jeff Bezos showed them .
However , the one - click patent , although many say it is not going to stand up in court ( you can see some examples of opinion with the Google query one - click patent ) , inhibits the use of the idea , or forces people to pay money that may not be justified ( as Apple has done ; I learned that from the same Google query ) .
While one could argue that the patent system is here protecting an inventor , it is also possible that the system is preventing people from using an idea that is really in the public domain --- exactly the opposite of the support - of - technological - progress ideal of the patent system .
In the absence of any true injury , companies with large ``patent portfolios '' will threaten smaller companies with lawsuits if they do n't license their patents .
I have seen cases where company A has had to pay company B , even though A did not get any value from the patents of B , having developed or obtained the ideas allegedly covered by B's patents quite independently of B .
Indeed , it is probable that A could have won a court test , but because the risks are all on A's side , they prudently ``paid protection '' rather than risk having their house burned down .
One sees even more egregious cases of individuals who file a patent , and later discover that their patent resembles something important that has happened --- no thanks to them --- such as spreadsheets or the Web .
Having never made any attempt to publish their idea , usually because it is in fact unpublishable by the normal standards of our field , they start a suit against the people who are true innovators .
Alas , because of the risks involved , it is often easier to pay protection than to fight a legitimate battle in court .
Some Examples
The first is a case in which it was utterly transparent that the idea was not new , yet proving it not to be ``novel , '' as required by law , was tricky .
Because it was so blatently obvious , no one had made a public declaration of the idea , as required for a legal conclusion of ``not novel . ''
The second illustrates what I believe to be a contradiction in the way nonobviousness is established .
The method patented was one of many ways to solve the problem .
I believe them to be collectively obvious , yet the jury decided that a patent on one method covered all other possible ways .
A Patent on Triangular Matrices
Fast - forward to 1968 .
Two guys thought of the same idea , and somehow concluded that they were the first people ever to think of it .
I guess they did n't have the benefit of a Van- Buren - High education .
They filed a patent on the idea , in particular , as embedded in a computer program .
Well you could n't actually patent programs in those days , so it was described as a device that searched for an order of variables that made the matrix of the equations triangular .
And then they added that you could also write a program to do this job .
To the credit of the patent examiner , the patent was rejected .
However , these guys were not inclined to give up .
By the early 1980's they had gotten the court to overrule the Patent Office and grant them the patent .
That was convenient timing , because by then spreadsheets were becoming popular , and they decided that all the spreadsheet manufacturers were violating their patent , since they in fact were filling in cells based on the values of previously computed cells .
Enter a man whom we 'll call Mr. P , standing for ``philanthropist . ''
Mr. P was very generous to his community .
For example , he received great public notice for offering to pay for the college education of every student to graduate from a certain ghetto school , and he apparently followed through on this offer , which was taken up by many of the students .
The only trouble was that Mr. P had an odd way of making the money he gave away .
He would buy up patents and then file lawsuits against any target with money .
Given the risk / reward pattern associated with patents , he would usually receive a settlement , often a large settlement .
So Mr. P bought the patent on triangularizing matrices for almost nothing and brought suit against the spreadsheet manufacturers .
I was enlisted in their defense , and the attorneys decided that their best bet was to show that the idea was not novel ; i.e. , to find prior art in the literature .
The trouble is that the idea is so obvious that no one could publish it in a journal or conference proceedings .
It might have been written in Mr. Cabin 's notes , but that is not a public disclosure of the idea , so it would n't count even if so .
Well we looked and looked .
I found something in Hilbert 's writings on equational theories that might be interpreted as describing the solution to a triangular system .
One of the other people on the team found a thesis from MIT in 1962 that solved the following problem .
Suppose you are carrying a FORTRAN deck of cards and you drop them .
You'd have a lot of trouble assembling them in the correct order , and if you do n't , the program wo n't run .
But if instead of FORTRAN you used a language that was in effect a triangular system of equations , then you could feed them into the hopper in any order , and another program could topologically sort them and the program would run .
The denouement was less than spectacular .
The judge threw the case out on a technicality .
It was never decided that the patent itself was bogus and should never have been granted .
But at least justice was , in its own weird way , served .
Among the Many Ways to Compress Data
The Lempel - Ziv algorithm , which you should recall involves storing strings that have appeared previously in the file and replacing subsequent occurrences of that string by pointers to the original occurrence .
For instance , if the appears many times , we can save by replacing all but the first to a short pointer to the byte of the file where the first the occurs .
An implementation of the dictionary data abstraction .
Recall this abstraction , which I think is one of Don Knuth 's neatest ideas , is a set with the methods ``insert , '' ``delete , '' and ``membership - test . ''
The dictionary would hold the unique strings seen so far and their original locations in the file .
Because this story takes place in the 1980's , the amount of main memory available was really tiny .
Often a PC had 64 K bytes , or less .
Thus , they had to be careful not to store too many strings in the dictionary , or they would run out of main memory , and performance of the data - compression would drop .
At this point , you should stop and think how you would solve this problem .
That is , you need to pick some dictionary implementation , and modify it so that it will store only a limited number of strings , and yet give the correct answers to queries that ask whether a given string is in the set stored .
Technically , you should think with the mind of someone from 1985 , but I suspect that the method you come up with is likely to have been known in 1985 , and moreover , taught to undergraduates of that year and well before .
Anyway , back to our story .
C was sued by a company we 'll call D , which had a patent on the three steps that I outlined above .
Well not exactly .
They could n't patent Lempel - Ziv , a nice idea that was in the public domain .
They tried to patent the dictionary , but that was n't going to hold up , since the abstraction is in Knuth 's 1973 book .
However , they also patented a particular method for solving the third problem : limiting the size of the dictionary .
I have to be careful not to reveal too much detail , but let us say that one of C and D used a hash table with a limited number of elements per bucket , and the other used a binary search tree with a limited depth .
D sued C for patent infringement , and I enlisted to defend C .
At the trial , the jury learned more about the background of the case .
Previously , C had licensed the software of D to include in its popular software product .
Later , C decided to drop D's software and implement its own version .
That decision was a disaster for D , and apparently the jury thought more about this aspect of the case than about the issue of whether or not the solution of D in the patent was or was not ``obvious . ''
In retrospect I should have been more careful about the implications of a decision in favor of C .
Even though I believe , and will try to argue shortly , that the case reveals a logical flaw in the way patents are treated by the courts , I also feel that it is the responsibility of all in the scientific community to support the ethical handling of intellectual property .
Problem 1 : The Least Novel Ideas May be the Hardest to Refute
If you want to find a good idea in software , you can probably find that in the CS literature as well .
But what about a bad , trivial , or blatently not - novel idea ?
You are unlikely to find that published , because program committees and journal referees reject such articles .
Unlike most fields , software has a written repository outside the conventional literature : the software itself .
Many mundane ideas appear in software ; well - crafted software is often mundane .
However , documents such as unpublished software are excluded as a proof that an idea is not novel , because the software itself is not a public document .
As in the case of the patent on triangular matrices , it is often quite hard to find a public , written statement of the idea , giving the illusion to the court that the idea indeed may be novel .
An interesting exploitation of this paradox is the Web site called Bounty Quest ( Added 12/28/07 : this site no longer exists in the form I referred to . )
There you will see published rewards for finding in the literature a document that represents prior art for some of the most notorious patents of obvious ideas , including the one - click patent .
The people who have offered the rewards are probably safe .
The reason , as stated above , is that no one would be able to publish the idea in a public place .
( Added 2/7/01 : Jim Ward of Bounty Quest informed me that there had indeed been some prior art discovered and that they had awarded bounties to four winners . )
More importantly , by diverting attention to the issue of novelty --- the nonexistence of a prior document describing the exact idea --- the sponsors of the bounty quest are able to ignore the true issue : the ideas are obvious , and something very much like it would be developed by anyone faced with the same challenge .
Problem 2 : It Is not Always Obvious What Is Obvious
If the patent examiner believes that the result of such a hypothetical experiment is as I suggested above , then they are obliged to reject a claim such as ``any method for limiting the size of a dictionary during execution of the Lempel - Ziv algorithm . ''
However , they should grant a patent on the actual method used .
But when the case goes into court , something very different happens .
A court will not necessarily allow one to circumvent a patent by achieving the same goal in a different way .
In the data - compression case , changing the data structure completely was thought to be an equivalent implementation of the patented idea .
Thus , we have the following paradox :
When deciding whether an idea is obvious , the existence of an equivalence class of well - understood solutions does not render all of them as a class ``obvious . ''
Yet when a patent on one method is granted , it de facto covers all members of the class .
What Can We Do About The Problem ?
I 'd love to see the standards of the program committee used to measure what was patentable .
These standards include novelty and nonobviousness ; they also include usefulness , although with perhaps a disagreement about the immediacy of use .
It 's not going to happen because : Courts really like the jury system .
The idea of substituting an elite for random jurors , even in a specialized matter like patent validity , scares many , including me .
Publication is an unfair requirement for the start of the patent - granting process .
The reason is that , should a patent not be granted , you have the right to keep the idea as a trade secret --- not protected by law , but protected by your own best efforts .
Incidentally , Peter points out that anyone filing a patent outside the US will have their application ( not just the granted patent ) made public after 18 months .
Moreover , in the US , a year 2000 change also results in publication of the application after 18 months , unless the inventor certifies they will not file in any other country .
I 'd love to see public review of patents before they are granted .
It would be wonderful if responsible scientists regularly argued for the obviousness , or provided prior citations , for weak patents .
The right of the inventor to keep ideas secret if they are not granted a patent makes this approach a nonstarter , as well .
I 'd love to see a requirement for the demonstration , along with every patent granted , of the superiority of the method .
This criterion is implicit in the way we evaluate our own work .
You ca n't just publish a paper saying ``here is how I would solve this problem ' ' ; you need a justification , such as being the only way known at the time ( e.g. , the RSA patent ) , or being provably faster , simpler , or more general than previously known methods .
Surprisingly , there is nothing in patent law that requires a patented method to be good .
Worse , because of the paradox regarding equivalence classes of methods , the patent on a bad method can turn out to cover a good method .
But here are a few things I encourage you to try .
First , although a professor of theoretical computer science is not a good model of a person practicing the art with ordinary skill , we are a large source of experts , and experts play an important role in the process of validating patents .
Some of the arguments we need to mobilize in support of true innovations and against the bogus or trivial are :
The behind - the - scenes row between broadband providers and the record industry over filesharing has turned public , with internet trade association ISPA nominating the BPI for its " Villain of the Year " gong today .
BPI boss Geoff Taylor .
Caption suggestions in the comments please .
The ISPs are under pressure to make a voluntary deal with rights holders to disconnect persistent illegal filesharers .
The government has threatened to introduce legislation in November if the pair can't agree .
It 's obviously not going well , however .
ISPA says the BPI makes this year 's villain list " for its heavy handed approach against consumers rather than engaging in constructive dialogue with the internet industry when dealing with filesharing " .
The BPI was unavailable to respond today .
In December its chief executive Geoff taylor said : " The BPI has been seeking to persuade ISPs for more than a year that they should implement such procedures [ disconnecting filesharers ] but progress has been limited . "
ISPA also named Conservative leader David Cameron as a villain of the last 12 months " for buddying up with the music industry and trying to appeal to a younger audience " .
Cameron gave the keynote speech at the BPI AGM in July and promised to extend copyright term if record companies agree to " positive role models for young kids " .
More pursuant to his nomination , he also said ISPs should do more to help the BPI battle illegal filesharing .
Competitiveness minister Stephen Timms ' nomination is notable in the " Hero of the Year category " , " for leading the push to increase internet access speeds , paving the way for services such as high - definition internet TV " .
Timms ' work has so far been limited to promising something called a " vision statement " on next generation broadband .
Winners will be announced on 14 March , and the full list of nominations is here , including a bizarre " Hero " nod for Facebook " for respecting peoples ' browsing privacy " . ®
Call me a Luddite .
Call me an ostrich .
Call me delusional .
Just please , stop calling me up , mailing me propaganda , and bombarding my news with Chicken Little - esque reports of global warming .
This is no longer a secret that needs to be leaked immediately !
Yes , there are climate changes .
Drastic ones , at that .
All I have to do is stick my head out the window to notice them .
Having read an enormous amount of history , I�ve also noticed that drastic climate changes are nothing new .
What I don�t recall reading were reports of ancient Egyptians blaming embalming fluid emissions for the years of drought .
Granted , a great deal of scientific history may have been lost in the Alexandria Library flare up back in 48 BC .
( Well , the year depends on the scholar you �re reading at the time . )
However , as of this date , archaeologists have yet to decipher Sanskrit scrolls demanding improved flatulence guards for camels in order to cool down the desert .
Nonetheless , global warming has been a long time coming , and I have no doubt we�ve hurried it along with kooky things like industrial revolutions and an abundance of walking beef carted along by big rigs .
What irritates the everlasting life out of me is the bit where they keep telling us what we already know .
Global warming has progressed from concern to bandwagon .
Look here , people .
I know perfectly well that if I don�t recycle or use random and sundry products responsibly , I �m contributing wicker to the hand basket this planet is riding to hell in .
You�ve told me .
You�ve told the country .
You�ve told the world .
A Nobel Prize has been awarded for telling the world something it�s already been told .
I�ve listened to possible solutions ranging from aerosol eradication to alternate fuel solutions to lowering my toilet paper usage to one square per bathroom incident .
( Remind me to never shake hands with that concerned little rock star . )
Here�s what I �m asking .
If you �re so all fired concerned about it , stop telling me it�s looming over my head like a vengeful IRS agent I denied in a cocktail lounge .
Get together in your happy little think tank .
Eat your healthy snacks , drink your green tea with anti-oxidants , meld your brilliant little minds , and then get back to me when you all agree on a viable solution .
Really , if you haven�t driven me to a point by then where anything with the words � Global Warming � curdle my ovaries , I�ll read it .
I�ll probably even take your advice if it�s within my ability to do so .
And please , send someone in a lab coat to tell me what you came up with .
It �s bloody hard to take seriously anyone with a name that involves a season , flower , or lunar phase .
Until that day arrives , I�ll tell you honestly , the first pieces of paper I�ll merrily recycle daily will be �literature� proclaiming I , personally , can stop Global Warming by unplugging my toaster and putting more corn in my fuel tank than on my table .
I�ll be waiting .

For a legion of bloggers , what 's so delectable about these stories is the apparent hypocrisy , the dissonance between the outwardly conservative politics of these men and their private same - sex behavior .
But while these guys may be liars -- Craig 's " wide stance " inanity has already entered the world - historical lexicon of political b.s.-- it's not clear that they are conniving hypocrites .
Hypocrisy is among the most universal and well - studied of psychological phenomena , and the research suggests that Craig , Haggard and the others may be guilty not so much of moral hypocrisy as moral weakness .
The distinction may sound trivial at first , but as a society , we tend to forgive the weak and shun the hypocritical .
Assume for a moment that Craig and Haggard actually believed what they said -- that homosexuality is sin .
They spent most of their lives fighting for the conservative cause .
But in Craig 's case , the Idaho Statesman has published allegations that there were at least three other slipups involving men , beginning in 1967 .
What if , like the radio host who gets fat but commits to losing weight , the moralizers were trying through their " pro-family " endeavors to expiate their lustful sins ?
If you go around saying homosexuality is immoral and a sin while you 're secretly engaging in homosexual activity then you are a hypocrite !
NOT RUN FOR SENATOR ????!!!
NOT DEMONIZED HOMOSEXUALS AT EVERY FUCKING OPPORTUNITY FOR 40 YEARS !!!!!??
You may think they are wrong about homosexuality ( I do ) , but that does n't make them hypocrites .
1 : a person who puts on a false appearance of virtue or religion
2 : a person who acts in contradiction to his or her stated beliefs or feelings

Ladies and gentleman , I have just read the stupidest article ever written .
It was awful .
So awful I can hardly think ; in fact , I think I just lost 5 IQ points ... which still puts me 130 ahead of the author of the shittiest , most servile , most idiotic article ever written .
His name is John Cloud and he masquerades as a journalist for .
He has apparently managed to learn how to read and write , but I have no idea how given his feeble mental faculties .
Many of you may have already read this article , but I just found it today as I was catching up on some reading .
Here I am , flipping throughand I see a story called " The Psychology of Hypocrisy " which is about the recent Republican sex scandals , including Larry " Wide Stance " Craig , the homo - hating Senator from Idaho .
Cloud takes them to task , right ?
He presents an in - depth analysis of how the perverted mind of sanctimonious fucks like Larry Craig works , right ?
No .
The " article " is a six paragraph defense of hypocrites like Craig .
Cloud claims -- with a straight face -- that poor Craig is a victim !
A victim of his own " moral weakness " and not a hypocrite at all !
The real bad guys -- of course -- are the evil bloggers and their readers who have tormented poor Larry and his " friends " .
It 's " not clear " ?
It 's not fucking clear that they 're hypocrites ?!
If you 're deaf , dumb , blind and live on Mars it might not be clear , but if you have half a fucking brain you know they 're hypocrites !
Shit , even the Republicans know that , but Mr. John Cloud is far stupider than a Republican .
He 's a Vichy Democrat ; you know the kind : The Hillary - voting kind who would let Bush attack Iran with no justification whatsoever .
Republicans may be evil , but at least I can respect them ; the Vichy Democrats are contemptible , spineless weasels who are n't worth a pint of warm piss .
Trivial ?
No , the distinction is utterly fallacious and disingenuous .
It makes me think he knows he 's full of shit .
John Cloud is the perfect example of a sell - out journalist hack .
He afflicts the afflicted and comforts the comfortable because he 's a boot - licking shill for his corporate masters and has no soul left .
Real journalists do the reverse , of course , but I 'm not expecting that much from Mr. Cloud .
Just a lucid thought or two would impress me at this point .
Let me explain this to Mr. Cloud as succinctly as possible since we might be looking at a buffer - overflow if I use to many big words :
End of story .
How hard is this to understand ?
I certainly agree that people should be forgiven for most moral failures , but this is not just a " slipup . "
Maybe Cloud " accidentally " fucks other men in the ass so he and Craig are kindred , klutzy spirits , but most of us do not have that problem ( throughout the article Cloud implies homosexuality is indeed a moral failure ) .
But it 's clear that this is a pattern in Larry Craig 's life , going back , at least to 1967 .
Here 's a thought :
If you have a " moral failing " that leads you to accidentally get blowjobs from other men , maybe you should n't get on a stage and tell people that homosexuality is sinful behavior that only degenerates and Democrats engage in !
Maybe if Larry Craig did n't want to be a hypocrite he could have , I dunno , Maybe he could have ( just a thought here ) ... Just a thought .
Clearly , it 's one that John Cloud did n't think of while he was standing in line at men's room outside of Larry Craig 's office .
Maybe this is all a closeted homosexual thing and cognitive dissonance has set in , but I kind of doubt it .
I think it 's more likely that John Cloud is an intellectual whore and his opinions are up for auction to the highest bidder .
But even that is charitable .
Worst case : the guy really is as stupid as I 've been saying .
No , John , they are hypocrites , and no amount of waffling on your part will disguise that .
In fact , they are textbook hypocrites .
Hey , I know !
Why do n't I consult a " dictionary " ( it 's a book where words are defined , Mr. Cloud ) .
Here 's Merriam - Webster 's definition of hypocrite : Hmmm .... " false appearance of virtue " ... does that sound like Mr. Larry " wide stance " Craig ?
Craig never said anything like , " Homosexuality is wrong and immoral , but I am not a perfect man .
Indeed , sometimes I like to head down to public bathrooms near my house and solicit gay men for sex . "
Nope , Larry Craig always implied that he was a paragon of ( hetero ) virtue .
How else do you get elected Senator in a red state ?
Clearly , the man has acted in contradiction to his stated beliefs .
It 's right there in black & white , but John Cloud is intent on casting a cloud of confusion over the matter when this is probably one of the most clear - cut , bald - faced acts of hypocrisy ( that we know about ) in modern politics .
Only Mark Foley can hold a candle to Larry Craigs hypocrisy .
Is there anybody out there who is n't convinced that what I 've described is hypocrisy ?
Is there anybody out there who actually agrees with John Cloud that poor Larry and Mark are victims of a cruel and fickle public ?
How is it that I , a lowly , potty - mouthed , mudslinging blogger was able to tear into this article with such ease ?
No doubt others have already done the same ; how did Cloud 's piece of shit article get past his editor ?
Do they not have dictionaries atheadquarters ?
Budget cutbacks , perhaps ?
It makes me wonder if stupidity is actuallyin the mainstream press because stupid people will never investigate how the Corporate Oligarchy really works .
Everybody knows what goes on in Washington ...
Or do we ?
Without better reporters than John Cloud the Clown we 'll never know for sure .
So what of Mr. Cloud , then ?
How did this idiot manage to write the stupidest article ever written ?
Was it training ?
Nature ?
Nurture ?
Luck ?
Who cares ; the man is a fucking moron .
What amazes me is that this guy is a journalist at a mainstream publication and they have n't canned his ass yet .
How fucking stupid can you be and still keep your job ?
Near as I can tell John Cloud has only one person in serious contention with him for that award and his name is George .
Then again , maybe both of them were chosentheir stupidity , rather than in spite of it .
I guess , in both cases , the joke is on us :
The morons are in control and livin ' the good life while the rest of us suffer like fools under their mindless tyrrany .
Life 's not just unfair ... it 's fucking stupid .
Maliciously so .

Yesterday , the Federal Communications Commission released its final set of rules ( PDF ) and bidder list ( PDF ) for next week 's 700M Hz spectrum auction .
Of the 266 applications originally received by the FCC , 214 bidders have made the final cut .
There are no surprises in the final list , but the collapse of Frontline Wireless means that there may be no one bidding on the D block of spectrum .
The spectrum in the auction will be vacated by television broadcasters in February 2009 when analog TV transmissions cease , and is divided into five blocks .
The A , B , and E blocks consist of regional licenses , which should make it feasible for bidders such as the Northeast Nebraska Telephone Company , James Valley Cooperative Telephone Company , Citizens Mutual Telephone Cooperative , and The Tri-County Telephone Association , Inc. , to get spectrum for wireless Internet service .
The C and D blocks were expected to be where the action would be , and the bidding for the C block is still expected to be hot and heavy with the likes of AT&T , Google , and Verizon bidding .
With Frontline Wireless out of the picture , there 's a bit of mystery surrounding the D block , however .
Whoever wins the auction for the D block will be required to build a national network that will be used for both commercial and public safety communications , making it less attractive to some would - be bidders .
Should the reserve prices for any of the blocks be unmet , those could be reauctioned at a later date , presumably with fewer requirements and a lower reserve price .
It 's also possible that the FCC might accept a lower bid for Block D should it be close to the reserve .
Here 's how the reserve prices stack up :
Block A : $ 1.807 billion
Block B : $ 1.374 billion
Block C : $ 4.638 billion
Block D : $ 1.330 billion
Block E : $ 903.7 million
Note that those are aggregate reserves , which means that the total of the bids on the smaller regional within blocks A , B , and E must exceed the FCC 's mandated total .
Bidders will remain anonymous in this auction , and companies participating in the auction are forbidden from any sort of collusion .
Bidders are not allowed to collude or otherwise share information with one another " about bids , bidding strategies , or settlements , which may include communications regarding post-auction market structure , unless they have identified each other on their short - form applications as parties with which they have entered into agreements under Section 1.2105 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( viii ) . "
The auction begins on January 24 with two rounds of bidding , and will continue with three rounds of bidding each weekday until the auction closes .
Next time you 're reaching down for that iPod or Zune ( or anything else for that matter ) , take care that you do n't alarm the authorities with any suspicious movements -- or you could end up like the UK's Darren Nixon .
Apparently , the mild - mannered mechanic was on his way home from work when the Bobbies surrounded him and drew their guns , believing that the MP3 player in his pocket was a firearm .
According to the Daily Mail , Mr. Nixon was tracked on CCTV , arrested at gunpoint , swabbed for DNA , fingerprinted , and thrown in a cell -- all for listening to a bootleg of Chinese Democracy on a 4GB Philips GoGear .
Said Darren , " I was really shocked when I saw the guns .
They were pointing them right at me .
It was a pretty scary experience .
I had no idea what was going on . "
After the team of Mentat cops realized their mistake , they could n't even offer an apology , said Nixon , " They just dropped me off at home and said a quick ' sorry for any inconvenience ' , and that was all I got from them , which I thought was pretty out of order . "
Once again , a hot serving of sweet justice .

Follow Up to Bias Against Torture and Kind Right - Handers
Imagine that one month after the 9/11 attacks the U.S. conducted a massive bombing campaign against terrorist training camps in Afghanistan .
Further assume that ( 1 ) the U.S. knew Bin Laden was well hidden and so the attacks would have no significant chance of killing him , ( 2 ) the U.S. military had estimated that about 5,000 innocents would die because of the bombings and indeed around 5,000 innocents did die , and ( 3 ) the bombings were conducted mainly to deter future terrorist attacks against the U.S.
Such a bombing campaign would have been widely supported in the U.S. Most Americans would assign the moral blame for the civilian deaths to Bin Laden .
But now imagine that instead of conducting a bombing campaign President Bush ordered the assassination of Bin Laden ’s closest relatives .
Assume that 500 people were killed including all of Bin Laden ’s parents , grandparents , children , uncles , aunts , and first cousins who were alive on 9/11 .
President Bush , lets assume , announced that although those killed were innocents their deaths were necessary to deter future terrorist attacks against the U.S.
My guess is that for ordering such assassinations Bush would have been impeached , removed from office and sentenced to either death or life in prison .
The relative expected responses to the bombing campaign and assassinations seem inconsistent because fewer innocents would die with the assassinations and the assassinations might well have a greater deterrence effect on future terrorists .
We would be less bothered by the bombings , I suspect , because we could claim that we did n’t want the innocents to die .
But if we estimate that X number of innocents will die because of a military strike , why should it morally matter whether we actually wanted these X people to perish ?

The 9/11 Commissioners knew that military officials lied to the Commission , and considered recommending criminal charges for such false statements , yet did n't bother to tell the American people ( free subscription required ) .
The 9/11 Commission co-chairs do n't believe the 9/11 Commission Report :
The co-chairs of the Commission now admit that the Commission largely operated based upon political considerations .
Chairman Thomas Kean says that the CIA intentionally impeded the 9/11 Commission 's investigation and says “ I ’m upset that [ the government ] did n’t tell us the truth . ”
9/11 Commissioner Timothy Roemer said " We were extremely frustrated with the false statements we were getting "
One of the primary architects of the 9/11 Commission Report , Ernest May , said in May 2005 , " We never had full confidence in the interrogation reports as historical sources . "
And the high - level attorney who led the 9/11 staff 's inquiry , said " I was shocked at how different the truth was from the way it was described ....
The tapes told a radically different story from what had been told to us and the public for two years ....
This is not spin .
This is not true . "
The Co-Chair of the Congressional Inquiry into 9/11 and former Head of the Senate Intelligence Committee , Bob Graham , does n't believe it either .
Graham
:
Senator Bob Graham , the Florida Democrat who is a former chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , accused the White House on Tuesday of covering up evidence . . .
* * *
The accusation stems from the Federal Bureau of Investigation 's refusal to allow investigators for a Congressional inquiry and the independent Sept. 11 commission to interview an informant , Abdussattar Shaikh , who had been the landlord in San Diego of two Sept. 11 hijackers .
In his book " Intelligence Matters , " Mr. Graham , the co-chairman of the Congressional inquiry with Representative Porter J. Goss , Republican of Florida , said an F.B.I. official wrote them in November 2002 and said " the administration would not sanction a staff interview with the source . ''
On Tuesday , Mr. Graham called the letter " a smoking gun " and said , " The reason for this cover - up goes right to the White House . "
Postscript : David Ray Griffin sent me the following email after reading this post , clarifying the various stories about the conflicting timelines of the military 's response to the hijacked flights ( the first and last points cited above ) :
What the 9/11 Commission calls lies by the military are places where officers have contradicted the Commission ’s own new story about why the flights were not intercepted , as I explained in the latter half of “ Omissions and Distortions ” and more briefly in “ Flights of Fancy ” ( in Christian Faith and the Truth behind 9/11 ) and then again in the first chapter of Debunking 9/11 Debunking .
As I show , the idea that the military would have deliberately told the kinds of lies alleged by the Commission makes absolutely no sense .
Why ?
Because the story that the military told in “ NORAD ’s Response Times ” ( Sept. 18 , 2001 ) , and continued to tell to the 9/11 Commission , got the military only partly off the hook , because it left them vulnerable to the charge that they had either stood - down their standard procedures or had been incredibly incompetent .
According to the new story told by the 9/11 Commission , the FAA did n’t even notify the military about Flights 175 , 77 , and 93 until after they had crashed .
This gets the military completely off the hook , at least for those 3 flights .
If that had been the truth , it would have been completely irrational for the military to have lied by saying that the FAA had given them notice in time for them to have intercepted the flights .
But the 9/11 Commission could handle the contradictions between its new story and the military ’s old story only by claiming that the military had made false statements .
( And since it was hard to see how the military officers could have been confused , the inference was made that they had lied . )
This is not to say that the story the military had told was true .
It is possible that the old story and the new story are both false .
Indeed , I believe that to be the case .
E.g. , the military ’s claim that it was not notified until 9:24 about Flight 77 contradicts the FAA memo , sent to to the Commission by Laura Brown on May 22 , 2003 , stating that the FAA had been in conversation with the military about Flight 77 long before 9:24 .
So the Commission knew that the military ’s story was a lie .
It responded by increasing the lie by suppressing the memo and saying that the FAA NEVER notified the military . )
Many of the other 9/11 Commissioners do n't buy it :
And many other key players in generating the Report do n't believe it :
They do n't believe it .
Why do you ?

ACLU learns of third ' secret ' torture memo from Gonzales Justice Department RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday November 6 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Legal papers filed in federal court Monday in a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union and other organizations disclose that the Justice Department 's Office of Legal Counsel ( OLC ) issued three secret memorandums relating to interrogation practices of detainees -- one more than has been publicly revealed .
The New York Times revealed two memoranda authored in 2005 relating to " harsh interrogation " of prisoners held by the CIA .
One explicitly authorized interrogators to use combinations of psychological enhanced  interrogation practices including waterboarding , head slapping , and stress positions .
The second declared that none of the CIAs interrogation methods violated a law being considered by Congress that outlawed cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment .
More details in a press release sent by the ACLU Tuesday afternoon follow .
Until now , the existence of only two of those memos had been reported and it was not known precisely when the memos had been written .
The memos are believed to have authorized the CIA to use extremely harsh interrogation methods including waterboarding .
 These torture memos should never have been written , and it is utterly unacceptable that the administration continues to suppress them while at the same time declaring publicly that it abhors torture ,  said Jameel Jaffer , Director of the ACLUs National Security Project .
 It is now obvious that senior administration officials worked in concert over a period of several years to evade and violate the laws that prohibit cruelty and torture .
Some degree of accountability is long overdue .
The memos should have been  but were not  identified and processed for the ACLU as part of its Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) lawsuit requesting information on the treatment and interrogation of detainees in U.S. custody .
In response to legal papers filed by the ACLU on October 24 objecting to that omission and requesting the release of the two memos , the government filed papers Monday stating : OLC has reviewed its opinions from that time frame and has determined that there were in fact three opinions issued to CIA relating to the interrogation of detainees in CIA custody
Two of the opinions were issued on May 10 , 2005 The third was issued on May 30 , 2005 ... OLC has not located any legal opinions issued to CIA from January 31 , 2005 through May 9 , 2005 that relate to the interrogation of detainees in CIA custody . ( emphasis added )
In addition to neglecting to provide the relevant memos to the ACLU as part of its FOIA lawsuit , the government has also withheld the documents from key senators in a congressional inquiry .
 The Justice Departments failure to identify and disclose these memos is yet another example of its efforts to thwart public inquiry into its authorization of illegal interrogation methods ,  said Amrit Singh , a staff attorney with the ACLUs Immigrants 
Rights Project .
 The memos must immediately be disclosed , and high ranking officials must be held accountable for authorizing torture .
The OLC memos  and the possibility of others that might remain unknown  take on particular meaning as the confirmation process continues today in Congress regarding the nomination of Michael Mukasey for attorney general .
Mukasey has been the subject of intense criticism over his refusal to identify waterboarding as torture .
A hearing regarding the ACLUs request for the release of OLC torture memos is scheduled for November 13 , 2007 at 4 p.m. Eastern Standard Time in federal court in New York .
A copy of the ACLUs brief requesting production of outstanding documents is online at : www.aclu.org/safefree/torture/32572lgl20071024.html
The governments response to the ACLUs brief is online at : www.aclu.org/safefree/torture/32573lgl20071105.html

Many of these documents are also contained and summarized in a recently published book by Jaffer and Singh , Administration of Torture .

San Francisco - based Dr Hootan Roozrokh , who could face up to eight years in jail if convicted , denies the charges .
He is accused of ordering large amounts of narcotic painkillers and sedatives for a Ruben Navarro , 25 , before he was officially declared dead .
Mr Navarro 's mother says her son was exploited and did not die with dignity .
Dr Roozrokh is also charged with administering the antiseptic Betadine through a feeding tube into the patient 's stomach .
That procedure typically takes place once a donor has died .
Prosecutors claim this occurred just after Mr Navarro , who was physically and mentally disabled , was taken off life support .
He survived for another seven hours .
The BBC's David Willis , in California , says that with nearly 100,000 people on the national waiting list for organs , the case has raised questions about the ethics of removing a patient from life support simply to retrieve their organs .
He adds that some believe the charges against Dr Roozrokh could prompt surgeons to be more cautious in how and when they recover organs .
SIX years ago this Tuesday , President Bush granted American armed forces sweeping authority to detain and interrogate foreign members of Al Qaeda and their supporters and to use military commissions to try them .
By doing so , the president set in motion the creation of military commissions and the detention camp in Guantánamo Bay , Cuba .
The Bush administration may legitimately claim certain benefits from the Guantánamo system .
Some dangerous men are held there , and valuable intelligence has probably been gathered , perhaps even some that has enabled the government to disrupt terrorist activities .
But the costs have been high .
Guantánamo has come to be seen worldwide as a stain on America ’s reputation .
The military commissions have failed to deliver justice , stymied by the federal courts ’ refusal to permit the president to create a system at odds with United States courts - martial and the international law of war .
Meanwhile , the number of detainees at Guantánamo has steadily dropped to a little over 300 , from its peak of more than 700 , no more than 80 of whom are likely to face any kind of American prosecution .
Not a single defendant has gone to trial , and only one has pleaded guilty .
I guess , there is justica , afterl all .

A judge who lost a $ 54 million lawsuit against his dry cleaner over a pair of missing pants has lost his job , District of Columbia officials confirmed .
Roy Pearson 's term as an administrative law judge expired May 2 and the D.C. Commission on Selection and Tenure of Administrative Law Judges has voted not to reappoint him , Lisa Coleman , the city 's general counsel , wrote Nov. 8 in response to a Freedom of Information Act request from The Associated Press .
Pearson was one of about 30 judges who worked in the Office of Administrative Hearings , which handles disputes involving city agencies .
He had held his position for two years .
The Washington Post and The ( Washington ) Examiner , citing sources familiar with the case , reported the commission 's decision last month .
Coleman refused to release a copy of a letter to Pearson informing him of the decision , saying it is considered a personnel matter .
Pearson 's lawsuit in D.C. Superior Court claimed Custom Cleaners , owned by South Korean immigrants , did not live up to Pearson 's expectations of " Satisfaction Guaranteed , " as advertised in store windows .
Pearson demanded repayment for the lost pants , as well as damages for inconvenience , mental anguish and attorney 's fees for representing himself .
He calculated his losses initially at $ 67 million but lowered his request to $ 54 million .

An insidious computer virus recently discovered on digital photo frames has been identified as a powerful new Trojan Horse from China that collects passwords for online games - and its designers might have larger targets in mind .
" It is a nasty worm that has a great deal of intelligence , " said Brian Grayek , who heads product development at Computer Associates , a security vendor that analyzed the Trojan Horse .
The virus , which Computer Associates calls Mocmex , recognizes and blocks antivirus protection from more than 100 security vendors , as well as the security and firewall built into Microsoft Windows .
It downloads files from remote locations and hides files , which it names randomly , on any PC it infects , making itself very difficult to remove .
It spreads by hiding itself on photo frames and any other portable storage device that happens to be plugged into an infected PC .
The authors of the new Trojan Horse are well - funded professionals whose malware has " specific designs to capture something and not leave traces , " Grayek said .
" This would be a nuclear bomb " of malware .
By studying how the code is constructed and how it 's propagated , Computer Associates has traced the Trojan to a specific group in China , Grayek said .
He would not name the group .
The strength of the malware shows how skilled hackers have become and how serious they are about targeting digital devices , which provide a new frontier for stealing information from vast numbers of unwary PC owners .
More than 2.26 million digital frames were sold in 2007 , according to the Consumer Electronics Association , and it expects sales to grow to 3.26 million in 2008 .
The new Trojan also has been spotted in Singapore and the Russian Federation and has 67,500 variants , according to Prevx , a security vendor headquartered in England .
Grayek said Mocmex might be a test for some bigger attack , because it 's designed to capture any personal , private or financial information , yet so far it 's only stealing passwords for online games .
" If I send you a package but it does n't explode , why did I send it ? " he said .
" Maybe I want to see if I can get it out to you and how you open it . "
The initial reports of infected frames came from people who had bought them over the holidays from Sam's Club and Best Buy .
New reports involve frames sold at Target and Costco , according to SANS , a group of security researchers in Bethesda , Md. , who began asking for accounts of infected devices on Christmas Day .
So far the group has collected more than a dozen complaints from people across the country .
The new Trojan is n't the only piece of malware involved .
Deborah Hale of Sans said the researchers also found four other , older Trojans on each frame , which may serve as markers for botnets - networks of infected PCs that are remotely controlled by hackers .
There is W32 .
Rajump , which deposits the same piece of malware that infected some of Apple 's video iPods during manufacturing in October 2006 .
It gathers Internet Protocol addresses and port numbers from infected PCs and ships them out , according to Symantec .
One destination is registered to a service in China that allows people to conceal their own IP addresses .
Then there is a generic Trojan ; a Trojan that opens a back door on PCs and displays pop-up ads ; and a Trojan that spreads itself through portable devices like Mocmex does .
How all this malware got onto the photo frames and what it 's doing there is unclear .
Trojans can download other Trojans , which is part of how botnets are controlled .
While SANS is investigating the infections , the retailers are saying little .
Sam's Club said it has found no infected frames , and its distributor , Advanced Design Systems , did not return calls seeking comment .
A few Target customers complained about frames distributed by Uniek , a store spokesman confirmed .
Target is no longer selling those frames , but that 's because the frames did n't sell well over the holidays , he said .
Target has found no infections , he said , but is watching for them .
Best Buy said one line of its Insignia frames - also now discontinued - was infected during manufacturing but would not provide details .
Costco did not return calls seeking comment .
The United States remains the world leader in scientific and technological innovation , but its dominance is threatened by economic development elsewhere , particularly in Asia , the National Science Board said Tuesday in its biennial report on science and engineering .
The United States ’ position is especially delicate , the agency said , given its reliance on foreign - born workers to fill technical jobs .
The board is the oversight agency for the National Science Foundation , the leading source of money for basic research in the physical sciences .
The report , on the Web at nsf.gov / statistics / indicators , recommends increased financing for basic research and greater “ intellectual interchange ” between researchers in academia and industry .
The board also called for better efforts to track the globalization of high - tech manufacturing and services and their implications for the American economy .

Jesus Diaz :
The first time I saw your photo I could n't believe anyone could have as many Apple computers as you do , at least not outside of a museum .
How many do you actually have ?
James Savage : About 100 Macs and Apple computers ( one NeXT ) are in Macca [ the spare room ] , with another 25 or so Macs in our home office and the rest of the Macs are in use throughout the house .
Advertisement
JD : How long did it take to get all these Macs and when did you start ?
JS : I 've been using Macs since my first , a Macintosh Plus , purchased new in 1988 .
I really began accumulating them in large numbers about five years ago .
It originally began just as a quest to access some old Apple II files by getting an Apple IIe .
Then , I wanted to transfer the files so an LC with a IIe emulator card was the best way to do this .
Once I realized how inexpensively I could get Macs I once owned or desired to own , I really went crazy .
There were many months when I would receive at least a Mac a week .
I guess you can say that it has been about five years of serious collecting to get me where I am today .
JD : Once you find them , do they take a long time to restore ?
JS : Macs hold up very well , so often , little is needed .
I might have to do a little cleaning of the case and a fresh OS install , but other than that , most of them run like the day they were purchased when I receive them .
Advertisement
Some of the Macs are harder to find because they were never sold in the US .
My Color Classic II was a nice find since it is a Japanese model ( complete with Japanese Mac OS and keyboard ) that found its way to the States .
I have a IIvi that was sold to me by a military family who had purchased it new in Germany .
JD : And after that , how much time per day do you dedicate to taking care of them ?
JS : They really do n't need much care and feeding .
I have about a dozen or so Macs that are powered 24 hours a day , and other than the periodic software update , they do just fine with little intervention .
On the RetroMacCast we like to feature a different Mac each week .
To prepare for that , I 'll power up the featured Mac , reacquaint myself with it , and take pictures of it for the podcast .
Advertisement
From time to time , we 'll get tech support questions from our listeners , so that gives me a chance to use the older Macs to test solutions .
With every Mac made and countless pieces of software , peripherals , and connectors , I can pretty much duplicate any configuration .
JD : Do you sometimes turn them on and play with them , to check them out or say hi ?
JS : Yes , sometimes I 'll do that when I feel a little nostalgic .
The new display room permits me to have many of them set up for operation .
As people come to visit , I 'll be able to turn them on and show the operation of different Macs throughout their history .
JD : How much money do you think this collection could sell for on eBay ?
JS : As a lot ?
That 's a tough question .
Most of the money in this collection is in my time spent gathering everything .
Strictly talking about the value of the computers , the lot is n't worth very much at all .
Computers , with rare exception , do not appreciate .
Even a pristine original 128k Macintosh is only worth a fraction of what it cost new .
The sum total of my collection excluding the later models is probably worth about the price of brand new fully - loaded Mac Pro .
[ I personally think it would be worth a lot more than that for the entire collection - JD ]
JD : And finally , do you know many people who have this many Macs ?
JS : Many people have large numbers of Macs , some approach my numbers or even exceed them .
My podcast cohost , John , has around 30 Macs at his house , and quite a few of our listeners have collections of that size .
As for the larger collections , you might have heard of Jeremy Mehrle .
Jeremy 's collection is quite spectacular , and he has been featured in many articles .
I think he 's hovering around 100 Apple computers .
Also , I 've just learned that one of our listeners , Justin from Australia , probably has a few more than I have .
Advertisement
JD : Anything else you want to add ?
JS : Yeah , I would like to thank my wife , Tonya , for her understanding and support of my hobbies and a special thanks to my in - laws , Marty and Tony , for their help in remodeling the hobby room to showcase the collection .
And if you are interested in this , you can check my podcast here .

The common wisdom is that gas stations make almost no profit off the gas itself ( the gas companies make a ton of profit , of course ) and must have side businesses like garages and , above all , snack shops to turn a profit .
What if you were to turn that equation on its head and add a " filling station " to , say , a Starbucks ?
That 's the intriguing possibility raised by an article on SFGate about Hyatt Hotels and Tesla Motors , the Google - founders - financed electric car start - up .
( It 's also been written up on CNET News.com . )
" Hyatt will install Tesla recharging stations at three hotels , stretching in an arc from San Francisco to Lake Tahoe ....
By placing rechargers at Hyatts at Fisherman 's Wharf , Sacramento and Incline Village on Tahoe 's North Shore , a Tesla owner could drive from San Francisco to the lake without fear of running out of juice .
Tesla has already driven one of the roadsters from Tahoe back to the company 's San Carlos headquarters without recharging , but that was downhill , said Diarmuid O'Connell , Tesla 's director of corporate marketing . "
The two companies talked up the brand alignment between them , and how a Tesla customer is a Hyatt customer .
Whether that 's true or not , it 's rather more upscale than an oil company aligning itself with , say , a fast food company to supply burgers at its stations .
Hotels are good places for charging because customers will leave their cars overnight .
Starbucks could enter the picture when you can charge more quickly .
A separate news item in Technology Review about secretive battery manufacturer EEstore claims that they have a battery technology that will give a range of 200 miles -- and charge in less than 10 minutes .
If it 's true ( and there are plenty of skeptics ) , that would make a Starbucks a perfect place to add a charger .
Pull up and park , plug your car in , stand in line for a latte , come on out and you 're off with another 200 miles .
It would transform the aesthetic and tone of " filling up " from one that has become grimy and unpleasant to one that is clean and faintly European .
The gas station as a " third place . "
I love it .
Families of those killed in Baghdad attack sue Blackwater for extrajudicial killing RAW STORY

An injured survivor and the three families of men killed in a Sept. 16 shooting in Baghdad , filed suit against Blackwater USA in a Washington , D.C. federal court this morning .
The case was brought by the Center for Constitutional Rights and the firms of Burke ONeil LLC and Akeel & Valentine , P.C. Talib Mutlaq Deewan , who was wounded in the incident , and the estates of the deceased men  Himoud Saed Atban , Usama Fadhil Abbass , and Oday Ismail Ibraheem  sued Blackwater and its affiliated companies alleging the firm violated U.S. law and created and fostered a culture of lawlessness amongst its employees , encouraging them to act in the companys financial interests at the expense of innocent human life .
The lawsuit is seeking unspecified compensatory damages for " death , physical , mental , and economic injuries , " as well as punitive damages .
According to a synopsis of the suit , the complaint asserts that " Blackwater violated the federal Alien Tort Statute in committing extrajudicial killing and war crimes , and that Blackwater should be liable for claims of assault and battery , wrongful death , intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress , and negligent hiring , training and supervision . "
Michael Ratner , president of the Center for Constitutional Rights cites Blackwater 's " repeated and consistent failure to act in accord with the law of war , U.S. law , and international law . "
" For the good of both nations , as well as for countless innocent civilians , the company cannot be allowed to continue operating extra-legally , providing mercenaries who flout all kinds of law , " he continued .
" This lawsuit , like the ongoing U.S. and Iraqi government investigations , cannot bring back those killed at Nisoor Square but it can make Blackwater accountable for its actions . "
 This senseless slaughter was only the latest incident in a lengthy pattern of egregious misconduct by Blackwater in Iraq ,  Burke O'Neill partner Susan Burke commented .
 At the moment of this incident , the Blackwater personnel responsible for the shooting were not protecting State Department officials .
We allege that Blackwater personnel were not provoked and that they had no legitimate reason to fire on civilians . "
Defendants named in the suit are Blackwater USA , Blackwater Security Consulting LLC , The Prince Group LLC and Erik Prince , Blackwater 's founder .
In 2004 , the Center for Constitutional Rights won a victory in a Supreme Court ruling which determined that so - called enemy combatants held in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , must be afforded the right to challenge their detention before a judge .
The Center represented detainees in the case .
The same year , the group filed a criminal complaint with German authorities , urging them to investigate possible war crimes related to abuses at the US - run Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq .
Under the " doctrine of universal jurisdiction , " the Center stated then , " suspected war criminals may be prosecuted irrespective of where they are located . "
The full text of the Blackwater complaint can be read here in pdf .
The Department of Defense has commissioned a nine - month study from Rice University chemists and scientists in the Texas Medical Center to determine whether a new drug based on carbon nanotubes can help prevent people from dying of acute radiation injury following radiation exposure .
The new study was commissioned after preliminary tests found the drug was greater than 5,000 times more effective at reducing the effects of acute radiation injury than the most effective drugs currently available .
“ More than half of those who suffer acute radiation injury die within 30 days , not from the initial radioactive particles themselves but from the devastation they cause in the immune system , the gastrointestinal tract and other parts of the body , ” said James Tour , Rice ’s Chao Professor of Chemistry , director of Rice ’s Carbon Nanotechnology Laboratory ( CNL ) and principal investigator on the grant .
“ Ideally , we ’d like to develop a drug that can be administered within 12 hours of exposure and prevent deaths from what are currently fatal exposure doses of ionizing radiation . ”
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) has awarded Tour and co-principal investigators J. Conyers and Valerie Moore at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston ( UT - Houston ) and Luka Milas , Kathy Mason and Jeffrey Myers at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center a $ 540,000 grant for a nine - month study of an experimental drug that the investigators have named Nanovector Trojan Horses ( NTH ) .
NTH is made at Rice ’s Chemistry Department and Carbon Nanotechnology Laboratory in the Richard E. Smalley Institute for Nanoscale Science and Technology .
The drug is based on single - walled carbon nanotubes , hollow cylinders of pure carbon that are about as wide as a strand of DNA .
To form NTH , Rice scientists coat nanotubes with two common food preservatives — the antioxidant compounds butylated hydroxyanisole ( BHA ) and butylated hydroxytoluene ( BHT ) — and derivatives of those compounds .
“ The same properties that make BHA and BHT good food preservatives , namely their ability to scavenge free radicals , also make them good candidates for mitigating the biological affects that are induced through the initial ionizing radiation event , ” Tour said .
In preliminary tests at M.D. Anderson in July 2007 , mice showed enhanced protection when exposed to lethal doses of ionizing radiation when they were given first - generation NTH drugs prior to exposure .
“ Our preliminary results are remarkable , and that ’s why DARPA awarded us this grant with a very compressed timeline for delivery : nine months , which is almost unheard of for an academic study of this type , ” Tour said .
“ They are very interested in finding out whether this will work in a post - exposure delivery , and they do n’t want to waste any time . ”
Ionizing radiation is any form of radioactive particle or energy that converts an atom or molecule into an ion by altering the balance between the number of protons and electrons .
In living organisms , ionization often results in the creation of free radicals — highly reactive molecules that can wreak havoc by disrupting healthy physiological processes .
These free radicals induce a cascade of deleterious biological events that cause further destruction to the organism in the days and weeks after initial radiation exposure event .
NTH is designed to terminate the destructive biological cascade .
Tour said the researchers are also interested in finding out whether the new drugs can prevent the unwanted side effects that cancer patients suffer after undergoing radiation therapy .

Three years ago , the British evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins became a guinea pig in an experiment .
Neuroscientist Michael Persinger claimed he had induced religious experiences in subjects by stimulating specific regions of their brains with electromagnetic pulses .
Dawkins , renowned for his biological theories as well as for his criticism of religion , volunteered to test Persinger 's electromagnetic device — the " God machine , " as some journalists dubbed it .
" I 've always been curious to know what it would be like to have a mystical experience , " Dawkins said shortly before the experiment .
Afterward , he admitted on BBC that he was " very disappointed " that he did not experience " communion with the universe " or some other spiritual sensation .
Many researchers , like Persinger , view the brain as the key to understanding religion .
Others focus on psychological , genetic , and biochemical origins .
The science of religion has historical precedents , with Sigmund Freud and William James addressing the topic early in the last century .
Now modern researchers are applying brain scans , genetic probes , and other potent instruments as they attempt to locate the physiological causes of religious experience , characterize its effects , perhaps replicate it , and perhaps even begin to explain its abiding influence .
The endeavor is controversial , stretching science to its limits .
Religion is arguably the most complex manifestation of the most complex phenomenon known to science , the human mind .
Religion 's dimensions range from the intensely personal to the cultural and political .
Additionally , researchers come to study religious experiences with very different motives and assumptions .
Some of them hope that their studies will inform and enrich faith .
Others see religion as an embarrassing relic of our past , and they want to explain it away .
" Even when the neural basis of religion has been identified , it remains a plausible interpretation of any conceivable neuropsychological facts that there is a genuine experience of God , " notes Fraser Watts , a psychologist and theologian at the University of Cambridge and an Anglican vicar .
A major funder of research on religion is the John Templeton Foundation , started in 1987 by the Christian financier John Templeton to promote " collaboration " between science and religion .
The theories described below illustrate the diversity of scientific approaches to understanding religion .
All these theories are tentative at best , and some will almost certainly turn out to be wrong .
The field suffers from vague terminology , disagreement about what exactly " religion " is , and which of its aspects are most important .
Does religion consist primarily of behaviors , such as attending church or following certain moral precepts ?
Or does it consist of beliefs — in God or in an afterlife ?
Is religion best studied as a set of experiences , such as the inchoate feelings of connection to the rest of nature that can occur during prayer or meditation ?
Comparing studies is often an exercise in comparing apples and oranges .
Nonetheless , the science merits close attention .
Inventing God
Stewart Guthrie , an anthropologist at Fordham University in New York , is in the explain - it - away camp of researchers .
Noting the plethora of gods that populate the world 's religions , many with minds and emotions similar to our own , Guthrie argues that the belief in supernatural beings is a result of an illusion that arises from our tendency to project human qualities onto the world .
Religion " may be best understood as systematic anthropomorphism , " he writes in his book , Faces in the Clouds .
Anthropomorphism is an adaptive trait that enhanced our ancestors ' chances of survival , he adds .
If a Neanderthal mistook a tree creaking outside his cave for a human assailant , he suffered no adverse consequences beyond a moment 's panic .
If the Neanderthal made the opposite error — mistaking an assailant for a tree — the consequences might have been dire .
In other words , better safe than sorry .
Over millennia , as natural selection bolstered our unconscious anthropomorphic tendencies , they reached beyond specific objects and events to encompass all of nature , goes Guthrie 's theory , until we persuaded ourselves that " the entire world of our experience is merely a show staged by some master dramatist . "
Humans are not alone in this trait .
In The Descent of Man , Charles Darwin noted that many " higher mammals " share the human propensity " to imagine that natural objects and agencies are animated by spiritual or living essences . "
As an example , he recalled watching his dog growl at a parasol lifted off the ground by a gust of wind .
Andrew Newberg , a neuroscientist at the University of Pennsylvania , has focused on the tendency of people from different religious traditions to report similar mystical experiences , which typically involve sensations of self - transcendence and " oneness . "
These commonalities indicate that the visions stem from the same neural processes , Newberg hypothesizes .
To test his theory , Newberg has scanned the brains of more than 20 adherents of spiritual practices , including Christian prayer and Tibetan Buddhist meditation .
He uses a technique called single - ­photon - emission - computed tomography , or SPECT , a variant of the better - known positron - emission tomography , PET .
The chief advantage of SPECT is that it can capture the brains of meditators in a relatively natural setting .
The subject meditates not in the SPECT chamber itself but in a separate room .
When a subject — a Franciscan nun , in one case — feels her ordinary self " dissolving into Christ consciousness , " as she describes it , a radioactive fluid is injected into her body through an intravenous tube ; the fluid travels to her brain and becomes trapped in nerve cells there .
The nun then goes to the SPECT chamber , where a computer - controlled camera scans her brain .
The resulting image reveals levels of neural activity in the moment immediately after she received the radioactive fluid , when she presumably was still immersed in contemplation .
Newberg 's scans showed that neural activity decreases in a region at the top and rear of the brain called the posterior superior parietal lobe .
Newberg refers to this region as the orientation - association area , because it helps us orient our bodies in relation to the external world .
Patients whose posterior superior parietal lobes have been damaged often lose the ability to navigate through the world , because they have difficulty determining where their physical selves end and where the external world begins .
Newberg hypothesizes that suppressed activity in this brain region ( prompted by an individual 's willed activity ) could heighten a sense of unity with the external world , thus diminishing a person 's sense of subject - object duality .
Intriguingly , Newberg has found some overlap between the neural activity of self - transcendence and of sexual pleasure .
This result makes sense , Newberg says .
Just as orgasms are triggered by a rhythmic activity , so religious experiences can be induced by dancing , chanting , or repeating a mantra .
And both orgasms and religious experiences produce sensations of bliss , self - transcendence , and unity ; that may be why mystics such as Saint Teresa so often employed romantic and even sexual language to describe their raptures .
The overlap between rapture and orgasm is n't total .
The hypothalamus , which regulates both arousal and quiescence , seems to play a larger role in orgasms , while the brain 's frontal lobes , the seat of higher cognitive functions , are apparently more active during spiritual practices .
Nevertheless , Newberg concludes , an " evolutionary perspective suggests that the neurobiology of mystical experience arose , at least in part , from the mechanism of the sexual response . "
Newberg 's research can be questioned on several counts , however .
One might ask what his brain scans are really measuring , since his subjects must remain self - aware enough to pull a string when they reach what is allegedly their deepest state of spirituality .
Also , the SPECT method provides only a snapshot of the brain at a single moment .
Studies of meditation carried out with other techniques , such as magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography , have revealed different patterns of neural activity — not surprisingly , since meditation is a complex behavior that evokes many different psychological states .
THE PRIVATIZATION OF SURVEILLANCE
The U.S. security establishment is rapidly increasing its ability to monitor average Americans by hiring or compelling private - sector corporations to provide billions of customer records .
The explosive growth in surveillance by government and business is creating a " Surveillance - Industrial Complex " ( PDF ) that threatens all of our privacy .
ABOUT THE REPORT
This report makes the case that , across a broad variety of areas , the same dynamic of the " privatization of surveillance " is underway .
Different dimensions of this trend are examined in depth in four separate sections of the report :
" Recruiting Individuals . "
Documents how individuals are being recruited to serve as " eyes and ears " for the authorities even after Congress rejected the infamous TIPS ( Terrorism Information and Prevention System ) program that would have recruited workers like cable repairmen to spy on their customers .
" Recruiting Companies . "
Examines how companies are pressured to voluntarily provide consumer information to the government ; the many ways security agencies can force companies to turn over sensitive information under federal laws such as the Patriot Act ; how the government is forcing companies to participate in watchlist programs and in systems for the automatic scrutiny of individuals ' financial transactions .
" Mass Data Use , Public and Private . "
Focuses on the government 's use of private data on a mass scale , either through data mining programs like the MATRIX state information - sharing program , or the purchase of information from private - sector data aggregators .
" Pro-Surveillance Lobbying . "
Looks at the flip side of the issue : how some companies are pushing the government to adopt surveillance technologies and programs based on private - sector data .

Louis was king of France when the monarchy was overthrown during the French Revolution .
He was guillotined in 1793 .
Louis was born at Versailles on 23 August 1754 .
In 1770 , he married Marie Antoinette , daughter of the emperor and empress of Austria , a match intended to consolidate an alliance between France and Austria .
In 1774 , Louis succeeded his grandfather Louis XV as king of France .
Louis initially supported attempts by his ministers Jacques Turgot and later Jacques Necker to relieve France 's financial problems .
French support for the colonists in the American War of Independence had brought the country to the verge of bankruptcy .
Meanwhile , accusations of frivolity , extravagance and scandalous behaviour against the queen , Marie Antoinette , further discredited the monarchy .
In 1789 , to avert the deepening crisis , Louis agreed to summon the ' estates - general ' ( a form of parliament , but without real power ) in order to try and raise taxes .
This was the first time the body had met since 1614 .
Angered by Louis ' refusal to allow the three estates - the first ( clergy ) , second ( nobles ) and third ( commons ) - to meet simultaneously , the Third Estate proclaimed itself a national assembly , declaring that only it had the right to represent the nation .
Rumours that the king intended to suppress the assembly provoked the popular storming of the Bastille prison , a symbol of repressive royal power , on 14 July 1789 .
In October , Louis and his family were forced by the mob to return to Paris from their palace at Versailles .
In June 1791 , they attempted to escape , which was considered proof of Louis ' treasonable dealings with foreign powers .
He was forced to accept a new constitution , thereby establishing a constitutional monarchy .
Nonetheless , against a background of military defeat by Austria and Prussia , the revolutionary leadership was becoming increasingly radicalised .
In September 1792 , the new National Convention abolished the monarchy and declared France a republic .
Louis was found guilty of treason and executed at the guillotine on 21 January 1793 .
Marie Antoinette was executed nine months later .

Amity Shlaes , The Forgotten Man : A New History of the Great Depression ( New York : Harper Collins , 2007 ) , 464 pp .
Franklin Delano Roosevelt has two principal legacies : the New Deal and World War II .
The latter would have occurred even had he never been elected president , though America might not have intervened in the conflict , or had it done so , might have focused on Europe while avoiding war with Japan .
The New Deal , however , was entirely Roosevelt ’s creation .
And , as Amity Shlaes demonstrates in her spritely written The Forgotten Man , the Roosevelt program was deeply flawed , actually lengthening America ’s economic downturn while dramatically expanding government power and undermining constitutional governance .
As such , the New Deal continues to malform American politics today .
There is a “ standard history of the Great Depression , ” writes Shlaes , a long - time newspaper editor and columnist .
Greed in the 1920s led to economic collapse .
Herbert Hoover failed by opposing necessary government action .
Roosevelt saved America , and capitalism , by engaging in massive federal spending , intrusive government regulation , and national social engineering .
This standard history , along with the usual conservative rebuttal , is largely inaccurate , argues Shlaes .
The title , The Forgotten Man , stems from William Graham Sumner ’s essay by the same name , citing the man , C , who always pays and suffers as a result of the efforts of A and B to help X . In Sumner ’s words , C was “ the man who never is thought of ” even as he is conscripted in the grand reform schemes of others .
Roosevelt picked up on the rhetoric of the forgotten man , but applied it to those he believed required government aid .
Which was pretty much everyone .
Shlaes explores the early history of the Roosevelt years , offering an important perspective ignored by more traditional historians .
The first “ reality , ” as Shlaes calls it , “ was that the 1920s was a great decade of true economic gains , a period whose strong positive aspects have been obscured by the troubles that followed . ”
Although the stock market crash is identified with the Great Depression , it did not cause economic collapse .
The sharp fall in stock prices was an inevitable response to an overinflated market  think housing prices today .
A “ correction , ” is it is so often called , ultimately was necessary for sustained growth to recur .
More relevant to causing and deepening the Depression , in Shlaes view , was the fact that neither Hoover nor Roosevelt understood the problem of deflation .
It ’s an issue that the great free market economist Milton Friedman also highlighted when pointing to the Federal Reserve ’s damaging contraction of the money supply prior to America ’s economic implosion .
Unfortunately , Hoover worsened the economic downturn precisely because he was a market meddler , not a laissez - faire advocate .
Indeed , Shlaes nicely contrasts Hoover with his predecessor , Calvin Coolidge , as well as Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon .
Hoover signed the Smoot - Hawley Tariff , which destroyed international demand for American products .
He also pushed businesses to prop up wages and prices , which impeded market adjustments to strikingly new economic conditions .
These policies were “ dramatically counterproductive , ” as Shlaes politely puts it .
Unfortunately , nothing much changed under Roosevelt .
Indeed , he succeeded politically even as he failed economically .
Contrary to pop history , there was no quick rebound after his election .
His jaunty optimism could not make up for the mass of contradictory policies , topped by misguided attempts to fix prices and production .
Particularly harmful was Roosevelt ’s sustained attack , through both rhetoric and policy , on business , wealth , profits , utilities , and private property .
On this front Roosevelt started early and steadily expanded operations .
By 1935 , notes Shlaes , “ The skirmishes were over ; the class war was out in the open . ”
While there was corruption and other misbehavior in the 1920s like during every other period in American history , they had little to do with the onset of the Great Depression .
But by demonizing his favorite economic scapegoats , Roosevelt ended up cutting business revenues , diminishing profit prospects , reducing property security , and creating economic uncertainty .
This discouraged corporate managers from expanding old enterprises and business entrepreneurs from establishing new ones .
Thus , the persistence of the Great Depression should come as no surprise .
Roosevelt ’s strategy won votes , at least in the short - term , but impoverished the American people .
In fact , the modest early recovery , notes Shlaes , was cut short by another crash , “ a depression within the Depression .
It was occurring five years after Franklin Roosevelt was first elected , and four and a half years after Roosevelt introduced the New Deal .
It was taking place eight years after President Herbert Hoover first made his own rescue plans following the 1929 stock market crash .
Washington had already made thousands of efforts to help the economy , yet those efforts had not brought prosperity . ”
So bad was the economy that at any other time the incumbent president likely would have been defeated .
Roosevelt was saved by war .
The Republicans made significant congressional and gubernatorial gains in 1938 .
In 1940 Wendell Willkie , a former utility executive , “ polled 22 million votes , more than any Republican in history , even more than Hoover in 1928 , ” notes Shlaes .
But it was not enough .
With war raging in Europe , a conflict to which the U.S. seemed increasingly drawn , voters stuck with the more experienced candidate .
The Forgotten Man is more descriptive than judgmental , a thoughtful history that allows readers to draw their own conclusions about the New Deal .
But free of the starry - eyed admiration of many biographers , Shlaes presents the dark practical undercurrents to the rhetorical flights of fancy that characterized Roosevelt and the New Deal .
As a result , it is difficult to escape the conclusion that while Roosevelt might have restored people ’s optimism , he undermined their productivity .
Indeed , perhaps the most important judgment offered by Shlaes  admittedly not original to her , but zealously avoided by Roosevelt idolaters  is how similar Hoover and Roosevelt were in practice .
She writes :
“ Both preferred to control events and people .
Both underestimated the strength of the American economy .
Both doubted its ability to right itself in a storm .
Roosevelt offered rhetorical optimism , but pessimism underlay his policies .
Though Americans associated Roosevelt with bounty , his insistent emphasis on sharing  rationing , almost  betrayed a conviction that the country had entered a permanent era of scarcity .
Both presidents overestimated the value of government planning .
Hoover , the Quaker , favored the community over the individual .
Roosevelt , the Episcopalian , found laissez - faire economics immoral and disturbingly un-Christian .
“ And both men doctored the economy habitually .
Hoover was a constitutionalist and took pains to intervene within the rules  but his interventions were substantial .
Roosevelt cared little for constitutional niceties and believed they blocked progress .
His remedies were on a greater scale and often inspired by socialist or fascist models abroad . ”
Unfortunately , while both Hoover and Roosevelt erred  proved wrong by the failure of their programs to reinvigorate the American economy  their mistaken visions live on in both the Republican and Democratic parties today .
Both major political parties promote economic intervention on a massive scale .
Both political parties push for ever more expansive federal power .
And both political parties seek to apply those policies to the entire world , using war , if necessary , to advance their attempts at global social engineering .
The American people eventually turned away from the worst excesses of the New Deal .
It is time for the American people to again say no more .
VideoEgg has announced that its ad network for Facebook applications – eggnetwork – has pulled in around $ 1.5 million in ad revenue over the past five months .
[ From How Much Money Are Facebook Apps Making ?
Not Much Apparently ]
This does n’t surprise me at all .
My almost year long affair with Facebook has enlightened me to many realities in this network .
Very few FB apps are what us old timers would refer to as applications , they are more like interactive games and gadgets .
Video , music , and images are well mined out at this point and FB users do n’t have much of an appetite for consuming content within Facebook .
What FB users seem to do a lot of is consume the meta - content that other FB users are creating through their interactions with FB .
For the apps that actually do things , well none of them are all that good when compared to alternatives .
Clearly there is value in having these apps in one place , but eventually the development platform strategy has to go beyond the goal of locking users into the platform .
For all the talk of viral features in FB , the fact remains that the most popular apps are still the early apps that benefited from scarcity and an ability to spam your entire friends list with invites .
Triers vs. users .
The favored past - time for a vast number of FB users is adding apps to their profile pages , not actually using them for anything .
In fact , profile clutter is now so much of a problem that FB released a clean up tool to deal with it .
I am skeptical of the move to enable FB apps outside of FB primarily because FB apps are themselves pretty primitive compared to what is capable in other frameworks .
Now this is not to understate the value of the backend network , but getting back to that issue of these apps not being very good when compared to standalone alternatives , it ’s pretty hard to drive adoption when the apps themselves are unappealing .
Users in general show little appetite for applications that feature advertising , even in Facebook , so while advertisers may salivate at the notion of driving CPM / CPA in Facebook , I think this goal will remain illusory .
As the creative folks get more clever about how to insert brand and ad payloads we will likely see a shift here , and I am also not suggesting that all advertising is bad either .
But in the end if we end up with incremental improvements in clickthroughs and other interactions , when compared to traditional forms of online advertising , well how valuable is the platform then ?
I realize that much of what I have just written flies in the face of accepted wisdom , and RockYou and Slide both just raised big $ $ , as well as Facebook itself , but I would caution anyone that private company valuations have never been a proxy for broader mainstream market success .
I do believe that gold is indeed in them thar hills , but mozying on up with a couple of picks and shovels and dreaming of riches without understanding the intricacies of what it takes to be successful will probably just result in fool ’s gold .
54 Easy Tips For The
Ocarina
And Other Small Musical Instruments
The 54 tips are organized into 3 sections :
A. Ocarina Tips For Everyone
B. Ocarina Tips For Children ( and teaching children )
C. Ocarina Tips For Advanced Players And Musicians
A. Ocarina Tips For Everyone 1 . Crawl first , walk next , then run .
Even though you progress much more quickly on the ocarina than many other instruments ... remember that you must crawl before you can walk , and walk before you can run .
As do other investments , music provides the greatest returns over the long haul ; almost anyone who sticks with it long enough can become an accomplished musician .
One of my favorite ocarina demonstrations on youtube
Since I began playing the ocarina , I have always been able to look back and realize that I was noticeably better than I had been only one year before .
On many occasions I have rejected a song as unappealing only to return to it a year or so later and find that it was a gem .
I simply didnt have the skills to make it sparkle the first time around .
On other songs and techniques that are a little over my head , I just keep chipping away , remembering to run through them now and again when I take short ocarina breaks .
A few months or a year later , the seemingly impossible song has been transformed into a near - virtuoso performance .
2 . Keep a repertoire notebook .
Little by little , build a repertoire notebook .
After buying the books , assemble a notebook with your favorite songs in it .
Having ready access to all your favorites in one book instead of scattered among dozens of others really helps to focus your efforts .
3 . Understand what vibrato is .
Vibrato is that wavering sound that you hear when a singer or instrumentalist holds a long note on a slow song .
Though not hard to learn , vibrato can add a wonderful richness to your tone on certain songs , especially slow ones .
4 . Learn to play vibrato .
5 . How to play diaphragmatic vibrato .
While there are different ways of producing vibrato , the method that I employ is diaphragmatic vibrato .
The diaphragm is a muscle that is used for breathing and that separates the thoracic cavity , where the heart and lungs ( etc. ) are located , from the abdominal cavity , where the stomach and intestines ( etc. ) are located .
When your diaphragm contracts , it flattens downwards , thereby increasing the volume of your chest cavity and causing your lungs to take in air to fill the resulting vacuum .
When your diaphragm relaxes , it moves up , forcing air out of your lungs .
The extent of the variation in pitch in instrumental vibrato is decided by the performer , but does not usually exceed a semitone either way from the note itself ( more ...
While it frequently functions with no conscious input from you ( such as when you sleep ) , here are some steps you can take to gain control over your diaphragm to produce a nice vibrato .
First , place your hand on your stomach and try laughing , " Ha , ha , ha , ha , ha , ha , " in a whisper , i.e. , without using your vocal cords .
Can you feel your stomach pulsing ?
That was your diaphragm propelling air out of your lungs .
Now , play a long G note on your ocarina while expelling air in slow rhythmic pulsations with your diaphragm as you did when laughing .
After practicing this for a time , eventually begin speeding up your vibrato by tightening your stomach muscles slightly .
Dont expect spectacular results the first or second time you try this .
Learning to produce a pleasing , controlled vibrato is not complicated , but it usually requires small amounts of practice over an extended period of time .
6 . Listen to talented musicians .
Ultimately , the music that you carry in your head is what will flow from your instrument .
Besides practicing regularly , one of the best ways to grow as a musician is by listening to talented musicians perform the kind of music that you want to play .
Of course , it takes time , effort , and ( gulp ! ) money to find , acquire , and listen to good music , but it can make an immense difference in your musicianship .
Time and again , I have found new skills showing up in my own playing after listening to skilled musicians do the same ; other times I have n't known how to approach a tune until hearing it artfully performed .
7 . Put recordings of skilled musicians on your IPod .
8 . Use work , exercise , driving time for listening to your musical mentors .
Use work , exercise , or driving time to enjoy listening to music that you can learn from .
Ultimately , the music that you carry in your head is what will flow from your instrument .
An ocarina is a simple wind instrument
... that can even be made out of broccoli 9 . Polish your airway .
A smooth airway is vital to good tone .
Although most ocarinas require almost no special care or upkeep , small bits of junk or lint can sometimes accumulate in the airway over time - especially if your cracker - chewing , juice - swigging munchkin has honked on it a few times .
Therefore , every once in a great while , you might want to polish the airway to keep it in tiptop playing condition .
To do this , fold a piece of white paper several times to the proper width and thickness , and repeatedly slide the paper in and out of the airway .
Be sure not to leave any tiny paper fragments in the airway when you are finished .
10 . Find time to practice .
How can I find the time to practice ?
There is no doubt that I experience periods of real growth as a musician whenever I can sit down for an hour or two on a daily basis and play .
Oh , that I could play that much year round !
Nevertheless , for me and many others , taking my ocarina along through daily life and enjoying frequent two to ten minute ocarina breaks has made it possible to keep up with a musical instrument even amidst the awesome responsibilities of adulthood .
11 . Playing in Tune with Other Instrumentalists .
Whether you are playing an instrument or singing , being in tune with others requires active listening .
Usually other instruments can tune to you , but you can raise or lower the pitch of your ocarina by blowing harder or softer .
With practice , this becomes more and more intuitive .
Or can be made out of ... a carrot
Or can be made out of ... a 12 .
Learning to blow unconsciously .
After playing the instrument for a time , your brain unconsciously determines the correct airspeed for playing controlled high notes , but in the beginning be sure to blow hard enough so that high notes will not squeak .
On rare occasions , beginners can get caught up in a vicious circle .
They play a high note shyly or timidly and , of course , the note squeaks .
Out of shame , they proceed to blow even more timidly with equally disastrous results , thereupon concluding , " High notes are too hard ! "
All they need to do is blow more forcefully .
( On the other hand , if the instrument produces a very high - pitched , irritating blast instead of the desired note , they are blowing too hard .
Remember that blast , though , if you ever need to sound an SOS when lost or stranded in the mountains . )
13 . Dirty airways and high notes .
A reason why beginners sometimes play ragged high notes is that they do n't keep their airway clear by sucking out condensed moisture .
Novices in general and little ones in particular tend to slobber into the airway much more at first than they will after becoming more proficient .
14 . Polish the airway .
Because a clear airway is vital to good tone , kids should rinse their mouth with water if playing the ocarina right after eating .
Although the ocarina requires almost no care and upkeep , small bits of junk or lint can sometimes accumulate in the airway over time .
Therefore , every once in a while , you should polish the airway to keep it in tiptop playing condition .
To do this , fold a piece of white paper several times to the proper width and thickness , and repeatedly slide the paper in and out of the airway .
Be sure not to leave any tiny paper fragments in the airway when you are finished .
If family members are sharing an ocarina ( something that I do n't suggest ) and there is concern about germs , you can put a drop of rubbing alcohol in the airway as you polish it .
Make sure that all the alcohol has evaporated before playing the instrument .
15 . Mentally transpose a song by playing by ear .
Not infrequently , you will find songs that are playable on the ocarina but that are written outside the ocarinas range .
Often you can " mentally " transpose the song by playing it by ear .
Transposition is not difficult to learn .
In many situations , however , playing a song by ear is quicker and less tedious than transposing : if you can hum a song by memory , then you can play it by ear .
16 .
Playing by ear is not as difficult as it may seem .
Contrary to what many people I talk to seem to think ( and to what I thought a few years ago ) , playing by ear is not a mysterious innate ability reserved for a gifted few .
It is a skill that improves dramatically with practice , and the ocarina is an ideal instrument on which to develop it .
Learning music by ear is done by repeatedly listening to other musicians and then attempting to recreate what one hears .
This is how people learn music in any musical tradition in which there is no complete musical notation ( more ...
17 .
Play a song without looking at the sheet music .
As you carry your ocarina along with you , try playing - without looking at a sheet of music - any melody that comes to mind .
18 . Experiment when playing by ear .
Experiment a little to find the best note to start the song .
If you find yourself in an awkward key full of sharps or flats , try starting the song on the note above or the note below .
19 . Play " name that tune . "
Have a friend or family member help you with this .
Ask him or her to say the name of a tune ... and then you would have to play it by ear .
The more you do this kind of thing the more natural it becomes .
In turn , the more you can play by ear , the easier it is to play with other musicians and the more you feel like a real musician .
20 .
Avoid being musically lopsided .
Push yourself to both read music and play by ear .
Most players favor or are stronger at either playing with music or playing by ear .
Both are helpful and useful at different times , for different purposes .
Push yourself to do what you 're less comfortable with .
21 . Play silently .
This technique ( silent fingering ) is performed by putting the ocarina to your mouth and fingering the notes without blowing .
What is great is that you can practice silent fingering on an airplane or practically anywhere without disturbing a soul .
Another helpful idea is to make yourself a simple set of flash cards .
B. Ocarina Tips For Children 22 .
Have realistic expectations of your child when learning the ocarina or other instrument .
A Preliminary Word to Parents :
It is developmentally normal for kids to flit like hummingbirds from interest to interest , hovering briefly to taste of each one before darting off to the next .
Parents must accept that kids will be kids .
Too often have I heard a frustrated parent scold their eager little would - be musician with the words , " I 'm not getting you another musical instrument ; I already bought you a recorder ( guitar , etc. ) , but you didnt stick with it . "
Well , the reality is that most children will stick with music only if the parent does .
When I was a little shaver , I almost never practiced my piano unless Mom or Dad prompted me , i.e. , made me .
Obviously , it wasnt that I had no true interest in music .
My " problem " was that I was still a child .
Like most kids , I just naturally gravitated to activities that were easier , more fun , or more relevant in the very short term .
Consequently , parents , it is your job to provide the structure , discipline , and encouragement that your children need to receive not only the gift of music but also that of perseverance - a quality that will benefit them throughout life .
23 . Be positive .
Instead of pouring water on your childs interest in music , try to fan it into flame .
Certainly we must teach our children the joy of being others - centered , to be considerate of those around them ; I never let kids march around making loud , annoying blasts on the ocarina .
At the same time , I think parents need to go out of their way to celebrate and encourage any little triumph of their fledgling musician .
Occasionally I hear a mom say something such as , " I dont let Johnny practice his ocarina in the house any more ; he was just always playing that thing ! "
Another mother in a similar situation will say , " It has been such a blessing having Billy playing hymns around the house all the time . "
Which child do you think is more likely to continue with music ?
If we hold our applause until we hear our child perform beautifully , we may never get the chance .
Often kids like something initially just because they are good at it .
24 .
Motivating children to learn music .
Another way of motivating children is to require them to earn certain special privileges , activities , or their allowance by successfully completing weekly tasks , which may include practicing the ocarina , doing chores , reading books , exercising , or whatever your family deems important .
Younger children may respond best to more immediate rewards , i.e. , making a snack or computer time or swimming ( usually an activity that you would have done anyway ) contingent upon completing the practice session .
Just placing a star on a chart can be very reinforcing to some children , not to mention some adults .
25 . Learning along with your child .
Do I Need to Learn to Play the Ocarina Along with My Children ?
Well , that depends .
Older children may just need help getting started .
Generally speaking , however , the younger the child , the more involved a parent or teacher needs to be .
In the case of smaller children or those with certain special needs , I highly recommend that at least one parent learn along with the child or children .
Obviously , your own first hand experience with the ocarina will dramatically improve your ability to teach it .
If this sounds overwhelming , consider that the ocarina is much easier to learn than most instruments , and it doesnt take years of practice before you sound good enough to play in public .
I speak from experience when I say that sharing an activity like this is very rewarding to both you and your child .
Just think of the possibilities of using your music to serve others together as your child matures .
26 .
How long should my child practice .
Practice time can vary dramatically depending on several factors such as age , maturity , interest level , and family priorities .
One possible scenario is to teach your child once a week in a longer session and have them practice five to ten minutes ( or whatever you decide ) a day during the rest of the week .
Because you dont have to put the ocarina together beforehand , or wet a reed , or clean up , or take it apart afterwards , a ten - minute practice session can be very productive , although a half - hour might be more appropriate for older children .
It is n't mandatory to practice everyday ; one can progress rapidly by practicing from three to five times a week .
If they are so inclined , encourage your children to carry their ocarina with them in a pocket or sheath and play it whenever they feel the urge .
While most people who play traditional band instruments dont continue as adults , the ocarina is easy to keep playing all throughout life if you carry it with you .
In conclusion , whatever the number of minutes or practice sessions per week , the key to progress is consistency .
27 . Learning to read music .
Do they have to start learning to read music from the beginning ?
Not necessarily .
Though I have had good success teaching children as young as six to read music , there is no set age for starting , and the parent or teacher must decide if a child is ready .
In the case of children whose young age or special needs would make reading music especially difficult , the songs can be learned by singing together .
Be warm , affirming , patient , and have lots of fun singing and clapping , singing slow , singing fast , singing loud , singing soft …
After the child can sing or hum the melody , then you can begin to learn to play it , sometimes just a couple notes at a time and sometimes learning to play only part of a song in one sitting .
( How do you eat an elephant ?
One bite at a time . )
28 .
Helping kids to persevere .
Something useful to a lot of parents in helping their kids persevere is some type of clear , measurable , written plan .
29 .
Play follow the leader .
A great activity for teaching a pre-reader of music is what I call Follow the Leader .
To play Follow the Leader , the parent or teacher plays a note or short series of notes , and then the child must do the same .
At first , use only the notes B , A , and G ( the notes introduced in Unit One of the curriculum ) .
Over time , expand the game to include longer strings of notes , then the whole scale , and finally the entire range of the instrument .
This game is fun , easy , and great for improving a childs hole covering , tonal memory , rhythm , confidence , and ability to play by ear .
It is also a good way to introduce new songs , piece by piece .
30 .
Introducing children to " real " music .
It is good to introduce " real music , " that is , music from sources besides instructional courses , as soon as possible .
Although adults or adolescents may complete an entire curriculum before playing from other sources , younger children benefit greatly from playing lots of simpler songs at each level before moving on to more complex rhythms .
In general , the younger the child , the more time and practice that is required to acquire new skills .
In addition , letting children pick their own songs from outside sources is both fun and motivating .
The Wee Sing series , Christmas carols , and easier hymns or folksongs are all good sources of music .
If they encounter a new note while attempting a song outside the curriculum , help them to use the fingering chart to figure out how to play it .
Dont be afraid to leave a curriculum for a while in order to pursue your childs musical interests .
For example , maybe your kids only want to learn Christmas carols during the holiday season in preparation for playing at a local nursing home .
Enjoy the extended detour and come back to your curriculum when they are ready to move on to the next level .
31 . Quick , fun warm up games .
It is important to continually reinforce and review concepts that the children have learned in earlier lessons .
To do this , I play lots of quick , fun warm up games at the start of a lesson such as the following .
" Draw me a whole note on the B line . "
( Student quickly draws the five lines of the staff and a whole note on the middle line . )
" Good job !
Now , draw me a quarter note .
Wow , you did that fast !
Now , how long does a quarter note last ? "
( If asking questions of a group , be sure to require hand raising - or call on students at random - and wait a bit before taking an answer so that all the students have time to formulate a response .
If you merely call on the first person who puts a hand up , the slower students dont bother to think since they wont be called on anyway .
Try to give everyone an equal opportunity to answer questions . )
While looking at the book together , say , " Point to a quarter note , " or , " Show me a half note on the B line , " or " Point to a repeat sign , " etc .
These can all be fun ways of repeating concepts and of teaching to different learning styles .
32 . Have fun singing or chanting of rhythm patterns together .
Another playful way to teach them to read music is by doing a lot of singing or chanting of the rhythm patterns while keeping the beat through clapping , marching , or pounding on something such as the plastic top of a coffee can or on different percussion instruments .
rhythm , but in modern music a rhythm section generally consists of percussion instruments , bass and possibly chordal instruments ( e.g. , guitar , banjo ) and keyboard instruments , such as piano .
In recent years , music theorists have attempted to explain connections between rhythm , meter , and the broad structure and organization of sound events in music .

Not only boys but especially boys appreciate ACTIVE , movement - filled participation .
In fact , with young chaps , we sometimes do more chanting and singing than ocarina playing .
For instance , I usually have them chant a song with me as a rhythm pattern before they play it on the ocarina .
This is done by chanting a long or short monotone syllable ( bah , bah , bah ) that corresponds to each musical note as we keep the beat by clapping or pounding the table .
Chanting the song in monotone isolates and necessitates the reading of rhythm because students cannot use a familiar melody as a crutch to avoid reading the duration of the notes .
Furthermore , after chanting a song in monotone , students are more able to concentrate on where the notes lie on the staff since they have already grasped the rhythm .
33 . Silently fingering notes on a song before playing it .
Another helpful activity is to have a child silently finger the notes of a song before playing it .
In this activity , they put the ocarina up to their mouth and finger the notes as usual , but without blowing .
This forces the reluctant reader of music to actually read the notes instead of playing strictly by ear .
34 .
Use a trip to the grocery store as an opportunity to reinforce skills .
Musical flashcards can be a fun , quick , and motivating way of isolating and reinforcing skills .
Moms or Dads can ask their child ( ren ) to practice five minutes on the flashcards as they drive to the grocery store together .
In fact , its not a bad idea to leave a set on the dashboard of the car to practice a bit during each car ride .
Our family frequently uses everyday car trips for this type of thing with wonderful results .
35 . What to put on musical flashcards .
What should be on the flashcards ?
Well , whatever area needs reinforcing .
For example , on the front of a card , you could draw a whole note and write the questions 1 ) What is this note called ?
and 2 ) How many beats does it last ?
On the other side of the card you write the answers , i.e. , 1 ) A whole note , and 2 ) 4 beats .
You could copy a rhythm pattern from the book onto a card and write 1 ) Chant the rhythm pattern 4 times through while clapping , 2 ) Play the rhythm pattern 4 times on the ocarina , and 3 ) State the name and duration of each note in the rhythm pattern .
You could draw a staff with a half note on the B line , asking them to silently finger the note on the ocarina and to state how long the note lasts .
If they are able to and you want to take the time to show them how , the kids could periodically make their own flashcards to deal with any hard - to - remember concepts .
36 . Should You Take the Summer Off .
You can if you want , but I wouldnt .
If you do , be prepared to do a whole lot of review when you start up again .
Band teachers know the frustration of kids returning to school who seem to have contracted musical amnesia sometime between June and September .
This is especially true of younger children .
C. Ocarina Tips For Advanced Players 37 .
Learn alternate note fingerings .
After becoming confident with the fingerings on the standard fingerings , be open to alternate fingerings when the need arises .
As with many woodwinds , the chromatic notes on the ocarina can usually be fingered in different ways to suit the demands of a particular passage of music .
If the idea of alternate fingerings sound confusing , dont fret .
Just be aware of the possibilities and come back to it when you feel ready .
38 . Learn the difference between a transposing and non-transposing instrument .
What is the difference between a transposing instrument and a non-transposing instrument ?
C ocarinas and pianos are both considered non-transposing instruments .
In other words , when you read and finger a C note , the instrument plays a C note .
On the other hand , trumpets ( usually Bb instruments ) , saxophones ( usually Bb or Eb instruments ) , Clarinets ( A or Bb instruments ) , French horns , cornets , mellophones , etc. , and G ocarinas are all considered transposing instruments .
A Bb trumpet is called a transposing instrument because when a trumpet player reads and fingers a C note , the trumpet actually sounds a Bb ; likewise , when a G ocarina player reads a C , the ocarina actually sounds a G .
A transposing instrument is a musical instrument whose music is written at a pitch different from concert pitch .
Concert pitch is the pitch as notated for piano ( is a musical instrument whose music is written at a pitch different from concert pitch .

Why music educators teach non-C instruments as C instruments .
There are some excellent reasons why music educators have traditionally taught non-C instruments as if they were C instruments .
Doing so :
+ puts the musical notes in a reader - friendly place on the musical staff
+ allows one to play a whole family of instruments with only one set of fingerings
+ greatly facilitates the learning of other instruments , whatever their particular key .
40 .
How can non-C instruments play together ?
In the case of the ocarina , the comfortable vocal range ( the C range ) is by far the easiest place to find music , for it is the range of hymnbooks and most books of folksongs .
Nevertheless , a complication arises if a guitarist and a G ocarina player ( or a Bb trumpet player , for that matter ) want to play together while reading from the same sheet of music .
If they are to produce music and not noise , they must do one of three things .
1 ) The guitarist can simply pop on a capo to be in the same key as the ocarina player
2 ) One of the two musicians must transpose the music to be in the same key as the other
3 ) One of the two must play by ear ( Actually , playing by ear is transposing , but the person doing it need not understand the theory involved . )
41 .
Why you want to be able to play a non-C ocarina as a non-transposing instrument .
What are the advantages and disadvantages to learning a non-C ocarina as if it were a C instrument ?
While it makes sense to learn to play non-C ocarinas as C instruments first , there are some impressive advantages to also playing the non-C ocarina as a non-transposing instrument , i.e. , when you read and finger a G , the ocarina sounds a G .
One significant advantage is that you can now play your G ocarina off the same sheet of music as other musicians without needing to transpose or play by ear , which is especially helpful when you have n't heard the songs before .
Celtic music is a term utilized by artists , record companies , music stores and music magazines to describe a broad grouping of musical genres that evolved out of the folk musical traditions of the Celtic peoples of Northern Europe .

( more ... 42 . Why playing a G ocarina as a non-transposing instrument is especially useful to Celtic music .
The G ocarina is a very useful for playing Celtic music .
It has a great range for picking up a lot of flute , pennywhistle , dulcimer , fiddle , bagpipe , and vocal music that is written outside the reading range of a C ocarina .
Multi-chambered ocarinas are painfully difficult
to play with any fluidly .
Do n't be fooled by
how easy this virtuoso makes it look .
43 . How to turn 70 songs into 113 .
One book that I enjoy has 70 songs that can be played reading as a C instrument , but you pick up another 43 songs if you know how to read as a G instrument .
In practical terms , you now have 113 instead of 70 songs that you can play just as they appear in the book .
In fact , playing a G ocarina as a G non-transposing instrument is essential if you are interested in playing Celtic dance tunes , i.e. , reels , jigs , etc. , in keys that you would hear at an Irish music session .
( By drawing from different sources , I have found lots of this type of music that is playable on the ocarina . )
Also , finding music for playing a G ocarina in harmony with a C becomes much easier if you know how to play the G as a non-transposing instrument .
44 . How to play your G ocarina as a non-transposing instrument .
How do you learn to read music with the ocarina as a G instrument ?
Before I explain how ... you should know that it probably requires less effort to learn than you think .
I felt somewhat comfortable with it after one night .
When you first started , you learned to play the ocarina with a chromatic reading range of B , C , D , E , F , G , A , B , C , D , E .
Now you will learn the reading range of F# , G , A , B , C , D , E , F# , G , A , B ( a G major scale has an F# in place of an F ) .
Actually , this new range is twofold .
On the one hand , you can start reading on the F# that is three lines below the staff and play up to the middle B , a good range for , say , dulcimer or lower vocal music .
Alternately , you can start an octave higher on the first space from the bottom of the staff and play up to the high B , a range where you pick up a lot of fiddle , flute , pennywhistle , bagpipe , etc. , tunes .
For example , anything that you can play on the highland bagpipes , you can play on the ocarina .
( Below is a diagram that illustrates the two G ranges . )
The first step in learning to play your ocarina as a G instrument is to photocopy the diatonic fingerings on whatever fingering chart came with your ocarina .
You might want to copy the chart larger than its actual size .
Next , starting at the top , white out the letter C and the note C that is one line below the staff .
Then , write a G in place of the letter C and draw a whole note on the second line from the bottom , which is the G line .
Repeat this step with all the other notes of the G ocarina .
I suggest that you start by learning the upper range first until you are comfortable with it .
Then , move on to the lower range , picking up the sharps and flats as the need arises .
Silent fingering is a helpful way to learn new fingerings .
This forces you to concentrate on reading the notes and not just letting your ear guide you .
45 . Learn Celtic Ornamentation .
For those interested in Celtic ornamentation , cuts and rolls are often easier on the ocarina than on the flute , pennywhistle , or bagpipes because ocarinas work on different physical principles than do most wind instruments .
ornaments ( or ornamentation ) are musical flourishes that are not necessary to the overall melodic ( or harmonic ) line , but serve to decorate or " ornament " that line .
Many ornaments are performed as " fast notes " around a central note .
The amount of ornamentation in a piece of music can vary from quite extensive ( In music , are musical flourishes that are not necessary to the overall melodic ( or harmonic ) line , but serve to decorate or " ornament " that line .
Many ornaments are performed as " fast notes " around a central note .
The amount of ornamentation in a piece of music can vary from quite extensive ( more ...
For example , a cut can be made by uncovering any tone hole , including a thumb hole , that is covered when the primary note is sounded .
This means that crans , double rolls , and other grace notes have a wider number of cutting fingers to choose from .
Similarly , a tap ( or strike ) - a tap being defined as the second half of a roll , i.e. , " a roll consists of a cut and a tap " - can usually be performed with more than just the one finger directly below the primary note .
For example , on B , Bb , A , or Ab rolls , you can tap with the right index finger or any other finger on the right hand instead of executing the entire roll with the left hand .
Thus , a B roll may be performed - in addition to cutting with the left index and tapping with the left middle finger - by cutting with the left index finger and tapping with the right index or right middle finger .
By the same token , the high C and D are easily rolled by cutting with the left thumb and striking with right index finger .
With the exception of the low B and C ( which can be nicely cranned ) and the highest note , all notes , including sharps and flats , can be easily rolled .
46 .
Train yourself for blazing tonguing speed .
Double tonguing will allow you to tongue certain rapid combinations of notes much faster than is possible using regular tonguing .
Try double tonguing four quick G notes on your ocarina using the syllables tuh , kuh , tuh , kuh ( or dugga , dugga ) .
Once your tongue gets used to this , your blazing tonguing speed may amaze you .
Tonguing is when a musician playing a wind instrument uses the tongue on the reed or mouthpiece to enunciate different notes .
A silent " tu " ( too ) is made when the tongue strikes the reed or roof of the mouth causing a slight breach in the air flow through the instrument .

47 .
Why you should adapt songs for the range of your ocarina .
There is more beautiful music within the ocarina range than you or I could ever get to in a lifetime .
Nevertheless , there are many songs that are slightly outside your ocarinas range that can be adapted without too much difficulty .
48 .
Play a note either an octave higher or lower .
Often , an entire song is playable as written except for maybe a low A ( two lines below the staff ) at the beginning of a musical phrase .
Try playing the low A an octave higher .
Sometimes the reverse is true in which case you could play an octave higher .
49 .
Use an alternative note from a chord variation .
If a note is out of range in the middle of a song , try replacing it with a note from the same chord or slightly rearranging the passage .
Many times it sounds just fine .
50 .
Drop or raise an entire section a full octave .
Certain songs that I play have entire sections that are too high or too low to play on the ocarina .
I just drop or raise that particular passage an octave with very pleasing results .
51 . Sit out part of a musical piece .
When accompanying other musicians on , say , a reel that covers two octaves , frequently you can play half the song just as written and sit out rest of the piece .
There is no musical law that says that all instruments must play the entire song .
harmony is the use and study of pitch simultaneity , and therefore chords , actual or implied , in music .
The study of harmony may often refer to the study of harmonic progressions , the movement from one pitch simultaneity to another , and the structural principles that govern such progressions .

( more ... 52 . Use harmony to adapt your range .
When your ocarina does n't have the approprate range for a given piece , you can often play some type of accompaniment ( harmony ) instead of the melody .
An understanding of harmony and accompaniment can be very helpful .
In a nutshell , be flexible and willing to experiment
53 .
Wear ear / hearing protectors while practicing .
Hearing protectors ?
This may sound crazy , but I 've read on flute and piccolo sites that it is advisable for musicians to use some sort of hearing protection for longer practice sessions .
All band and orchestral instruments produce a good bit of volume .
Since reading that , I 've begun using hearing protection for long indoor sessions .
54 . Watch TV when practicing .
I read an interview with a world famous violinist , who described how he watched soap operas when he had to practice technical passages for long periods of time .
You could also listen to a book on tape or to the radio while playing .
Using earbuds under hearing protectors can make it easier to hear the TV / radio .
It 's very relaxing ...
Above all ...
Have fun !
Do n't get discouraged .
Human nature is funny .
We may receive 100 positive comments , but even a single negative comment will stick in our minds and undermine our confidence .
Ironically , if we think our playing sounds bad , we then become tense and timid , and our playing suffers even more .
Therefore , in the early stages , it might be best to play privately until you have more confidence and your tone and skills develop , which they will .

In a laboratory in Switzerland , a group of neuroscientists is developing a mammalian brain - in silicon .
The researchers at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne ( EPFL ) , in collaboration with IBM , have just completed the first phase of an ambitious project to reproduce a fully functioning brain on a supercomputer .
By strange coincidence , their lab happens to lie on the same shores of Lake Geneva where Mary Shelley dreamt up her creation , Dr Frankenstein .
In June 2005 , Henry Markram , director of the Blue Brain project , announced his intention to build a human brain using one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world .
" The critics were unbelievable , " recalls Markram .
" Everybody thought we were crazy .
Even the most eminent computational neuroscientists and theoreticians said the project would fail . "
Some of Markram 's peers said there simply was n't enough data available to simulate a human brain .
" There is no neuroscientist on the planet that has the authority to say we do n't understand enough , " says Markram .
" We all know a tiny slice .
Nobody even knows how much we know . "
Markram was not dissuaded by the negative reaction to his announcement .
Two years on , he has already developed a computer simulation of the neocortical column - the basic building block of the neocortex , the higher functioning part of our brains - of a two - week - old rat , and it behaves exactly like its biological counterpart .
It 's something quite beautiful when you watch it pulse on the giant 3D screens the researchers have constructed .
The neocortical column is the most recently evolved part of our brain and is responsible for such things as reasoning and self - awareness .
It was a quantum leap in evolution .
The human brain contains a thousand times more neocortical columns than a rat 's brain , but there is very little difference , biologically speaking , between a rat 's brain and our own .
Build one column , and you can effectively build the entire neocortex - if you have the computational power .
Although a neocortical column is only 2 millimetres long and half a millimetre in diameter , it contains 10,000 neurons and 30 m synapses .
The machine that simulates this column is an IBM Blue Gene / L supercomputer is capable of speeds of 18.7 trillion calculations per second .
It has 8,000 processors and is one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world .
Markram believes that with the state of technology today , it is possible to build an entire rat 's neocortex , which is the next phase of the Blue Brain project , due to begin next year .
From there , it 's cats , then monkeys and finally , a human brain .
Markram is banking on Moore 's law holding steady , as a computer with the power of the human brain , using today 's technology , would take up several football pitches and run up an electricity bill of $ 3bn a year .
But by the time Markram gets around to mimicking a full human brain , computing will have moved on .
Modelling the future
Modelling seems to be the way forward for neuroscience .
Each year , there are about 35,000 neuroscience papers published - and the number of papers being published is increasing at a rate of between 20 % and 30 % a year .
Most neuroscientists only get to read about 100 of these papers a year , if they 're lucky .
Pouring all of this knowledge into Blue Brain seems an obvious way to use and preserve it .
Markram , a 44 - year - old South African , first became interested in recording the electrophysiology of neurons when he was at the Max Planck Institute in Germany .
He was recording two neurons and he saw them communicate .
" I thought , my God , this is incredible , you can actually capture neurons communicating , " he says .
" Then I wanted to find out how they all communicated , so I started to map the whole circuit .
It took 15 years . "
Markram describes the data he has collected over the past decade and a half as " too boring to be published " .
The model is there to unify the data and test that it works .
A neurobiologist who wants to test a certain theory of how a specific brain function , such as memory retention and retrieval , works can use Blue Brain to do so .
The model will be open to the entire world 's research community .
Simulation - based research becomes possible when you have a critical power of computation .
Today , every commercial aircraft that is built started life as a simulation .
Even cameras are simulated before they 're built .
In physics , we do n't let off nuclear weapons any more , we just use simulations .
" We do n't use simulation in life sciences because biology requires the most powerful computers , " says Markram .
" We do experiments on animals , but that is going to change in the near future and this project will drive that change . "
One thing Markram is keen to stress is that this is n't another artificial intelligence ( AI ) system .
" We 're not looking for the brain of a robot , " he says .
" You can get an engineer to do that .
They are much better at it and they can do it really quickly .
But in the end , it [ Blue Brain ] will probably be much better .
If we build it right , it should speak . "
Decoding dysfunction
However , Markram is not holding his breath , waiting for some emergent consciousness to arise from the silicon brain .
What he is after is something more prosaic , but also a lot more useful than a talking machine .
By understanding the function of the brain , we can also begin to understand its dysfunction .
Disorders such as depression , schizophrenia and dementia are the price we pay for having complicated brains .
" We do n't understand what goes wrong inside those circuits , " says Markram .
" We 're still in empirical medicine .
If a drug compound works : good .
If not , we try another one . "
Blue Brain could accelerate experimentation tremendously .
It will be much more efficient than wet - lab experiments and it will reduce animal experimentation .
However , Steven Rose , emeritus professor of biology at the Open University , is sceptical that a biologically accurate model of the entire human brain can be built , given our current state of knowledge and technology .
The integration between the different regions of the brain is just too complex to recreate on a computer simulation .
" I 'm not against people playing with models , " says Rose , " but the idea that you can use it for anything very sophisticated as opposed to looking at real animals with real behaviour at the moment seems to me to be pie in the sky . "
Rose warns against underestimating the difficulties that still remain .
Then , rather grudgingly , he admits that the Blue Brain project is impressive .
" Impressive but modest , " he adds .
Clearly , Markram still has some doubters to win over .

Common Medical Misconceptions
Popular culture is loaded with myths and half - truths .
Most are harmless .
But when doctors start believing medical myths , perhaps it 's time to worry .
In 2007 , a study published in the British Medical Journal looked into several common misconceptions , from the belief that a person should drink eight glasses of water per day to the notion that reading in low light ruins your eyesight .
" We got fired up about this because we knew that physicians accepted these beliefs and were passing this information along to their patients , " said Aaron Carroll , assistant professor of pediatrics at the Indiana University School of Medicine .
" And these beliefs are frequently cited in the popular media . "
Click on for the top 7 most common medical myths — debunked .
Myth : Shaved hair grows back faster , coarser and darker
Fact : A 1928 clinical trial compared hair growth in shaved patches to growth in non-shaved patches .
The hair which replaced the shaved hair was no darker or thicker , and did not grow in faster .
More recent studies have confirmed that one .
Here 's the deal :
When hair first comes in after being shaved , it grows with a blunt edge on top , Carroll and Vreeman explain .
Over time , the blunt edge gets worn so it may seem thicker than it actually is .
Hair that 's just emerging can be darker too , because it has n't been bleached by the sun .
Myth :
You should drink at least eight glasses of water a day
Fact : " There is no medical evidence to suggest that you need that much water , " said Dr. Rachel Vreeman , a pediatrics research fellow at the university and co-author of the journal article .
Vreeman thinks this myth can be traced back to a 1945 recommendation from the Nutrition Council that a person consume the equivalent of eight glasses ( 64 ounces ) of fluid a day .
Over the years , " fluid " turned to water .
But fruits and vegetables , plus coffee and other liquids , count .
Myth : Fingernails and hair grow after death
Fact :
Most physicians queried on this one initially thought it was true .
Upon further reflection , they realized it 's impossible .
Here 's what happens : " As the body ’s skin is drying out , soft tissue , especially skin , is retracting , " Vreeman said .
" The nails appear much more prominent as the skin dries out .
The same is true , but less obvious , with hair .
As the skin is shrinking back , the hair looks more prominent or sticks up a bit . "
Myth :
We use only 10 percent of our brains
Fact : Physicians and comedians alike , including Jerry Seinfeld , love to cite this one .
It 's sometimes erroneously credited to Albert Einstein .
But MRI scans , PET scans and other imaging studies show no dormant areas of the brain , and even viewing individual neurons or cells reveals no inactive areas , the new paper points out .
Metabolic studies of how brain cells process chemicals show no nonfunctioning areas .
The myth probably originated with self - improvement hucksters in the early 1900s who wanted to convince people that they had yet not reached their full potential , Carroll figures .
It also does n't jibe with the fact that our other organs run at full tilt .
Myth : Reading in dim light ruins your eyesight
Fact :
The researchers found no evidence that reading in dim light causes permanent eye damage .
It can cause eye strain and temporarily decreased acuity , which subsides after rest .
Myth : Eating turkey makes you drowsy
( Image credit : Dreamstime )
Fact : Even Carroll and Vreeman believed this one until they researched it .
The thing is , a chemical in turkey called tryptophan is known to cause drowsiness .
But turkey does n't contain any more of it than does chicken or beef .
This myth is fueled by the fact that turkey is often eaten with a colossal holiday meal , often accompanied by alcohol — both things that will make you sleepy .
Myth : Cellphones are dangerous in hospitals
Fact :
There are no known cases of death related to this one .
Cases of less - serious interference with hospital devices seem to be largely anecdotal , the researchers found .
In one real study , cellphones were found to interfere with 4 percent of devices , but only when the phone was within 3 feet of the device .
A more recent study , this year , found no interference in 300 tests in 75 treatment rooms .
To the contrary , when doctors use cellphones , the improved communication means they make fewer mistakes .
" Whenever we talk about this work , doctors at first express disbelief that these things are not true , " said Vreeman said .
" But after we carefully lay out medical evidence , they are very willing to accept that these beliefs are actually false . "

( CNN ) -- Climate change is " severe and so sweeping that only urgent , global action " can head it off , a United Nations scientific panel said in a report on global warming issued Saturday .
Exposed mud banks at a reservoir in Spain , November 2007 .
The report produced by the Nobel prize - winning panel warns of the devastating impact for developing countries and the threat of species extinction posed by the climate crisis .
U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon , presenting the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report in Valencia , Spain , warned that some of the effects of rising levels of greenhouse gases may already be irreversible .
The U.N. head said the situation was already " so severe and so sweeping that only urgent , global action " could head off the crisis .
The report warns that in spite of the protocols adopted by many Western countries after Kyoto , greenhouse gas emissions will continue to rise by between 25 and 90 per cent by 2030 .
The Kyoto treaty was a global effort to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases .
The United States is one of only a few nations not to have signed the protocol , which expires in 2012 .
The report also predicts a rise in global warming of around 0.2 degrees Celsius per decade .
Scientists say up to an 85 percent cut in carbon dioxide emissions is needed to head off potential catastrophic changes that could lead to more floods and famine .
Ban Ki-moon told the panel he was hopeful that the report 's findings could help bring about " a real breakthrough " in climate change negotiations in Bali , Indonesia , next month .
The climate change panel was delivering its fourth and final report on the science of climate change and the impact of human - produced greenhouse gases at a conference in Valencia .
The Bali talks will set the groundwork for the successor to the Kyoto treaty .
They will also guide global climate policy for at least the next decade , and dictate the types of long - term investment decisions made by big industries and utilities .
Written by more than 2,500 top government - appointed scientists , Saturday 's report contains a summary for policymakers attending the Bali talks , outlining the scientific evidence for global warming and ways to deal with it .
However , panel member Achim Steiner , executive director of United Nations environment program , said the report was also meant to serve as a " civilian 's guide " to dealing with climate change .
He said he hoped individuals could use the information contained in the report to take practical steps to curbing gas emissions .
The U.N. panel -- the recent recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize with former U.S. Vice President Al Gore -- was asked if goals of reducing emissions could be achieved without the contribution of China and especially the United States , which was one of only a few countries that did not sign up to the Kyoto treaty .
Ban Ki-moon said he had " high expectations " that both countries would play a " constructive role " at the upcoming talks .
" Both countries I think can and should lead each in its own way , " he said .
The disagreement over how the cuts in carbon dioxide emissions should be managed may well stall the Bali talks .
Some countries are thought to be in favor of mandatory caps on emissions , which could hit the industrial output of major carbon dioxide producers such as the United States .
Mandatory caps are also unlikely to be supported by developing countries , who fear they could be a barrier to growth .
Opponents of the caps -- thought to include the Bush administration -- favor voluntary restrictions and suggest postponing mandatory caps until the richer world is better able to pay for it , and cleaner energy technologies are more developed .
Writing in the International Herald Tribune on Friday , the U.N. head said the world was " on the verge of a catastrophe if we do not act . "
However , he insisted that he remained optimistic that international cooperation could still help reverse the damage caused by unchecked temperature rises .
" The overarching message : We can beat this .
There are real and affordable ways to deal with climate change , " he said in the column .

MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) - Mexican men who display extreme jealousy or avoid sex with their wives could be tried in court and punished under a new law , the special prosecutor for crimes against women told a local newspaper on Friday .
Men who phone their wives every half hour to check up on them , constantly suspect them of infidelity or try to control the way they dress are committing the crime of jealousy , special prosecutor Alicia Elena Perez Duarte told Excelsior newspaper .
Those who stop talking to their wives , avoid sex or try to convince suspicious spouses they are “ crazy ” even if they are caught red - handed having an affair , are guilty of indifference , she said .
Men found guilty of jealousy or indifference could face up to five years in prison , the newspaper said .
Mexico ’s individual states will determine the punishments , it said .
The progressive new law was passed this month to protect women from domestic violence .
In Mexico , about 75 percent of all murdered women are killed by their husbands , Perez Duarte said .
“ If we do not stop this from the beginning , it turns into beatings , and the beatings turn into more beatings and rape , until it gets out of hand , and whoops , she died , ” she told the paper .
Perez Duarte said the law would be a weapon that women could employ to level the playing field with abusive men .
“ Men ought not to feel discriminated against , ” she told Excelsior .
Perez Duarte said indifference , jealousy or lack of love were crimes against women just as much as physical violence .
“ Jealousy produces a particular type of stress in the person that comes up against it , ” she said .
“ It is exactly the same .
They are wounds , psychological scars identical to physical scars . ”
Jan. 29 , 2008  -- Washington lobbyists and members of Congress gathered at a popular Capitol Hill bar and restaurant last night to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for GOP presidential candidate Sen .
John McCain , whose staff refused to disclose exactly how much was raised or by whom .
" Like most campaigns , we do not release numbers of attendees or dollars raised per event , " said McCain spokesperson B.J. Boling .
While McCain did not attend the event , a copy of the invitation obtained by ABCNews.com shows that donors who paid between $ 1,000 and $ 2,300 were invited to rub elbows with some of the 32 members of Congress supporting McCain for a reception at the Charlie Palmer Steakhouse .
Donors who raised at least $ 10,000 were designated co-chairmen for the event and were treated to a " VIP Roundtable " before the main reception .
The invitation lists 24 lobbyists as " co-chairman " for the event .
The lobbyists represent a range of industries , including the finance , telecommunications , technology and healthcare sectors .
McCain has 59 lobbyists raising money for his campaign , more than any of the other presidential candidates , according to the latest finding from government watchdog group Public Citizen .
The group , which advocates for public financing of elections , has identified more than 2,300 well - connected individuals , known as " bundlers , " who have solicited contributions from friends and associates on behalf of a presidential candidate .
McCain is known as a champion of campaign finance reform .
His campaign
Web site touts the senator 's credentials as a reformer , stating that he has fought for " greater transparency regarding the official activities of lobbyists " and the " disclosure of how candidates and campaigns are funded . "
When it comes to disclosing how much lobbyists are raising for his presidential campaign , however , the group found that McCain has fallen short , even by standards set by the Bush / Cheney 2004 campaign which voluntarily disclosed on its
Web site the names of bundlers who raised at least $ 100,000 and $ 200,000 .
" As far as transparency goes , they all have to do better , including McCain , " said Taylor Lincoln , who directs the project for Public Citizen .
Lincoln says that Democratic Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are the only presidential candidates who have disclosed the minimum amount their bundlers are raising .
" Everyone knows that John McCain is someone who has always stood on principle , taking stances against special interests , " responded Boling when ABCNews.com asked whether the campaign would provide more disclosure .
" Individuals who support John McCain do so because they believe he's the right man at the right time to lead as our next president .
Our donations are fully disclosed with the FEC and we have a complete list of our finance committee on our Web site . "

In this week 's BMJ , doctors warn of excess sorbitol intake , a widely used sweetener in " sugar - free " products such as chewing gum and sweets .
Sorbitol has laxative properties and is poorly absorbed by the small intestine .
Their advice follows the cases of two patients with chronic diarrhoea , abdominal pain and severe weight loss .
Although extensive investigations were carried out , final diagnosis was only established after detailed analysis of eating habits .
On questioning , both patients admitted consuming substantial amounts of sugar - free gum and sweets .
The first patient ( a 21 year old woman ) chewed large amounts of sugar - free gum , accounting for a total daily dose of 18 - 20g sorbitol ( one stick of chewing gum contains about 1.25g sorbitol ) .
The second patient ( a 46 year old man ) reported chewing 20 sticks of sugar - free gum and eating up to 200g of sweets each day , which together contained around 30g sorbitol .
After both patients started a sorbitol free diet , diarrhoea subsided , normal bowel movements resumed and weight gain was achieved .
As possible side effects are usually found only within the small print on foods containing sorbitol , consumers may be unaware of its laxative effects and fail to recognise a link with their gastrointestinal problems , write the authors .
In conclusion , they say , our cases demonstrate that sorbitol consumption can cause not only chronic diarrhoea and functional bowel complaints but also considerable unintended weight loss ( about 20 % of usual body weight ) .
Thus , the investigation of unexplained weight loss should include detailed dietary history with regard to foods containing sorbitol .

The English language is under assault by stupid people who use words they do n't understand , and is defended by pompous asses who like to correct those people .
We 're not sure who to side with .
So , here are some words that you 'll see used incorrectly on a daily basis , and a helpful guide as to just how big of a dick you 'd have to be to correct people on it .
We have also included many pictures of these words being read by women with large boobs .

Irregardless
People think it means :
Regardless .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement Actually means :
Not a damned thing .
This is not a word .
Now , we have no problem with making up words ( if a particular scent can only be described as " fartalicious , " we reserve the right to call it so ) .
The problem with this one is " regardless " already means something is n't worth regard ( that 's why the " less " is there ) so adding the " ir " to it means ... it 's worth regarding again ?
Who knows .
Should you care ?
If there 's ever a time to speak up , this is probably it .
Mainly because this is one of those words used almost exclusively by people trying to sound smarter than they are .
Remind them that when using fake words to at least try to use ones that have some kind of meaning , if they want to avoid unnecessary cockulance when speaking .

As in , " How big of a dick are you if you insist people use it the right way ? "
Peruse People think it means :
To skim over or browse something .
Actually means :
Almost the opposite of that .
Peruse means " to read with thoroughness or care . "
If you peruse a book , you leave no page unturned .
This makes sense when you consider the Middle English per use , meaning " to wear out or use up . "
Unfortunately , if you " consider the Middle English " very often when speaking , you 're probably not exactly the life of the party .

Should you care ?
You could make the argument that the way people use it is so far off from the original meaning that it 's worth fighting for , but there is almost no way to do it tactfully : " What are you doing , Chris ? "
" Oh , just perusing the report here before the meeting . "
" Well you better GET OUT THE MICROSCOPE , RETARD ! HA HA HA HA HA !!! "
So , perhaps the best thing is to just lead by example and start using the word correctly yourself .
But , this can create its own problems : " Hey Sharon , What 's Chris doing ? "
" Oh , he said he was perusing that new report . "
" Then why is he hunched over it with his tongue out , re-reading the opening page for the ninth time ? "
" Gosh , I do n't know .
I guess he must be clinically retarded . "

As shown above , the Journal reports that of the many thousands of mutual funds sold to the public , only 31 beat the Standard & Poor ’s 500 index in each of the 8 years from 1999 to 2006 .
A skeptic of the efficient markets hypothesis might think that , subsequently , these funds would offer a better - than - average place to invest .
In 2007 , however , only 14 out of these 31 outperformed the index — about what would be expected from sheer chance .
Exceptional past performance appears to give little reason to expect future success .
Let me venture a guess about how many of the remaining 14 will see their winning streak continue another year : 7 .
ROCKY MOUNT , Va. -
It was so quiet out in the country , the officers did n't want to make a sound .
Lying in the woods , huddled in sleeping bags , they could n't use their cars or even turn on a light .
The moonshiners might see them .
The officers , from the Virginia Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control , had been pursuing a local businessman for years .
At last , a tip had led them to a distillery .
Silently , from across the road , they watched who came and went .
They sneaked in a surveillance camera .
The moonshiners also had surveillance cameras .
The cat - and - mouse game culminated in a raid in which ABC officials , joined by sheriff 's deputies and federal agents with the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , burst into a barn on the rural property and found four large silver - colored pots used to make moonshine - cheap , illegal whiskey .
That led to the largest federal moonshine case in southwestern Virginia in years and a 31 - count indictment filed in November in federal court .
People have always enjoyed their liquor in rural Franklin County , which calls itself the " moonshine capital of the world , " a slogan seen on billboards and T - shirts and even at a moonshine exhibit on the campus of a local Methodist college .
A late - 1990s federal - state crackdown , Operation Lightning Strike , slowed the liquor trade .
Federal officials say it has yet to recover .
But the ABC says moonshining is starting to make a comeback as moonshiners , who have been known to hide their stills behind fake headstones in cemeteries and camouflage them with green paint in the woods , adapt to the scrutiny .
" I could give you a list about as long as your arm of people who I know are in the business full time right now , " said Buddy Driskill , special agent in charge of the state alcohol agency 's Lynchburg office .
Driskill says Washington and Baltimore are prime destinations for the untaxed and unlicensed liquor , named for 18th - century bootleggers who smuggled brandy off the British coast by the moonlight .
These days , people consume moonshine in illicit establishments known as " nip joints . "
" They 're making a whole lot of liquor , " Driskill said .
Jay Calhoun is determined to stop them .
A burly ABC agent who wears a John Deere cap , olive - colored overalls , Calhoun lives among the moonshiners near Rocky Mount , a community of 5,000 in the Blue Ridge Mountains , 25 miles south of Roanoke .
" They know us , and we know them , " said Calhoun , 50 , who heads the ABC 's three - person illegal whiskey unit .
The familiarity is such that a moonshining suspect once offered to give Calhoun a ride to court for the trial .
Another time , Calhoun bumped into a " still hand , " the person who runs the stills .
" I was in this little country store getting a can of sardines or pinto beans or something , and he was buying the same thing , " Calhoun said .
" I knew where he was going , and he knew I was going in to work , too . "
With his partner , Randall Toney , 57 , Calhoun operates out of a tiny , unmarked two - room office with surveillance equipment packed into a corner .
Many nights , the agents drive the rural roads of Franklin County , looking for stills .
Because moonshine is so ingrained in the culture and history of the region , the industry is clannish .
Once a year , they 'll get a call with the location of a still .
At some point that call came in about Jody Alton " Duck " Smith , 60 , a lifelong Franklin County resident and a car dealer with a penchant for community service .
A 1998 raid hinted at a possible other side .
The ABC uncovered and destroyed a large whiskey still on property owned by Smith , agents said .
Surveillance of the still in the current case took months .
Court records show that ABC agents installed a camera across the street from the still .
Smith was seen by agents at the location , the records say .
When ABC and ATF agents raided the still in May 2006 , they found 1,728 one - gallon jugs and 50 pounds of barley , according to the indictment in US District Court in Roanoke .
Smith was charged with operating the distillery .
He pleaded not guilty .
William Lindsey , an attorney for Smith , said his client denies the charges but has n't had much else to say .
" Folks around the alleged illegal liquor business do n't talk much , God bless 'em , " he said .

A new study conducted at a California liberal arts college found that students do n't look first at Wikipedia when given a research assignment .
They do n't even go to Google or Yahoo .
Instead , most students look at their course readings , talk to professors , and use their library 's web site and databases .
Hurrah for US research skills ?
Not exactly .
The study appears in the current issue of First Monday , a peer - reviewed online - only journal dealing with digital culture .
Researchers at St. Mary's , a small liberal arts college in California , took a look at what students did when confronted with a new research assignment from a professor .
The findings are n't especially surprising : the first thing students did was to get confused and procrastinate .
Once they finally settled down to work , though , the surprises began .
Some professors have lamented the fact that too many students dive right into Wikipedia or fire up general search engines when searching for scholarly information .
The St. Mary 's study found , though , that 40 percent of students surveyed first went to their course materials for background information and citations .
Next up was the library web site , where 23 percent of students went first .
Search engines were the first destination for 13 percent of students , and 12 percent went to the professor .
Only 3 percent tried Wikipedia .
Students were also ( thankfully ) aware that blogs were n't scholarly sources , and all of them noted that they would not include blog data in a research paper .
Those findings would be more heartening if they were representative of all college students ; sadly , that 's not the case .
The study included only upper-division students , which excludes half of the US collegiate population .
It took place at a small liberal arts school with an annual tuition of $ 30,000 a year ( not including room and board ) .
And it relied on the survey data of 178 students ( survey data can lend itself to the underreporting of " undesirable " behaviors ) rather than on observation .
As such , we wonder how the data would look were the scope considerably expanded .
Perhaps the survey was n't representative of all students , but it was interesting in that it covered a fairly privileged subset of students — and even these students admitted to being routinely confused about doing research , procrastinating until the last possible moment , and finding the research process " barely a tolerable task . "
The study found that even these upper - level students were " confused by what college - level research entails . "
Concerns about students running to the web to take shortcuts on their research may be overblown , but it is clear that students need better instruction and tools to guide their research .
In light of this , it 's surprising how many students are n't turning to online resources , even if these resources may be flawed .

A new initiative called One Laptop Per Child has the goal of getting a low - cost , entry - level notebook into the hands of children in developing countries .
This notebook is the OLPC - XO which is an extremely basic version of what we might consider a portable computer , but comes in a durable , affordable , and easy - to - use package .
In this review I will cover both the internal hardware aspect of this notebook , along with a comparison of it against more common consumer notebooks .
( view large image )
Specs
Processor : 433MHz AMD Geode
Display : 7.5 " LCD 1200×900 ( black and white ) / 800×600 ( color )
RAM : 256MB DDR333
HD / Storage : 1GB Flash w/ SD Expansion slot
Wireless : 802.11b/g and 802.11s Mesh
Ports : 3 USB , Headphone , Microphone
Battery : 3.1Ah 6.5v
AC Adapter : 12v @ 1.42A , 100-240 v switching
Dimensions : 9.52 x 8.97 x 1.26 "
Weight : 3lbs 2.2oz
Price $ 400 with the " Give One , Get One " program ( $ 200 per laptop )
Build and Design
The OLPC is targeted towards children and built for areas with less than perfect operating conditions .
It is ruggedized and very sturdy even when compared to a high - end business notebook like a ThinkPad .
Almost every inch of this notebook is designed to hold up against being dropped , thrown around , or carried by itself without any case .
The design of the OLPC is very simple , yet incredibly well thought out .
The notebook is shaped like a thin lunchbox , with a carrying handle on top .
All edges are rounded off , and the flat surfaces of the notebook are textured for easy gripping .
Screen latches are nothing like what you would find on a standard notebook , with the WiFi antennas themselves acting as the latch mechanisms .
OLPC engineers even went one step further , making the notebook very easy to repair almost anywhere .
With a single small Phillips screwdriver you can tear the entire thing apart to bare components in probably five minutes .
The first time I cracked my OLPC open I had it apart in about 10 minutes including the time to take pictures for each step of the process .
Another interesting design feature was the inclusion of spare parts .
Housed inside the handle section are a number of spare screws for the entire notebook .
Screen
The screen on the OLPC is unique in that it works in both bright and dark environments .
You can view the screen in black and white in bright sunlight , and then switch back into color by turning the backlight back on .
Another interesting trait of this screen is the resolution changes between modes .
In sunlight mode ( black and white ) it has a resolution of 1200×900 , and in color has 800×600 .
The reason for the change in resolution is rather technical , so if you want to know more about the screen resolution I ’ll direct you to the display section of the OLPC Wiki article .
Compared to even the most basic budget notebook , the OLPC ’s screen really falls short in terms of color , viewing angles , and brightness .
Just moving a hair off of a direct viewing angle , the screen looks black and white .
Colors when in optimal viewing range still do n’t compare to any standard notebook , with a very grainy and washed out feel .
Straight view : color .

Horizontal view : color … but looks black and white .

Performance
In the speed sector the OLPC really falls flat on its face .
Boot time from a fully powered - off state is 1 minute and 35 seconds .
Simple tasks like viewing a basic webpage can also bring the OLPC to its knees .
One example would be loading the NotebookReview.com homepage , and scrolling up and down the page .
The OLPC has pretty bad lag doing that , and will have mini lockups on long distance scrolls .
Following a YouTube link , if you click to play the flash movie the OLPC will become slow and unresponsive , and never actually start to play the video .
Keyboard and Touchpad
The keyboard on the OLPC is not unlike the flexible keyboard we reviewed a while back .
Typing passwords or even a website address can be a pain , and it usually requires a few backspaces to correct errors .
While it is undoubtedly a very durable keyboard for harsh conditions , I would take the keyboard on my Motorola Q over it .
( view large image )
The touchpad has a soft matte texture and is fairly responsive .
You notice some lag when moving the cursor around , but that could be blamed on system performance , not the touchpad .
The touchpad surface is quite large , measuring almost 6 " x 2 " , but only the center section ( ~ 2×2 " ) is useable .
The touchpad buttons are on the small side , providing shallow feedback .
External Connections
Left side : AC Power , one USB , headphone and microphone jacks .

Right side : Two USB ports .

Battery Life
With backlight on and the OLPC sitting idle and WiFi enabled it barely reaches 4 hours of battery life .
Here is a link to a page on the OLPC ’s Wiki with more detailed battery life stats .
Software
Included software is very sparse , but with only 1GB total storage space for operating system and programs , you do n’t have much room to work with .
While it does have some software you do n’t find on standard notebooks ( acoustic tape measure , pippy for editing code ) , the software many people look for is missing or very basic .
The word processor resembles wordpad , the chat software has no support for common protocols ( AIM , MSN , Yahoo ! ) , and the internet browser is very clunky to use .
" Browse " web browser ( view large image )
" Write " word processor ( view large image )
" Accoustic Tape Measure " ( view large image )
" Naim " chat application ( view large image )
Advanced users who have access to the internet can pull in updates and additional software through the console , making the notebook somewhat easy to maintain .
One of the first programs I installed was Naim , which gave me very basic AIM instant messaging capabilities .
While it does n’t look or feel anything like what people are used to , at least it worked .
Comparison To Other Notebooks
The Asus Eee PC is a good comparison for this notebook , as they are both in the same size and price range ( the 2G Surf ) .
While they are designed for different markets , the Eee PC is the only other recent product on the market that could be considered a competitor in most markets .
Asus Eee PC ( left ) , Lenovo T60 ( middle ) and OLPC XO .
( view large image )
Size and weight wise the Eee PC is smaller , and weighs almost 50 % less .
System speed is also almost no comparison , as the Eee PC has twice the speed , and has double the RAM .
Just turning the systems on you notice the huge different between each notebook , with the OLPC starting up in 1 m 35s , and the Eee PC starting in 12 -20s .
System storage space is also double on the Eee PC 2G Surf , with 2GB of space compared to the OLPC ’s 1GB .
For average use , the Eee PC is also much easier on the eyes and hands .
The screen is much brighter , has vivid color , and the viewing angles are incredible in comparison to the narrow window on the OLPC .
The OLPC keyboard is also a pain to use , as the OLPC uses a flexible membrane style keyboard , and the Eee PC uses a compact " standard " keyboard .
With the OLPC you need to aim perfectly for keys , and give a solid press for proper recognition .
The Eee PC has better tolerance , and as long as you have adjusted to the smaller layout it is much easier and faster to type on .
Even the touchpads vary greatly between both machines , with the OLPC having a great deal of lag , and the Eee PC being snappy .
For your average consumer , the OLPC is not really the best notebook to consider for purchase .
You can get much better performance and capability from the Asus Eee PC in almost every situation .
The key difference though is the Eee PC is not anywhere near as durable , and probably would n’t survive in the harsh conditions found in a developing nation .
Conclusion
As a cheap notebook for children to use who have no other prior computer experience this notebook is designed and built very well .
It is extremely rugged , offers a simple repair solution , and has incredibly simple to use software .
For power users this notebook should not be considered .
It runs about as fast as a 4 - 5 year old notebook , ca n’t properly render most webpages , and lacks software that many advanced users would need .
Do n’t get me wrong , it is fine for a child , but do n’t expect to take this notebook as a replacement for your work machine on vacation anytime soon .
Pros
Very durable
Sunlight readable display
Has spare parts inside !
Cons
Very slow
Heavy in comparison to other similar sized notebooks

Long Bet Winner : Weblogs vs. The New York Times
In 2002 , blogging evangelist Dave Winer made a long bet with New York Times executive Martin Nisenholtz : " In a Google search of five keywords or phrases representing the top five news stories of 2007 , weblogs will rank higher than the New York Times ' Web site . "
Today , Associated Press editors and news directors chose the top 10 news stories of the year , which makes it possible to determine who won the bet .
AP's No. 5 : Chinese exports
The Times ranks 20th for the Nov. 30 article China Agrees to Remove Certain Export Subsidies .
The weblog BloggingStocks ranks 19th for the Dec. 5 entry Chinese exports take off .
Winner : Blogs .
AP's No. 4 : oil prices
The Times ranks 15th for the Oct. 17 story Record Price of Oil Raises New Fears .
The weblog BloggingStocks ranks 42nd for the Dec. 11 entry Is the Price of Oil ' Artificially ' High ?
Winner : Times .
AP's No. 3 : Iraq War
The Times ranks 20th for its special section on the war .
The weblog Iraq War Today ranks 17th .
Winner : Blogs .
AP's No. 2 : mortgage crisis
The Times ranks first for the Sept. 2 story Can the Mortgage Crisis Swallow a Town ?
The user - generated weblog Digg ranks 19th for Monday 's entry Top 5 Reasons Why the Mortgage Crisis = Global Warming , which links to a Dec. 17 blog entry on Solve Climate .
Winner : Times .
AP's No. 1 : Virginia
Tech killings
The Times ranks 30th for an April 18 weblog entry , Updates on Virginia Tech , from The Lede : Notes on the News .
The user - generated weblog Newsvine ranks ninth for today 's weblog entry , Top News Story : Virginia Tech Killings , which is about AP 's top 10 stories of 2007 .
Winner : Blogs .
So Winer wins the bet 3 - 2 , but his premise of blog triumphalism is challenged by the fact that on all five stories , a major U.S. media outlet ranks above the leading weblog in Google search .
Also , the results for the top story of the year reflect poorly on both sides .
In the five years since the bet was made , a clear winner did emerge , but it was neither blogs nor the Times .
Wikipedia , which was only one year old in 2002 , ranks higher today on four of the five news stories : 12th for Chinese exports , fifth for oil prices , first for the Iraq war , fourth for the mortgage crisis and first for the Virginia Tech killings .
Winer predicted a news environment " changed so thoroughly that informed people will look to amateurs they trust for the information they want . "
Nisenholtz expected the professional media to remain the authoritative source for " unbiased , accurate , and coherent " information .
Instead , our most trusted source on the biggest news stories of 2007 is a horde of nameless , faceless amateurs who are not required to prove expertise in the subjects they cover .
Comments
Rogers ,
Here 's what I get from the conclusion of your post :
A Wiki trumps both blogs and media outlets
Wiki's are closer to on - line libraries while blogs and media portals are like Daily newspapers ... the news rolls off the front page and into oblivion .
So , unless there 's been an amzingly popluar news event with a limit number of sources then the wiki will quickly rise to the top of a search since the Wiki has more permanence and is discovered and referenced more often than a blog or new portal .
Your comment on the authority of the writers for wikipedia is a cheap shot in my opinion .
I think a Wiki can be polished and perfected by use and discussion .
IMHO the content is useful and I go back often .
Dave Winer was predicting that individuals would out perform professional journalists for audience but what seems to have happened is that a lot of blogs started to look and act like columnists from the dailies .
And some blogs began to look like news syndicates .
What develops readership / audience is still the quality and utility of the information .
People seek the news that gives them the best value for the effort of finding it .
Truthiness
Rafe Colburn : Perhaps the requirement to cite sources trumps the requirement to provide credentials .
Would people with credentials spend hours documenting their knowledge for public benefit ?
Some do but many think there knowledge needs to be compensated for the sharing .
Being a knowledge worker teaches most of us to use our knowledge judiciously for personal benefit : quid pro quo .
Just trying to get something beyond the usual Wikipedia bashing started here .
So it 's Wiki 1 , Blogs 2 , NYT 3 ?
Sounds about right , though NYT ought to be more like 117th .
There 's a big difference between SEO value & quality of content & reporting , no offense .
I also think that it is somewhat short - sighted to not think that " old media " wo n't embrace the technologies of " new media " .
oh , bollocks .
Dave Winer is a self - aggrandizing , mediocre techie in love with the sound of his own voice .
The NYT is created by professionals .
Only the heads - up - arses blogosphere would think there 's any comparision .
" Only the heads - up - arses blogosphere would think there 's any comparision . "
Of course , that was n't the comparison being made , but who 's counting .
This is quite remarkable when you think about it , because a single blog is like a columnist for the NY Times .
So the NY Times , with a large number of writers , articles , and columns , ranks below the best single authors on selected topics .
My interpretation is that because of the large number of blog authors , some one will likely have a better story than the best story in the NY Times .
Wikipedia , with its multiple - author , vetted - checked - revised model , is better than either in terms of authority , and tends to get a lot of incoming links from people who cite it for background or reference .
Typically , some number of individual writers will be much better than a wikipedia article , but the wikipedia article will get more links in total , so gets a higher ranking in google .
Rogers ,
You 're post is the second link on TechMeme .
Gawker has used you as a primary source for a post one this thread .
You 're beginning to smell like a real A - List source .
Try not to get addicted to the " flow " that will result .
It changes a person .
I wonder wether the above is a story about Google 's algorithm .
Quick !
Post something about Twitter !
" ... our most trusted source on the biggest news stories of 2007 is a horde of nameless , faceless amateurs who are not required to prove expertise in the subjects they cover . "
That 's pretty much the definition of " journalist . "
( Incidently , I speak from a position of authority , having hired many a nameless , faceless amateur who was not required to prove their expertise in the subjects they covered for many many years as a newspaper publisher . )

" .... Two years ago , the advertising giant 's search engine was fighting a losing battle against spam .
A perfect storm of ruthlessly effective SEO and wittering blogtards meant that Google 's search engine was being swamped by noise - or " Goobage " , as some call it ....
... Then Google had a brainwave .
Realizing that few searchers explore beyond the top three results , it decided to give a powerful boost to Wikipedia .
Nevermind the 6 billion junk pages - Google need only ensure users clicked on the two million Wikipedia entries .
As a consequence , Wikipedia entries rose to the top of the rankings .
During 2006 , Wikipedia entries eclipsed all others , and typically feature in the top three SERPs , or the top search result ... "

Long Bet Winner : Weblogs vs. The New York Times | Workbench
In 2002 , blogging evangelist Dave Winer made a long bet with New York Times executive Martin Nisenholtz : " In a Google search of five keywords or phrases representing the top ...
# 1 Wikis
# 2 Blogs
# 3 Newspapers
That sounds about right for SEO and net natives but I think most people still look at newspapers for authority .
And you can't deny they have the budget to research and break stories .
Unless you are VCed blog ( which in my mind takes you out of the " blog " category ) , breaking stories is almost impossible .
It 's still too costly .
BTW : There 's an interesting thread over at MeFi about the faceless cabal that runs Wikipedia .
Title should be " Wikipedia more effectively SEO'd for Google Algorithm than NYTimes.com or popular Blog platforms . "

" Your comment on the authority of the writers for wikipedia is a cheap shot in my opinion .
I think a Wiki can be polished and perfected by use and discussion . "
... and then , the content can be smudged and marred beyong recognition .
Nothing is static on Wikipedia ; not the rules , not the content , and certainly not the quality .
Here , I 'll even " cite " Wikipedia for you :
en.wikipedia.org
There 's articles that have " lost " featured article status , because of endless continuing tinkering and poking by people gaining mana and levelling up on Wikipedia .
" Usual Wikipedia Bashing " , as far as I 'm concerned , classifies the same as " Usual discussion of Wikipedia in any depth . "
The problem with your last sentence ( and part of the reason for the decline in MSM ) : " Instead , our most trusted source on the biggest news stories of 2007 is a horde of nameless , faceless amateurs who are not required to prove expertise in the subjects they cover . "
Since when have journalists proven their expertise in the subjects they cover ?
I know that my dissatisfaction with journalism in my chosen profession is derives from their inability to report on the topics with any kind of competence .
Usually their " journalism " is just a story hand fed to them by a PR agency .
At least the nameless and the faceless may have real experience in the topic at hand and / or less of an agenda to promote ...
Is n't a significant amount of blogging driven though by stories published by the Times ?
Regardless of who is winning the battle for SEO and the most hits , the Times still is clearly more influential .
I wonder where YouTube.com would rank .
Winer predicted a news environment " changed so thoroughly that informed
> people will look to amateurs they trust for the information they want . "
> Nisenholtz expected the professional media to remain the authoritative
> source for " unbiased , accurate , and coherent " information .
Interesting proposition , but doing a web search proves neither of those does it ?
It just shows the things that the search alogorithm decide are important , not what " informed people ... look to ... " or whether the result is " unbiased , accurate , and coherent " .
I would say blogs won out over the NYT .
If the bet was that ' joe public ' or the general internet user would win out on the top 5 stories then he would definitely be correct .
In my mind ( & forgive me if I am wrong ) , is n't Wikipedia in effect just like a blog but one that has been contributed to by more people as opposed to one blogger ?
With blogs & wikis , users can contribute to the article by way of actual content or with comments .
A wiki is software that allows users to create , edit , and link web pages easily .
Wikis are often used to create collaborative websites and to power community websites .
A blog ( web log ) " Blog " can also be used as a verb , meaning to maintain or add content to a blog .
Many blogs provide commentary or news on a particular subject ; others function as more personal online diaries .
A typical blog combines text , images , and links to other blogs , web pages , and other media related to its topic .
The ability for readers to leave comments in an interactive format is an important part of many blogs

By taking a cheap shot at Boeing , Dan Rather may be headed for a comeback less graceful than Britney Spears ' performance at the MTV Music Awards .
On the most recent edition of his new show , he reported on Tuesday that the new 787 Dreamliner aircraft may be unsafe .
Since then , dozens of news agencies have jumped on the bandwagon .
Most of them are reporting that the carbon fiber frame may not be as safe as aluminum .
Few have bothered to question Rather 's claims that the composite materials are brittle , more likely to shatter on impact , and prone to emit poisonous chemicals when ignited .
I have n't yet watched the segment , but I have read the full transcript [ doc ] .
As a researcher trained materials engineering , I consider the written summaries that appeared in the news today to be very misleading .
While there is a lot of weight behind the argument that composite materials are not as well - studied as aircraft aluminum , the reasoning behind the flurry of recent articles may be faulty .
First off , if a plane crashes , the composite frame will definitely not be the only source of toxic fumes .
Second , high performance composites have been used in fighter aircraft and for years .
Sports cars , race cars , and train cars made from composite materials have endured fantastic crashes .
Claims that the impact toughness of carbon fiber is inadequate may be premature .
The title of Rather 's story , Plastic Planes , indicates a lack of grounding in science .
High - performance carbon composites are far stronger than plastics .
My main concern is how well they will hold up to water – a point that is only briefly touched on during the show .
Because they are vulnerable to slow and steady degradation by moisture , the new materials may not last as long as aluminum .
The report by Rather was correct to explain that testing them for wear and tear will be more difficult .
That was , perhaps , his most valid point .
To get a second opinion , I contacted Cirrus Design , a company that has been making small aircraft from composite materials for years .
Here is what they had to say :
Though Cirrus ' are made with different composite materials than the
Dreamliner , there is no reason to believe that composites cannot be made every bit as strong as aluminum .
Some would argue there is more energy absorption in composites than in aluminum structures .
Also , this Dreamliner must go through FAA Certification before it is allowed on the market , like general aviation aircraft .
There is no way the FAA
would allow Boeing , nor would Boeing put an unsafe , loaded with people aircraft in the sky .
Safety is paramount in decision making with all aircraft manufacturers .
Perhaps this is part of an attempt by Rather to make a comeback after the debacle that resulted in his departure from CBS News .
The reporter also recently filed a lawsuit against his former employer for $ 70 million dollars .
Updates : Yesterday , I contacted Tom Hahn , a Professor of Mechanical , Materials , and Aerospace Engineering at UCLA and editor - in - chief of the Journal of Composite Materials .
He did not get back to me until late last night .
Here is what he had to say :
I have full trust in Boeing 's decision to use composites in 787 .
It is a timely decision based on our understanding of composites stemming from many years of analytical and experimental research .
Aero - News network is reporting that a representative of Airbus , the bitter rival of Boeing , has defended the composite design , calling it as safe as aluminum .
Clay McConnell , VP for corporate communications at Airbus North America , said the same thing as the engineers at Cirrus Design : if the plane is not safe , the FAA will not certify it .
I just received two emails from a man that claims to be Wayne Nelson , the executive producer of Dan Rather Reports .
He followed up with an apology this evening .
Our exchange was as follows :
Mr. Rowe–As Executive Producer of Dan Rather Reports i must take
issue with the unbelievably shallow piece you wrote on the program .
Yes , perhaps you should watch it before making so many inane
comments .
And when you watch it , perhaps you will notice that it is
not Mr. Rather making the charges but an engineer with more than 40
years at Boeing , as well as several of his colleagues .
Vince Weldon
has serious concerns with the " crashworthiness " of the 787 .
As
someone who worked closely on the design of the plane we believe he
has the right to air his concerns before thousands of passengers
begin flying the plane .
Wayne Nelson
Dan Rather Reports
New York , NY *** Wayne , Perhaps you should have provided some balance to your story by
contacting some third party experts .
Aaron Rowe ***
You would n't know balance if it bit you in the ass .
Why do n't you stick to engineering .
Hopefully you 're better at that .

Also , I would like to draw some attention to this comment from John in the long thread below :
DAN RATHER IS CAUGHT LYING RED -HANDED IN THIS SEGMENT .
I can't believe no one else saw this !
When the guy has a square piece of laminent in his hand and is flipping it around , he tells Dan that it has impact damage .
Dan says " It does ? ! " with an overly surprised expression on his face .
Like he never saw this piece of material before the tape was rolling .
He then says that he can't see any kind of damage on the sample .
I did , and I grabbed my TIVO remote , but waited to see what they were going to do before re-winding .
This guy then places it into an expensive machine , which I 'm sure he is trying to sell , and it shows where the impact damage is on a video screen .
A dark round punch in the middle of the square surrounded by lighter ones .
Now I re-wind the video to see that I can CLEARLY see a round impression on the square as the guy is flipping around .
The light catches it perfectly .
How come
Dan can't see it from across the table , but I can see from across my living room ?
Dan , it 's HDTV for God 's sake !
Your Hocus - Pocus Bullshit is n't going to work anymore !
I really do n't care if the planes are safe or not .
Odds are someone else will find out before me .
But , my bet is that they are .
Because if one has to lie to prove a point , then there is no point to be made .
If anyone would care show me a screen shot of that , I would love to see it !

U.S. consumers will pay record prices for gasoline this spring , with national monthly pump costs peaking near $ 3.50 per gallon when the busy driving season begins , the government 's top energy forecasting agency said Tuesday .
REUTERS / Shannon Stapleton
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. consumers will pay record prices for gasoline this spring , with national monthly pump costs peaking near $ 3.50 per gallon when the busy driving season begins , the government ’s top energy forecasting agency said Tuesday .
Higher crude oil prices , which last week topped a record $ 100 a barrel , are pushing up motor fuel costs , the Energy Information Administration said in its new monthly forecast .
The price of crude oil now accounts for about two - thirds of the cost of making gasoline , according to the Energy Department ’s analytical arm .
Tight supplies caused by global oil demand growing faster than new oil production is behind higher petroleum costs .
And consumers should not expect a break any time soon .
“ Global oil markets will likely remain tight through 2008 , then ease moderately in 2009 , ” the EIA said .
“ Both motor gasoline and diesel prices are projected to average over $ 3 per gallon in 2008 and 2009 , with monthly average gasoline prices peaking near $ 3.50 per gallon this spring . ”
The national price for gasoline jumped 5.6 cents over the last week alone and now stands at $ 3.11 a gallon , up 80 cents from a year ago .
High gasoline prices are cutting into consumer spending and raising business expenses , hurting a U.S. economy that is already suffering a slowdown .
The pain at the pump has also become an issue in this year ’s U.S. presidential election , with both Democratic and Republican candidates telling voters they know family budgets are being pinched and laying out their energy policies to tackle the problem .
U.S. gasoline use during the first half of this year will be higher than a year ago , but rising pump prices will reduce motor fuel demand growth by 20,000 barrels a day in the current quarter and by 10,000 barrels a day in the second quarter , the EIA said .
Malware 's new infection route : photo frames
In 2007 , Sam ?s Club also sold infected frames over the holidays , according to customers who bought them , as did Best Buy , Target and Costco .
Sold at Sam's Club , the ADS Digital Photo Frame - 8 " has reportedly been the vector for cases of malware after a Bethesda research institute specializing in information security reported cases of computers being infected by digital photo frames .

It was n't a pretty picture when Rick Sandy plugged in the digital photo frame his wife had given him for Christmas .
When he started downloading pictures to the device , his computer froze .
He restarted it , and his Norton anti-virus software went blank .
Then , the files that controlled his computer disappeared .
And Sandy - an information technology expert himself - was shut out of his own machine .
" It was the nastiest virus I 've ever encountered , " said Sandy , who spent 12 hours rebuilding his computer .
Sandy 's experience was an example of how the continually adapting world of cyberhackers is spreading its tentacles from computers to the electronic devices that plug into them .
Malicious software code has turned up on a wide range of popular electronics , from digital photo frames to compact flash cards to MP3 players - even MP3 - playing sunglasses - and retailers are scrambling to respond .
Nobody knows how widespread the infections are .
Best Buy said it received about two dozen complaints this week after it posted notices on the Web that it sold some infected photo frames over the holidays under its Insignia brand .
The frames were infected during manufacturing .
One line , the 10.4 - inch frame , has been discontinued .
Sam's Club , where Sandy said his wife bought his frame , is investigating the incident , a spokeswoman said , but has found no other infected frames .
Security researchers at SANS , a computer security research and education organization in Bethesda , Md. , say the infections are part of a dangerous trend .
They started asking people to report them on Christmas Day , after a different consumer told the SANS Internet Storm Center that he'd received an infected photo frame as a Christmas gift .
So far , the researchers have collected five reports of infected photo frames bought at Sam's Club and half a dozen reports of other infected devices , said Marcus Sachs of SANS , all of which plug into Windows PCs through a USB port .
Security experts say buyers should be aware that digital devices have more computing power than they once had and can run automatically when plugged into a PC .
To be sure , digital photo frames are computers unto themselves .
The high end models have wireless access - allowing people to ship photos around a home network - and a gigabyte of memory , an amount unheard of in portable devices just two or three years ago .
Although infected devices have turned up before - Apple in 2006 , for example , shipped video iPods that were infected with a Windows virus during manufacturing - the malware is getting nastier .
Whatever infected Sandy 's computer was smart enough to prevent him from downloading any anti-virus programs after his Norton software failed .
Using another computer to run a Google search on the name of the infection he found led him to three Chinese - language Web sites .
Best Buy did n't provide the name of the malware that infected its frames , but said the bad code was detected and contained by up - to - date anti-virus software .
Sam's Club 's supplier , Advanced Design Systems in Tuscaloosa , Ala. , has found no infected frames at Sam's Club or its manufacturer in China , said Vice President Tommy Randolph .
However , ADS is still investigating and has checked hundreds of frames out of the hundreds of thousands sold .
" It makes you aware that whatever you do in prevention , you have to double it , " he said .
ADS does not supply Best Buy with frames , nor does it share manufacturers .
SANS also received a report of an infected Seagate hard drive - a shrink - wrapped 250 GB Maxtor External One Touch Backup - purchased at a RadioShack and then returned .
Both RadioShack and Seagate said they were unaware of the problem .
Seagate did discover some contaminated hard drives in September - a different model - when test machines in one of its manufacturing plants in China were infected with malware that collected passwords for online games and shipped them to a server .
Since then , however , Seagate has tightened processes in all its manufacturing plants and has restricted access to the test machines , which are not connected to the Internet , said BenHur Castro , a senior director of product line management .
He has no new reports of infected drives .
A RadioShack spokesman said " products get returned all the time for various reasons , " and RadioShack does n't engage the manufacturer unless there is a " pattern of problems " with a unit .
One difficulty in tracking down these infections is that people do n't always report them , said Roel Schouwenberg , a senior researcher at Kaspersky Lab , an anti-virus vendor headquartered in Moscow .
Schouwenberg discovered Seagate 's infected hard drives last year , as well as infected MP3 players made by Victory Nederland in Holland , after customers reported their problems to Kaspersky .
When people do report infections , he said , they tend to call their anti-virus vendors .
" For these affected companies , " he said , " it 's something totally new to have shipped out infected devices . "
Robert Edward Auctions , an auction house specializing in baseball memorabilia , recently came upon a document which is not only illuminating , but may represent the most amusing chunk of writing to be officially issued by Major League baseball in existence .
Today the league is having some serious public relations problems wrestling with the use of performance enhancing drugs , in the 1890 ’s , when the document in question was issued , they were having serious public relations problems of another kind .
Specifically they were wrestling with the constant stream of terrifically filthy language which evidently issued from their players ’ mouths , in every possible direction - at umpires , opposing players , fans , women , kids , nuns , diapered toddlers …
What makes this particular document so fantastic is that in issuing these “ Special Instructions To Players , ” warning against foul language on the field , Major League baseball decided to reprint some of the offensive language verbatim .
Hilarious .
See below and read for yourself .
Ha .
God I love that .
It should n’t come as any kind of surprise though , considering in the 1890 ’s baseball players were n’t yet the over - groomed , under - motivated , millionaires we ’re stuck watching today .
Back then , if these guys had n’t been playing ball they ’d probably be exactly what they sounded like , longshoremen , or coal miners , or infantry grunts , or vice presidents .
A grateful hat tip to seldivider for bringing this to my attention , and giving me an excuse to coin the hyphenated term “ shit - pickling . ”
SAN DIEGO – A novel medical technique that smuggles an electrical charge into the brain through the vagus nerve is proving at least as effective as medication in controlling severe depression , psychiatrists say .
In vagus nerve stimulation , or VNS , a two - inch diameter , .25 inch thick disk is surgically tucked under the skin near the left collarbone , then wired upward to the vagus nerve in the neck .
The battery - operated disk delivers intermittent , rhythmic pulses to the nerve – whose name means " wandering " in Latin – that reaches a half dozen areas of the brain critical to treating depression , according to Dr. Darin Dougherty of Massachusetts General Hospital .
" Instead of prescribing milligrams I 'm prescribing milliamps , " Dougherty says .
The implanted disc is programmed and reprogrammed with a wand held over the skin .
Data on each patient about the intensity and frequency of the pulse and device settings is stored in individual memory cards slotted into in a handheld computer linked to the wand .
VNS has been used for 10 years to treat epilepsy , where it can cut the number of seizures for some patients by about 40 percent .
Doctors began to suspect it held potential for treating severe depression when patients clung to the device , even when it was n't helping their epilepsy .
" We asked ( epilepsy ) patients who were n't being helped if we could remove the device and by and large , the patients said , ' No , no , do n't take this away , ' " says Dr. Mitchel Kling of the National Institutes for Health .
" In some cases where there was n't good seizure control , patients ' mood problems stabilized . "
The technique won FDA approval as a depression treatment in July 2005 .
Since then , about 3,000 depression patients have been wired , according to Cyberonics , the Houston - based manufacturer of the device .
Doctors gathered at the American Psychiatric Association conference here say they 've seen measurable results .
In an October 2005 study , about a third of the severely depressed patients responded well , and almost half went into remission .
Ninety - one percent maintained their recovery nine months later , and some patients who did n't report immediate benefits showed improvement and even remission later on .
Researchers know the treatment stimulates norepinephrine and serotonin centers , now treated with pharma at a tepid success rate , and increases blood flow and neuron activity .
But they candidly say they do n't fully understand why VNS works .
Once healed from surgery , patients report their voices get gravelly during the pulse cycle , usually five of every 30 seconds .
If that becomes a problem – during public speaking , for example – the device is designed with an off - switch :
The patient can suspend the unit by placing a magnet over it , Dougherty says .
Batteries last eight to 12 years , Dougherty says , and drawbacks include a requirement that the patient avoid physical therapy ultrasounds that can heat up the wiring and damage the nerve – though diagnostic ultrasound works fine – and problems getting a full body MRI .
The implant neatly sidesteps one of the biggest problem of treating depression : the documented tendency for patients to abandon treatment over side effects or because they feel better .
I cannot avoid the subject any longer .
Almost every day I receive a clutch of emails about it , asking the same question .
A frightening new report has just pushed it up the political agenda : for the first time the World Food Programme is struggling to find the supplies it needs for emergency famine relief .
So why , like most environmentalists , wo n't I mention the p-word ?
According to its most vociferous proponents ( Paul and Anne Ehrlich ) , population is " our number one environmental problem " .
But most greens will not discuss it .
Is this sensitivity or is it cowardice ?
Perhaps a bit of both .
Population growth has always been politically charged , and always the fault of someone else .
Seldom has the complaint been heard that " people like us are breeding too fast " .
For the prosperous clergyman Thomas Malthus , writing in 1798 , the problem arose from the fecklessness of the labouring classes .
Through the 19th and early 20th centuries , eugenicists warned that white people would be outbred .
In rich nations in the 1970s the issue was over - emphasised , as it is the one environmental problem for which poor nations are largely to blame .
But the question still needs to be answered .
Is population really our number one environmental problem ?
The Optimum Population Trust ( OPT ) cites some shocking figures , produced by the UN .
They show that if the global population keeps growing at its current rate , it will reach 134 trillion by 2300 .
But this is plainly absurd : no one expects it to happen .
In 2005 , the UN estimated that the world 's population will more or less stabilise in 2200 at 10 billion .
But a paper published in Nature last week suggests that there is an 88 % chance that global population growth will end during this century .
In other words , if we accept the UN 's projection , the global population will grow by roughly 50 % and then stop .
This means it will become 50 % harder to stop runaway climate change , 50 % harder to feed the world , 50 % harder to prevent the overuse of resources .
But compare this rate of increase with the rate of economic growth .
Many economists predict that , occasional recessions notwithstanding , the global economy will grow by about 3 % a year this century .
Governments will do all they can to prove them right .
A steady growth rate of 3 % means a doubling of economic activity every 23 years .
By 2100 , in other words , global consumption will increase by about 1,600 % .
As the equations produced by Professor Roderick Smith of Imperial College have shown , this means that in the 21st century we will have used 16 times as many economic resources as human beings have consumed since we came down from the trees .
So economic growth this century could be 32 times as big an environmental issue as population growth .
And if governments , banks and businesses have their way , it never stops .
By 2115 , the cumulative total rises to 3,200 % , by 2138 to 6,400 % .
As resources are finite , this is of course impossible , but it is not hard to see that rising economic activity - not human numbers - is the immediate and overwhelming threat .
Those who emphasise the dangers of population growth maintain that times have changed : they are not concerned only with population growth in the poor world , but primarily with growth in the rich world , where people consume much more .
The OPT maintains that the " global environmental impact of an inhabitant of Bangladesh ... will increase by a factor of 16 if he or she emigrates to the USA " .
This is surely not quite true , as recent immigrants tend to be poorer than the native population , but the general point stands : population growth in the rich world , largely driven by immigration , is more environmentally damaging than an increase in population in the poor world .
In the US and the UK , their ecological impact has become another stick with which immigrants can be beaten .
But growth rates in the US and UK are atypical ; even the OPT concedes that by 2050 " the population of the most developed countries is expected to remain almost unchanged , at 1.2 billion " .
The population of the EU 25 ( the first 25 nations to join the union ) is likely to decline by 7 million .
This , I accept , is of little consolation to people in the UK , where the government now expects numbers to rise from 61 million to 77 million by 2050 .
Eighty per cent of the growth here , according to the OPT , is the direct or indirect result of immigration ( recent arrivals tend to produce more children ) .
Migrationwatch UK claims that migrants bear much of the responsibility for Britain 's housing crisis .
A graph on its website suggests that without them the rate of housebuilding in England between 1997 and 2004 would have exceeded new households by 20,000 - 40,000 a year .
Is this true ?
According to the Office for National Statistics , average net immigration to the UK between 1997 and 2004 was 153,000 .
Let us ( generously ) assume that 90 % of these people settled in England , and that their household size corresponded to the average for 2004 , of 2.3 .
This would mean that new immigrants formed 60,000 households a year .
The Barker Review , commissioned by the Treasury , shows that in 2002 , the nearest available year , 138,000 houses were built in England , while over the 10 years to 2000 , average household formation was 196,000 .
This rough calculation suggests that Migrationwatch is exaggerating , but that immigration is still an important contributor to housing pressure .
But even total population growth in England is responsible for only about 35 % of the demand for homes .
Most of the rest is the result of the diminishing size of households .
Surely there is one respect in which the growing human population constitutes the primary threat ?
The amount of food the world eats bears a direct relationship to the number of mouths .
After years of glut , the storerooms are suddenly empty and grain prices are rocketing .
How will another 3 billion be fed ?
Even here , however , population growth is not the most immediate issue : another sector is expanding much faster .
The UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation expects that global meat production will double by 2050 - growing , in other words , at two and a half times the rate of human numbers .
The supply of meat has already trebled since 1980 : farm animals now take up 70 % of all agricultural land and eat one third of the world 's grain .
In the rich nations we consume three times as much meat and four times as much milk per capita as the people of the poor world .
While human population growth is one of the factors that could contribute to a global food deficit , it is not the most urgent .
None of this means that we should forget about it .
Even if there were no environmental pressures caused by population growth , we should still support the measures required to tackle it : universal sex education , universal access to contraceptives , better schooling and opportunities for poor women .
Stabilising or even reducing the human population would ameliorate almost all environmental impacts .
But to suggest , as many of my correspondents do , that population growth is largely responsible for the ecological crisis is to blame the poor for the excesses of the rich .

WASHINGTON , Dec. 5  American intelligence agencies reversed their view about the status of Iran ’s nuclear weapons program after they obtained notes last summer from the deliberations of Iranian military officials involved in the weapons development program , senior intelligence and government officials said on Wednesday .
The notes included conversations and deliberations in which some of the military officials complained bitterly about what they termed a decision by their superiors in late 2003 to shut down a complex engineering effort to design nuclear weapons , including a warhead that could fit atop Iranian missiles .
The newly obtained notes contradicted public assertions by American intelligence officials that the nuclear weapons design effort was still active .
But according to the intelligence and government officials , they give no hint of why Iran ’s leadership decided to halt the covert effort .
Ultimately , the notes and deliberations were corroborated by other intelligence , the officials said , including intercepted conversations among Iranian officials , collected in recent months .
It is not clear if those conversations involved the same officers and others whose deliberations were recounted in the notes , or if they included their superiors .
NY Times lets ' conflicted ' Ashcroft pen pro-immunity op - ed for telecoms Nick Juliano
Published : Monday November 5 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Former Attorney General John Ashcroft says telecommunications companies that helped the government eavesdrop on Americans should not have to face costly lawsuits charging the companies with acting illegally and mishandling private customer data .
Arguing in favor of a controversial telecom immunity proposal that is being debated as part of legislation that would update the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , Ashcroft acknowledged there are still legal questions about President Bush 's warrantless surveillance scheme .
But he said private companies should not be held to account because they believed they were acting legally .
As long as the government said , ' Trust me , ' that was enough for the telcos .
" Longstanding principles of law hold that an American corporation is entitled to rely on assurances of legality from officials responsible for government activities .
The public officials in question might be right or wrong about the advisability or legality of what they are doing , but it is their responsibility , not the companys , to deal with the consequences if they are wrong , " Ashcroft wrote Monday in the New York Times .
" To deny immunity under these circumstances would be extraordinarily unfair to any cooperating carriers .
By what principle of justice should anyone face potentially ruinous liability for cooperating with intelligence activities that are authorized by the president and whose legality has been reviewed and approved by our most senior legal officials . "
After leaving government in 2005 , Ashcroft began a lobbying and consulting firm .
The Ashcroft Group is among several prominent DC firms representing telecommunications giant AT&T , Roll Call reported earlier this year .
The Times acknowledges the potential conflict of interest in an editors note , but it obviously was not enough of a concern to keep editors from running Ashcroft 's column .
Ashcroft does not personally represent a company targeted by about 40 lawsuits that have been filed nationwide .
In the essay , Ashcroft takes a far rosier view of the president 's surveillance program than he apparently did in 2004 when the Justice Department was unable " to certify [ the program 's ] legality , " as Ashcroft 's former deputy , James Comey testified earlier this year .
From his sickbed , where he lay recovering from surgery , Ashcroft resisted entreaties from the White House to override the concerns and re-certify the warrantles spying .
The dramatic hospital - room scene was detailed in Comey 's testimony .
On Monday , Ashcroft said that selling the lawsuits as a means to hold the governments and its industry enablers accountable was all well and good , but the bottom line was any disclosures about the program would aid America 's enemies .
" Although the lawsuits are couched in the language of accountability and the publics right to know , they would really have the effect of showing the world and our enemies sensitive secrets about how our national security agencies do their work , " Ashcroft wrote .
" For domestic purposes , proper accountability already exists  through the peoples elected representatives on the House and Senate Intelligence Committees .
It is through the legislature , not lawsuits , that we as a nation have tried to balance the need to let our intelligence agencies operate in secret , as they must if they are to be effective , and the need to ensure that they do so lawfully . "
The former Attorney General also declared that immunity is a good idea because the Senate Intelligence Committee voted for it , and if all the brave telecoms were doing was trying to fight the terrorists , well that 's all that matters .
" Assuming that the countrys communications companies helped the National Security Agency track Qaeda operatives and other terrorists after being assured that their conduct was lawful , they acted as patriots , not privacy violators , " he wrote .
" The Senate Intelligence Committee acted wisely .
The full Congress should follow its lead . "
But let 's not get ahead of ourselves here , say some bloggers who have been following the FISA debate .
Despite Ashcroft 's claims that immunity would be limited to telecoms that believed their actions were authorized or if they did n't do what lawsuits allege them to have done .
" But that 's one of the tricks with this surveillance -- the telecoms did something , and it's not entirely clear we 've described what they did properly .
Moreover , there 's the presence of telecoms that recognized the form of the requests was illegal - - for some reason , Qwest recognized the assurances that the activity was authorized to be dubious , " writes emptywheel .
" If the government can ask for data and use it in any fashion they want ( or ask the telecoms to use it in any fashion ) , what does that say about the creeping surveillance ? " emptywheel continues .
" It demonstrates precisely the problem with surveillance that takes place independent of any review : the government can do anything and just claim it 's legal .
Even if it violates clear laws like FISA . "
Matt Stoller , writing at Open Left , says the telecoms lobbying firepower makes them a daunting foe in legislative battles .
" Telecom companies own DC , from Al Wynn to Jay Rockefeller John Ashcroft , " he writes .
" It 's just that simple . "
For years the U.S. has attempted to mold Pakistan .
The result is not pretty : an unstable , undemocratic state which possesses nuclear weapons , border provinces which offer safe haven to Taliban and al - Qaeda forces , and people who loath the American government .
The murder of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto is merely the latest blow to Washington ’s plans .
Pakistan was born in violence as part of Britain ’s partition of its Indian colony on the way to independence .
The seeds of continuing international conflict were sown by leaving the bulk of primarily Muslim Kashmir in Hindu India .
Equally foolish was concocting a geographically divided Pakistan in which the peoples of east and west shared little other than religion .
During the Cold War Washington used Islamabad to balance against an India which leaned towards the Soviet Union .
It was never a good bet : India was more democratic and militarily stronger , besting Pakistan in two ( or three , counting an early battle over Kashmir ) wars .
The last one , in 1971 , birthed an independent Bangladesh out of East Pakistan .
Today Bangladesh is poorer and perhaps even less stable than Pakistan  though , mercifully , it lacks nuclear weapons .
During the 1980s Pakistan was America ’s primary conduit of aid to Afghan mujahedeen forces fighting the Soviets .
Since 2001 Pakistan again has been a front - line state , this time in allied efforts to eradicate al - Qaeda and suppress the Taliban in Afghanistan .
Even as the Bush administration was constructing a fanciful “ axis of evil ” out of the disparate nations of Iraq , Iran , and North Korea , Pakistan was proving to be a greater problem .
First , despite receiving more than $ 10 billion from the U.S. since 9/11 , Islamabad was but an indifferent ally in the war on terror .
The Musharraf regime delivered up some al - Qaeda operatives , but was thought to shelter others .
The northwestern provinces , never fully under the central government ’s control , provided refuge to anti-American forces , including , it was often charged , Osama bin Laden .
The Pakistani military was either unable or unwilling ( or , more likely , both ) to eliminate these sanctuaries .
The bottom line for Islamabad was ensuring regime survival , not aiding America .
Even Musharraf ’s limited cooperation angered the Pakistani people , almost half of whom said in a recent CNN poll that they approved of bin Laden .
Pakistan also embodied the problem of nuclear proliferation , having built an “ Islamic bomb ” despite Washington ’s opposition .
Today the regime is thought to possess as many as 120 nuclear warheads , though estimates vary wildly .
Even worse , Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan , father of the Pakistani bomb , set up an international “ Nukes - R - Us , ” peddling his wares around the globe .
After his activities were discovered , the Pakistani government professed its shock , shock .
But the Musharraf regime refused to make him available to U.S. intelligence , inflaming skepticism in Washington of the claim that planeloads of nuclear materials were being shipped around the world without anyone in Islamabad knowing anything .
Finally , Musharraf , who seized power from an elected government in a coup , paid only the barest pretense to democratic forms despite the Bush administration ’s loud crusade for democracy .
Not that Pakistani democracy , which tended to alternate irregularly with military rule , met America ’s standards .
For instance , Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto , father of recently murdered Benazir Bhutto , refused to honor the results of the 1971 election , triggering a civil war between east and west , leading to India ’s intervention .
He also opened his nation ’s drive for nuclear weapons in 1972 .
( Bhutto was later ousted and executed by Gen. Mohammed Zia-ul Haq , who himself died in a mysterious plane crash . )
Nor were the more recent reigns of Benazir Bhutto and Muhammad Nawaz Sharif much better .
They continued work on nuclear weapons , leading to Pakistan ’s first tests in 1998 .
The two civilian leaders allied with the Taliban , supported Middle Eastern militants , and tolerated religious persecution at home .
Both were thought to profit from the corruption that pervades public life in Pakistan .
Indeed , Benazir Bhutto was ousted from office twice in response to claims of corruption .
She and her husband , Asif Ali Zardari , were convicted in Swiss court and he was jailed for years in Pakistan on corruption charges .
He was released only in a politically inspired amnesty .
As a result , few mourned the demise of democracy after Pervez Musharraf ’s October 1999 coup against Prime Minister Sharif .
Musharraf proclaimed : “ I would like to move away from the sham democracy we have had in Pakistan . ”
Of course , he did no such thing .
Last fall he even staged a coup against his own government , using the state of emergency to replace members of the supreme court , thereby ensuring its approval of another presidential term .
This was not to the Bush administration ’s liking , but there was little it could do .
For decades the U.S. provided aid , sold weapons , and offered diplomatic support to whatever regime happened to be in power in Islamabad .
Yet America had minimal success in promoting domestic reform .
Foreign aid has done little anywhere to generate economic growth , and tens of billions of dollars  from the U.S. , World Bank , Asian Development Bank , International Monetary Fund , and other institutions  for Pakistan proved to be no exception .
The country of 165 million remains desperately poor , with a per capita GDP of just $ 829 in 2006 , despite enjoying better than average economic growth of late .
Nor did America ’s ministrations result in much liberalization of Pakistani politics , even during formally democratic episodes .
True democracy requires far more than occasional elections , but Pakistan lacks the tolerant public ethos and private mediating institutions that are so important in creating stable democratic systems .
Finally , nothing the U.S. did  provide aid , make threats , cut off aid , impose sanctions  affected Islamabad ’s decision to go nuclear .
Short of launching air strikes or invading , Washington could not stop Pakistan from taking a step which it saw as essential to its national interest in light of the decision by its principal military rival , India , to develop nuclear weapons .
Indeed , only by threatening to begin bombing did the Bush administration get Islamabad ’s attention after September 11 .
Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage apparently told President Musharraf : “ Be prepared to be bombed .
Be prepared to go back to the Stone Age . ”
Thus was Pakistan forced to drop Afghanistan ’s Taliban regime as a client and formally enlist in the coalition against al - Qaeda .
The pressure worked because Washington ’s threat was credible and Pakistan was able to determine what " is " is , in President Clinton ’s parlance , when it came to “ cooperating ” with the U.S. Musharraf continually played upon Washington ’s fear of his possible overthrow by Islamic extremists , warning that he could only go so far in accommodating the U.S. Analysts divided over his vulnerability , but few policymakers wanted to take a chance .
Musharraf ’s growing isolation  even before Bhutto ’s assassination , two - thirds of Pakistanis opposed his plan to serve a second term  led the Bush administration to push even harder on the democratic front .
But the options in Pakistan ’s “ big man ” form of politics were essentially limited to Bhutto and Sharif .
Sharif was viewed as too favorable towards Islamic fundamentalists and antagonistic towards the U.S. Moreover , though he also was twice prime minister , and was the elected official ousted by Musharraf , Sharif lacked a Greek Chorus in Washington .
Bhutto , though both courageous and Westernized , looked little better on any objective measure .
As noted earlier , Bhutto ’s record did n’t inspire confidence .
In two stints as prime minister she passed few pieces of important legislation , failed to control abuses by security forces , promoted the Taliban , did little to discourage Islamic radicalism , and was dismissed from office for corruption .
Moreover , she , no less than Sharif , represented a family and tribal politics common to South Asia , in which her party was more a tool of personal ambition than political philosophy or moral principle .
British author William Dalrymple called her “ a feudal princess with the aristocratic sense of entitlement that came with owning great tracts of the country and the Western - leaning tastes that such a background tends to give . ”
Indeed , she prevailed in a bitter intra-family struggle for control of the Pakistan People ’s Party .
While she was prime minister , her younger brother , Mir Murtaza Bhutto , was shot dead by the police , causing accusing fingers to point her way .
His daughter ( her niece ) , Fatima Bhutto , complained that Benazir Bhutto ’s “ role in his assassination has never been adequately answered , although the tribunal convened after his death under the leadership of three respected judges concluded that it could not have taken place without approval from a ‘ much higher ’ political authority . ”
( After Benazir Bhutto ’s death , her husband , Asif Ali Zardari , took over control of the PPP , nominally on behalf of their 19 - year - old son , Bilawal Zardari , who has started calling himself Bilawal Bhutto Zardari .
Asif served as a cabinet minister in his wife ’s second administration and earned the sobriquet “ Mr. Ten Percent ” for his reported attention to the earning potential of power . )
Despite this record , Benazir Bhutto had several advantages over Sharif  beauty , exile in Britain rather than Saudi Arabia , less apparent tolerance for Islamic radicals , and , most important , a calculated willingness to tell Westerners what they wanted to hear .
Former U.S. Ambassador Peter Galbraith said of her : “ She was this completely charming , beautiful woman who could flatter the senators , and who could read their political concerns , who could persuade them that she would much better serve American interests ” than would her opponents .
As a result , she was lavished with encomiums by Washington ’s policymaking and punditry elites .
Indeed , a veritable flood of journalists and analysts claiming to be her “ friend ” emerged after her death , extolling her manifold virtues .
One commentator even rhapsodized about the “ Asian Winston Churchill . ”
Thus , the Bush administration applied strong pressure on Musharraf to allow Benazir Bhutto back into the country to contest parliamentary elections , originally scheduled for next week .
Washington sold this as a grand step forward on the return to democracy , but Musharraf surely saw the political advantages for himself .
The proposed political condominium would provide Musharraf with parliamentary legitimacy for his continued rule ; in return , Bhutto would receive a decision - making role as prime minister .
Their dealings looked more like two oligarches dividing the political spoils than opening up the political system .
Indeed , for this reason the negotiations cost Bhutto public support .
Barely a quarter of the population believed that she had returned for the country rather than to satisfy her own ambitions .
Most people thought deal would serve Musharraf and Bhutto more than the average Pakistani .
The likely benefits for America were even less clear .
Any accommodation would have been uncertain and unstable , prone to collapse at the slightest challenge .
Moreover , despite Bhutto ’s pro-Western rhetoric , noted analyst Stanley Kurtz , “ Her supporters are poor people who have n’t benefitted from the growth of Pakistan ’s economy under Musharraf .
They ’re attracted to Bhutto ’s socialism , not to hopes for liberal democracy or military assaults against the Taliban . ”
To have acted at Washington ’s behest would have quickly sapped her remaining popularity .
Then came the assassination .
Now the Bush administration ’s plans are in ruins .
The politician who was supposed to lead the restoration of democracy is dead .
Most U.S. policymakers distrust the only other major democratic leader , Sharif .
Says Peter Rodman of the Brookings Institution : Sharif is “ a wild card and not to be trusted . ”
Sharif returns the sentiment , asking with evident asperity : “ Now that a major Pakistani political leader has been assassinated , why is [ Bush ] still supporting his man ” Musharraf ?
The Musharraf government is suspected  almost certainly wrongly , but truth is of little matter to conspiracy - minded Pakistanis  of complicity in the murder .
Moreover , even those inclined to think favorably of the president must wonder at the behavior of government officials who denied Bhutto additional protection , lied about the cause of her death , and impeded any effective investigation of her murder .
The assassination sparked violent riots , which in turn begat a new military crackdown .
The government also delayed the poll , triggering new protests from the opposition .
The possibility of cooperation among Musharraf ; Sharif , who was ousted by Musharraf ; and Bhutto ’s Pakistan People ’s Party , which united only around her , seems slight , to say the least .
The likelihood of Pakistan emerging as a stable and liberal democracy continues to fall .
But the administration still shouts advice from the sidelines .
The Pakistani people should persevere in pursuit of democracy .
The country should remain calm .
The election should go ahead as planned .
The election should be postponed as proposed .
And so on .
One unnamed administration official told the Washington Post : “ Plan A still has to work .
We all have to appeal to moderate forces to come together and carry the election and create a more solidly based government , then use that as a platform to fight the terrorists . ”
Apparently fantasy drives more than the administration ’s Iraq policy .
Alas , there is little evidence that the Pakistani people much care what Washington says .
Frankly , it ’s doubtful that Musharraf much cares either , given how badly the administration ’s “ Bhutto option ” turned out .
Anyway , how can U.S. policymakers seriously argue that they have the slightest idea what to do to “ fix ” today ’s mess ?
Of course , reality has n’t stopped the usual suspects from concocting grand new initiatives .
Various presidential candidates have proposed that Washington issue all sorts of demands , including that Musharraf accept an international inquiry into Bhutto ’s death and even step down .
The New York Times urged the Bush administration to “ fortify Pakistan ’s badly battered democratic institutions . ”
Other analysts and pundits suggest that the U.S. government enhance its military involvement in Pakistan , increase aid to encourage economic development , promise to remain engaged over the long - term , intensify diplomatic efforts to improve Pakistan - Afghan relations , push for normalization of Pakistani - Indian relations , improve Pakistani military capabilities , and demand greater access to local intelligence .
The International Crisis Group has just published a detailed paper entitled : “ After Bhutto ’s Murder : A Way Forward for Pakistan . ”
Among its proposals : Musharraf should resign , the constitution should be fully restored , and power should be transferred into civilian hands .
The ICG forgot to mention sending the tooth fairy to visit every Pakistani child .
All these ideas sound wonderful in theory .
But Washington has virtually no practical means to achieve any of them .
Just how would the U.S. “ fortify ” political institutions that have been largely dismantled by the incumbent dictator supported by Washington ?
Does anyone expect Musharraf to voluntarily yield power ?
And who believes that a liberal democracy would result from a coup or street riots sufficient in strength to drive him from power ?
Alas , the administration ’s “ Benazir gambit ” has knocked Humpty Dumpty off the wall , and no American can put Pakistan ’s political system back together again .
Indeed , there ’s no reason to believe that any civilian Pakistani government would be notably more competent , less corrupt , and more willing to combat Islamic extremism than past civilian regimes , let alone more likely to survive .
The building blocks for liberal democracy remain absent : the population is 60 percent illiterate ; the civic ethos is one of conflict rather than cooperation ; broad - based community groups and institutions are largely nonexistent ; family and tribal identities transcend other loyalties ; the army and Inter - Services Intelligence agency ( Pakistan ’s CIA ) have long dominated Pakistani life .
Under such circumstances the best strategy for the U.S. government would be to put distance between itself and the authorities in Islamabad .
Cooperation would still be necessary to deal with the Taliban and al - Qaeda .
A continuing dialogue over the security of Pakistan ’s nuclear weapons would remain worthwhile .
And America ’s bully pulpit should be used to broadly affirm the ideals of a liberal society : the responsibility of governments everywhere to respect the lives and dignity of their peoples , and to be accountable to them .
But no more attempting to micro manage Pakistani political affairs .
No more trying to dictate political actors and outcomes .
No more supporting or undermining the government .
No more taking sides among contending parties .
No more pronouncing judgment on every permutation of Pakistani politics .
No more seeking to buy political allegiance with more “ aid . ”
In contrast , Americans  and others around the world  could do much more by supporting private organizations that go around the Islamabad regime to support local development projects and build relationships with community and tribal leaders .
The vast majority of Pakistanis disdain the U.S. government .
The answer is not better State Department propaganda , but less meddling by Washington policymakers and greater involvement by private Americans actually interested in Pakistanis as people .
Social engineering does n’t work in America .
Attempting to reorder the globe is an even greater fantasy .
Decades of plans and programs designed to remake Pakistan have come to naught .
The failure of Washington ’s latest strategy , based on the return of Benazir Bhutto , was not surprising , just more disastrous than usual .
It ’s time U.S. policymakers learned a lesson from their manifold mistakes and said no more .
The Orgasmic Brain
[ Quotes from The Three - Pound Universe ,
0-874-77650-3 , 419 pg pb
by Judith Hooper and Dick Teresi , 1986 ; 1991 ]
'
In the years from 1950 to 1952 , he implanted brain electrodes in twenty - six patients .
Some of them suffered from incurable epilepsy , intractable physical pain , Parkinson 's disease , and other medical conditions , but most came out of the dimly lit back wards of the state mental hospitals .
With dental burr - drills , Heath and his co-workers drilled through the patients ' skulls , guided the electrodes carefully into specific sites , and then left them there , at first for a few days , later for years at a time .
...
" By implanting electrodes and taking recordings from these deep - lying areas , " he explains , " we were able to localize the brain 's pleasure and pain systems .
We 'd interview a patient about pleasant subjects and see the pleasure system firing .
If we had a patient who flew into a rage attack , as many psychotics did , we 'd find the ' punishment ' system firing . "
The pleasure system includes the septal area and part of the almond - shaped amygdala ; the other half of the amygdala , the hippocampus , the thalamus , and the tegmentum ( in the midbrain ) constitute the punishment system .
...
Whenever a mental patient flew into a violent rage or turned into a catatonic zombie , the EEG was almost certain to display the telltale sawtooth pattern .
If the patient got well , the spike disappeared .
...
" The primary symptom of schizophrenia is n't hallucinations or delusions , " he tells us .
" It 's a defect in the pleasure response .
Schizophrenics have a predominance of painful emotions .
They function in an almost continuous state of fear or rage , fight or flight , because they do n't have the pleasure to neutralize it . " ...
It turned out that electrical stimulation of the pleasure center automatically turned off the punishment system -- what Heath calls " the aversive system " -- and vice - versa .
And so Heath tried to cure mental illness with direct electrical stimulation of the pleasure neurons .
" If we stimulated their pleasure systems , violent psychotics stopped having rage attacks , " he says .
" We even stimulated the septal area in people suffering from intractable cancer or arthritis pain and we were able to turn off the pain . " ...
By stimulating the septal pleasure area , he could make homicidal manias , suicide attempts , depressions , or delusions go away -- sometimes for a long time .
...
As it turned out , it took more than a few pulses of current to exorcise madness .
Heath had to devise safer electrodes that could be left in the brain for years so that a patient could be restimulated at intervals .
Then , in 1976 , the " most violent patient in the state " -- a mildly retarded young man who had to be tied to his bed because of his savage outbursts -- received Dr. Heath 's first brain pacemaker .
The pacemaker is an array of tiny battery - powered electrodes that delivers 5 minutes of stimulation every 10 minutes to the cerebellum , at the very back of the brain .
Its power source , a battery pack about the size of a deck of playing cards , could fit neatly in the patient 's pocket .
( Later it was miniaturized to matchbook proportions and implanted in the recipient 's abdomen ; it requires recharging every 5 years . )
The cerebellum , Heath learned , is a better entryway to the brain 's emotional circuitry .
Stimulating a precise half - inch of its cauliflowerlike surface automatically fires the pleasure area and inhibits the rage centers , and so it was no longer necessary to invade the limbic areas farther forward in the brain .
The first pacemaker patient soon stopped trying to slash himself and his caretakers and went home from the hospital .
All was well , for a while .
Then the man inexplicably went on a rampage and attempted to murder his parents .
Before he was subdued , he had severely wounded his next - door neighbor and narrowly missed being shot by the sheriff .
Heath 's X rays quickly spotted the problem : broken wires between the pacemaker and the power source .
Once the wires were reattached , the rage attacks waned again .
The young man is now in vocational rehabilitation and doing well .
In 1974 a pretty , intelligent twenty - one - year - old librarian was shot in the head during a holdup .
After an operation that removed much of her frontal lobes , she had frequent seizures , was barely conversant , and had to be fed through a tube because she stopped eating .
By the end of the next year she was in a continual frenzy .
She lashed out at anyone within range and once tried to stab her father .
She screamed whenever she was touched and complained of constant , excruciating pain all over her body .
Her brain pacemaker was installed in November 1976 , and , magically , the rage episodes subsided .
She started eating ; her memory improved ; and her doctors began describing her personality as " pleasant " even " sparkling . "
Another patient , a severely depressed former physicist , was troubled by voices that commanded him to choke his wife .
When he got one of Dr. Heath 's pacemakers in 1977 , the infernal voices vanished , along with his perennial gloom .
He and his wife began to visit relatives and dine together in restaurants for the first time in years .
But * his * wires eventually broke , and once again his wife was threatened with strangulation .
When the gadgetry was mended , so was the man 's psyche .
Ironically , the many technical snafus that plagued the pacemaker gave Heath the perfect controls for his experiments .
...
Even so , the cerebellar pacemaker is not a psychiatric cure - all .
By Heath 's estimates , about half of the seventy - odd patients have been substantially rehabilitated -- no mean feat , given that pacemaker recipients come from the ranks of the " incurable " -- but other have never emerged from their private hells .
For some reason , depressives and patients prone to uncontrollable violence have benefitted most ; chronic schizophrenics the least .
Fortunately for posterity , Heath and his colleagues filmed many of their bold journeys into the human emotional apparatus .
...
A woman of indeterminate age lies on a narrow cot , a giant bandage covering her skull .
At the start of the film she seems locked inside some private vortex of despair .
Her face is as blank as her white hospital gown and her voice is a remote , tired monotone .
" Sixty pulses , " says a disembodied voice .
It belongs to the technician in the next room , who is sending a current to the electrode inside the woman 's head .
The patient , inside her soundproof cubicle , does not hear him .
Suddenly , she smiles .
" Why are you smiling ? " asks Dr. Heath , sitting by her bedside .
" I do n't know ...
Are you doing something to me ?
[ Giggles . ]
I do n't usually sit around and laugh at nothing .
I must be laughing at something . "
" One hundred forty , " says the offscreen technician .
The patient giggles again , transformed from a stone - faced zombie into a little girl with a secret joke .
" What in the hell are you doing ? " she asks .
" You must be hitting some goody place . "
The " goody place " is the septal pleasure center , which the unseen technician is stimulating with an electrical current .
" She was a mean one , " Heath muses .
" She was hospitalized for years for a schizoaffective illness .
...
This film was made in 1969 , and the treatment has held on her -- she 's doing well . "
[ From another patient story : ]
" There -- see the big delta wave appearing in the septal region , " Heath tells us .
Sure enough , large , languorous waves are now coming from the lead to the septal electrode .
" There 's almost an exact correlation , " he adds .
" When he gets a rush of good feeling , the record shows large - amplitude waves in the pleasure system . " ...
Along with depth electrodes , Heath 's team would often surgically implant a sort of tube , called a canula , through which they could deliver precise amounts of a chemical directly into the brain .
Oriental sacred texts ( and Aldous Huxley 's Brave New World ) mention a legendary bliss drug called " soma " , the food of the Himalayan gods .
The real life version might be acetylcholine , a natural chemical neurotransmitter .
When the Tulane researchers injected acetylcholine into a patient 's septal area , " vigorous activity " showed up on the septal EEG , and the patient usually reported intense pleasure -- including multiple sexual orgasms lasting as long as thirty minutes .
" I can show you a film of one of the recordings , " Heath offers , fishing through some of the reels on the shelves .
We half expect a neurologic peep show , but the film he digs out is the raw EEG record of a woman patient , who was being treated for epilepsy , under the influence of acetylcholine .
A flat , clinical voice - over accompanies the staticky march of brain waves across the screen :
Now we 're coming to the start of the changes ...
It 's in the form of a fast spindle , about 18 per second ... first in the dorsal right anterior septal , then it spreads to the other septal leads .
...
This is still correlated with the same clinical findings of intense pleasure and particularly of a sexual nature .
The flip side of joy is pain .
The next film shows a patient having his " aversive system " stimulated .
His face twists suddenly into a terrible grimace .
One eye turns out and his features contort as though in the spasm of a horrible science - fiction metamorphosis .
" It 's knocking me out ... I just want to claw ... , " he says , gasping like a tortured beast .
" I 'll kill you ... I 'll kill you , Dr. Lawrence . "
... When [ Heath ] first showed his movies to an assemblage of psychiatrists , neurologists , and other scientists , some were outraged .
Murmurs of medical hubris , mind control , and unsafe human experimentation circulated -- in large part because of the film we just saw .
But what looks like a scene from the Spanish Inquisition , Heath assures us , is no more than electrical stimulation of the rage / fear circuits .
Unfortunately , the audience , back in 1952 , misread it .
" They thought we were hurting him , " he tells us .
" But we * were n 't* hurting him .
We were stimulating a site in the tegmentum in the midbrain , and all of a sudden he wanted to kill .
He would have , too , if he had n't been tied down ...
He started remembering a time when he lost his temper -- when his shirts were n't ironed on right and he wanted to kill his sister .
That showed us we 'd activated the same circuit that was fired by his spontaneous rage attacks . " ...
" As soon as we turned off the current he went back to normal , " Heath recalls .
" We asked him why he had wanted to kill Dr. Lawrence ( not his real name ) , and he said he had nothing against Dr. Lawrence ; he was just there .
He 's like a psychotic person on the street who lashes out at whoever is around . " ...
Heath tells us some of his patients were given " self - stimulators " similar to the ones used by Old 's rats .
Whenever he felt the urge , the patient could push any of 3 or 4 buttons on the self - stimulator hooked to his belt .
Each button was connected to an electrode implanted in a different part of his brain , and the device kept track of the number of times he stimulated each site .
Heath tells of one patient who felt impelled to stimulate his septal region about 1500 times per hour .
He happened to be a schizophrenic homosexual who wanted to change his sexual preference .
As an experiment , Heath gave the man stag films to watch while he pushed his pleasure - center hotline , and the result was a new interest in female companionship .
After clearing things with the state attorney general , the enterprising Tulane doctors went out and hired a " lady of the evening , " as Heath delicately put it , for their ardent patient .
" We paid her fifty dollars , " Heath recalls .
" I told her it might be a little weird , but the room would be completely blacked out with curtains .
In the next room we had the instruments for recording his brain waves , and he had enough lead wiring running into the electrodes in his brain so he could move around freely .
We stimulated him a few times , the young lady was cooperative , and it was a very successful experience . "
The conversion was only temporary , however .
...
We ask Heath if human beings are as compulsive about pleasure as the rats of Old 's laboratory that self - stimulated until they passed out .
" No , " he tells us .
" People do n't self - stimulate constantly -- as long as they 're feeling good .
Only when they 're depressed does the stimulation trigger a big response .
There are so many factors that play into a human being 's pleasure response : your experience , your memory system , sensory cues ... " he muses .
" [ Timothy Leary ] was asked whether drugs were a bad influence on young kids , and he said , ' This is nothing .
In a few years , kids are going to be demanding septal electrodes . '
" But it does n't work that way . " '
Hans Thewissen , Ph.D. , Professor of the Department of Anatomy , Northeastern Ohio Universities Colleges of Medicine and Pharmacy ( NEOUCOM ) , has announced the discovery of the missing link between whales and their four - footed ancestors .
Scientists since Darwin have known that whales are mammals whose ancestors walked on land , and in the past 15 years , researchers led by Dr. Thewissen have identified a series of intermediate fossils documenting whale ’s dramatic evolutionary transition from land to sea .
But one step was missing :
The identity of the land ancestors of whales .
Now Dr. Thewissen and colleagues discovered of the skeleton of Indohyus , an approximately 48 - million - year - old even - toed ungulate from the Kashmir region of India , as the closest known fossil relative of whales .
Dr. Thewissen ’s team studied a layer of mudstone with hundreds of bones of Indohyus , a fox - sized mammal that looked something like a miniature deer .
Dr. Thewissen and colleagues report key similarities between whales and Indohyus in the skull and ear that show their close family relationship .
Thewissen and colleagues also explored how Indohyus lived , and came up with some surprising results .
They determined that the bones of the skeleton of Indohyus had a thick outside layer , much thicker than in other mammals of this size .
This characteristic is often seen in mammals that are slow aquatic waders , such as the hippopotamus today .
Indohyus ’ aquatic habits are further confirmed by the chemical composition of their teeth , which revealed oxygen isotope ratios similar to those of aquatic animals .
All this implies that Indohyus spent much of its time in water .
Dr. Walt Horton , Vice - President for Research at NEOUCOM commented : “ This remarkable research demonstrates that the study of the structure and composition of fossil bones can tell us about how the skeleton of whales and , by extension , other mammals like humans , interacts with the environment and changes over time . ”
Before , it was often assumed that whales descended from carnivorous terrestrial ancestors , and some researchers speculated that whales became aquatic to feed on ocean - dwelling fish .
According to Dr. Thewissen , “ Clearly , this is not the case , Indohyus is a plant - eater , and already is aquatic .
Apparently the dietary shift to hunting animals ( as modern whales do ) came later than the habitat shift to the water . ”
Although it may seem strange to think of a tiny , deer - like animal living in water , one modern mousedeer offers something of an analogue to the ancient Indohyus , even though it is not closely related to whales :
The African Mousedeer ( also called Chevrotain ) is known to jump in water when in danger , and move around at the bottom ( for a movie showing this go to YouTube and watch ‘ Eagle vs. Water Chevrotain ’ ) .
Whale evolution is one of the best documented examples of mammal evolution , and Dr. Thewissen ’s discovery adds a significant new piece to the puzzle .
“ Not much was known about the earliest whales , until the early nineties , ” Dr. Thewissen said .
“ But then , a number of discoveries came in quick succession . ”
The article documenting Dr. Thewissen ’s new discovery , titled " Whales originated from Aquatic Artiodactyls in the Eocene of India , " was published in the November issue of Nature .
It ’s authors ( in order of appearance on the paper ) include : J. G. M. “ Hans ” Thewissen , Ph.D. , Professor of the Department of Anatomy , Northeastern Ohio Universities Colleges of Medicine and Pharmacy ( NEOUCOM ) ; Lisa Noelle Cooper , Doctoral Student , Graduate Program in Biomedical Sciences , Kent State University and NEOUCOM ; Mark T. Clementz , Ph.D. , Department of Geology and Geophysics , University of Wyoming , Laramie WY ; Sunil Bajpai , Ph.D. , from the Department of Earth Sciences , Indian Institute of Technology , Roorkee , Uttarkhand in India ; and B. N. Tiwari , Ph.D. , from the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology , Dehra Dun , Uttarkhand , India .

Amazon has announced a new payment system for real - world shops which uses a simple wave of the hand .
Its new Amazon
One scanner registers an image of the user ’s palm , letting them pay by hovering their hand in mid-air “ for about a second or so ” , it says .
The product will be trialled at two of Amazon ’s physical stores in Seattle .
But the company said it is “ in active discussions with several potential customers ” about rolling it out to other shops in the future .
“ In most retail environments , Amazon
One could become an alternate payment or loyalty card option with a device at the checkout counter next to a traditional point of sale system , ” it said .
Amazon also said the system could be used for “ entering a location like a stadium ” or scanning yourself into work instead of using an ID card .
“ We believe Amazon One has broad applicability beyond our retail stores , ” it added .

A drug which reduces the desire for marijuana and blocks its effect on the brain has been successfully tested in rats .
Scientists say the findings may translate into better therapies for cannabis addiction in humans .
Rodents given a compound derived from a plant in the buttercup family lose their hankering for a synthetic version of tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) – the active compound in marijuana .
The treatment also blocked a reward response in the animals ’ brains when they did receive synthetic THC .
In the first part of the experiment , Steven Goldberg at the National Institute on Drug Abuse in Maryland , US , and his colleagues placed rats in a cage with a lever the animals could push .
Each time the rats leaned on the lever , they received a dose of the synthetic THC through a small tube running into their body .
Over a period of three weeks the rats learned to enjoy the effects of synthetic THC and frequently self - administered the drug .
By comparison , rats that received saline solution did not press the lever often .

Goldberg ’s team then injected the rats with a compound derived from the seeds of the Delphinium brownii plant , which is in the buttercup family .
The compound , known as methyllycaconitine ( MLA ) , had a dramatic effect on the animals ’ behaviour .
Blocking dopamine
On the day that they received MLA they pushed the lever for synthetic THC 70 % less than before .
The drug did not seem to otherwise change the rats ’ movement and coordination , and had no other apparent side effects .
The scientists also took a close look at the effects of MLA on the rats ’ brains .
They used a technique called microdialysis to take tiny fluid samples from a reward - signalling area of the brain known as the nucleus accumbens , which sits near the base of the head .
When rats receive synthetic THC , levels of the reward chemical dopamine normally shoot up in the nucleus accumbens – but MLA blocked the release of dopamine in this brain region .
“ The increases in dopamine are virtually non-existent because of MLA , ” says Goldberg .
He adds that MLA did not lower dopamine levels below normal amounts .
This is important , says Goldberg , because it suggests that a similar therapy for humans would not interfere with normal reward signalling in the brain .
He notes that the drug Rimonobant , which makes monkeys less likely to self - administer THC , has been linked to depression in humans .
The exact mechanism by which MLA works remains a mystery .
Scientists know that MLA binds to specific cell receptors in the brain called alpha - 7 nicotinic receptors .
They speculate that cannabis indirectly triggers these receptors , but cannot do so when the receptors are blocked by MLA .
Human potential
There is a genuine need for medications to help cannabis addicts overcome their drug problem , according to Goldberg : “ About 10 % of the people who experiment with it go on to heavy use and have trouble voluntarily giving it up .
I think there is a proportion of the population who need ways to make them stop . ”
Drug -makers have recently made medications such as Chantix available to help people quit tobacco smoking .
But researchers say that these drugs affect different nicotinic receptors than those triggered by THC .
And while some people have pushed Rimonobant as a possible remedy for addiction , Goldberg says that more options – such as one based on MLA – must be explored : “ Each patient is different and what works in one might not work in another . ”

Google has become so ubiquitous in many people 's daily lives that it serves as the all - encompassing information source on how to do nearly anything : jump a car , tie a tie , fold a pocket square , remove ketchup stains .
Oh , and crack open a safe to steal $ 12,000 .
That 's what a couple of burglars did last month in Colorado , when they broke into an indoor amusement center called Bigg City armed with the knowledge they thought they needed in order to get into a couple of safes .
The burglars knew the passcodes to the safes in question but were still unable to open them after several tries , so they eventually resorted to their good friend Google to tell them how .
These burglars may not have been the sharpest tacks in the box to begin with ; they attempted to cover a security camera lens not with spray paint or some other opaque agent , but the clear , cleaning properties of WD - 40 , and attempted to do the same to a fire alarm that they thought was a camera .
But at least they were resourceful ; after spending an hour and 15 minutes attempting to unsuccessfully crack the safe using their handy passcodes , according to the Colorado Springs Gazette , they used the computer in the next room to search Google for " how to crack a safe . "
The Google search proved fruitful for the two burglars , as they were able to get the information they needed and walk away with $ 12,000 in cash as well as a PlayStation and a laptop .
And despite their inept attempts to outwit the security cameras , they have not yet been arrested .
It 's not the first time criminals have turned to the Internet for inspiration , and it certainly wo n't be the last .
It 's also a problem that law enforcement officials are keenly aware of .
Last year , US Department of Homeland Security head Michael Chertoff characterized the Internet as containing a plethora of terrorist resources , ranging from training to networking to fundraising .
And according to the Times Online , European officials are currently considering passing legislation that would outlaw the publication of bomb - making information on the Internet .
Under the current proposal , ISPs could face charges for not blocking web sites with bomb - making instructions on them .
" It should simply not be possible to leave people free to instruct other people on the internet on how to make a bomb — that has nothing to do with freedom of expression , " EU Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini told the Times .
Safe - cracking is a far cry from bomb making , and the Colorado burglary is comical as it involves only $ 12,000 and a couple of dim - witted robbers .
At the same time , it serves as a reminder of the mixed blessing the Internet has proven to be for law enforcement .
When Chris Dodd pulled out of the presidential race , he promised to keep up the good fight on the FISA bill and filibuster it if it contained retroactive immunity for telecoms .
For showing this leadership , there was an outcry from the netroots to support Dodd as Majority Leader .
Unfortunately , that support from the electorate ( I mean , how dare he listen to the people who put him in office ?
The nerve ! ) as well as his continued pledge to filibuster the FISA bill is making Chris Dodd a very isolated person within his caucus .
Per Roll Call ( subscription req'd ) :
( D) uring his campaign for the presidency , Dodd chose to focus much of his time and energy on foreign policy issues and became an outspoken critic of President Bush 's wiretapping programs , going so far as to filibuster a compromise Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act reauthorization because of privacy concerns .
That prompted some private complaints from Democrats , who felt Dodd should have focused more on core issues under his committee 's jurisdiction , particularly when the foreclosure crisis began to heat up last fall .
Party leaders were reportedly unhappy with the fact that Dodd did not spend more time personally working on the mortgage legislation his committee produced and which Sen.
Charles Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) ultimately helped shepherd out of the chamber .
And while some hard feelings may remain , Dodd is set on hitting the ground running in terms of his committee work this year , planning an aggressive agenda that will feed into the party 's broader economic efforts , aides said . [..]
Democrats said the FISA fight - which could come in the first week or two of the new session - may be an early test of whether Dodd 's presidential campaign has caused any significant strains in his relationships with colleagues .
One senior Democratic aide said that while some Democrats could have been irked in the heat of the moment , most understand it is the nature of presidential campaigning for candidates to tackle hot - button issues and to rely heavily on veteran staff for day - to - day work in the Senate .
" I think it 's too early to say " whether there are any hard feelings , the Democratic aide said .
" But I think you could term it as a key few months for him " in terms of his reintegration into the Caucus .
" It will be interesting to watch when he returns , " the aide said .
For those not fluent in DC passive - aggressive speak , allow me to translate the " anonymous Democratic aide " for you : " okay , we know you needed to do something to stand out from the pack during your campaign , but now you need to get in line , or you 'll find yourself at odds with your caucus . "
That 's right ... the Senate Democratic leadership does n't like it when you step away from their agenda of signing off on every one of Bush 's threatened vetoes and take a stand .
Look at the telecom donations and see if you see some familiar names .
Dodd needs our support .
I 've been in contact with his team and they want responses from citizens that they can show his staff as well as others to let them know that we have Dodd 's back to continue this fight .
Please contact Sen .
Dodd or leave a comment on this thread supporting his leadership .
PFAW also has ways you can get involved to fight telecom immunity .
UPDATED : ThinkProgress has White House spokesperson Tony Fratto's hysterical fear mongering designed to corner the Senate into passing the FISA law with the immunity :
“ We ’re exactly three weeks away , ” he said , “ from the date when terrorists can be free to make phone calls without fear of being surveilled by U.S. intelligence agencies ” .
You know this kind of scare tactic is Harry Reid 's Achilles heel , he 's petrified to look soft on " terra " , so your support of Dodd is even more crucial .

For a two - page " exposé " in its upcoming issue , Mad magazine enlisted the talents of 10 Pulitzer Prize - winning cartoonists to illustrate " Why George W. Bush Is in Favor of Global Warming . "
The Dayton Daily News ' Mike Peters , who won a Pulitzer in 1981 , offers his satirical jab at President Bush 's view on climate change .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush was told in August that Iran may have suspended its nuclear weapons program , the White House said on Wednesday , a day after Bush said he was not given a full report on the issue .
A new intelligence estimate released on Monday said Iran had stopped its nuclear weapons program in the fall of 2003 , raising questions about whether the president was aware of that when he increased his rhetoric against Tehran .
Bush for months has called Iran a threat and in October raised the specter of World War Three if it acquired a nuclear weapon .
Some Democrats seized on this week ’s intelligence report to suggest Bush took an aggressive stance against Iran even though he knew that U.S. intelligence had a different picture of the threat posed by Tehran .
During a news conference on Tuesday , Bush said he was informed of the intelligence report last week , but said U.S. intelligence chief Mike McConnell told him in August there was new information on Iran .
“ He did n’t tell me what the information was .
He did tell me it was going to take a while to analyze , ” Bush said .
On Wednesday , White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said McConnell told Bush in August that Iran may have suspended its nuclear weapons program and that the new information might cause the intelligence community to change its assessment on Iran .
McConnell told the president that new information had been obtained on Iran just as the intelligence agencies were about to finalize the report and that they would not be able to meet a congressional deadline for the estimate , she said .
“ He ( McConnell ) said that if the new information turns out to be true , what we thought we knew for sure is right .
Iran does in fact have a covert nuclear weapons program , but it may be suspended , ” Perino said .

McConnell advised the president that it would take more time to vet the information and determine its validity , she said .
She was responding to questions about what the spy chief told Bush in August .
After the new National Intelligence Estimate was released , critics accused Bush of hyping the threat from Iran , and some suggested similarities with the administration ’s much - criticized handling of prewar intelligence on Iraq .
One of the main justifications for the U.S. - led March 2003 invasion of Iraq was that it had weapons of mass destruction , which were never found .
Bush and his administration have for months been trying to increase international pressure on Iran over its nuclear program through more U.N. Security Council sanctions and by ratcheting up the rhetoric .
Washington also accuses Iran of meddling in Iraq , which Tehran denies .
“ It ’s exactly what he did in the run-up to the war in Iraq in consistently exaggerating intelligence suggesting that Iraq had WMD , while failing to tell the American people about intelligence concluding that it did not , ” Sen .
Joseph Biden , a Delaware Democrat and presidential hopeful , said on Tuesday .
Bush said the intelligence report had not changed his mind about Iran .
He emphasized that view on Wednesday with a statement as he arrived for an event in Omaha , Nebraska .
“ It is clear from the latest NIE that the Iranian government has more to explain about its nuclear intentions and past actions , ” Bush said .
“ The Iranians have a strategic choice to make , they can come clean with the international community about the scope of their nuclear activities and fully accept the longstanding offer to suspend their enrichment program and come to the table and negotiate , or they can continue on a path of isolation that is not in the best interest of the Iranian people , ” he said .
Being clever , it seems , is a good way to avoid being eaten .
Predators such as chimpanzees and wild cats tend to hunt small - brained prey that are less able to think their way out of a tight corner .
Robin Dunbar and Susanne Shultz of the University of Liverpool , UK , examined predator and prey relationships in five forest communities , and found that the most important factor determining which prey chimps and cats like to eat was the relative size of its brain ( Biology Letters , DOI : 10.1098/rsbl.2006.0519 ) .
