NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Bank of America said Monday it will pay the U.S. government $ 425 million to end a federal backstop of assets related to its purchase of troubled brokerage Merrill Lynch earlier this year .
The government agreed to guarantee $ 118 billion in assets in January as part of a plan to help BofA absorb Merrill Lynch , which was on the verge of failure .
In exchange , BofA agreed to pay the U.S. a fee of 3.7 % .
On Monday , BofA said it will pay $ 425 million to the Treasury Department , Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to terminate the agreement .
The Charlotte , N.C. - based bank said Monday 's decision was part of a broader effort " to reduce its reliance on government support and return to normal market funding . "
Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) , like many of its peers , received billions of dollars in taxpayer - funded bailouts last year as the financial crisis unfolded .
But the banking industry has regained its footing in recent months , and many big financial institutions are now looking to distance themselves from the government .
" We are a stronger company than we were even a few months ago , " said Kenneth D. Lewis , chief executive officer and president of BofA , in a statement .
Despite continuing challenges from rising credit costs , Lewis said he believes the bank is poised " to emerge from this current economic crisis as one of the leading financial services firms in the world . "
“ I should not believe in a God who does not dance . ” - Friedrich Nietzsche
“ If there is no salsa in heaven , I am not going there !
Hell is right below ”
The metamorphosis of salsa to what is heard and danced in clubs today has been a long , slow , and varied process .
Not one person or place can be attributed as the founder of salsa .
Instead , the dance and music have evolved over time through an elaborate syncretism of different sounds , cultures , and meanings .
“ Son is the most perfect thing for entertaining the soul . ” – Ignacio Piñeiro , founder of Septeto Nacional .
The Cuban Son is a root of most Salsa music today .
The first time that the Clave rhythm was played in public was in the Cuban Son .
After the Slave revolution and later emancipation in La Hispañola , many rich French Caribbean families and their house slaves emigrated to the Oriente province in Cuba from what is now Haiti .
Some of these slaves were educated in music and knew both the European music and the African secular music .
“ Dance is like life , it exists as you ’re flitting through it , and when it ’s over , it ’s done . ” – Jerome Robbins
Around 1917 when the “ Danzon ” was the most popular national dance in Cuba , a new musical style known as the Cuban Son appeared in Havana .
The Son was accepted with such enthusiasm that soon it became very popular without taking anything away from the “ Danzon ” .
The “ Danzon ” , which had been the national dance of Cuba since 1879 , could be found everywhere from the popular dance halls to upper class social clubs .
The Son had the same elements as the “ Danzon ” but was different in its form .
It is due to the Son that the African instruments came to light to animate the orchestras that were prevalent and typical at the time in Havana .
“ Dance is the hidden language of the soul . ” – Martha Graham
Before and around the time of World War II , the music traveled to Mexico City and New York .
It was in New York where the term “ Salsa ” was created .
In fact , the use of the word salsa for danceable Latin Music was coined in 1933 when a Cuban song composer Ignacio Piñerio wrote a song Échale Salsita .
According to the late Alfredo Valdés Sr. the idea occurred to Piñerio after eating food that lacked Cuban spices .
According to Valdés , the word served as a type of protest against bland food .
However , the term did not really take off until the 1960s .
“ Dance is music made visible . ” – George Balanchine
“ This is a real sexy and sensual dance so if you wo n’t be able to focus on the dancing then it ’s not for you . ”
Following the Cuban revolution , the United States ended diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1961 .
This action cut off the flow of music and musicians that had inspired the New York scene for decades .
Four years later , immigration policy changes opened the door to migrations from previously excluded countries .
Along with other demographic shifts , these two events altered the course of the Latin music in ways that defined it even more sharply as a New York phenomenon .
By the late 1960 ’s , the Dominican community had burgeoned , and rhythms such as the Dominican merengue , Colombia cumbia , and Puerto Rican plena and jibaro styles had become part of the New York music scene .
Since salsa has its roots in so many dances and is open to improvisation , salsa styles are very fluid : New York style , Cuban - style salsa ( also called Casino ) , Salsa Rueda ( Rueda de Casino ) , Salsa Filipina ( Ronda Manila ) , Cumbia ( Central and South America ) , Cali and Los Angeles .
Dance styles are associated with their original geographic area that developed that style .
There are often devotees of each of these styles outside of their home territory ( except Cali style ) .
Characteristics that may identify a style include : foot patterns , body rolls and movements , turns and figures , attitude , dance influences , and the way that partners hold each other .
“ Dancing can reveal all the mystery that music conceals . ” – Charles Baudelaire
Let 's try an expression that diverges ( never terminates ) in the untyped lambda calculus :
scala > type x = App [ Lam [ App [ X , X ] ] , Lam [ App [ X , X ] ] ]
#Eval :8 : error : illegal cyclic reference involving type Eval
That 's Scala 2.7.4 .
It figures out that we 're trying to construct an infinite type .
Hurray !
But that also means it 's not Turing - equivalent .
There will be other , legitimate types that it can't check either .
Try the same thing in 2.8 and you get ...
Exception in thread " main " java.lang.StackOverflowError at scala.tools.nsc.symtab.Symbols$Symbol.isPackageClass(Symbols.scala:407 ) at scala.tools.nsc.symtab.Types$Type.isGround(Types.scala:640 ) at scala.tools.nsc.symtab.Types$Type.isGround(Types.scala:640 ) at scala.tools.nsc.symtab.Types$Type.isGround(Types.scala:640 ) at scala.tools.nsc.symtab.Types$Type.isGround(Types.scala:640 ) at scala.tools.nsc.symtab.Types$Type.isGround(Types.scala:638 ) at scala.tools.nsc.symtab.Types$Type$$anonfun$isGround$1.apply( Types.scala:638 ) at scala.tools.nsc.symtab.Types$Type$$anonfun$isGround$1.apply( Types.scala:638 ) at scala.collection.generic.LinearSequenceTemplate$class.forall(LinearSequenceTemplate.scala:97 ) at scala.collection.immutable.List.forall(List.scala:27 )
... which is what you would expect .
So it looks like typechecking in 2.8 has become undecidable in general .
But do n't fret .
You really have to try hard to get this kind of result .
Data types such as the Church numerals and Booleans can be encoded in this calculus .
I might post those a bit later .
Scala rocks .
Which the editorial board of Investors Business Daily obviously is , as they allowed this to be printed on their pages .
People such as scientist Stephen Hawking would n't have a chance in the U.K. , where the National Health Service would say the life of this brilliant man , because of his physical handicaps , is essentially worthless .
Perhaps they do n't have access to the Internets at Investors Business Daily , because even Wikipedia will tell you that Hawking is British , lives in Britain , and has lived to the age of 67 there , and was diagnosed with ALS under , and treated by the National Health Service for his entire adult life .
They must have just been fooled by his voice synthesizer 's American accent .
But just to make this absolutely clear , here 's the man himself :
" I would n't be here today if it were not for the NHS , " he told us .
" I have received a large amount of high - quality treatment without which I would not have survived . "
The lesson is do n't mess with Stephen Hawking .

Xbox , Wii , PlayStation 3 , SexBox ?
An integrated circuit manufacturer appears to be working on the SexBox , a console designed to play AO - rated games .
Silicon Xtal Corporation , located in San Jose California , registered the name SexBox in the US for use with a “ video gaming console comprised of computer hardware with unique controls which plays Adult Only rated ( AO ) video game software titles . ”
Ca n’t get much clearer than that .
The trademark description also explains the device may be used as a gateway to other adult entertainment and massive multiplayer online games .
Wait , massive multiplayer adult games ?
The company behind the proposed device says they worked on the Xbox 360 hardware .
Microsoft probably wo n’t be amused with their choice of name .
Platform holders Microsoft , Nintendo , and Sony have not allowed any AO rated games on their console .
Stores do n’t carry AO games either .
Titles rated Adults
Only by the ESRB , such as the Indigo Prophecy : Director ’s Cut , were sold and distributed online .
The number of AO rated games is few , but there is n’t a device like the SexBox on the market to support them .
Anyway , it does n’t sound like the SexBox is designed to play Indigo Prophecy …
Hilarious picture from , Kotaku .
Graeme Conroy persuaded another child to film the young girl A man has been jailed for 18 months for allowing a three - year - old child to smoke .
Newcastle Crown Court heard that the girl asked Graeme Conroy , 31 , for a cigarette and when she started smoking it she was filmed on a mobile phone .
The court heard that the child had smoked three cigarettes before the filming took place .
Conroy , from Ashington , Northumberland , pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering or injury to health .
Last month magistrates in Gateshead had remanded Conroy , of Blyth Terrace , into custody and committed his case to the crown court after deciding their powers of sentence were insufficient .
Footage discovered During that hearing , they heard that he handed the lit cigarette to the child and encouraged her to inhale it .
Conroy then persuaded another child , aged 14 , to film it on a mobile phone for fun , the court heard .
But it was this that proved to be his undoing when the footage , which was recorded on 24 February , was discovered and he was reported to the police .
His behaviour was irresponsible and he clearly did n't give sufficient thought to what he was doing
Jane Foley , defending
In the footage Conroy can be heard laughing and at one point someone is heard saying : " She 'll smoke it all herself . "
The court heard that when the girl put the cigarette out in an ashtray , she asked for another .
Conroy also told onlookers that the youngster had also smoked cannabis before .
However , tests carried out on the girl 's hair by police proved negative for the drug , the court heard .
Prosecutor Tony Glover said : " The essence of the offence is that he encouraged this child to smoke .
' Endangered ' child " He said he knew it was wrong and knew he should n't have done it . "
Jane Foley , defending , said : " His behaviour was irresponsible and he clearly did n't give sufficient thought to what he was doing , believing it to be a bit of a joke .
" To anyone hearing the circumstances of the offence they would be appalled to hear that a three - year - old girl was permitted to smoke this cigarette . "
Sentencing Conroy , Judge David Wood said : " This sort of conduct could be very damaging to a child 's health and could have all sorts of effects upon her future health .
You have completely disregarded her safety and endangered her . "
After the hearing Det Insp Ron Cruikshanks , of Northumbria Police , described the offence as " an appalling case of ill treatment against a child " .

Market Street Pilot is an Encouraging Move by Mayor Newsom
Though much of the media reaction to Mayor Gavin Newsom ’s Better Market Street Project is narrowly focusing on the traffic impacts of mandatory right - turns at two intersections on Market , the trial project will attempt to do much more to improve the public realm and public perception of San Francisco ’s most iconic street .
" The new and improved Market Street will rival main streets around the world , " said Mayor Newsom .
" With input from the community , and the leadership of the five key agencies , we will identify specific solutions that work best for our main corridor . "
The traffic changes at 8th Street and 6th Street are intended to reduce conflicts between cars , transit , bicycles and pedestrians , and the success of the restrictions will be measured by a stakeholder group that includes the MTA , the San Francisco County Transportation Authority ( TA ) , DPW , the Planning Department , advocates like the SFBC and Walk SF , and business groups like the the Market Street Association , Building Owners and Managers Association ( BOMA ) and the Union Square BID .
By bringing all the groups together , the Mayor ’s office hoped to avoid the pitfalls from previous splintered efforts to improve Market Street .
Kit Hodge , Director of the Great Streets Project for the SFBC , said that some of the more reticent stakeholders concerned about the traffic changes got on board with the project when the Mayor ’s office broadened the scope to include quality - of - life issues .
" What galvanized the stakeholders is the trial approach and the
placemaking approach , which reflects multiple looks on Market Street ,
not just transportation , but seeing the street as a place , " she said .
" There are a number of other things happening beyond traffic changes , including ad hoc plazas on the sidewalks , art in buildings , music along the street . "
Hodge said the Great Streets Project would continue collecting baseline data through next week and then would help the agencies with public feedback .
She encouraged all interested public to use the many options for communicating with project organizers , including the website , 311 , Twitter , and Facebook .
Astrid Haryati , the Mayor ’s Director of Greening , will oversee temporary greening measures along Market in the pilot area , what are being dubbed Greenpods , and will help to expand the lunchtime concert series People in Plazas that coincided with the opening of the Pavement to Parks plazas .
San Francisco County Transportation Authority ( TA ) Senior Transportation Planner Zabe Bent said the holistic approach improving the street was important for garnering support from business groups and advocates .
She said that with their involvement , the planners and transit operators could consider bold long - term improvements , such as Calm the Safety Zones , which would add high - visibility markings to the street and clearer demarcations between transit , pedestrians , cyclists , and vehicles .
" The goal is to make sure that [ we find ] ways to
improve safety for bicyclists and pedestrians . "
Though a Calm the Safety Zone could take many forms , this TA image is an example rendering .
Bent said the MTA already has its half of the necessary funding from Safe Routes to Transit grants for Calm the Safety Zones and that with Board of Supervisor approval , the TA could release Proposition K money for the remainder .
She hoped that the MTA could start laying down the treatments as early as November , but definitely by spring .
As part of the recent Strategic Analysis Report ( SAR ) completed for the Board of Supervisors , Bent explained , they have a placeholder in effect for additional pilots , which she said could mean " refining the existing pilot locations – or identifying additional improvements elsewhere . "
She listed the intersections of 4th St , Sansome , and Battery as locations where stakeholders were concerned about conflicts between vehicles and pedestrians .
A further consideration for the TA and the MTA is the impact the restrictions will have on parallel streets in SOMA , such as traffic calming on Howard and Folsom to protect pedestrians there , depending on what comes of the evaluation process .
Though Bent said there is no guarantee that they would ban cars on Market Street , she said the TA had studied the scenario and could consider fundamental questions of how the street is used if there was a demand for it .
She also said the trial was an important first step before the scheduled repaving of
Market Street in 2013 , when agencies will need to have any significant engineering changes prepared .
" The TEP has identified Market Street as one of the main priorities for improvement .
As TEP implementation moves forward , we could dedicate Prop K funds to restricting autos altogether , changing how automobiles use the lanes , " she said .
Whether or not the approach will fundamentally change Market Street and make it into a grand promenade ( as the Mayor hopes ) could depend on a number of issues bigger than street changes , according to Bent .
" Long - term land use and social services are not going to change in the next six months .
Those are things that need a deeper look among the stakeholders . "
MTA spokesperson Judson
True pointed to the broader issues on Market Street as well , saying the MTA will analyze the impacts of the restrictions on Muni and will use this as an appropriate time to consider the long - term goals for how the street is engineered and how it functions .
" We ’re really excited to be participating in this effort .
The time is right to re-imagine Market Street in its entirety . "
There is now a Photoshop app for the iPhone / iPod Touch and it ’s called …
Photoshop.com Mobile .
The best part ?
It ’s free !
Free Photoshop ??
For the iPhone ??
Well , do n’t go expecting a full version of Photoshop on your iPhone , it ’s a relatively limited and simple image editor , but for quick photo edits on the go , it works just fine and has a nice clean interface .
I imagine over time the functionality will increase and I would n’t be surprised if there was a feature rich paid option either , but until then here ’s what you ’ll get with the free iPhone version of Photoshop Mobile :
Image editing features of iPhone Photoshop include :
* Crop , Rotate , Flip
* Adjust Exposure , Saturation , Tint , Black & White
* Simple Filters including Sketch & Soft Focus
* Effects include : Vibrant , Pop ( Andy Warhol style ) , Border , Vignette Blur , Warm Vintage , Rainbow , White Glow , Soft Black & White
There are some additional publishing features so that you can easily share and upload images to Photoshop.com after you have signed up for an account , but you ’ll need to sign up for that login outside of the app itself which is kind of annoying .
Instead of signing up for yet another photo sharing service , I ’ll just stick to saving images to my iPhone Photo Gallery so I can share them myself via Flickr or Facebook .
I ’ve been playing around with Photoshop on my iPhone 3G and it ’s not the quickest app in the world ( a friend with an iPhone 3GS reports it ’s a lot faster on the 3GS model ) but it definitely does what it advertises , and it ’s more than adequate for the simple functions it includes .
It ’s definitely nice to finally have Photoshop on the iPhone , although I ’m not sure if this app warrants the “ Adobe Photoshop ” name , but it ’s certainly a step in the right direction !

The first chapter of the official Dragon Age flash game has been released , and it's way deeper than anticipated .
The Dragon Age franchise just keeps getting better and better , and its flagship entry Dragon Age : Origins has n't even been released yet .
Dragon Age Journeys : The Deep Roads , a free flash game that tells the story of the underground dwarven kingdom of Orzammar , is now available to play and is a much more absorbing experience than I thought it'd be .
The game sounded tempting when it was first announced , but after playing it for an hour or so I 'm already hooked .
The Deep Roads is the first of three currently planned chapters , though it is divided up into five sections itself .
After well over an hour of playtime , I 've beaten the second section and recruited two party members .
Upon starting the game , you create a character just like in Dragon Age : Origins , either a warrior , rogue , or mage , and then customize his / her looks and , later , abilities .
Movement is similar to Diablo , with players clicking the mouse to traverse each area while collecting loot and items , but the enemies are static and only attack when approached .
When you get close to an enemy , the game switches to a tactical battle screen that is exactly like Heroes of Might and Magic's .
Battles have been pretty fun so far , with each enemy having its own unique abilities , including ranged attacks , trap setting , or the possibility to go berserk .
Your own characters have statistics , spells , and their unique abilities as well , just like they do in Dragon Age : Origins , along with weapons , armor , potions , and other items to equip and use .
The whole experience feels very deep and is definitely worthwhile as an appetizer for Dragon Age : Origins .
In addition , players can unlock three items in Dragon Age : Origins by completing certain tasks in The Deep Roads .
Completing a quest unlocks an item that boosts elemental resistance in Origins , answering three surveys about Dragon Age Journeys ( that become available while playing ) will impart an item that raises elemental damage , and aqcuiring all five of The Deep Roads ' achievements will unlock the Helm of the Deep ( + 2 constitution , +10 mental resistance , +10 physical resistance ) .
When these tasks are completed , the items are deposited into your EA account and unlocked later in Dragon Age : Origins once purchased .
To learn more check out the BioWare Blog or just play Dragon Age Journeys at http://www.dragonagejourneys.com.
This is definitely a must play for anyone into RPGs like Diablo or Heroes of Might and Magic , or just Dragon Age fans that have an unquenchable thirst for anything they can get .
Dragon Age : Origins itself is coming to North America on the PC and Xbox 360 on November 3 ( in Europe on November 6 ) , and to the PlayStation 3 on November 17 ( in Europe on November 20 ) .
UPDATE : BioWare just revealed that the PS3 version of Dragon Age : Origins will also be released in North America on November 3 .

Roland S. Martin says health care reform may fall victim to disunity among Democrats .
( CNN ) -- Democratic members of Congress , party strategists , and even President Obama have tried their best to portray Republicans as obstructionists to health care reform , and want us to believe that if the effort fails , it 's all because of the GOP .
That 's bull .
The failure to pass health care reform would be a yoke around the Democrats ' neck , and the cause of losing the moment would be their inability to achieve unity among themselves .
Democrats have the perfect political hat trick .
They control the White House , the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House , with a strong majority in both houses .
But I 'm reminded of something Rep. John Conyers , D - Michigan , told me nine years ago : Democrats know nothing about party unity .
Conyers was being interviewed for an election special I was working on for a now - defunct black cable network , and he said that if Democrats had a majority of the votes in the House , they had a unified group of only about 165 .
That 's because when you throw in the 50 - something Blue Dog Democrats -- strongly conservative members whom some party loyalists liken to Republicans in Democrat clothing -- then you have a different kind of dynamic than you do in the GOP , where the strong base of conservatives typically stays in line .
Then , of course , you have the far - left members , loud and noisy , and oftentimes unwilling to compromise their positions in order to move legislation forward .
When you put the far left and the far right of the Democratic Party in one room , you will see fireworks that rival a Democratic - Republican fight .
And that 's exactly what we are seeing on health care reform .
All summer , the conversation has been dominated by the White House trying to placate conservative Republicans and Blue Dog Democrats on the various health care bills that the House and Senate are considering .
Both groups are adamantly opposed to growing the federal government , and with a rising deficit , the last thing they want is another $ 1 trillion program .
( Although most did n't mind the $ 1 trillion we spent on the useless war in Iraq -- but I digress . )
Obama administration officials thought they had the liberal and progressive wing of the party in their pockets and set their sights on satisfying conservatives in both parties .
But over the weekend , Obama and Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius totally botched the deal by giving the impression that the public option was n't a major goal .
That sent the progressives / liberals nuts , and now the White House is trying to put the genie back into the bottle .
The progressive / liberals are angry because they believe they have given up way too much in this health care bill , with nothing to show for it in terms of Republican and Blue Dog Democrat support .
Yet what no one wants to mention is that many of them are still seething over having to accept massive cuts in the stimulus bill by Republicans and Blue Dog Democrats in order for that to pass .
Obama implored them to support the changed bill for the good of the country , and they bit their lip and sucked it up .
That day is over .
In many ways , the Democratic Party is too democratic .
It includes so many special interests that it's hard to achieve major consensus without having to satisfy everyone .
Republicans ?
They have a simpler base and have always found it easy to drive an agenda .
President Obama is desperate to toe the line on achieving bipartisanship with this health bill .
He wants as many Republican votes as he can get , but he 's not making considerable headway in that area .
Maybe he has a shot at upwards of 10 votes in the Senate , but you can forget the House .
Now , because of the public option mess , he is going to have to shore up his progressive / liberal base .
But those people are now emboldened and unwilling to cede more ground .
So the time the president wanted to spend on wooing conservatives will have to be spent on keeping his angry progressive / liberal wing intact .
Democrats have floated the idea of going it alone and passing health care reform .
Some have said the president will pay a big price among independent voters if he does that .
Well , tough .
If health care was his first priority to getting elected , that should remain the case .
Damn the 2010 midterm elections , and damn the 2012 presidential elections .
Congress has been trying for more than six decades to achieve health care reform , and the Democrats have all the stars lined up to do so .
Of course , even with their large majority , it wo n't be a cakewalk getting a bill passed in the Senate .
If it does n't happen now , I do n't want to hear any carping from the left .
Your own party had a shot and screwed it up .
Democrats , you will have no one to blame but yourselves .
It 's now or never .
So stop whining about the Republicans and get your own house in order .

Of all the thoughts that flashed through my mind as I fell from 15ft up a ladder one morning last May , the potential financial cost of my unexpected descent was not one .
I had been trying to paint the weatherboard above the bedroom windows of our house ; a whim that had occurred to me in the middle of the night ( as these things do ) while working out chores for my week 's holiday .
Unfortunately , I reached just a little too far on a ladder just a little too short , and suddenly felt it slide from under me .
Bouncing off the wall , knocking off the guttering and a carriage lamp in the process , I eventually collapsed in an inelegant heap on top of the ladder .
In the agonising hour that followed before our next - door neighbour arrived home and found me whimpering piteously for help , left leg utterly unresponsive , I had time to think of many things – including how stupid I 'd been – but never the implications of my future treatment .
This was Britain , after all .
I would , without question , query or censure , be treated by the NHS at no cost to myself .
Not so , perhaps , had I bounced off the front of my parents - in - law 's house in Houston , Texas .
They are in their early 80s , expatriates from Britain for more than 50 years , and have followed my medical care with what I now realise is more than solicitous interest , thanks to the vitriolic US healthcare debate of recent weeks and the slagging - off that British medicine has received as a result ( why do Americans always home in on the state of our teeth ? ) .
When we spoke last weekend , my mother - in - law , Sheila Thurau , had just received a letter telling her there was only $ 945 ( £ 570 ) left to spend on treatment for her this year , under the US government 's Medicare scheme for over 65s .
As her current bill for the sort of medication 82 - year - olds need – blood pressure tablets and the like – comes , so the letter informed her , to $ 262 a month , it will be a close - run thing whether she emerges in credit .
Essentially , the state funds the first $ 2,700 each of the annual cost of their medications and treatment .
Beyond that , they pay the rest up to a limit of $ 4,020 , after which they qualify for what is called catastrophic coverage , where the state picks up the extra costs .
Of course , if they were younger they would have to be paying medical insurance – the average annual cost of a family policy tops $ 12,000 .
Without it , as they discovered from their doctor in Houston , an accident like mine might leave you facing life - changing bills upwards of $ 75,000 .
Back here , once my neighbour had raised the alarm , not one but two ambulance crews arrived within minutes .
I thought I 'd only dislocated my knee but they knew better .
I 'd shattered my tibia , a plateau fracture that left fragments of bone floating about aimlessly in my leg .
They have n't shown me the x-rays yet , but my wife says they 're quite spectacular ( one of my doctors said it was the best break they 'd seen at the hospital for at least three weeks ) .
The ambulance crews turned up at my bedside at the end of their shifts out of professional interest .
Ah , they said sympathetically , they 'd known it was a break , but had n't liked to tell me .
Since then , at our nearest accident and emergency hospital , the Kent and Sussex in Tunbridge Wells , I 've had the services of consultant orthopaedic surgeons , anaesthetists , doctors , nurses , ambulance crews , physiotherapists , x-ray staff , porters and even chaplains .
Until last week , for 14 weeks , my leg was encased in a complicated and sophisticated exterior framework with metal pins and wires binding the bones back together .
Now it is just bandaged from knee to ankle and bound in splints .
I hop about on hospital crutches and a zimmer frame and an ambulance calls when I need a hospital appointment .
I have so far spent three weeks in hospital , had four operations under general anaesthetic , daily home visits from district nurses and face weeks , if not months , of more care .
Yet I have never been asked for my credit card or insurance documents before treatment , as I was the only time I fell ill while visiting the in - laws in the US .
No one has murmured that this treatment or that service might be a little on the expensive side , or will incur a delay .
And no one – despite what conservative Republicans allege – has yet questioned whether my life is still worth living , or whether amputation would be cheaper .
I can't tell what my treatment has cost the NHS , but I have some idea what it might have been in the US thanks to the in - laws ' doctor , who gave an estimate based on prices in Houston .
The figures are eye - watering .
She reckons : $ 12,000 per operation ; up to $ 3,500 for anaesthetics each time ; hospital at $ 500 a day and ambulance $ 300 a trip .
That 's not counting the cost of medicine .
It adds up to more than $ 76,000 , or at least £ 47,000 .
We 'd have had to sell the house I was so rashly attempting to paint .
I am , understandably , profoundly grateful to the NHS .
As it happens , during my 55 years I have had more than my money 's worth out of it .
I have been an insulin - dependent diabetic for 22 years , and in recent times have needed treatment for a range of other sundry ailments : frozen shoulders , kidney stones and retinopathy in the eye .
My pre-existing medical conditions would give American healthcare schemes a coronary .
Of course , in the US I 'd probably have had medical insurance ( though more than 40 million Americans do n't ) but mine would almost certainly have cost more than the $ 12,000 national average .
Perhaps
I 'd have been in a company health scheme , but employers are cutting back on those too , limiting cover and restricting availability to new staff ( hence affecting employees ' ability to change jobs ) .
In Britain , only once have I gone private , after I was told there was a nine - month wait to use the new , multimillion - pound NHS - provided MRI scanner at the hospital to investigate my aching shoulder .
Such was the pain and inconvenience , I invoked my membership of the Guardian 's company scheme and was booked in for an appointment – same scanner , same specialist , same hospital , same treatment – within the week .
I felt rather ashamed .
To be fair , the Kent and Sussex would not be everyone 's first choice of hospital .
Built in the 1920s in art - deco style and opened by the young Queen Mum while she was still Duchess of York , its dated charms are fading .
Round the back it degenerates into a clutter of modern buildings and converted huts .
Much worse , it is part of the NHS trust where more than 90 patients died in C difficile outbreaks between 2004 and 2006 , after revelations that conditions in parts of the trust 's hospitals were scandalously filthy .
But that 's not true any more .
My treatment has been exemplary and the shortcomings have been administrative , as far as I can tell , rather than medical .
I could have done with more information from the doctors about my condition , but I guess a slightly patronising manner comes with the job and , if you must fall unnecessarily off a ladder , perhaps dimness is taken for granted .
The orthopaedic wards are still crowded and mixed , unlike in the US ; few beds are left empty for more than a couple of hours , even in the middle of the night .
" It 's very seasonal in here , " a nurse told me .
" In winter we get little old ladies who have fallen over on the ice .
And this time of year , it 's middle - aged blokes like you who 've fallen off ladders . "
Sometimes my ward was full of men and sometimes elderly women , not always segregated even on opposite sides of the ward .
A senile , elderly man would constantly call out " Help , help , help " night and day , interspersed with even more desperate cries of " Wee , wee , wee " , and kept uncovering himself as he tried to get out of his bed a few feet from an equally elderly female patient .
" Cover yourself , Henry , " the staff would cry cheerily as they passed .
" You 'll excite the old ladies and just make the men jealous ! "
His wife sat desolately by his bed most afternoons , telling him not to be a naughty boy .
The not unexpected news that a recovery was unlikely was broken to her in front of the rest of us by a junior doctor .
" We 've been married 55 years , " the old lady said sadly .
The scene made voyeurs of us all .
Every ward I was on seemed to have a Henry , shouting through the night .
That would have been different in the US , where the norm is for single or , at worst , double - bedded rooms .
A nurse said to me : " We wanted to put Henry in an isolation room , but unfortunately we needed it for swine flu . "
More alarming was the hospital 's reliance – I am sure it is not alone here – on agency nursing staff to cover shift shortages , some of them clearly deficient in English and in training .
I watched one evening as the ward sister attempted to explain to one that she wanted him to fetch something .
He stood at the end of my bed , murmuring " fetch ? fetch ? " – clearly not having the faintest idea what he was being asked to do .
The sister went and did the job herself .
On another occasion , I handed an agency nurse my full urine bottle – few things are hidden in hospital – and she looked around , wondering what to do with it , before spotting the basin where staff wash their hands and pouring the contents down the plughole .
When I told a staff nurse what she 'd done , he turned white and rushed away to get some bleach .
" I would n't mind if the agency staff had any qualifications , but we have to take them on trust , " a ward sister told me .
" We just do n't know when the agency cover turns up what they can do .
I find it 's best to treat them as if they know nothing and then I wo n't be disappointed . "
Later that night , I spotted the same sister telling the agency nurse that she could n't sign her timesheet because it said she had done two hours more than she had .
A ward orderly said : " It would n't be so bad but , because they 're agency , they are paid twice as much as we are .
It does cause resentment , especially when we have to do their jobs as well as our own . "
The hospital 's wards were staffed , even in deepest , bluest Kent , with a united nations of regular nursing staff .
Filipinos , Indians , Africans , Portuguese , Brazilians , Italians , New Zealanders , eastern Europeans : the NHS would collapse without them .
The Polish and Czech nurses brought an air of exoticism with them and a wistfulness too , as they crowded round the ward television set – the only time it was on – to watch the Eurovision song contest .
They were , almost without exception , brilliant and dedicated .
As I apologised to one young Polish nurse for some imposition , she replied , smiling : " I do n't mind .
You remind me of my Dad , " which may not have been entirely good for my self - esteem , but did lift my morale .
Another , inspecting the web of wires connecting the metal frame to my leg , said wonderingly : " I think that 's really cool .
When you see those , you know it 's a really good break . "
If this seems like the familiar picture of the NHS groaning under the strain , then there 's something else too .
On the outskirts of town , on the site of the old Victorian Tonbridge workhouse that has for many years been a maternity hospital , a new £ 225 m PFI hospital – one of those controversial private finance initiatives where private money funds public provision – is finally arising to replace the Kent and Sussex .
A forest of cranes crowds across the landscape , the site is lit up at night and , a year after work started , the framework is in place .
In two years ' time it will be open , with every one of its 500 patients in individual rooms , not wards , just like in the US .
It will be state - of - the - art .
I should have waited two more years to fall off my ladder .
Back in Houston , my parents - in - law are ruminating on the cost of their healthcare , at the complexities even of the state - provided Medicare system .
The talk among the oldsters on their estate is how much you have to pay for drugs or operations , and whether it is cheaper to buy medication in Canada .
Some of their friends are struggling to find $ 185 a month to pay for a drug that delays the onset of Alzheimer's .
My in - laws ' fear – and ours – is what , God forbid , will happen if they need surgery , or even a short - term hospital stay .
They fear the cost of unexpected illness .
Sheila recently had to haggle with local dentists over the cost of capping one tooth : her usual dentist wanted $ 500 but she found another , rougher , practitioner who charged $ 300 .
Her basic hearing aid cost her nearly $ 1,400 – a deluxe model would have been twice as much .
Much as my own grandparents in England feared ending up in the workhouse , my in - laws fear falling into the state - provided Medicaid system ( one step down from Medicare ) , for which you need to be destitute to qualify .
Father - in - law Vern says 60 % of US bankruptcies are triggered by medical costs .
" No one who has been through illness in this country worries about socialised medicine , " he says .
" We know there is a lot of money and vested interests in play , lots of fire and smoke .
" They are so ignorant about the NHS .
It does n't help when this idiot from the Conservative party comes over and talks down the service and gets lots of publicity .
What sort of kick is he on ? "
I do n't like to tell him that Daniel Hannan is one of our local MEPs .
" To our knowledge , he 's never visited one of our hospitals , " says a trust spokesman .
But then , of course , health is beyond his remit .
Some names have been changed .
Two bombers kill four people and injure many more on campus of International Islamic University , on outskirts of Pakistani capital
Two suicide bombers have killed four people and injured 18 others at a university in Islamabad , the Pakistani interior ministry said today .
The attackers detonated explosives almost simultaneously at around 3 pm local time on the campus of the International Islamic University , on the outskirts of the Pakistani capital .
They A string of attacks by the Taliban has shocked the country in the past two weeks .
No one has yet claimed responsibility for today 's blasts , but the university 's president , Dr Anwar Hussain Siddiqui , pointed the finger at the door of the Taliban , currently the target of a huge army operation in the lawless region of South Waziristan , on the Afghan border .
" It seems that [ militant ] sympathisers or collaborators are doing this to divert attention from the military operation , " Siddiqui said .
" They are trying to create panic in the capital city . "
The interior minister , Rehman Malik , said whether or not there had been a claim of responsibility , " all roads lead to South Waziristan " .
" We are in a state of war , " he said .
" They will make every effort to destabilise the country .
These so - called Islamists are enemies of Islam and enemies of Pakistan . "
The attackers struck in a women 's cafeteria and at the Islamic law department .
Witnesses told Dawn News there were between 3,000 and 4,000 students on the campus at the time .
Television footage showed a woman with a bloodied left leg being carried on a stretcher , and a redbrick building with shattered windows .
Geo News reported that one female student was among the dead .
It said a suspect had been arrested near the campus .
The university has more than 18,000 students , nearly half of whom are women .
Many of the students come from abroad , including around 700 from China .
It is a seat of Islamic learning , but most of the students take secular subjects such as management science or computer studies , Siddiqui said .
Foreign students were among the injured , according to Dawn News .
Zulkifli , a student from Indonesia attending the university , said he had seen two bodies being taken from a building on the campus .
Security at educational establishments had been tightened in response to the recent campaign of violence by militants who want to overthrow the state .
Many schools and universities had closed in the wake of the threat posed by the Taliban .
Pakistani forces launched an offensive on Saturday to drive out the Taliban from their bases in the lawless region of South Waziristan .
In the run-up to the offensive , militants attacked a police station in Peshawar , a United Nations office , the army headquarters in Rawalpindi and three different police facilities in Lahore on the same day .
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) -- Former President Jimmy Carter reiterated Wednesday that he believes racism is an issue for President Obama in trying to lead the country .
In Atlanta , Georgia , on Wednesday , Jimmy Carter again linked harsh Obama criticism to racism .
" When a radical fringe element of demonstrators and others begin to attack the president of the United States as an animal or as a reincarnation of Adolf Hitler or when they wave signs in the air that said we should have buried Obama with Kennedy , those kinds of things are beyond the bounds , " the Democrat who served from 1977 - 1981 told students at Emory University .
" I think people who are guilty of that kind of personal attack against Obama have been influenced to a major degree by a belief that he should not be president because he happens to be African American .
" It 's a racist attitude , and my hope is and my expectation is that in the future both Democratic leaders and Republican leaders will take the initiative in condemning that kind of unprecedented attack on the president of the United States , " Carter said .
Watch Carter speak at Emory »
Carter 's comments came a day after he said racial politics played a role in South Carolina Rep .
Joe Wilson 's outburst during Obama 's speech to Congress last week and in some of the opposition the president has faced since taking office .
" I think an overwhelming portion of the intensely demonstrated animosity toward President Barack Obama is based on the fact that he is a black man , that he 's African - American , " Carter told " NBC Nightly News . "
" I live in the South , and I 've seen the South come a long way , and I 've seen the rest of the country that shares the South 's attitude toward minority groups at that time , particularly African - Americans . "
Michael Steele , the first African - American to chair the Republican National Committee , denied Wednesday that race is fueling protests .
Watch Lou Dobbs ' guests debate the issue »
" President Carter is flat - out wrong , " Steele said in a statement .
" This is n't about race .
It is about policy . "
The House voted Tuesday to formally disapprove of Wilson 's behavior during the joint session of Congress .
The resolution was approved largely along party lines , with Republicans calling the measure unnecessary partisan politics .
Wilson apologized to the White House last week , but congressional Democrats said he owed the chamber a similar statement of regret .
Steele said Democrats are just trying to divert attention from what he called the president 's " wildly unpopular government - run health care plan . "
Actor and comedian Bill Cosby , who is black , said Wednesday in a written statement that he agrees with Carter .
" During President Obama 's speech on the status of health care reform , some members of Congress engaged in a public display of disrespect , " he said .
Watch Carter link animosity toward Obama to racism »
" While one representative hurled the now infamous ' you lie ' insult at the president , others made their lack of interest known by exhibiting rude behavior such as deliberately yawning and sending text messages . "
Carter 's comments on racism came during his 28th annual town hall meeting at Emory , where he has been a professor since 1982 .
He spoke an a variety of issues .
Carter criticized former President George W. Bush for his handling of North Korea , whose then - leader Kim Il Sung had persuaded by Carter to abandon his nuclear ambitions and allow international inspectors into the country .
" Unfortunately , when President George W. Bush came into office , he threw away all of those agreements ... and declared that North Korea was one of the ' axis - of - evil ' " nations , Carter said .
That led the current North Korean president , Kim Jong
Il , to order the reprocessing of the nation 's spent nuclear fuel rods , to expel the inspectors and to explode two nuclear devices , destabilizing the region , Carter said .
The former president said top U.S. officials should consider acceding to North Korea 's requests by negotiating directly with its leaders , guaranteeing not to launch an attack against the country and , over a period of time , establishing full diplomatic relations .
" I do n't see why we should n't , " he said .
" That 's the only thing that can keep North Korea from continuing with their reprocessing of fuel . "
But Carter predicted Bush would do well as a former president .
" I suspect he is going to fulfill his destiny in a very admirable way , " the Sunday School teacher from Plains , Georgia , said .
Asked what he would do if he were allowed to return to office for a single day , the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize winner said : " Bring peace to Israel and its neighbors . "
He predicted that global warming will occupy much of Obama 's time once a health plan is passed and said the United States needs to wean itself from its dependence on imported oil .
Carter noted that when he became president in 1977 , the nation was importing 8.6 million barrels of oil per day .
By 1982 , that number had been halved to 4.3 million .
" Now , it 's 13 million barrels per day , and we 're heavily dependent , as you know , on imported oil from some countries that do n't really care about our own well - being . "
Carter cited Egyptian President Anwar Sadat as the most interesting person he met during his presidency .
He praised Sadat for allying with him in 1979 to forge a peace treaty with Israel .
Carter blamed " political problems " for his inability to overhaul the nation 's health care system in 1979 so that all 15 million Americans then without health insurance would have gotten coverage .
That number has tripled in the intervening years .
He also said he opposes sex -ed programs in the nation 's public schools that teach abstinence only , saying such programs only increase the number of abortions and unwanted children .
The 84 - year - old former politician said the best moment of his life -- so far -- was when Rosalynn Smith told him 63 years ago that she would marry him .
The former president also took a swipe at rapper Kanye West 's behavior on Sunday , when he jumped onstage during the MTV Video Music Awards and took the microphone from country singer Taylor Swift during her would - be acceptance speech for the Best Female Video .
West declared that Beyonce Knowles should have won .
" I thought it was completely uncalled for and his punishment was to appear on the new Jay Leno show , " Carter said .
His reference to West 's television appearance as punishment was tongue - in - cheek , since the musician had been booked on the show long before the incident took place .
On Monday , West appeared on the debut of Leno's 10 p.m. show and said he knew his actions were wrong .
Swift said on Tuesday that West had called her directly and apologized .
All About Jimmy Carter • Barack Obama • Racism and Bigotry
I ca n’t think of anyone who does n’t want to significantly improve their life .
The good news is : Every moment is an opportunity to become better than we ’ve been in the past .
This is a brief article on how to improve your life starting today .
I challenge you to take action on each of these items ; they will change your life if you do .
1. Become an Eclectic Reader
An eclectic reader is a reader who reads information from a variety of sources .
Reading daily from a variety of authors with different backgrounds and beliefs is an excellent way to expand your mind and change your life .
It ’s not necessary that you agree with “ everything ” the authors say ; you can learn something from anyone .
Reading from a multiplicity of sources gives you the ability to take - on new concepts , thoughts , and principles that stretch your mind to greater dimensions and new perspectives , allowing you to receive ideas which have “ never ” been conceived before .
You should n’t just listen to people who you “ agree ” with ; listen to individuals with unorthodox concepts and view points that you may oppose .
There ’s a quote that goes , “ If everybody ’s thinking the same , then somebody ’s not thinking . ”
Do n’t get caught up in “ group thinking , ” where your thoughts only mimic that of the greater population .
Use reading as a tool to give you deeper insights so you can form more accurate conclusions .
How many books or articles are you reading a day ?
As many of you may know , reading is something that I love to do .
I ’m reading all the time ; the information that I read comes from such a unique variety of authors that it would be very unlikely for someone to “ in - take ” this same combination of information .
This rare combination of information provides me with new concepts which have never been thought of before .
2. Meditate and / or Schedule Quiet Time
When I say meditate , I ’m talking about taking 5 - 10 minutes , maybe more , to silence your mind , using this time as a form of relaxation and renewal .
You may choose to utilize this time as a way of quietly focusing your mind on the images that you want to experience .
You may choose to utilize this time as a way of opening your mind to new ideas that will improve your life or solve certain problems that you ’re encountering .
Your mind is always so busy ; take a few minutes everyday to give it a much needed refresher .
“ Time - out ” is always better than “ burn - out . ” Schedule “ time - out ” daily , if you do , you will be healthier , happier and you will have many more creative ideas to improve your circumstances and your life .
3. Start Working Out , or Increase Your Workouts
Are you giving your best efforts to your workouts ?
I could personally do more , I work out six days a week , but I know I ’m capable of seven .
Are you giving your best ?
Working out improves your life ’s expectancy , overall health , the way you look , and the way you feel about yourself .
Why would anyone not do it ?
If you ’re not working out , get started today ; try to do at least 4 - 5 days a week , even if it ’s only for a few minutes , learn to cultivate the joy of working out .
Do n’t go around saying “ I hate working out , ” because you will begin to hate it .
Affirm that you “ love to work out , ” and you will begin to love it .
4. Spend Quality Time With The People Who Mean The Most To You
Friends and family are truly an avenue which can create lots of joy in your life .
Take time to really experience and appreciate the joy of being around the people who mean the most to you .
I ’m talking about daily pre-scheduled quality time , no cell phones , no computers , no distractions , no thoughts of being anywhere else , or doing anything other than experiencing and appreciating the people who mean the most to you .
Learn from them , teach them , laugh with them , discuss deep issues , and just “ shoot the breeze . ”
What ’s your story ?
Who can you spend more time with ?
And do n’t say your “ poker buddies . ”
Maybe it ’s your kid , maybe it ’s your wife or husband , maybe it ’s your nieces and nephews .
Let people know how much you admire and appreciate them by giving them the price - less gift of your time .
5. Enhance Your Diet
The saying is true , “ You are what you eat . ”
The only source your body has to re-create itself is the food that you give it , so do n’t give it junk .
Do you realize that diseases can be caused as a result of poor movement of food through your body ?
Are you getting 100 % of the fiber your body needs ?
Are you drinking enough water ?
Do you have a written diet plan ?
Are you receiving a large portion of your calories from fruits and vegetables ?
I challenge you to do so , if you are n’t .
In concluding , make sure that you observe and implement these ideas today .
You have the power to improve your life forever , starting right now .

Brown Widows live primarily in the south .

Here it is , all shriveled up in a ball .
I thought that it was dead .
I thought to myself , " would n't it be funny if it somehow bit me from beyond the grave ? "
I placed the shriveled spider on its belly and began to try to spread its legs in order to get a good pose for a photo , when WHAM , it sprung to life !
I was absolutely shocked .
It had remained in ball form for over four hours , after I had manhandled it with a pair of pliers .
I was certain that it was dead , but no , it was fully alive and in perfect condition !
I swept it back into the plastic container .
At first I just threw a few bugs in there for it to eat .
It was very interesting .
It would approach a large ant , for instance , and then turn around at the last second and start to throw webbing over the ant with its back two legs alone .
Thus , it could catch and incapacitate bugs without any web .
It could catch them on the ground , by throwing out webbing with its hind feet .
Very interesting .
I finally added some debris into the container , and it promptly spun a web .
The web is just a sloppy bunch of haphazard strands .
However , it gets the job done .
It 's always interesting to watch spiders move on the web .
The web looks like a mess to me , but the spider navigates it just fine .
The spider was a real pig .
I gave it way too much food , and it ate it all .
I once gave it five large flies in one day .
I also gave it large game , such as dragonflies .
Here we see it feeding on the tail of a huge dragonfly .
Notice how fat the spider has become .
It almost looks bloated .
Over the course of time , the spider grew darker and darker .
I could leave it with no food for weeks , and it was fine .
I had trouble getting good photographs , because I had to take the photos through the plastic , with no manual focus on my camera .
Every time I opened the lid , the spider ran for cover and hid .
Here we see the spider hanging over the body of a luber grasshopper .
Like I said , I gave it large meals .
By now , the spider is even darker than in this photo , and almost fully black .
It is not the slick , dark , complete black of a Black Widow , but it 's fairly close .
I do n't know anything about keeping spiders as pets , but it 's pretty easy to keep alive , and does n't seem to require much .
I 'm not really into spiders , but there 's something about the power the spider has , the ability to produce such a painful bite , I suppose , that makes it appealing .
In my job , I deal with wildlife all the time , so I know enough to be cautious around dangerous animals .
The Brown Widow , however , is easy , because it 's so timid .
That 's why it curled into a ball for hours in the first place .
Like most animals , it is misunderstood , and chooses flight before fight .
This spider would never actively seek out or attack a person or pet .
New photo .
Even blacker .
The hourglass remains orange , whereas the Black Widow has a red hourglass marking .
New photo .
I wonder why the color has darkened like this .
It looks pretty close to the Black Widow .
After two months in captivity , it spun this egg sac .
The Brown Widow 's egg sac is unique in that it features bumps or spikes .
The spider became noticeably thinner as a result .

I 've received probably over 100 emails about Brown Widow Spiders as a result of this web page .
I 'm posting the one below , with a few photos :
Hi , I 'm from southern CA and happened on your site .
I 've become interested a bit in the brown widows and how their life cycle .
I 've been watching and photographing them in my yard over the last month or so .
This has led to several questions and theories which your site did a good job of providing information about .
One issue that I 've been wondering about the enormous range of coloring that I 've seen .
They get so black that I 'm not sure whether the blackest ones are brown or black widows .
I 've been looking at one large spider in particular trying to figure out if it is a black widow for sure or not .
Its hour glass is split significantly and it is significantly asymmetrical with one section almost non-existent .
Based on what you said it sounds like it is a black widow .
The fact that the hour glass is red and not orangey red might be an indicator .
Also something that you did n't mention was the yellow stripe on the head side of the hour glass that seems to always be on brown widows ( although it is less prominent on some ) .
Maybe the lack of that is also a strong sign that the spider in question is a black widow .
It is easily the largest spider in the my yard that I 've been keeping track of and maybe that 's another sign that it 's a black widow .
I also had been wondering whether the brown widows darken with age or there are different color variations .
I 've been watching a fairly small black one and that , I thought , shot down my theory that they just darkened with age .
It seemed like if it was small it must be young .
But I had n't thought about the idea that they might shrink after they had laid their eggs .
Maybe that 's the reason this spider was small .
I notice that I haven's seen any males near the small black colored brown widow .
One thought I 've had is that the striking pattern that the brown widows have is some kind of sexual attractor and the pattern fades away after the spider has mated .
Another interesting thing to me is just how many of these things there are around here .
I 'm 59 and I 've lived in Southern , CA most of my life and in that time I 'd see a black widow every now and then , but I just do n't remember these brown widows but on the other hand I was n't looking for them either .
But I 've seen many black widow egg cases in that time and before fairly recently I had never seen a brown widow egg case .
Right now they seem to be much more common than black widows .
I 've taken a walk around my neighborhood looking for these things and I could fine a brown widow on average about every ten feet or so along the sidewalk when the side wall had some sore of wall next to it .
Anyway , thanks for your site .
Oh and congratulations on your courage on keeping these things in captivity .
I thought about doing that but it seemed a little too dangerous .
Below are four of his photos :
I have friends in these areas : Phoenix | Houston | Denver | Boca Raton Exterminator | Fort Lauderdale | Palm Beach Exterminator | Tampa Animal Control
I was very surprised to notice a widow spider perched in a web spun under the tiny ledge below my storage room door in Orlando , FL .
I had never seen one in my life .
My house is usually completely bug - free and spider free , so I was surprised to see one of the few actual dangerous spiders in my home .
At that time , I knew only of the Black Widow , but this spider was clearly not black .
However , it had the shape of a widow spider , and the infamous red ( well , orange really ) hourglass .
I did some research , and found that there 's a few kinds of widow spiders out there , four different ones in Florida , including the Southern Black Widow , Northern Black Widow , Red Widow , and the Brown Widow .
The venom of all of these spiders is highly toxic and painful to humans ( though not generally lethal ) .
The research indicates that the Black Widow Spider bite is the worst .
However , the Brown Widow bite can be pretty bad , so I was careful .
I picked it up with a pair of pliers and dropped it in a plastic container .
It completely shriveled up and stayed that way for many hours .
I was certain that I had killed it with the pliers , and dumped it out onto some white paper to take a photo .

I placed the shriveled spider on its belly and began to try to spread its legs in order to get a good pose for a photo , when WHAM , it sprung to life !
I was absolutely shocked .
It had remained in ball form for over four hours , after I had manhandled it with a pair of pliers .
I was certain that it was dead , but no , it was fully alive and in perfect condition !
I swept it back into the plastic container .
At first I just threw a few bugs in there for it to eat .
It was very interesting .
It would approach a large ant , for instance , and then turn around at the last second and start to throw webbing over the ant with its back two legs alone .
Thus , it could catch and incapacitate bugs without any web .
It could catch them on the ground , by throwing out webbing with its hind feet .
Very interesting .
I finally added some debris into the container , and it promptly spun a web .
The web is just a sloppy bunch of haphazard strands .
However , it gets the job done .
It 's always interesting to watch spiders move on the web .
The web looks like a mess to me , but the spider navigates it just fine .
The spider was a real pig .
I gave it way too much food , and it ate it all .
I once gave it five large flies in one day .
I also gave it large game , such as dragonflies .
Here we see it feeding on the tail of a huge dragonfly .
Notice how fat the spider has become .
It almost looks bloated .
Over the course of time , the spider grew darker and darker .
I could leave it with no food for weeks , and it was fine .
I had trouble getting good photographs , because I had to take the photos through the plastic , with no manual focus on my camera .
Every time I opened the lid , the spider ran for cover and hid .
Here we see the spider hanging over the body of a luber grasshopper .
Like I said , I gave it large meals .
By now , the spider is even darker than in this photo , and almost fully black .
It is not the slick , dark , complete black of a Black Widow , but it 's fairly close .
I do n't know anything about keeping spiders as pets , but it 's pretty easy to keep alive , and does n't seem to require much .
I 'm not really into spiders , but there 's something about the power the spider has , the ability to produce such a painful bite , I suppose , that makes it appealing .
In my job , I deal with wildlife all the time , so I know enough to be cautious around dangerous animals .
The Brown Widow , however , is easy , because it 's so timid .
That 's why it curled into a ball for hours in the first place .
Like most animals , it is misunderstood , and chooses flight before fight .
This spider would never actively seek out or attack a person or pet .
New photo .
Even blacker .
The hourglass remains orange , whereas the Black Widow has a red hourglass marking .
New photo .
I wonder why the color has darkened like this .
It looks pretty close to the Black Widow .
After two months in captivity , it spun this egg sac .
The Brown Widow 's egg sac is unique in that it features bumps or spikes .
The spider became noticeably thinner as a result .

Check out my friend 's Florida Honey Bee Removal page .
I 've received probably over 100 emails about Brown Widow Spiders as a result of this web page .
I 'm posting the one below , with a few photos :
Hi , I 'm from southern CA and happened on your site .
I 've become interested a bit in the brown widows and how their life cycle .
I 've been watching and photographing them in my yard over the last month or so .
This has led to several questions and theories which your site did a good job of providing information about .
One issue that I 've been wondering about the enormous range of coloring that I 've seen .
They get so black that I 'm not sure whether the blackest ones are brown or black widows .
I 've been looking at one large spider in particular trying to figure out if it is a black widow for sure or not .
Its hour glass is split significantly and it is significantly asymmetrical with one section almost non-existent .
Based on what you said it sounds like it is a black widow .
The fact that the hour glass is red and not orangey red might be an indicator .
Also something that you did n't mention was the yellow stripe on the head side of the hour glass that seems to always be on brown widows ( although it is less prominent on some ) .
Maybe the lack of that is also a strong sign that the spider in question is a black widow .
It is easily the largest spider in the my yard that I 've been keeping track of and maybe that 's another sign that it 's a black widow .
I also had been wondering whether the brown widows darken with age or there are different color variations .
I 've been watching a fairly small black one and that , I thought , shot down my theory that they just darkened with age .
It seemed like if it was small it must be young .
But I had n't thought about the idea that they might shrink after they had laid their eggs .
Maybe that 's the reason this spider was small .
I notice that I haven's seen any males near the small black colored brown widow .
One thought I 've had is that the striking pattern that the brown widows have is some kind of sexual attractor and the pattern fades away after the spider has mated .
Another interesting thing to me is just how many of these things there are around here .
I 'm 59 and I 've lived in Southern , CA most of my life and in that time I 'd see a black widow every now and then , but I just do n't remember these brown widows but on the other hand I was n't looking for them either .
But I 've seen many black widow egg cases in that time and before fairly recently I had never seen a brown widow egg case .
Right now they seem to be much more common than black widows .
I 've taken a walk around my neighborhood looking for these things and I could fine a brown widow on average about every ten feet or so along the sidewalk when the side wall had some sore of wall next to it .
Anyway , thanks for your site .
Oh and congratulations on your courage on keeping these things in captivity .
I thought about doing that but it seemed a little too dangerous .

Last week , Secretary of Education Arne Duncan sent a letter to principals across the country , on view later in this post , informing them that President Barack Obama would be delivering a speech to the nation 's schoolchildren on Tuesday , September 8 .
Duncan wrote , " The President will challenge students to work hard , set educational goals , and take responsibility for their learning .
He will also call for a shared responsibility and commitment on the part of students , parents and educators to ensure that every child in every school receives the best education possible so they can compete in the global economy for good jobs and live rewarding and productive lives as American citizens . "
Shockingly controversial , right ?
But apparently the very thought of Obama speaking to their kids without someone nearby to tell them not to pay attention to the bad man trying to bankrupt the treasury , undermine our healthcare system and coddle terrorists determined to destroy the American way of life has caused consternation among numerous parents in Douglas County .
Susan Meek , spokeswoman for the Douglas County School District , confirms that her office received enough complaints on the subject that staffers eventually issued a communique to schools on the subject .
Meek says the decision to show the speech , and to whom , will be " site - based , " meaning each principal can determine his or her own policy .
In the case of Staci McCormack , principal at Arrowood Elementary in Highlands Ranch , she sent an e-mail to parents earlier today ( it 's reproduced in its entirety below ) , acknowledging that she 'd also heard from some parents unhappy at the prospect of their children seeing the Obama speech .
To address their concerns , McCormack went on , " only a few classrooms at AWE will be offering the children an opportunity to view the President 's speech " -- and anyone who does n't want them to participate can opt out , just as they can when the topic is sex education .
The Obama administration is touting the September 8 address as the first - ever presidential speech aimed directly at schoolchildren .
That 's debatable : In October 2001 , President George W. Bush called on every American child to donate a dollar each to needy kids in Afghanistan .
But the scheduling of the speech during school hours presents a new twist , and while Meek shies away from characterizing the motivations of callers , she does concede that " I think for political reasons , some parents have concerns about their child watching the President speak . "
Meek insists , however , that despite Douglas County 's reputation for conservatism , the calls her office has received have n't all been in opposition to schools airing the speech .
" Our community is made up of different political views , " she notes .
" I 'm sure the calls from parents who are expressing concern are made up from one group .
But we 've also received calls from individuals who would like to have it shown in their child 's classroom . "
Thus far , Meek has n't heard from any pro-Obama parents upset about the opt - out policy .
As for those on the opposite side of the issue , she says " most people feel comfortable once they understand what the process is . "
And that , to borrow a phrase associated with a previous administration , they can just say " no . "
Below , see the e-mail from Arrowood Elementary principal McCormack , followed by the letter to principals from Secretary of Education Duncan :
Parents ,
We have mailed the individual CSAP scores to your homes .
Please look for their arrival within the next few days .
On September 8 , 2009 , President Obama will be addressing the children on TV .
Some of you have called our office asking if we will be showing the presentation and you have asked that your child not be in the room if we do show the presentation .
Only a few classrooms at AWE will be offering the children an opportunity to view the President 's speech .
If a child chooses not to watch the speech , the child will be sent to our media center to engage in an individual literacy activity directed by the teacher .
You will be informed this week by your child 's teacher if they will have the option of watching the presentation .
After the viewing , there will be no discussion held in the classroom .
The follow - up conversation may happen at home with parents .
Thanks for your continued involvement , Staci McCormack , Principal
So far the public outrage has n't been nearly as intense as Janet Jackson 's Nipplegate , but once the thought of a naked ladyflower on prime time television settles in , the reaction will be huge .
Next up , FCC fines .
Last night , when a contestant on So You Think You Can Dance celebrated making it to the next round , she got so excited she fell to the floor , writhing in excitement , and let the camera film up her skirt .
Too bad she was n't wearing any panties .
Oopsie !
After the Janet Jackson debacle , where she showed her breast on live television during the Super Bowl halftime show , the reaction was immediate and fierce .
After all , bare nipples are the greatest threat to our national order .
Well , nipples and gay marriage are close , but nipples always win by a hair .
Now there may have been a real live vagina on television , we have no idea what the precedents are .
Viacom , the owner of CBS , paid $ 550,000 for showing first base , how much will Fox have to pony up for the whole infield ?
Well , that depends on a few factors :
" Today 's projections show that population growth is starting to slow down , the impacts of the radical reforms we have made to the immigration system over the last two years are working , " he said .

An 11 - year - old Alabama boy cried wolf in order to try and hide his bad grades , by faking his own kidnapping Friday .
The boy told police that a man with a pistol forced him in a " beat up car " and threatened to kill him .
The boy claims he was able to jump out of the car , but was n't able to get his bookbag which held his report card , but rest assured he managed to get his band instrument .
After his escape , the boy ran for his grandparent 's house .
He later confessed to his grandfather that the story was all a lie .
The grandfather called police in order to apologize .
Police became suspicious about the kidnapping and escape when the boy was able to get his band instrument but not his bookbag .
The 11 - year - old is not facing charges , but police would n't confirm that the boy would never face charges .
Even though the boy is safe and sound , the backpack and report card are still missing .
I would be willing to bet that this boy is mischievious and a parent 's worst nightmare .
You would probably never be surprised by what he would do next .
However , it would be entertaining and produce some funny stories when they reminisce about the past , years from now .
Fortunately , this far the police have decided not to press charges , although it does n't sound like they spent much time on the case .
It 's too bad though that the boy was so worried about showing his parents his grades that he had to concoct a story like this .
The boy should spend more time studying and doing homework instead of wasting his time devising plans to avoid showing his grades to his parents .
I hope that this boy gets punished for this stunt even though it is kind of funny .
Ironically , when children do things like this it's kind of funny but when adults try to pull stunts like this , I wonder if they are a few cards short of the deck .
Adults know better and so should this eleven year old .
Pretty soon he will be going into junior high or he might already be in middle school .
By this age , kids need to start being responsible for themselves and if they do something wrong they have to face the consequences .
Otherwise , they can turn into irresponsible adults , which our country does n't need any more of .
Obama gives Israel carte blanche on settlement construction
By Chris Marsden
24 September 2009
Tuesday ’s meeting in New York between Barack Obama , Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority ( PA ) President Mahmoud Abbas was widely regarded as little more than a photo opportunity before it began , as well as something of a political embarrassment for the US president .
It was both these things .
But it also confirmed the degree to which the Obama administration is prepared to back Netanyahu ’s settlement construction programme on the West Bank and East Jerusalem and to dictate terms to the Palestinians .
The weeks leading up to the tripartite meeting were dominated by Israeli announcements of a massive programme of housing construction involving 3,500 units on the West Bank and in East Jerusalem , contravening the official US position for a settlement freeze .
But after repeated official statements of opposition and diplomatic visits by Middle East Envoy George Mitchell , Obama unceremoniously dumped the demand for a freeze .
Assembling an hour late following separate discussions with Netanyahu and Abbas , Obama spoke alone before engineering an awkward handshake for the cameras .
Obama did his best to give an appearance of strength .
There must be a “ sense of urgency , ” he said .
“ Simply put , it is past time to talk about starting negotiations .
It is time to move forward . ”
But this was window dressing for his statement praising Netanyahu for having “ discussed important steps to restrain settlement activity . ”
This , not a freeze , was now the basis for future negotiations .
Mitchell would meet next week in Washington with teams sent by Netanyahu and Abbas , Obama said , after which Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would report back to him by mid-October .
Obama also chastised the Arab regimes along lines welcome to Tel Aviv , stating that it remained “ important for the Arab states to take concrete steps to promote peace . ”
Abbas was praised for the PA ’s “ efforts on security , ” a euphemism for clamping down on opposition to Israel and hostilities directed against Hamas in Gaza .
But Obama followed this with criticism for not doing more to stop incitement and to “ move forward on negotiations . ”
He insisted that both leaders show “ flexibility and common sense and sense of compromise . ”
This was a barely veiled repudiation of the PA ’s insistence on a halt to settlement building and discussions on the final status of East Jerusalem as the basis for negotiations , as formerly agreed on by the “ Road Map ” drawn up under President George W. Bush .
Abbas , whose attendance at the summit was widely denounced in the West Bank and Gaza , was effectively humiliated by Obama for his pains .
To save face afterwards , he insisted that during the meeting he had “ confirmed our positions and commitment to the Road Map and its implementations ” and “ also demanded that the Israeli side fulfil its commitments on settlements , including on natural growth , ” having “ defined the occupied territories as the West Bank , Gaza and Jerusalem . ”
The renewal of negotiations “ depends on a definition of the negotiating process , ” Abbas said , meaning that talks must be based “ on recognising the need to withdraw to the 1967 borders . ”
Such declarations were rendered meaningless by Mitchell ’s statement following the meeting .
He stated clearly that ending Israeli settlements on the West Bank was not a precondition for talks .
He told the Jerusalem Post , “ There are many obstacles .
[ Settlements ] are one .
It ’s not the only one .
We are not identifying any issue as being a precondition or an impediment to negotiation . ”
Mitchell described the settlement freeze as one of several US “ requests ” directed to both sides .
Making clear that even the provisions of the Road Map have been junked , he insisted that “ neither side should hold out for the perfect formula . ”
Whatever Abbas ’s public posturing , he has no alternative but to seek to impose on an increasingly hostile Palestinian population whatever rotten compromise is on offer from Washington and Tel Aviv .
Herb Keinon , writing in the Jerusalem Post , noted the interview given by Abbas to Jackson Diehl in the Washington Post this summer , in which he had attempted to project a hard - line stance .
Abbas had said then that “ he could wait until the US pressure on Israel led to the collapse of the Netanyahu government , ” Keinon noted .
Keinon writes that with no evidence of US pressure , let alone the collapse of Netanyahu ’s government , Abbas ’s “ waiting game ” paradoxically “ also serves Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu , as long as — and this is indeed taking place — the Palestinians continue institution - building : improving their ability to govern , improving their security apparatus with the help of US Lt. - Gen. Keith Dayton , and improving their economy . ”
Keinon here clearly identifies the role that the PA is expected to play and is , in fact , already playing — that of a proxy police force acting under the direct instructions of the US and Israel .
The Israeli delegation could not restrain itself from crowing over the outcome of the summit .
Following his discussions with Obama , when asked by reporters what was meant by “ restraint , ” Netanyahu replied , “ Ask the Americans . ”
The Palestinians had agreed “ to renew the negotiations without preconditions , ” he insisted .
What was now being decided was only “ how the discussions will be held , within what framework and how they will be characterised . ”
Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman of the far - right Ysrael Beiteinu said that the meeting had proved peace negotiations could resume without giving in to Palestinian preconditions .
He told the press of his friendly exchanges with Abbas and chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat .
He said that he expected the Palestinians to withdraw their petition to the International Criminal Court in The Hague regarding Israeli Defence Forces war crimes during Operation Cast Lead , the Israeli assault on Gaza between December 2008 and January 2009 .
Netanyahu ’s religious party coalition allies , Shas , gave him fulsome support .
Interior Minister and Shas Chairman Eli Yishai declared that the Palestinians ’ “ sole aim is to entrench themselves in harmful positions in order to improve , through conflict , agreements that they themselves have trampled on… .
The prime minister ’s steadfast perseverance removed another layer from the Palestinian mask . ”
Likud Knesset members ( MKs ) praised Netanyahu and even his right - wing critics within the party — several of whom had visited a settlers ’ protest tent against a settlement freeze in Jerusalem prior to the summit — professed satisfaction at its outcome .
MK Ofir Akunis said the summit “ proves construction in Judea and Samaria [ the West Bank ] will continue alongside the diplomatic talks … .
It ’s now clear that the international community has far more esteem for a strong government that insists on Israeli interests . ”
MK Tzipi
Hotovely boasted that “ Israel does n’t have to prove to the world anymore that it is willing to take steps for peace .
We can say that we tried everything and we will no longer make any concessions . ”
Haaretz ’s diplomatic affair correspondent Akiva Eldar pronounced a damning verdict on the degree to which Obama ’s agenda is now so openly dictated by Netanyahu , Likud and the Israeli far right .
He asked , “ So what if Obama says the time has come to move the peace process forward ?
His chatter make[s ] as much an impression on Netanyahu as the threats issued by the Labour Party rebels .
[ Likud minister - without - portfolio ] Benny Begin and Yesha settlement leader Pinhas Wallerstein scare him more than that lefty Obama and his few friends in Israel . ”
But Obama ’s apparent impotence before Netanyahu cannot be so easily dismissed .
It is a reflection of the fact that he shares Israel ’s agenda in large measure .
His primary concern in seeking “ final status ” negotiations with the Palestinians is to help secure Arab support for a broader agenda for securing US hegemony over the oil - rich Middle East , centred on efforts to curtail Iran ’s role as a regional power .
Whereas , to this end , Obama would like Israel to make a few more concessions to the Palestinians , he requires above all Israel ’s support as a steadfast regional ally in his conflict with Tehran .
With the United Nations summit dominated by US demands for additional sanctions against Iran , Netanyahu told the media that Iran was also a major subject of his own discussions with Obama .
“ The Iranian issue overshadows everything , ” he said .
Indeed , the Constitution gives Congress almost all war powers other than operational command .
The legislature raises the military , declares war , and has the power " To define and punish ... offenses against the law of nations " ; " make rules concerning captures on land and water " ; " make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces " ; and " make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers . "
Many Iraqis expressed enthusiasm for President Barack Obama 's election last November , but some questioned why he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize so early in his presidency .
Abood Mohammed , a Baghdad mobile phone shop owner , said President Obama had given hope to many in the Muslim world for improved relations with the U.S. But Mr. Mohammed said the American president had yet to show substantive results on the ground .

Gordon Brown issued an unequivocal apology last night on behalf of the government to Alan Turing , the second world war codebreaker who took his own life 55 years ago after being sentenced to chemical castration for being gay .
Describing Turing 's treatment as " horrifying " and " utterly unfair " , Brown said the country owed the brilliant mathematician a huge debt .
He was proud , he said , to offer an official apology .
" We 're sorry , you deserved so much better , " Brown writes in a statement posted on the No 10 website .
Turing is most famous for his work in helping create the " bombe " that cracked messages enciphered with the German Enigma machines .
He was convicted of gross indecency in 1952 after admitting a sexual relationship with a man .
He was given experimental chemical castration as a " treatment " .
His criminal record meant he was unable to continue his work for the UK Government Communications Headquarters ( GCHQ ) because his security privileges were withdrawn .
Two years later he killed himself , aged 41 .
Thousands have signed a Downing Street petition calling for an official apology , among them the novelist Ian McEwan , scientist Richard Dawkins , and gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell .
Paying tribute to Turing 's contribution to " Britain 's fight against the darkness of dictatorship " , Brown described him as " a quite brilliant mathematician " .
" Without his outstanding contribution , the history of world war two could well have been very different , " he writes .
" The debt of gratitude he is owed makes it all the more horrifying , therefore , that he was treated so inhumanely .
In 1952 , he was convicted of gross indecency – in effect , tried for being gay .
" His sentence – and he was faced with the miserable choice of this or prison – was chemical castration by a series of injections of female hormones . "
The petition , which yesterday had 30,805 signatures , was the idea of computer scientist John Graham - Cumming , who has also written to the Queen to request Turing be awarded a posthumous knighthood .
Although an official apology is unusual , the act is seen as symbolic .
Alan Turing is survived by three neices – Inagh , Shuna and Janet , from his brother 's first marriage – and a nephew , John Dermot Turing , from his brother 's second marriage , along with their associated family members .
Acknowledging the strength of feeling , Brown wrote : " Thousands of people have come together to demand justice for Alan Turing and recognition of the appalling way he was treated .
While Turing was dealt with under the law of the time and we can't put the clock back , his treatment was of course utterly unfair and I am pleased to have the chance to say how deeply sorry I and we all are for what happened to him .
" Alan and the many thousands of other gay men who were convicted as he was convicted under homophobic laws were treated terribly .
Over the years millions more lived in fear of conviction .
" This recognition of Alan 's status as one of Britain 's most famous victims of homophobia is another step towards equality and long overdue . "
" But even more than that , Alan deserves recognition for his contribution to humankind …
It is thanks to men and women who were totally committed to fighting fascism , people like Alan Turing , that the horrors of the Holocaust and of total war are part of Europe 's history and not Europe 's present .
" So on behalf of the British government , and all those who live freely thanks to Alan 's work I am very proud to say : we 're sorry , you deserved so much better . "
Though most famous for his codebreaking , Turing is often considered to be the father of modern computer science , having made highly significant contributions to the emerging field of artificial intelligence and computing .
After the war he worked at many institutions , including the University of Manchester , where he worked on the Manchester mark 1 , one of the first recognisable modern computers .
In 1999 Time Magazine named him as one of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th Century .
• This article was amended on Sunday 13 September 2009 .
We said that Alan Turing , the man often considered the father of modern computer science had no surviving family .
In fact , his family includes three nieces , a nephew and his mother , and several children and spouses of this group .
This has been corrected .
Chad Ochocinco vows to find ' loopholes ' in NFL Twitter policy
CINCINNATI ( AP )  Chad Ochocinco is working on a tweet surprise for the NFL .
He promised something new for the Cincinnati Bengals opener Sunday against the Denver Broncos at Paul Brown Stadium .
What exactly ?
He would n't say .
But it 's likely to get a review from the NFL , which has banned players ' use of social networks during games .
Ochocinco thinks he 's found a way around it .
" The Twitter world , they do n't need a signal , " he said Wednesday .
" They 'll know .
It 's the quiet before the storm .
Just watch . "
THE HUDDLE : Ocho spars with Skip Bayless on ESPN
Leave it to the receiver to try an end around .
Ochocinco became immersed in social networking sites in the offseason , enjoying the chance to connect with fans .
A company formed by backup Bengals quarterback Jordan Palmer and two of his California friends has designed an iPhone application for him .
The company , Rock Software , Inc. , is awaiting approval for the app , which would include a Twitter feed .
Perhaps that 's part of the plan .
Near the end of training camp , the league established guidelines for using Twitter , Facebook and other social networks .
Players , coaches and football operations personnel can use them for up to 90 minutes before kickoff , and again after they 've done media interviews following the game .
The league said that no player or anyone representing him can provide in - game updates on the player 's personal Twitter , Facebook or other networking accounts .
Ochocinco , who is one of the most prolific tweeters among NFL players , thinks he 's found a way around it .
" I 've been really , really quiet , and there 's a storm coming Sunday , " he said .
" That 's one of the things that I do when I 'm back : I have something .
I keep you on the edge of your seat .
" NFL , I would like to apologize to you guys early .
I understand .
I read all the fine print in the letters you sent , but I did find loopholes .
I found loopholes . "
The 31 - year - old receiver has done numerous Ustream episodes and tweeted voluminously during the offseason .
He tried to scoop the media on the Bengals signing first - round draft pick Andre Smith , tweeting that a deal was done .
Smith 's agent then tweeted that the report was premature — the offensive tackled wound up signing a day later .
Ochocinco got his picture taken with Smith in the locker room and posted it .
The league 's directives seemed to cut into one of his planned ventures : tweets on game days .
At one point , Ochocinco suggested he could get fans to post for him , taking their cue from signals he provided on the field .
The NFL 's directive ruled that out , too .
Last week , Ochocinco posted on his Twitter feed : " Due to the many rules the NFL has made I 've found it difficult to enjoy Twitter and I 'll be deleting my account :("
He has n't tweeted on his OGOchoCinco account since last Friday .
" Just the calm before the storm , " he said .

Forty - two - year - old Russell McCoy was energized and sweaty as he finished a three - mile run around his neighborhood .
He headed straight for his refrigerator and cracked open a diet soda , downing it in a couple of swigs .
Holding the empty can , he backed toward the garbage pail , pivoted , shot , and scored .
Then pain , sudden and excruciating , lanced through his left hip .
He bent over , aware that he had twisted something the wrong way .
Breathing deeply , he felt a little better .
A few hours later , though , he tried to run a few strides and almost yelped from the pain .
For the next two weeks , he took it easy .
But the hip did n’t get better .
I first saw Mr. McCoy in June , two months after the soda - can episode .
He had already been to another doctor , who was convinced this was “ referred pain ” — in other words , pain in one body area that is actually the result of a problem in another .
According to that doctor , Mr. McCoy had strained his lower back muscles and was experiencing it as hip pain .
A week of an anti-inflammatory medicine and stretching exercises for the lower back had not helped , however .
An X - ray of the hip a month later showed no sign of arthritis or fracture , and an MRI of the lower back had n’t revealed much either , just a small disk bulge that seemed unrelated to the pain .
Over the two months since the injury , my patient told me , he had gained 10 pounds .
He was n’t exercising because it hurt too much .
He was n’t sleeping well , either ; the hip ached when he lay on his left side .
He sucked his breath in sharply when I pushed on the greater trochanter , the bony outer part of his upper left thigh .
His main symptom — the sore spot on his hip that hurt when pressed — was typical for trochanteric bursitis , inflammation of the greater trochanter ’s bursa .
A bursa is a fluid - filled sac that allows adjacent tissues to glide over each other .
When injury or overuse irritates the bursa , any pressure or movement around it will cause pain .
I recommended treating the inflammation with a cortisone injection .
My patient cringed at the thought of a needle poking into the painful area .
Instead , he decided to seek yet another opinion , this time from an orthopedic surgeon .
Like the first doctor , the surgeon believed the symptoms originated in the lower back .
He had Mr. McCoy see a physical therapist , who thought the back had nothing to do with it and that he had strained a muscle in his hip .
The next stop was a chiropractor , who worked on both hip and back with no improvement .
Finally , four months after our first visit , Mr. McCoy was back in my waiting room .
His belly now bulged over his belt , and he grimaced each time his left foot hit the floor .
“ I ’m ready for the injection , ” he said .
“ Let ’s go for it . ”
I had him lie on his right side , located the most tender area on the top of his left thigh , and injected a mixture of anesthetic and cortisone .
Injections like these are among the few procedures that can give almost instant relief .
The anesthetic numbs the sore area immediately , and the steroid kicks in within two days .
If the anesthetic helped , it would support my diagnosis , and we could be pretty sure that the steroid would work .
If the anesthetic did n’t help , then it probably was n’t trochanteric bursitis after all .
I held my breath as he took a few steps .
He winced .
The injection had not worked .
It had been six months since Mr. McCoy first hurt his hip , and now we were right back where we started .
I had run out of ideas .
The physical exam , the X - ray results , and the injection had ruled out the common causes of hip pain — arthritis , bursitis , fracture , referred pain from the lower back — but he still could n’t run .
In many situations , the search for a cause of pain ends without an answer , and we change our focus to pain control .
But I was not ready to give up .
Apologizing for adding yet another doctor into the mix , I suggested a rheumatologist — a joint specialist — who then sent Mr. McCoy for a procedure in which an anesthetic , followed by cortisone , was injected directly into the ball - and - socket part of the hip joint .
This , too , failed to relieve the pain .
We had not yet addressed the slight disk bulge that appeared on the MRI of Mr. McCoy ’s lower back .
I did n’t think it was the culprit , but we had no other leads .
Disk bulges are notoriously tricky to interpret because they are common in people both with and without pain ; in fact , they appear on MRIs of people without back pain roughly 50 percent of the time .
So it is n’t easy to decide whether a bulge justifies the discomfort , expense , and radiation exposure of additional tests , or even surgery .
Mr. McCoy ’s neurosurgery appointment would n’t happen for another two months .
While he waited , I suggested he return to the physical therapist for a cane and some hip exercises .
When I saw him a month later , in January , I had to blink a couple of times .
He was n’t limping .
He was n’t using a cane .
He was smiling .
What he told me was so utterly unexpected , so simple , that I was at a loss for words .
“ I have a short leg , ” he explained .
“ The physical therapist measured my legs , and my right one is about half an inch shorter .
He gave me a heel lift and it ’s working like a charm . ”
I had not learned about leg length discrepancy ( LLD ) in my training , and it seemed that none of the other clinicians Mr. McCoy saw had considered it either .
But leg length discrepancies are common .
According to some studies , up to 70 percent of people have a slight difference in the length of their legs ; one person in a thousand has a difference of nearly an inch .
In most cases , the difference goes undetected .
There are two kinds of LLD .
Structural discrepancies , which can be congenital or the result of a fracture or hip replacement surgery , involve an actual difference in the length of the bones .
Functional discrepancies , on the other hand , are caused by muscle weakness or stiffness in the pelvis , ankle , or foot — the legs are the same size but function as if one is longer .
Mr. McCoy probably had a lifelong mild leg length discrepancy that never bothered him until he hurt his hip .
The pain changed the way he walked , and all of a sudden the discrepancy mattered .
My patient ’s LLD was small enough that it had never caused an obvious limp , at least until now .
But there was another clue that nobody had noticed .
“ I looked at the soles of his shoes , and one was more worn , ” the physical therapist told me .
“ If the right leg is shorter , you tend to walk on the outer part of that foot , to extend the leg .
On the other side , to make the longer leg feel shorter , you flatten out that foot .
You can learn a lot from the soles . ”
One common method used to check for a structural leg length discrepancy involves running a tape measure from a point on the pelvis to the ankle bone several times and then averaging the numbers .
To check for a functional discrepancy , a physical therapist will measure from the belly button to each ankle bone .
Some doctors recommend taking a special X - ray to verify the measurement ; others believe that the degree of accuracy achieved with an X - ray is not worth the radiation exposure and is not necessary with small discrepancies .
Physical therapists often give a patient with hip pain and a small LLD a heel lift or even an insert from a sneaker to try for a week or so .
What makes the treatment tricky is that a heel lift does n’t always work .
As with those incidental disk bulges on MRIs , a leg length discrepancy may have nothing to do with the pain ; since a slight difference in leg lengths is so common , it would be easy to make the mistake of treating the pain with a heel lift when there is another reason for it , like arthritis or bursitis .
And some people have had an LLD for so long that they ’ve compensated by holding their pelvis at a certain angle .
In those situations , a heel lift that is used for more than a week may end up causing pain rather than relieving it .
For some people , the search for relief from hip pain never ends .
Luckily , that was n’t the case with my patient .
The heel lift did more than match the length of his legs .
It lifted his spirits .

Mr Bercow is the youngest Speaker in modern times John Bercow has ordered a £ 20,000 refurbishment of the Speaker 's official grace - and - favour flat in the Palace of Westminster , it has been reported .
Items ordered by the new Speaker , elected after Michael Martin stepped down amid the expenses row , include a £ 6,764 sofa suite , the Telegraph said .
Some changes make the flat child - friendly , such as fitting window locks and turning a study into a playroom .
Mr Martin spent £ 724,600 of public money on the flat from 2000 to 2008 .
Mr Bercow , who has three young children and at 46 is the youngest Commons Speaker in modern times , has previously noted it was a " fantastic apartment but it's not altogether child friendly " .
Child friendly
The Telegraph reported it had seen the document detailing the changes to be made , including £ 6,764.30 on a new sofa suite , £ 760 on a window seat cushions , £ 3,600 on window locks , £ 90.95 on mattresses and sheets and £ 275 on eight lampshades .
Other costs include £ 3,880 on planters to make the terrace more child friendly and £ 1,087 on decorating a study to turn it into a playroom .
I have seen large damp patches on one of the ceilings for sure and when Michael Martin was there part of the ceiling fell down because it was damp
Mike Granatt
Former Speaker 's adviser
The House of Commons in - house maintenance was also asked to check that the access to wall ducts was child proof .
A spokeswoman for the House of Commons said Mr Bercow was " happy that this information is in the public domain , that the public know how this money has been spent " .
Mike Granatt , who was a spokesman for Mr Bercow 's predecessor Michael Martin , told BBC Radio 5 Live the Speaker 's contract required him to live in the flat and it was " not unreasonable that the place should be made safe for his kids " .
He said the apartments consisted of two parts - the " grand state rooms " downstairs and the private apartment above which , he said , did need some redecoration .
" Some of the rooms I have been in ... certainly need refurbishment , I have seen large damp patches on one of the ceilings for sure and when Michael Martin was there part of the ceiling fell down because it was damp . "
" You have to remember this is a listed building , it 's a Grade I listed building - it 's a Royal Palace .
Any work that is done inside it generally has to be overseen to the standards of English Heritage . "
He added that the hand - made wallpaper famously ordered by former Lord Chancellor Lord Irvine for his apartment in the House of Lords - at a cost of £ 59,000 - had actually been a demand from English Heritage .

Simple because whatever the Bushco created problem the world faced we could just shrug and say something along the lines of ... Yeah , those Republicans suck !
No deeper analysis was really deemed necessary .
It was SO obvious that all of our problems like torture and a scandalous income disparity and killing Iraqi children even though they never did anything to threaten us was just how life was under Republicans .
The American voter figure it out too , and voted them out of office .
They , as did we in the blogosphere , figured when we voted them out , things would change big time .
The most hopeful among us thought that having a Democratic majority and a Democratic President would lead to a new golden age of equality and justice and economic fairness and recovery .
And free health care !
But nine months in to this hoped for golden age , while we have seen changes around the edges , we have had to fight tooth and nail to get the relative crumbs that we have gotten .
Even though the Republicans are despised by 75 % of America , and out of power , and OBVIOUSLY doing nothing more than obstructing ... we still are struggling to get any REAL changes to health care , the financial structure , Climate Crisis , the Wars or any accountability on the torture that the whole world knows occurred , but we are still tiptoeing around .
Why ?
The simple answer is to blame the Dems and President Obama .
But you can sense THEIR frustration as well !
Even they thought that they could come in to power and get things passed as easily as Bush .
Heck , they thought they would get 80 votes for the stimulus !
Sadly , they thought they would be greeted a Liberators .
But even without any political power , the Republicans ( it could be said ) are winning !
They are stopping or watering down everything the new administration are trying to do !
Why ?
And why did Bush have such success in getting his horrific agenda through Congress while the Dems struggle on every issue ?
Because it turns out that it was not the Republicans per se that were the problem at all .
Just as Fox news is just an arm of the Republicans , as the White House just figured out , the Republicans themselves are just a arm of a larger power .
An arm of the Ruling Class .
Why was Bush able to ram his agenda through so easily ?
Because his agenda was the agenda of the Ruling Class .
Why can't Obama get his agenda through ?
Because his agenda directly attacks the Ruling Class .
As we can see most baldly after 5 months of negotiations in the Finance Committee to get the most favorable bill possible for the Insurance Industry Arm of the Ruling Class ... once they got everything they could from their paid operatives like Max Baucus and every Republican in Congress , they are now rejecting the bill that was written just for them .
A year after the world panicked as the too big to fail banks came one millimeter away from crashing the economy of the whole world .... the main villain in the piece is giving out23 billion dollars in bonuses while fighting tooth and nail to defeat reforms that would protect the economy they just crashed .... for everyone but themselves .
The Ruling Class crashed the world economy ... and are now profiting from it .
And the list goes on , down through every issue and every problem our country and the world faces .
Heck , we can't even have a comprehensive investigation of torture , because the trail of evidence leads directly to George Bush and Dick Cheney ... and the Ruling Class always protects it 's pawns own .
The Republicans were defeated , and Obama took power and got a super majority of Democrats .
It should be a piece of cake to achieve great things .
But we can't .
Because it is NOT a simple partisan political fight .
The Republicans SHOULD have no power .
Yet they still are dominant in the media , still are more influential in Congress , and we still are operating in a frame of societal reference where the Parties are somehow equal .
75 % of Americans want a Public Option , a Majority of Senators are willing to vote for a Public Option , The House insists on the Public Option and the president wants a Public option .
The Will of the People and the Will of the Congressional majority is for a Public Option .
But we ca n't GET a Public option .
Why ?
With all the power on our side , why are we STILL unable to get what the overwhelming majority of Americans want ?
Why are the neutered Republicans still able to have so much power ?
Because , as it turns out , it is NOT the Republicans who are the problem .
It is the Ruling Class who are thwarting the Will of the People .
The Republicans are only powerful because they represent the Will of the Ruling Class .
When will we realize .... and ACT like we realize , what the real problem is ?
That this is not a battle between republicans and democrats .
When will we realize that this is a battle of The Ruling Class and their Corporations against The People ?
When will we start to refer to the struggle we are in as what it REALLY is behind all the political smoke and mirrors ... a Class War ?
A War between the Ruling Class and The People ?
.
.
For those who are wondering : Who Are The Ruling Class ?
In terms of long - term potential , few mixed martial artists carry the value of Gegard Mousasi , a multi-lingual 24 - year - old with talent to spare .
Currently under contract to Strikeforce and Dream , he denies the UFC made a pitch for his services following the collapse of Affliction ’s fight promotion wing in July .
“ There ’s never been an offer to me to fight in the UFC , ” Mousasi told Sherdog.com in this exclusive video interview .
In the month since Affliction ’s demise , Mousasi has become the Strikeforce light heavyweight champion .
He smashed Brazilian veteran Renato “ Babalu ” Sobral in exactly one minute to capture the belt in August , posting his 13th consecutive victory dating back to 2006 .
“ Basically , the fight went … it ended too quickly , so there was n’t much he could offer , ” Mousasi said .
“ It was a good fight for me for my U.S. debut .

Enlarge By Rich Pedroncelli , AP The Sacramento Municipal Energy District is funding the construction of a solar energy field .
Across the USA , states are falling short of their goals to increase the use of renewable energy as Congress weighs a national renewable - energy standard .
Thirty - five states have set goals to use more electricity from solar panels , windmills and other renewable forms of energy , according to a database funded by the Energy Department .
There is no central clearinghouse of states ' compliance records , but USA TODAY research and interviews with state and power company officials found nine states that have failed or expect to fail to meet their energy goals .
The states offer a lesson for the federal government , says Charles Benjamin of Western Resource Advocates , an environmental group .
The House of Representatives passed a bill in June that called for 15 % of the nation 's electricity to come from alternative sources in 2020 — up from 9 % last year .
A Senate bill with a similar goal is likely to be combined with a climate - change bill introduced last month .
" There are sometimes unknown challenges when you begin a venture like this , " Benjamin says .
" Just because you want renewable energy does n't mean it will happen . "
In their quest to draw more renewable power , states have come up against obstacles such as the recession , red tape and an outdated transmission system that makes it difficult to move solar or wind power from where it 's made to where it 's needed .
Some states , including Delaware and New Hampshire , require power companies that do n't buy enough renewable energy to make payments to a fund for renewable - energy projects .
That allows companies to comply with the rules but does n't help move a state toward greater reliance on alternative energy .
Among the states struggling with the renewable - energy targets they set for themselves : • New Jersey .
Gov. Jon Corzine , a Democrat , approved a state energy plan requiring the generation of 1,000 megawatts of power from offshore windmills by 2012 .
That 's enough to power up to half a million homes .
The state will miss the deadline " by about a year , " says Lance Miller of the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities , because of delays in finalizing federal rules .
• California .
The state set a 2010 deadline to get 20 % of its electricity from renewable sources .
That wo n't be achieved until 2013 or 2014 , according to a state report issued in July that said about 13 % of the state 's power in 2008 came from renewables .
Among the obstacles was a delay in connecting renewable - energy projects to the state 's power grid , according to the state 's website .
• Arizona .
The state planned to get 0.3 % of its electricity from solar power generated at homes and businesses by 2009 .
That goal probably will not be met until 2011 , says Kristin Mayes , chairwoman of the Arizona Corporation Commission , which oversees electric utilities .
Mayes says the troubled economy has made residents and businesses reluctant to invest in solar panels .
New York , Ohio and Maryland are also on pace to miss at least one of their 2009 energy goals , the USA TODAY review found .
Massachusetts might miss its 2009 goal for certain kinds of renewable energy such as wood , says Dwayne Breger of the Department of Energy Resources .
New Hampshire power companies met two - thirds of their 2008 renewable generation goal , according to a Public Utilities Commission report , and Delaware 's power companies fell shy of their goal in 2007 , the latest year for which data are available , said Courtney Stewart of the Delaware Public Service Commission .
When states decided to up their dependence on renewable energy , they did n't realize all the battles they 'd face , says researcher David Hurlbut of the Energy Department 's National Renewable Energy Laboratory .
" There was the idea that if you put the renewable - energy goal out there , the energy will just appear by magic , " he says .
" I would n't want anyone to think it 's easy … but all the challenges out there are solvable . "
The stimulus package may help .
That bill awarded tax credits for renewable - energy production , and the Energy Department awarded $ 502 million in stimulus money last month to companies building such projects .

An agency worker recalls several years ' temping in London , trying to help his co-workers and do as little work as possible .
Since the 1980s there has been a determined attack on wages and working conditions by employers and the government .
Following the defeat of the miners strike , and then other organised groups of workers like the printers and the dockers , these attacks have been very successful .
Myself and my friends are part of probably the first generation to be less well off than our parents .
The falling level of real wages is particularly apparent looking at house prices .
Average house prices used to be around 2.5 times the average annual wage - now they are around 7.5 times the average wage .
That 's not to mention the fact that more than 50 % of people earn less than the mean average wage .
A big part of this assault has been casualisation - destroying permanent jobs and replacing them with low paid , casual agency workers with no employment rights .
This is great for employers , who can take on and sack workers at will , and keep wages down by simply replacing anyone who asks for more or causes trouble .
But it 's a tragedy for us workers , who are left permanently vulnerable , precarious , constantly having to worry about our next assignment and our next pay cheque , whether we will be able to pay our rent ( getting a mortgage or buying somewhere does n't even come into the equation ) .
Health and safety also suffers , as workers can't speak up about unsafe conditions because we can be replaced in an instant .
This has had tragic consequences , none more so than the killing of Simon Jones , an agency worker in Brighton decapitated on his first day working on the docks .
With agency work , the employee is doubly screwed , as you have two sets of employers extracting profit from you .
In one of my jobs I saw my agency 's invoice - while I was getting £ 7 an hour they were charging £ 15 .
On top of all that , most of the work that is actually done - and certainly pretty much all the work I have ever done - is completely socially useless .
Meaning that in a rationally organised economy it would not have to be done .
Only the madness of the profit motive means that so many of us have to waste our lives doing these pointless , monotonous tasks which benefit nothing except our employers ' bank balances .
So all this being the case , I did n't really have much respect for temp agencies , or the employers who hire them .
As well as my being naturally quite a lazy bastard , I decided that I was going to try to resist this state of affairs .
Where possible , I tried to get involved in collective organising at work , to try to improve the position of myself and my co-workers .
And where this was not possible , I tried to do the absolute bare minimum of work .
This was not , however , merely a selfish act .
While much maligned , the lazy worker actually provides a great service to society as a whole , and to his / her fellow worker .
Let me explain :
Slow work means more workers are needed .
More workers means lower unemployment .
Lower unemployment means greater demand for labour .
Greater demand for labour means higher wages .
So if all workers were as lazy as me , we would all be a lot better off !
I should point out here , however that I always made sure I did n't let down my colleagues , and never minded going the extra mile to help them out .
What I tried to do where I could was encourage everyone to resist work and lower our workloads together ( as opposed to just make others work harder to cover for one slacker ) .
I 'm writing this account of my experiences in the hopes that it might give others ideas on ways to collectively or individually resist the imposition of work , or contribute in some small way towards a general undermining of the work ethic and hopefully helping to foster just that little bit more workers ' solidarity .
I also hope that more people might be inspired to write their accounts of work resistance - just click submit content above !
In the year 2000 I left school , not having any work experience apart from a paper round , but I knew how to use a computer so I figured I would look for work in an office .
Not seeing much in the way of permanent jobs , I registered with a couple of temp agencies , and soon enough was offered a job in an immigration department of the Home Office as a filing clerk on £ 6 an hour .
Going in on my first day , I realised I was n't going to be living the life of an average civil servant .
The job was in a dingy basement garage , with stickers across the walls and ceiling saying " warning : do not touch : asbestos " .
In the garage were racks of shelves , many of them stuffed with files .
It turned out that builders had moved all of the files from an old facility to this new storing place .
However , when they moved them some files were out as they were still active and still in use .
The builders packed in the files as tightly as possible on the shelves , so when workers tried to return the files they had out to the new shelves none of them would fit .
So I was hired with three other temps ( a postal worker who had been made redundant , a student and an Australian ) , and our job was to take all these thousands of files off the shelves and re-stack them , leaving a bit of a gap on each shelf .
Up to that point it was the most ridiculous thing I had ever had to do .
After starting , and initially working very hard , I noticed the other workers taking it pretty easy .
Realising there was no point working harder than any of them , I slowed down as well .
The work environment we had was crap , the pay was terrible , and the actual job was mindnumbingly boring , so there was no point killing yourself over it .
And a key thing was that the slower we worked , the longer we would have a job for , and so ultimately the more money we would get .
Luckily , the basement was such a dump that the manager hardly ever came to check up on us .
One or two permanent workers came down to see how we were getting on once or twice a week , usually in the middle of the day .
So informally , without really even talking about it us temps started getting in later and later , taking longer and longer lunch breaks , and leaving earlier and earlier .
Not to mention just hanging out during the day , chatting , reading the papers , smoking , pushing each other round in the file carts and generally just having quite a nice time , while still of course filling in our time sheets for a full day .
We would also read some of the case files .
They were mostly very sad stories of asylum seekers who had been viciously persecuted in their home countries , some being raped or having their families killed , but who had their applications rejected simply because they did not submit their forms on time .
While talking to other people there , I found out that in many cases applicants were not aware of deadlines , and did not have access to translators who could have helped them complete them .
A couple of the other temps had quite a negative opinion of asylum seekers , thinking that many of them were " bogus " , until working here when the brutality of the asylum system was very apparent .
Pretty soon we got into a nice rhythm of working slowly and mucking about a lot .
We ended up working there for about three months , with a couple of staff changes , when if we 'd gone through it at full pace it probably would have taken us about two weeks !
I had a few other very short - term assignments in various different places ; I do n't remember them all .
In some ways casual work suited my lifestyle at the time : I was not that interested in working , was not spending much money ( I was was living in squats ) and so would save up during assignments then take holidays - often going to big international anticapitalist demonstrations abroad like Gothenberg and Genoa , amongst others .
After getting back from the anti-G8 riots in Genoa , I got a job as an administrative assistant in a film archive .
The work was okay , I had to log films in and out of database and deal with customer enquiries over the phone and e-mail .
I would also check out films I was personally interested in , watch them and then return them without logging it on the system .
I could do the work pretty quickly , then would mess around on the internet , chat to co-workers and take an excessive amount of cigarette breaks .
After a couple of months of of working there , the ( mostly female ) permanent staff began a campaign of rolling industrial action : a half day strike once a week in support of a pay offer and improved conditions , including better maternity rights .
People did n't talk much about this in the run-up to the action , and my supervisor told me to come into work as usual , despite her being in union member who planned to strike herself .
I said that I would n't cross a picket line , but was told by the union members I should come into work .
I did n't , and instead joined the workers ' demonstration outside the office , and went to work in the afternoon .
After this apparently the team manager said I should be replaced , but my supervisor and some other team members went into his office saying I should be kept on .
So one day I was given my week 's notice , but the following I was told I could stay on .
My employment there ended anyhow after a couple of weeks - I do n't know if this was quicker than it would have been had I not joined the strike , there was no real way of knowing .
My next long - term assignment was as a data entry clerk for a charity .
My job was to update the supporter address database .
It was ridiculously dull - seven or eight hours sat in front of a PC , ticking boxes and typing addresses and postcodes .
The only enjoyment to be got from it was finding the occasional funny name , like Doug Witherspoon and Dr Doctor ( really ! ) .
On top of that , I previously had a high opinion of this charity .
But after working there for a bit this changed completely .
Like many nonprofits today , it started as a campaigning charity , but more recently just acts as privatisation on the cheap for the government .
There is more money to be made in vying for government contracts , undercutting the wages and conditions of public sector workers , than in helping people !
Apart from that , much of its activity was expended on raising more money , to buy more ads , hire more fundraisers , do more mail outs and raise yet more money .
Not only that , but due to its charity status workers can always be told " work harder , work longer , go without this , etc it 's to help the poor " .
Needless to say , the senior managers and executives of the charity were hardly poor , the chief executive himself being a particularly slimy character , who rocked up every day in his Mercedes and frittered much of his obscenely high salary up his nose ...
It was doing this job that I developed repetitive strain injury ( RSI ) which has unfortunately stayed with me ever since .
I informed my manager that I was experiencing a lot of pain entering the data , but was offered no help apart from having someone check my seat was at the right height .
So , I started to try to find ways to slack off again .
It was quite difficult , as the incoming data was relentless - and most of it was quite pointless .
But I went as slowly as possible , and found that I could save myself time by simply not entering data from some of the documents and just putting them straight in the recycling .
With this free time I could then do other things I enjoyed , like surf the net , make international calls ( I actually got caught at this and had to pay them the £ 80 mine came to , as I did n't realise they monitored them ! ) , have extended smoking breaks , chat to colleagues ...
After a while I hooked up with a hot girl in the PR department , so we would flirt over the office e-mail then fuck in the post room and return to our desks .
At the time I was also involved ( for my sins ) in the Anarchist Youth Network ( AYN ) .
So occasionally I would stay late at the office , get brownie points for being such a hard worker , and print masses of subversive literature when everyone else had gone .
Over the whole time I worked there I must have printed and photocopied thousands of leaflets and stickers , and hundreds of pamphlets which we then distributed for free .
Despite the work and the place being crap , I stayed there for a couple of years , then got a different job at the same charity in the subsidiary office down the road .
( My life at this point was quite stable , I got sick of the instability of squatting so was paying rent and needed near full - time employment )
This was doing more general administration , and a big part of it was putting together information packs for events , of which there were a lot .
It was a bit more varied and a bit better paid than the data entry , and so a bit less soul destroying .
I took over the job from a permanent worker who was doing five days a week , and left .
After doing the job for a few weeks the way I had been inducted by the permanent worker , I started trying out quicker ways of getting the work done .
I found I could save a huge amount of time by bundling together complete sets of information packs which I could then copy altogether , instead of copying all the subsections and fact sheets separately and compiling them after .
Basically this meant that instead of standing in front of the copier for hours feeding stuff in like the previous worker did , I just put it all in at once and pressed " go " .
So with all this extra time I could go sit at the back of the copy room for a couple of hours and relax , read books or magazines , put music on .
I even set up an elephant 's foot stool , a shelf and some conveniently placed stacks of paper so that I could wedge myself in and nap without being seen from the window .
I would have a couple of info packs on my lap so that the noise of someone coming in would wake me and I could instantly appear to be working .
Also , using the cover of making these info packs I printed thousands more anarchist flyers , pamphlets and zines .
I also volunteered to attend meetings down at the main office , so that I could hook up with the girl there before making my way back .
So here , I had a pretty sweet deal .
However , I made a huge mistake .
I had been trying to get a permanent job at this place , with no luck ( one receptionist job was advertised on their website for one week only , and it received 500 applicants ) , so I was keen to look like a good worker .
So I thought telling my boss about how clever I was in making the admin systems so much more efficient would get me some points .
Unfortunately , all it did was meant he reviewed my work , saw that I could do it in much less time and so cut my hours from five days a week to 2 1 / 2 .
The wanker .
This is not a mistake I will ever make again - and is something that I always stress to anyone starting out at work .
If you come up with an innovation that makes your job quicker ,
.
Use the extra time to do things you want to do .
In spite of this , I kept working there for another couple of years , and got other part - time jobs to make up the money .
I joined the union at this workplace , and went to the monthly meetings .
I tried to get a few people to join , but it was n't a particularly active branch and did n't really do much , so I was n't able to get that involved .
I soon stopped making much of an effort to get people to join the union , because in the absence of any actual collective organisation being a paper member was pointless .
When I first sought out the rep the first thing she told me was that they " were n't troublemakers " .
And that was accurate enough .
The main collective issue which was discussed at length at the meetings was the annual cost of living pay claim , where we came up with a figure to request of management ( usually around 5 % ) based on cost of living increases , then after a few months of back and forth would settle for 2.5 % or 3 % ( I ca n't remember exactly what now ) .
There was hardly any communication between the workforce as a whole and the union reps through this process .
In spite of there being little organisation , in my team we did try to do things to make work that little bit nicer for each other .
We covered for each other if people nipped out , pinched biscuits and refreshments reserved for visitors for each other , etc .
I was a smoker at the time , and those of us that did smoke used to take ( sometimes very ! ) regular breaks together .
On one break I said how I thought it was unfair that we were entitled to take breaks whenever we wanted , but the non-smokers could n't .
So we decided to just tell the non-smokers and new starters that they were entitled to " fresh air " breaks of 5 or 10 minutes or so when they pleased .
By the time management got wind of this it was already an established practice .
And management in places like charities rely on the goodwill of staff , and so often very reluctant to provoke conflict .
Taking away what was now this established " right " would have provoked conflict , so it was just allowed to continue .
Occasionally I got the additional odd job to do for some extra hours .
One of these was to enter demographic data about attendees at our events .
This was quite a big job , as the data had n't been entered in ages , so there were about 20,000 people to do .
So my manager asked me to enter five and tell him how long it took .
So I did five , as slowly as feasibly possible .
He used this figure to estimate that it would take me three weeks to do the lot .
I did think that this was actually a futile exercise , because the data would n't tell us anything useful - attendees at our events do n't come to us directly , they are sent by a certain kind of public - sector body .
So the demographic makeup of our attendees would be the makeup of staff in those bodies .
It 's not like if we had disproportionately few ethnic minority or disabled attendees we could take any sort of action to address this .
The manager just thought that we probably should record this information on a spreadsheet .
And it was work !
So I did n't say this to him .
What I did do , however , was taken sample of about 200 files randomly out of the total .
I entered them , which took me a couple of hours .
Then for the rest of the 19,800 I copied and pasted the first 200 I did and then went through and jumbled them up a bit .
I then spent three weeks pissing around on the internet , much of which was on enrager .
net ( libcom.org 's original name ) .
I was pretty pleased with myself about this .
The last permanent job I went for there was the job I had actually been doing for the previous year and a half .
I was told after the interview by my manager ( the aforementioned wanker ) who did the interview and who sat two desks away from me that I would know within a week whether I had been successful or not .
Six weeks later , I realised I had not been when the woman who was successful came into the office and started working .
The manager himself was a lazy fucker who would always leave at around 3:30 p.m. claiming he had to attend a " meeting " .
Once on an afternoon off I saw him in the shops on Oxford Street after he had claimed this , and on a couple of other occasions people had phoned up complaining that he had n't shown up to meetings which he had left the office supposedly to attend .
After I left , management slashed the wages of the workforce , ironically leaving a lot of them in poverty , although not before awarding themselves significant pay rises of course .
I vowed to never work in a charity again if I could help it .
After having my hours cut at the charity , I did a few random jobs for short periods of time , at places like the NSPCC , South West Trains , the citizens advice bureau headquarters and a few others .
One of my housemates was working part - time in a university library archive , which he said he enjoyed , and he was going to leave the country so he suggested I apply for his job when advertised it .
So I did , and got the job .
It was working evening and weekend shifts on casual hourly contracts , so not technically agency work , but just as insecure .
The hourly wage , however was okay , and I liked my co-workers a lot .
Us casuals were all similar ages , most of the others were university students themselves as well .
The permanent staff would work 9 - to - 5 , Monday to Friday , so we would cover weekday evenings and weekends until 9 p.m .
In some ways this was annoying , because it cut into your life , meaning you would miss evening social engagements , and would not be able to stay out too late on Fridays .
But in some ways it was great , because we only had an hour overlap on weekdays with the permanent staff - and our bosses .
We had a line manager , who was a very nice , quiet , middle - aged woman , and her boss was the team manager , who was not at all nice .
Thankfully , almost all of our dealings were with the line manager , who also allocated us work .
Basically we had two main jobs - to catalogue new collections ( go through boxes of books and papers , entering the titles and physical locations of each of them on a database and write a corresponding reference number back on the document ) and to copy sets of documents for researchers .
The latter task had to be done to a pretty tight schedule , because the library guaranteed work within a specific timescale .
The former task , however , was ongoing .
It also involved a fair bit of heavy lifting .
Thankfully , there was usually never too much of the copying .
This work us casuals would share out equally between us .
We would take it in turns to do roughly equal amounts of work , job , leaving a note for the next person on what stage we were up to .
This work was also charged , but as we were the only people around we had a lot of leeway with this .
Us making people pay did n't benefit us in the slightest .
In fact , it made extra work for us as we had to write out a receipt and log it on a spreadsheet .
So we used to give out a lot of freebies - particularly to individuals , who were n't just going to expense the cost to their employer .
When I started I did n't want to take the piss , so with the cataloguing , I observed the rate of work of the others , and went along with that .
However , I soon realised that not only was the work not very closely monitored by the managers , but actually us finishing a job created new work for our line manager , who then had to sort us out a new job to do .
Realising this was quite an epiphany .
Already the pace of our work was pretty appalling , but it started slowing pretty much to a halt .
In the office there were two of us working at any one time , so in the week we would take it in turns to leave an hour early , and on a Saturday we would arrange for one of us to get in an hour later , and the other to leave an hour earlier ( usually depending on who was going out the previous night ) and take alternate two - hour lunch breaks .
We would also use the time to do our own thing .
The students would do their school work , I would read books , magazines and stuff from the archive , and post articles to libcom .
I requested an ergonomic backrest , which I used as a pillow to nap under my desk on the weekends .
Then I started bringing in DVDs to watch on the computer .
Despite this , we got the copying done on time and made crawling the slow progress on the cataloguing and got congratulated by our line manager for our speedy work !
Once I literally dragged out a cataloguing job for about two months when it actually took me about an hour to do .
After a while , I decided to join the union at the University , UNISON .
I spoke to the rep there about our status as hourly contract staff , and if there were anything we could do to become permanent , part - time workers .
This would mean we would get entitlements to sick pay , holiday pay and pension benefits which we were denied as casuals .
I did n't hear anything back from him .
So as a team we approach this with our line manager and team manager , and nothing changed .
So we went to HR .
Apparently we were an anomaly in the University , and so they said actually should have all been proper employees .
So we were put on fixed term contracts ( of around a year I believe ) , but then as the Lord giveth with one hand he taketh away with the other : the University reduced our hourly wage so that our hourly wage plus holiday pay would equal previous hourly wage .
This meant that to get any benefit we would have to take advantage of the sick leave - which we did .
However , calling in sick created work for whoever the other person on duty with us was , so this did initially cause some tension when one person called in sick several times .
However , I argued with the person who was getting annoyed that she should just call in sick an equal number of times herself !
Which she then did , taking a week off .
It also came in very handy when I was injured moving very heavy boxes ( not having had any manual handling training ) , and had to have an operation and several weeks off work .
Unfortunately my other part - time temp jobs did not pay this , so it was a very hard time for me financially .
I attempted to pursue taking legal action against the university for this , but the union would not back me since I had not been a member for enough time before it occurred , and in the end it would have been very difficult to prove who was at fault , and a potential payout I would have received too low to bother continuing with .
In this job the pay was n't great , and the hours were n't great , but the camaraderie and the dossing was amazing , so I kept it up until I came across the opportunity of a full - time temp position in a local council .
One particular high point was the Christmas party .
Despite it being a public sector workplace , they put on a fancy Xmas bash with free drinks ( including an almost certainly unhygienic giant vodka luge ) , albeit which only went on till 8 PM .
So throughout the evening our team , in addition to drinking as much as humanly possible at the time , would steal extra drinks in dribs and drabs with the caps still on .
Perpetuating gender stereotypes we pinched Becks for the boys and Smirnoff Ices for the girls , and after 8 we then went up onto the roof and got absolutely plastered with our spoils .
A girl I was going out with was occasionally a temp at a local council .
She suggested I go do temp work there as well , as there was often a lot of work going .
So I registered with one of the agencies they dealt with , and soon enough got an interview and a job in a small training department .
I quickly noticed that a lot of the systems were very inefficient - a lot of information was duplicated , and a lot of tasks were done manually that could be automated .
So I spent a couple of weeks overhauling everything and making it a lot more efficient .
However , I did n't repeat my mistake at the charity of telling the manager about it .
I mentioned a couple of things , and used some of the extra time to make a lot of superficial changes to the workspace - tidying up the filing system , making uniform labels for everything , so the office space looked quite fancy .
Then I used the time I gained to doss around .
I started getting in later , and the manager was too nice to say anything about it .
I moved the desks around to " tidy up " , but also made it so no one could see my screen , so then would surf the net , and even watch DVD movies in work hours .
I spoke to the local UNISON rep ( an SWP hack ) saying I was a member of UNISON at another part - time job , asking if I could get involved in helping out with any organising work , of agency workers for example .
He said okay and he would get back to me , which he did much later , by asking if I wanted to help give out leaflets for anti-war demonstrations at the local tube station .
I tried speaking to him again about an idea I had to try and equalise wages for agency workers .
But he just came back with more leaflets for another SWP front project , so I gave up on him .
By myself I then went round my floor talking to the other three agency workers , who were all on the same grade job as me .
We found we were all on different wages , and decided to ask together to be put on the wage of the best earner .
We had all been there for a little while at this point , and this was agreed to by the two relevant managers .
After having been there a few months the government announced plans to attack public sector workers pensions - particularly those in local government .
There was widespread outrage against this , which forced the unions to organise a joint ballot for industrial action , which led to over 1 million workers in nine - odd unions walking out on 28 March .
Members of the largest union , UNISON , not a hardline union by any means , voted 80 % for discontinuous strike action , a figure which was broadly similar in the other unions .
As the first strike day approached , I did n't hear anything about it until just a couple of days before .
The floor I was on had a very low level of union membership , but my manager was a UNISON member .
She told me know that she thought because she was a manager she would not be allowed to strike - I told her that on the contrary all union members were supposed to strike !
So the strike day came , I visited the picket lines briefly to show my support , but could n't stand on them for risk of getting fired .
The strike was very well observed across the country : thousands of schools were shut , rubbish was left uncollected , council buildings were closed .
My manager did stay at home , but some other workers on my floor went in .
A couple of temps went to work as well ; I spoke to them about the strike the next day and one or two had an attitude like they had been " rebellious " by " defying " the picket line .
I tried to tell them that the strikers were not against them - but that we should support the struggle of the permanent workers to defend their pensions , even though we did n't have them , because if they lost then soon enough there would n't be any decent permanent jobs with good pensions for us to get in the future .
The fight against the pension cuts was quickly derailed by the unions .
They called off the scheduled future strike action for " talks " , which of course proved fruitless , but in the months they went on the workers who had built up a lot of confidence in the first day of strike action became slowly demoralised and demobilised .
The unions then helped negotiate a slightly less worse package of cuts , which they then recommended to their members .
And instead of presenting the offer in its true nature - as cuts , UNISON presented them as opposed to the initial proposed cuts , so they presented these attacks on conditions as improvements which had been won .
It was clear there was going to be no further industrial action , so 97 % of UNISON members accepted this deal .
This was a very useful lesson to me , as at this stage I did still hold some illusion in the unions as tools which workers could use to defend their conditions - as opposed to predominantly a barrier to be overcome , even in defensive struggles .
It was also a pattern which has sadly been to reoccur several times - in the public sector pay struggles of 2008 , and significantly in the postal workers strikes of 2007 and 2009 .
While at this council , I came across another part - time temp vacancy which I got .
It was in a small office on a housing estate .
The work was completely pointless : really tedious , completely bureaucratic , generic admin .
The work did n't involve helping tenants at all .
To this day I do n't really know what the team did .
Something to do with supposedly attempting to encourage " participation " and doing " consultation " .
We published lots of brochures depicting white people and black people holding hands .
To make matters worse my two bosses were absolute morons .
One asked me to edit a PDF of a chart .
I explained to her that I could not just edit the PDF electronically , I would need the source file and programme that it was created from .
I explained that the only way I could edit it would be to physically print is the edits onto small bits of paper , then cut them out , stick them over the original and photocopy it .
She told me to then do this .
When I presented at the final chart , she then had my other manager pulled me into her office for a bollocking for not following her instructions and making an electronic edited document .
I tried to explain that this was physically impossible , but this boss was even more cretinous than the first .
When I was hospitalised at the archiving job , I had to take time off sick from this job .
I did n't get a card , any phone calls or indeed anything from my managers asking how I was .
I then pretty much decided to do absolutely fuck all .
After I decided this , having two managers I realised could have its advantages .
Whenever one asked me to do something , I told them I was doing too much work for the other , and I would get to it when I could .
The regular tasks I was given to do , like sort through these trays of documents to file , I would just shuffle around the couple of papers at the top and leave it .
I was the only one who checked the voicemail , so I just started deleting all the messages without listening to them .
Then basically all day I would spend posting news stories to libcom , editing stuff for the history section , e-mailing and calling people .
If I got left alone in the office then I would nap at the desk .
My biggest achievement was that for four weeks I did absolutely no work at all .
Then basically my two managers spoke to one another .
I got wind of this happening , then one of them asked to meet with me the next day .
I invented a doctor 's appointment to avoid that , then I quit .
My other job in the training department soon came to an end when the department was deleted in a restructure .
But thankfully shortly after I applied for a permanent job , and for the first time actually got it !
So , after seven years of temping and part - time casual work , I finally had a proper job with a regular pay cheque , so I would n't have to worry so much about being able to make rent this month .
Of course , it 's still crap , but it does n't mean I will lose my home if I get ill for more than two weeks .
During the time I was temping , many times I have seen the issue raised in radical circles of how to organise agency workers .
Now , this is an important issue , as agency working is a key way employers are breaking up workers ' organisation and making all of us more " flexible " to suit them - disposable with few rights .
However , many of the suggestions which keep coming up are deeply flawed .
The main two I am thinking of here are starting a union for temp workers , or starting a temp workers co-op .
On the union front , firstly contrary to what many people believe unions are not simply organisations of workers to defend workers ' interests , but in fact are primarily large bureaucracies concerned with perpetuating themselves and their positions of influence .
Effectively their social role is to help negotiate the sale of pliant labour to capital - and to do this they must be able to control their membership .
This is gone into in much more detail in our section on unions here .
Secondly , even if recruiting workers into unions could help them , agency workers are so split up and divided across so many sites and employers that this would be impractical .
While employed by agencies , temp workers are usually much more affected by the workplaces they are based in , which hire them .
And these are the organisations who are ultimately paying their wages as well .
With an agency workers co-op , the same pressures would be exerted on it by the market as exerted on all other agencies - the need to cut costs and provide staff who will work the hardest for the least money .
The problems of workers co-op 's within a capitalist economy are gone into in much more detail in this debate here .
So basically I think the only practical way of improving conditions for agency workers is for permanent and agency staff in particular workplaces to organise together .
Workers on permanent contracts can do a lot to help this , and more generally can try to challenge the actual use of agency workers .
However , people should be careful that they do not blame agency workers themselves for any problems which result from the use of agency staff - the problem is the agency work itself .
Now I 'm permanent , we invite agency workers and non-union members to union meetings .
We all share the same problems where we work , and more we talk together and discuss issues which affect us the clearer it becomes that we are all in the same boat .
We try to get agency workers to support us if ever we take some sort of industrial action - which we have done in national strikes over pay , as well as in local boycotts to get a suspended worker reinstated .
In return , we help try to get agency workers permanent jobs , and support them individually with any problems they have with management .
These are very small steps , but we have got results , and so over time local workplace cultures can be changed , and workers can take them with them when they leave .
I hope that this text has contributed again in a small way towards encouraging workers to try to approach their problems collectively .
Please post up here if you have any similar stories of work avoidance or workplace resistance .

Horses drawing buggies regularly clop down the roads approaching Lancaster , Pennsylvania a peaceful city in the heart of Amish country that had only three murders last year and relatively low crime .
But if the community sounds reminiscent of the past , it also has some distinctly modern technology : 165 surveillance cameras that will keep watch over thousands of residents around the clock .
When it is complete , the surveillance system will be bigger than those in large cities such as Philadelphia , San Francisco and Boston .
And the fact that it will be monitored by ordinary citizens has raised privacy concerns .
" They are using fear to sell the cameras as much as possible , " said Charlie Crystle , a member of a fledgling citizens group that opposes the cameras and is trying to raise public awareness about them .
" There 's just a huge potential for personal and political abuse . "
Officials in the city of 54,000 say the cameras have deterred crimes and helped solve them .
The white , domed cameras sit atop utility poles in public spaces , business districts and some residential areas .
They are monitored 18 to 24 hours a day by employees of the Lancaster Community Safety Coalition , a non-profit board with workers who report suspected crimes to police .
Lancaster is the seat of Lancaster county , a popular and peaceful tourist destination known for having one of the nation 's largest Amish populations .
Horses and buggies are common on surrounding roads .
The safety coalition , directed by city councilman Joseph Morales , screens prospective monitors and provides training about racial profiling and how to spot trouble .
The group has seven monitors , all paid .
The coalition does not release their names .
Monitors sit in a room with two large plasma screens and six smaller ones , each divided into views of different cameras .
A joystick allows them to zoom in or move the cameras if they see something unusual .
If they do , they call police .
" What they are typically seeing is people in their everyday life going through their business , " Morales said .
" They 're looking for anything out of the ordinary . "
A special commission recommended the $ 2.7 m ( £ 1.6 m ) camera system in 2001 in response to a spike in some crimes .
Police chief Keith Sadler strongly supports having citizens monitor the cameras because he does not have the manpower to do it with a force of 159 officers , about 20 fewer than two years ago .
" In this economy , nobody has the luxury to take cops off the street , " Sadler said .
" You are probably watched more by non-police agencies than you are by us . "
Lancaster has seen some declines in property crimes since the cameras went up , but those numbers have fluctuated — along with the totals for violent crimes .
Despite inconclusive statistical evidence , police and the commission say the cameras are providing officers with a new tool .
Last year , commission workers called police 492 times and provided video to police 305 times .
That work led to 82 arrests and 86 citations , as well as 18 charges pending .
Police also credit the cameras with helping to solve a murder in which a man was shot outside a restaurant and the shooting was caught on tape .
Other small cities have also invested in surveillance cameras , though not as heavily as Lancaster .
In Wilmington , Delaware , the city of about 73,000 developed a network of 21 publicly owned cameras and networked them with more than 200 private cameras owned by businesses .
That city also has 37 neighbourhood cameras , and the combined system is monitored by a non-profit group , which refers calls to the police .
Wilkes - Barre , a north - eastern Pennsylvania city even smaller than Lancaster , is planning to install 150 cameras this year , also monitored by a non-profit .
Some research has cast doubt on just how much surveillance systems reduce crime .
A January study by the University of California found that cameras did not reduce homicide in San Francisco but did help reduce the number of burglaries and some thefts .
A New York University study found that cameras did not do much to deter crime in some public housing projects .
Those findings and others are part of why Crystle and other critics do not think the effort is worth the risk in a small town like Lancaster .
He also points to examples such as Cambridge , Massachusetts , where officials decided in February against adding surveillance cameras because of privacy concerns .
Crystle and others in Lancaster say they have done nothing to warrant being watched .
Nick Boots , who owns a barber shop near a camera , said he thinks the city is using fear to gain support for the cameras .
" Through the fear of the perceived threat , people are willing to give up certain rights , " Boots said .
" You got to think of Lancaster now being like an open - air prison .
Who 's the warden ? "
Others praise the project , including Francisco Cruz , 65 , owner of Cruz Barber Shop , who said he 's seen less drug dealing and fewer prostitutes outside his shop since cameras went up .
" I do n't care if they put one right here in the shop , " Cruz said .
The American Civil Liberties Union also objects to the project , especially since it covers the entire city — not just high - crime areas .
" When you have a blanket network of surveillance , you are no longer about solving crime , " said ACLU attorney Mary Catherine Roper , citing studies that show cameras mainly help solve just small crimes .
" Now you 're talking about a surveillance community . "
“ Some in the Taliban have similar agendas that have helped Al Qaeda with safe havens , ’’ he told reporters at the daily press briefing .
“ There ’s also a significant number of Taliban that are local warlords that have far different agendas . ’’
The new intelligence analyses were requested by military commanders earlier this year with the hopes of identifying who might be open to accommodation .
The data are informing the heated debate within the Obama administration on whether to send tens of thousands of additional troops to wage a counterinsurgency campaign in Afghanistan .
Robert Gibbs , White House press secretary , indicated yesterday that the makeup of the insurgency is playing a prominent role in the discussions .
“ That does n’t sound like someone who wants to create a global caliphate , ’’ said Arturo Munoz , who retired earlier this year after a 30 - year career as a CIA analyst and case officer and is now a senior political scientist at the government - funded Rand Corporation .
“ There is a completely homegrown Pashtun tradition of Jihad , which is different from radical [ followers of the Taliban ] and goes back centuries .
We are just the latest foreign invader . ’’
The Afghan fighters use the threat of force to further their own economic interests - extorting payments from people shipping goods through the mountains including , in some cases , even US military supplies coming into Afghanistan from Pakistan , the officials said .
The nonreligious motivations give American war planners some hope that they can reduce the power of these militias , and perhaps even co-opt their support with a new set of strategies and incentives .
US commanders and politicians often loosely refer to the enemy as the Taliban or Al Qaeda , giving rise to the image of holy warriors seeking to spread a fundamentalist form of Islam .
But the mostly ethnic Pashtun fighters are often deeply connected by family and social ties to the valleys and mountains where they are fighting , and they see themselves as opposing the United States be cause it is an occupying power , the officials and analysts said .
“ Ninety percent is a tribal , localized insurgency , ’’ said one US intelligence official in Washington who helped draft the assessments .
“ Ten percent are hardcore ideologues fighting for the Taliban . ’’
Some of the major insurgent groups , including one responsible for a spate of recent American casualties , actually opposed the Taliban ’s harsh Islamic government in Afghanistan during the 1990s , according to the reports , described by US officials under the condition they not be identified .
WASHINGTON - Nearly all of the insurgents battling US and NATO troops in Afghanistan are not religiously motivated Taliban and Al Qaeda warriors , but a new generation of tribal fighters vying for control of territory , mineral wealth , and smuggling routes , according to summaries of new US intelligence reports .
Indeed , the intelligence reports say the Taliban movement that harbored the Al Qaeda terrorist network before the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks is responsible for only a small share of the rising attacks - mostly in southern Afghanistan , according to the officials .
“ The term [ Taliban ] has come to have a meaning far beyond what the United States should care about ’’ militarily , said Frederick W. Kagan , a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute who is advising US military commanders .
He added : “ The one that most threatens our effort in Afghanistan is the Taliban group that is based out of Quetta in Pakistan .
It is headed by Mullah [ Mohammed ] Omar , who was the former head of the Taliban government in Afghanistan . . . and his former cronies in that government . ’’
The long - term strategy must include an effort by the Afghan government to “ reintegrate ’ ’ many insurgents into society , an enormously complex task that requires much greater effort than just more troops , according to government advisers and private specialists .
The recent assessment by General Stanley A. McChrystal , the top US commander in Afghanistan , outlined the connections between insurgent groups and the original Taliban leadership that fled to Pakistan .
It also raises prospects for reconciliation with some of them .
For example , two major insurgent groups are believed to have allied with the Taliban to protect their sphere of influence , not to wage a holy war against the West .
The Taliban often help train local militias , but in exchange for loyalty also offer income - including in the form of wives and dowries - to many warlords , said Bruce Hoffman , a professor at Georgetown University who also advises the US government on terrorism and counterinsurgency strategy .
“ It is economics , ’’ Hoffman said .
McChrystal ’s assessment called for a “ credible program to offer eligible insurgents reasonable incentives to stop fighting and return to normalcy , possibly including the provision of employment and protection . ’’
Underneath , however , there is also simply a strong desire to repel foreign invaders , US officials believe , which may be harder to overcome .
They are fighting “ more out of xenophobia than Islamic fundamentalism , ’’ said a defense official with access to the latest intelligence assessments on Afghanistan .
The good news , however , is that many of them may be enticed to come over to the other side , said Munoz .
“ Foreigners have been playing the ‘ great game ’ for centuries in Afghanistan , ’’ he said , citing the Persians , Russians , British , and other outside powers who enlisted the Afghan people to further their interests .
“ You need the Afghans to play .
They have been only too willing to play - as long as they see a benefit for themselves . ’’

Larry O'Brien recently interviewed three of the Gang of Four about their seminal work on patterns .
Larry teased the interview 's readers for awhile , but he eventually asked the pressing question that most language designers ask and debate about patterns ;)
Here it is :
Larry :
GoF came out relatively early in the ascent of OOP as the mainstream paradigm and , for better or worse , " patterns " seem to be associated with OO approaches .
You even hear functional and dynamic advocates boasting that their languages " do n't need " patterns .
How do you respond to that ?
Erich : Just as an aside , it is also easy to forget that we wrote design patterns before there was Java or C# .
Ralph :
Some of those languages do n't need some of the patterns in Design Patterns because their languages provide alternative ways of solving the problems .
Our patterns are for languages between C++ and Smalltalk , which includes just about everything called " object - oriented , " but they certainly are not for every programming language .
I do n't think anybody actually says that programmers in other languages do n't need patterns ; they just have a different set of patterns .
Erich : Design patterns eventually emerge for any language .
Design dÃ©jÃ -vu is language neutral .
While these experiences are not always captured as patterns , they do exist .
The design principles for Erlang come to mind .
Larry :
Where would a person go to learn about patterns for dynamic and functional languages ?
Who 's making good contributions ?
Ralph :
If by " dynamic " you mean dynamic object - oriented languages like Smalltalk , Ruby or Python , then our patterns are applicable .
Functional languages require different patterns , but I do n't know who is working on them .
Updated Friday at 3:17 p.m. PDT with comments from Digsby .
When it comes to program installation , I 'm a strong believer in caveat emptor .
If a software publisher warns you during the installation process that it will install the Yahoo search bar or a Firefox extension along with its program , and makes it clear that you can opt out of it , then so be it .
Nobody 's forcing a gun to your head , and it 's important to read each of the installation screens no matter which program you 're installing -- at the very least to make sure that the program is not legitimately changing a directory or installing somewhere you do n't want it to be .

However , what 's made clear in this Lifehacker post , and I 've verified , is that popular multi-protocol instant messaging client Digsby will grab your processor cycles when you 're not looking and use them without giving you a say in the matter .
Whether Digsby is using your CPU for cancer research , the hunt for Yoda , or to help marketing agencies crunch their numbers is irrelevant .
By not giving you the opportunity to choose to do so , they are distributing malware .
Before you think that 's too harsh of a comparison , a botnet like the notorious Conficker does the same thing : it grabs your processor , and gives you no choice about it .
Digsby is merely polite about it , giving notice in the EULA and waiting until your system is idle .
Of course , nobody is forcing you to install the program , but they 're not exactly making this information prominently available .
To be fair to Digsby , they called out this behavior in a blog post back in December 2008 .
However , it 's not noted in the installation process itself , whereas the other opt - out choices have been made easy to see and decide upon .
This is abusing a user 's trust , because -- like the mention in the EULA -- the information is essentially buried and inaccessible unless you know to look for it .
As the comments to the Digsby blog post indicate , it 's been receiving negative feedback about this since it announced it .
To take no steps to rectify the situation except to give users more choices on promoting Digsby is unethical .
In light of all this , and the Digsby team 's reluctance to address what we consider a serious flaw in the program , the Download.com editorial team has decided to lower the ratings score for Digsby .
I 've requested comment from Digsby about their policies , and will update this post when I have a response .
Users looking for alternative multi-protocol IM clients should look at Pidgin , Miranda , Trillian , or VoxOx .
UPDATE : Digsby representatives have commented on the situation , both in a new blog post and directly to me .
I found this new blog post to be somewhat disingenuous .
It starts off by saying , " Several months ago , we started testing two unique revenue models to help us keep Digsby free and ad - free for all our users , " and then the next sentence points to the above - cited blog post from December 2008 .
That 's eight months ago , not exactly the standard definition ascribed to " several . "
It 's a minor point , but one I found emblematic of Digsby 's reaction to the situation because , as you 'll see , nothing 's changed .
The post continues , explaining that its relatively new installer is no different from other software publishers that offer a free product but force users to opt - out of installing a toolbar or search results hack .
As noted above , I agree with that premise .
Although it 's unfortunate that you have to opt - out to avoid these changes to your system , they are definitely presented clearly .
( Credit : Screenshot by Seth Rosenblatt / CNET )
After that , there 's an explanation of the " research module , " named Plura , which is the bit that borrows your CPU cycles .
" Some of the research Digsby conducts may be for nonprofit projects like the ones mentioned above ( in the blog post ) and some may be for paid projects , which will help us keep Digsby completely free , " the blog states , which means that whatever the project is that you 're being asked to donate your spare processor time to , you 're not going to learn what it is and it 's none of your business .
At least with SETI , you know what it is you 're donating your cycles to .
With Digsby , it 's a crap - shoot -- and hardly a transparent process .
When asked for comment last night , Steve Shapiro of Digsby said , " It 's clear from this that a lot of users still were n't aware of it since they do n't read the terms of service or track the blog closely , " and I think that 's a point we can all agree on .
He also said : " ( W ) e will be making a change in the product to make sure that every user we have now and every user who signs up from this point forward is clearly informed of what we do to keep Digsby free and shown how to enable / disable the functionality . "
Further e-mails with Digsby 's Director of Public Relations Erick Davidson revealed what those changes were : " When it runs for the first time , there will be a pop - up that will stay until the user reads more about it . "
Despite having left my computer idle for 30 minutes after doing a clean install of Digsby build 62 , when the Plura system theoretically would be running , I saw no pop - up warning when I returned to it .
Rushed out overnight , build 62 of Digsby does not include any changes to the installation process .
When asked , Davidson stated that this was because the installer is provided by another company , and added in a follow - up e-mail that there is no time line at the moment for introducing a toggle to Plura into the installer .
Users who want to keep Digsby but do n't want the Plura system to run can disable it by going to the menu bar Help option , clicking on Support Digsby , and choosing Disable for Help Digsby Conduct Research .
As I 've said , the issue for me is n't that Digsby is running Plura , it 's that it 's doing it without giving users the ability to opt - out before installation .
Given that Digsby 's competitors are able to offer similar and , in some cases , identical features , and that they 're able to do it without burying a bad - faith feature in the EULA or behind a semi-functional pop-up , I 'm going to stand by my assessment from yesterday :
For now , do n't use Digsby .
Microsoft 's Courier booklet was surprising , mostly because it was so far outside of what everybody now expects from a tablet .
This internal video shows how Microsoft thinks we 'll use Courier .
Advertisement
Since publishing the first leak , several more people have come forward with details on the Courier project .
Advertisement
This video is produced by the same firm that collaborated with Microsoft 's Pioneer Studios on the previous clip , and it walks through a slightly different ( and more conservative / realistic ) iteration of the Courier interface .
While the first video showed a handful of use cases , this one actually provides an overview of the interface and Courier 's features , and more of how you would actually use it if you are not a designer .
The heart of Courier appears to what 's called the " infinite journal , " which is what it sounds like : A journal / scrapbook that is endless , bound only by storage constraints ( presumably ) .
Hopefully they will call it something less awkward .
The journal can actually be published online , and it 's shown here as able to be downloaded in three formats : a Courier file , Powerpoint or PDF .
There 's also a library that looks a lot like Delicious Library , where things like subscriptions , notebooks and apps , are stored .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
This interface does share a few things in common with the other one :
In particular , the hinge between the screens is still used as a pocket to " tuck " items you want to move from one page to another .
It also still revolves almost exclusively around using the pen for input :
In 4 minutes of video , there 's not a virtual keyboard in sight .
Fingers are still used just to navigate , through flicks , swipes and pinches .
The interface has a few more traditional elements than the first video , with more of a Microsoft feel ( fonts and titles bars ) and less of the entirely handwritten journal aesthetic : a smart agenda , more defined folder system , universal search and multi-page web browsing .
It feels more evolved and fined , and less convoluted , suggesting it 's more recent .
Advertisement
It also begins to bring into focus Courier 's priorities , and possible limitations :
Other than the brief glimpse at the library and the web browser , there is basically nothing about viewing content , like watching movies , reading books , or listening to music .
Courier , in this iteration , appears to be all about creating and writing with a pen , which is vastly different from what everybody expects out of the Apple tablet .
We expect to have more a in - depth breakdown of the Courier interface in the next few days , so stay tuned .

16 vertices .
This is beyond what can be achieved on 32 - bit architectures with the Boost Graph Library Nocycle is an open source library that started with a desire to make a data structure that could store a directed acyclic graph in a somewhat minimized adjacency matrix format .
It can work with over 2vertices .
This is beyond what can be achieved on 32 - bit architectures with the Boost Graph Library adjacency_matrix ... which in my tests on gcc 4.0.1 stopped working after around 12,000 vertices .
As an additional thought experiment , I decided to try getting the DAG to keep a cached sidestructure of its own transitive closure .
Though this goal has been achieved , more clever methods will be needed to make it palatable for use on large graphs where edge insertions and removals are frequent .
So by default , caching is disabled and Nocycle uses a depth - first - search when reachability needs to be calculated ( such as to prevent inserting a link that would cause a cycle ) .
Though really only an exercise at this point , I did n't see why I should n't put this out for others to use or peer - review .
So the code is released under the Boost Software License .
This permits liberal inclusion in both open source or commercial software , and I welcome comments or improvements .
You can download it from GitHub , or just browse the source :
Note
The current choice of public inheritance vs. private inheritance vs. composition is driven completely by expedience .
What role virtual methods will play needs to solidify , as well as what the best directions would be to build a storage class compatible with the boost templates .
The rest of this page I 'll devote to explaining the implementation .
Compact Representation
V0 , V1 , V2 ) :
The way Nocycle stores its graph data is as an adjacency matrix .
However , it 's more compact than people typically bother to write .
Let 's start by imagining we are using an adjacency matrix for just 3 vertices ( ) :
V0 V1 V2 V0 .. B1 B3 V1 B2 .. B4 V2 B5 B6 ..
Excluding connections from vertices to themselves " .. " , we need six binary bits ( B[ n ] ) which indicate whether a directed edge exists .
There are two independent bits for each vertex pairing in the set , one for each direction .
For instance , B1 tells us if V0 points to V1 ( V0 → V1 ) , while B2 tells us if V1 points to V0 ( V0 ← V1 ) .
However , if we are working with a directed graph that specifically prohibits cycles , we do n't need two fully independent bits to encode the relationship between a pair of vertices .
This is because V[ x ] → V[y ] and V[ x ] ← V[y ] are mutually exclusive , and allowing such connections would create an instant cycle !
So for each pairing of vertices , we only need a tristate :
V0 V1 V2 V0 .. T0 T1 V1 XX .. T2 V2 XX XX ..
Where before we needed six bits , we now have three tristates ( T[z ] ) , each of which can hold one of these possibilities :
s0 : no connection
s1 : lower numbered vertex points to higher numbered vertex
s2 : higher numbered vertex points to lower numbered vertex
This representation saves us from accommodating states where vertices both point to each other .
Generally speaking , you 'll need half as many tristates as you 'd need bits ... and a tristate needs slightly less than two bits to be represented .
It 's an approximately 20 % space savings , and you can see the Nstate library for some generalized helper classes that I wrote to make this transparent to the graph code layer .
I wanted to allow for fast dynamic growth ... from just a few vertices to thousands .
For this reason , the cells are mapped into positions in a linear tristate array such that the connection information for higher numbered vertices appears after all the data for connections between lowered numbered vertices .
Therefore a scheme that works for K vertices can be resized in place for K+δ or K -δ vertices without disrupting the existing data .
It is still possible to represent cyclical graphs in this format , so not all encodings will be valid DAGs .
The broader class of what we are capable of representing are something called oriented graphs .
From Wikipedia :
The oriented graph , is a graph ( or multigraph ) with an orientation or direction assigned to each of its edges .
A distinction between a directed graph and an oriented simple graph is that if x and y are vertices , a directed graph allows both ( x , y ) and ( y , x ) as edges , while only one is permitted in an oriented graph .
So in Nocycle , I implemented the class Directed AcyclicGraph using the foundation of a class called OrientedGraph ( which , in turn , is implemented on top of NstateArray !)
Note
The usual caveats for an adjacency - matrix based implementation apply !
Getting its list of incoming or outgoing edges involves searching all slots paired with other vertices .
So regardless of how many connections a vertex has , the cost associated with getting the full list is proportional to O ( V ) ... where V is the number of vertices in the graph .
Answering the question about whether any specific linkage exists is still O ( 1 ) .
Tracking Vertex Existence
Boost .
Graph 's adjacency_matrix does not currently implement boost :: add_vertex or boost :: remove_vertex .
More generally , boost graphs always have a number of functional vertices equal to their current capacity .
So although you can have a vertex with no incoming our outgoing edges , you can't have a descriptor in your vertex in your graph which " does not currently exist " .
Nocycle can " push " and " pop " vertices at the end of the store , and deleting vertices in the middle opens up a space that can be reused .
To assist in managing currently unused vertex IDs , an additional tristate per vertex is folded into the memory layout to track its existence .
This revised organization for 4 vertices shows the tristate indexes and whether they are ( C ) onnections or ( E ) xistence for the pertinent vertices :
V0 V1 V2 V3 V0 E0 C2 C5 C9 V1 XX E1 C4 C8 V2 XX XX E3 C7 V3 XX XX XX E6
Now we have an array T[ ] which contains both the existence tristate E ( with an unused state ) and the connection tristates C. We need the function E( N ) where T[ E ( N ) ] is the existence tristate for vertex N. Also , we need C ( S , L ) such that T [ C ( S , L ) ] is the connection tristate for V×S and V×L ( where S < L ) .
First , E( N ) is easy .
It 's the sum of the first N natural numbers :
E( N ) => N*( N+1 ) /
2
A slight tweak will give us C ( S , L ) for the connection between a smaller numbered vertex and a larger one :
C( S , L ) => E( L ) + ( L - S )
This way we have a growth model that lets us encode existence and connectivity in a linear series of tristates , that can expand and shrink .
I elected to use the extra state of the existence tristate as a second " vertex type " -- so all vertices that exist may be either vertexTypeOne or vertexTypeTwo .
Reachability Calculation
An important question for a directed acyclic graph is whether one vertex can reach another by following a path of edges along the direction of the arrows .
To get an idea of what that means , let 's imagine you have a graph like this one ( from Wikipedia ) :
" Can Vertex 7 Reach Vertex 10 ? "
Yes : by going via Vertex 11
" Can Vertex 9 Reach Vertex 8 ? "
No : arrow points the wrong way
" Can Vertex 3 Reach Vertex 5 ? "
No : no path connects them
Answering this question is particularly useful for determining if it is safe to insert an edge into the graph without creating cycles .
To see this is the case , imagine making an edge pointing from Vertex 2 to Vertex 7 in the graph above .
This would create the cycle 2 → 7 → 11 →2 ... but it would have been avoidable if you had realized that 7 " canreach " 2 prior to making that link !
O ( V + E ) and a space complexity of O ( V ) .
This is the default implementation for computing reachability in Nocycle .
It should also be noted that when you account for the overhead of querying the adjacency - matrix to get the list of connections for a given vertex , the O ( V ) performance of that operation gives rise to an effective time complexity more like O ( V2 ) (!!)
Most programs use search algorithms to answer questions of reachability , and those searches slow down as the number of vertices and / or edges increase .
A depth - first search is a common approach , which has a time complexity ofand a space complexity of .
This is the default implementation for computing reachability in Nocycle .
It should also be noted that when you account for the overhead of querying the adjacency - matrix to get the list of connections for a given vertex , theperformance of that operation gives rise to an effective time complexity more like ( !!)
The flag DIRECTEDACYCLICGRAPH_CACHE_REACHABILITY tries to cache the transitive closure to provide O ( 1 ) answers to reachability .
A compact graph representation mitigates the fact that storing the transitive closure alongside a graph effectively doubles its size .
( Nocycle can hold a 4 vertex graph and its transitive closure in just 64 bits ! )
Unfortunately , keeping the transitive closure in sync on a volatile graph is computationally expensive . :(
To see this , imagine performing an insertion from fromVertex→toVertex .
We know that all vertices that canreach fromVertex ( including fromVertex ! ) can now reach toVertex , as well as anything toVertex can reach .
We must union toVertex 's reachability onto each member of the set canreach ( from ) ... which for a graph with V vertices is an O ( V2 ) time - complexity operation with O ( V ) space complexity .
When you add in that merely getting the connectivity list for a vertex in an adjacency matrix is a significant O ( V ) operation , you 're approaching an O ( V3 ) worst case scenario .
Note O ( V3 ) without the need for the O ( V ) operation of getting an adjacent vertices list .
So when incremental maintenance has a worst case with the same upper bound as a full regeneration , there 's cause for thinking carefully about whether the nature of the data and access pattern warrants invalidation .
Building the transitive closure from scratch with the Floyd - Warshall algorithm is onlywithout the need for theoperation of getting an adjacent vertices list .
So when incremental maintenance has a worst case with the same upper bound as a full regeneration , there 's cause for thinking carefully about whether the nature of the data and access pattern warrants invalidation .
Experimental Code
I tried a few techniques to improve performance on volatile graphs .
For instance , I used the cache graph 's vertexTypeTwo to indicate when the outgoing reachability for that vertex might have false positives .
This made it possible to defer the transitive closure update while still knowing something in the meantime ( e.g. that if there was n't an edge to a vertex in the reachability graph , then it still could definitely not be reached ) .
Also , I noticed that storing reachability links for vertices that were directly connected was somewhat redundant .
After all , one can check for adjacency of V×x and V×y in O ( 1 ) ... so performing that check prior to checking the reachability does not cost much .
This made it possible to " reclaim " a tristate for every edge in the main graph .
If you enable DIRECTEDACYCLICGRAPH_USER_TRISTATE , then this tristate becomes available for client use .
Once I had reclaimed this tristate for every edge for the user , I decided to try taking it back to see if it could add features to the cache .
With the compile flag DIRECTEDACYCLICGRAPH_CACHE_REACH_WITHOUT_LINK
, then two of the three possible tristates are used to answer the yes / no question of " Could the vertex pointed to by this edge be reached even if the physical edge were removed . "
If that is true , then you know the link can be removed without propagating any further invalidation of the cache .
It might be an interesting question for certain clients in its own right .
These optimizations do n't do anything about the worst case performance , and do n't help on volatile graphs .
But at least they give a background process something to clean up that may accelerate certain operations .
If there 's a long wait between insertions and deletions , and a lot of reachability checks in the meantime ... they could enable some interesting scenarios .
The regression tests handle these variations , so regardless of whether they 're useful -- they work and can be kept working . :)
Further Directions
My attempt at caching the transitive closure was fairly simple and had the natural burden for maintaining such a cache .
This is a general - application implementation , there is room for optimization on specialized cases where more is known about the data or access pattern .
One aspect that I found discussed in academic papers is leveraging the idea of " strongly connected subgraphs " to compute transitive closure efficiently .
And if you know more about the nature of your graph -- such as if it is sparse , or any other special properties , then " graph labeling " approaches are also used .
As I 've read more about the Boost Graph Library , I see that one of the main reasons for its abstruse mechanics is to facilitate the application of its algorithms to custom data structures without loss of performance .
It would be interesting to see an adapter developed that used Oriented Graph as a store for applying to boost graph algorithms .
Perhaps it could be called boost : : adjacency_spiral , and bring about some of the missing resizability and scalability that boost : : adjacency_matrix does n't have for DAGs ?
If you know of any other interesting ideas , post a comment or email me !
Why are we asking this now ?
Because research published yesterday suggests that when cyclists ride in dedicated lanes motorists give them less room .
Teams at Leeds and Bolton universities , supported by CTC , the national cyclists ' organisation , put a camera on the back of a bike being ridden along three roads in the north of England .
Analysis of the footage revealed that drivers gave up to 18 cm ( seven inches ) more space to cyclists on stretches without cycle lanes .
The findings question the perceived wisdom that slapping down strips of green paint and white lines makes riding safer .
And as cycling continues to enjoy a boom , the suggestion that cycle lanes could be endangering rather than protecting users highlights increasingly fraught relationship between riders and drivers .
Why is this a big deal ?
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Cycling is booming like never before .
In the capital alone there has been a 91 per cent increase in the number of cycle journeys since 2000 as commuters ditch gridlock and delay in favour of fresh air and exercise .
But not everyone 's prepared to take to two wheels .
" The main barrier stopping as many as two - thirds of the people who do n't cycle regularly is a fear of traffic , " says Chris Peck , CTC 's policy chief .
" While cycle lanes can have a positive effect , bad facilities only make those initial excursions terrifying , putting people off altogether . "
Why do drivers behave this way ?
It comes down to psychology .
" The very existence of cycle lanes can lead to drivers to being lazier when overtaking because they believe the space between the cycle lane and the middle of the road is their territory , " Peck says .
It 's though the presence of a solid white line offers the illusion – to both rider and driver – of a barrier behind which cyclists are protected .
When the barrier is not there , drivers take care as they move to overtake cyclists rather than roaring past with inches to spare .
Other research suggests drivers react in similar way to cyclists wearing helmets .
In 2006 , a traffic psychologist at the University of Bath found drivers gave him less room when he was wearing head protection than when he rode helmet - free .
How long have cycle lanes been around ?
Almost as long as bicycles .
And sharing space was a problem long before the car chugged and beeped its way on to the streets .
A New York Times report on the early explosion of cycling published in 1896 describes how " riders found no favor on the roads .
They were liable to wayside abuse and to legal injustice ...
If they took their machines on the roads where carriages travelled , they were in some localities liable to arrest . "
Tension only increased with the arrival of the internal combustion engine and in pre-war Britain the cycling lobby even attempted to confine cars to specially - built " motor roads " .
Of course they failed and the car would become king .
What have other studies found ?
This latest research is n't the first to paint cycle lanes in a bad light .
Studies in Sweden , Denmark , Finland and Milton Keynes have also shown an increased risk for cyclists using lanes .
And in 2007 , the Cycle Campaign Network , an umbrella organisation representing 70 local cycling groups , said it " knows of no evidence that cycle facilities and in particular cycle lanes , generally lead to safer conditions for cycling " .
Can lanes be effective ?
Only when they 're properly built and in the right places .
Government standards require cycle lanes to be two metres wide , with a minimum width of 1.5 metres .
But all the lanes used in the latest research fell short – and CTC believes that the same is true of the " vast majority " of Britain 's bike lanes .
" You would n't see authorities skimping on lane width when it comes to motorways , " Peck says .
" Even if drivers are being lazy that 's not so much of a problem if the cycle lane is wide enough to give the required berth . "
Other cycle lane failures include stretches that stop suddenly , depositing riders back into traffic .
Are lanes always a good idea ?
Not in slower traffic .
" It 's the difference in speeds on the road that creates danger , " Peck says .
" Cycle lanes try to alleviate that by creating separate areas but they are n't always successful .
But if traffic is limited to 20 mph , that 's the speed at which road users can mix happily . "
Many local authorities have started to introduce 20 mph limits in residential and urban areas in recent years .
The " shared space " scenario which this allows has become something of a global trend in urban planning .
In some places , including parts of Ashford in Kent , kerbs , traffic lights , road markings and signs have been ripped out .
In almost all cases , average speeds and accident rates have dropped .
CTC believes it's an approach that should be adopted more widely .
Peck says : " Even if you only went so far as to allow one - way roads to go two ways for cyclists it would increase the ability to navigate back streets away from dangerous main roads . "
What 's the story in other countries ?
Generally better but for an example of cycling nirvana we must pedal to Denmark , where the capital was last month named the best city in the world for cyclists .
Copenhagen boasts more than 200 miles of cycle routes and bikes have priority over cars at many junctions .
As a result , a third of people cycle to work , school or university , and accidents are rare .
" It 's astonishing how many people cycle there , " Peck says .
" And they have huge , wide cycle paths .
The size and design of British roads would make that difficult but reducing speed and rethinking how we use what we have would make a big difference . "

In what other ways can we improve cyclist - driver relations ?
Some say that training would be a useful way to make road users see eye to eye .
" There should be an element of cycle awareness in the driving test , " Peck says .
" Ideally learner drivers should also be given the chance to find out what it 's like to cycle on our roads . "
Peck also believes cyclists would be reassured if they were shown how to share the roads safely .
Cycling proficiency tests area traditionally associated with children and schools but Peck says " training should n't just be for kids " .
CTC has established a national standard for cycle training and has contacts with a nationwide network of instructors offering courses in how to ride assertively and with confidence on the roads in your area . "
And the ultimate solution ?
More cycling !
CTC 's recent " Safety in Numbers " report records a 91 percent increase in cycling in London since 2000 and a 33 per cent fall in casualties .
It 's a similar story all over the country .
The theory goes that more cyclists means that drivers , increasing numbers of whom also ride , are more aware .
And whether you 're on a ( hopefully intelligently designed ) cycle lane or sharing space with road users doing reasonable speeds , that means less fear and fewer accidents .
So get on your bike .
So should cycle lanes be got rid of ?
Yes ...
* Several studies suggest they encourage drivers to steer too close to cyclists
* All too often they are too narrow , poorly built and in dangerously inappropriate places
* They only serve to increase the rising tensions betweent motorists and cyclists
No ...
* Effective cycle lanes reassure riders who would otherwise be put off by a fear of traffic
* Conspicuous bike paths can reinforce the impression that cycling is the way to travel
* As the cycling boom continues , anything that makes roads more organised is positive

As Good Looks Increase ...
If you happen to be an extremely good looking person who is now sad because of this chart , we suggest the following : 1 . Walk into a room with a mirror .
2 . Look into that mirror .
Alt - Text :
If you disagree with anything about this chart you obviously hate science .
If you had to create a mortgage that was more toxic and more destructive than a subprime loan , you would have a very hard time creating that product .
Yet leave it to creative finance to spawn a devilish product with the unique name of option ARMs .
The option ARM is a 30 - year adjustable rate mortgage which offers borrowers four different monthly payments .
You have the 30 - year fully amortizing payment , a 15 - year fully amortizing payment , the interest - only payment , and the most popular last option of “ negative amortization . ”
The illusion and Orwellian language of this loan gave the impression that borrowers would have tremendous options in paying off their mortgage .
The facts are disturbingly different for this Jekyll and Hyde mortgage .
Over 80 percent of option ARM holders elected to go with the smallest payment .
The option ARM is a subset of the Alt - A toxic mortgage universe .
In the midst of the major bank failure circus Washington Mutual , Wachovia , and Countrywide Financial all were swallowed up with their option ARMs into the belly of JP Morgan , Wells Fargo , and Bank of America .
The three firms are now gone but their option ARMs linger creating banking indigestion .
In California these loans were highly popular with the decade long housing bubble .
Imagine paying only $ 1,479 a month for a $ 460,000 loan .
Things are good with the teaser payment and then the mortgage transforms into a toxic giant that ’ll eat you alive .
Take a look at a Countrywide loan example given to us in a suit brought on by the California Attorney General :
Things increase little by little until you hit the fifth year .
At that point , you run out of options and your payment jumps up to $ 3,747 and your balance has gone up to $ 523,792 because of the negative amortization .
The adorable little mortgage has turned into a ferocious lion ready to devour your monthly income .
Many here in California now find that they are in this situation .
They have an overvalued loan with a home that is off by 40 or 50 percent from the peak .
You have certain prime locations like Culver City that are loaded up with Alt - A loan products including option ARMs .
These will start recasting in mass later this year and into 2010 .
In light of the “ stellar ” earning being reported by financial institutions , the reality is the balance sheet for many is still riddled with toxic assets .
The commercial real estate bust is going to force many regional banks under .
These option ARMs are going to provide continued losses for each of the major banking players on Wall Street .
The only exception would probably be Goldman Sachs who did n’t drink the poison they were selling .
As it turns out , option ARMs are even more toxic than subprime loans .
Here are some facts to chew on :
Option ARMs
36.9 % of loans are 60 days past due
19 % in foreclosure
Subprime
33.9 % of subprime loans 60 days past due
14.5 % in foreclosure
To add fuel to the fire , most of these loans are in the states with the biggest bubbles .
Let us take a look at Wells Fargo and glance at the Pick - A - Pay portfolio :
68 percent of the balance is in California .
Another large portion is in Florida .
These loans are toxic and will be major losses for the bank going forward .
Yet there is a surprising trend going on .
Even though notice of defaults are sky high , you are not seeing the foreclosures hit the market .
I have heard from many that have gone past 6 months without making a payment and they are still waiting for that notice of default .
Why are banks not moving fast ?
Hard to say but it is probably because they are waiting for the public - private investment program to dump this stuff off to taxpayers or are simply overwhelmed by the amount of foreclosures they are seeing .
Many of the option ARMs will recast in 2010 with the peak being reached in 2011 .
If you look in the treasure chest of JP Morgan , you will find the artifacts left by WaMu :
These loan products were only useful in a gigantic once in a lifetime housing bubble .
They do not serve any other purpose .
I remember someone telling me that most of these loans were for “ doctors , lawyers , and those who do n’t want to document their income . ”
At least they got one of the three right .

Editor 's Note : Ruben Navarrette Jr. is a member of the San Diego Union - Tribune editorial board , a nationally syndicated columnist and a regular contributor to CNN.com .
Read his column here .
Ruben Navarrette says parents should n't worry so much that the film " Where the Wild Things Are " is too violent .
more photos »
San Diego , California ( CNN ) -- Maurice Sendak is my king .
No , not because Sendak , in 1963 , turned 10 sentences into a children 's classic .
" Where the Wild Things Are " tells the tale of a boy named Max who runs away from home and sails off to an island where the fantastical creatures that live there proclaim him their king .
And not because the film version of that book , directed by the brilliantly edgy Spike Jonze and co-written by Dave Eggers , took the No. 1 spot at the box office last weekend with $ 32.5 million .
Interestingly , this is less of a children 's movie than a movie about childhood .
Moviegoers 18 and over accounted for 43 percent of the audience while parents with children made up just 27 percent , according to distributor Warner Bros .
I do n't care about any of that .
I 'm probably the only member of Generation X who never read the book .
For what it 's worth , my wife and I did take our 4½ - year - old daughter to the movie last weekend , and I thought it was boring .
But the important thing is that my little girl loved it .
iReport.com : ' Wild Things ' okay for my kids
Did you catch that ?
All Americans need to take a deep breath and repeat after me :
Not everything has to be about you .
Sometimes you take your child to a movie , and , if you do n't like it , you keep your mouth shut and enjoy the popcorn .
In the film , Max acts out in ugly and violent ways , and winds up shouting at and biting his mother before running away from home .
Once on the island , the monsters Max encounters are moody , clingy , and occasionally violent .
You know , like Max .
See images from the film »
All week , I 've been reading about how many parents are wringing their hands over the movie , worried that it is too scary , too gloomy , too violent and too apt to inspire bad behavior in children .
One father reports that his daughter saw the movie and then promptly came home and bit her mother .
iReport.com : A lot of adults fell asleep
Yep , the movie 's definitely to blame for that -- better a bad movie than bad parenting .
I do n't think we 've done my daughter irreparable harm by exposing her to the Wild Things .
I 'm not losing any sleep over it , and -- to prove it -- my wife informs me that I dozed off for a few minutes in the theater .
No , the reason that the 81 - year - old Sendak is my king is because of what he said during a recent Newsweek interview that was intended to promote the film but no doubt wound up offending parents all over the country .
It went like this :
Reporter : " What do you say to parents who think the Wild Things film may be too scary ? "
Sendak : " I would tell them to go to hell .
That 's a question I will not tolerate . "
Reporter : " Because kids can handle it ? "
Sendak : " If they can't handle it , go home .
Or wet your pants .
Do whatever you like .
But it 's not a question that can be answered . "
Sendak : " This concentration on kids being scared , as though we as adults can't be scared .
Of course we 're scared .
I 'm scared of watching a TV show about vampires .
I can't fall asleep .
It never stops .
We 're grown - ups ; we know better , but we 're afraid . "
Reporter : " Why is that important in art ? "
Sendak : " Because it 's truth .
You do n't want to do something that 's all terrifying .
I saw the most horrendous movies that were unfit for child 's eyes .
So what ?
I managed to survive . "
Remember , this guy is 81 years old .
I miss the way people used to be .
A couple of generations ago , parents did n't worry about whether kids were happy all the time or comfortable 24/7 or wrapped in protective coating .
Of course , they did n't want their children hurt .
But it 's hard to imagine they would have spent much time and effort trying to keep kids from being scared .
Quite the contrary , they used to tell them scary stories at bedtime or on camping trips -- usually the kind intended to frighten little ones into behaving correctly .
" And then one day , all the kids who did n't listen to their mommies and daddies just disappeared . ... "
I get it .
We really , really , really like our children .
In fact , we love our children and we think they 're the most precious little darlings ever created , and so naturally we want to protect them .
And we should protect them from some things -- predators , disease , abuse , etc .
But we should n't protect them from all things .
And we certainly can't protect them from life .
And part of life is getting scared now and then .
In time , we learn to separate reality from fantasy .
And yet , while one infamous set of parents could face criminal charges for pretending their son was in a balloon , other parents think nothing of keeping their kids in a bubble .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr .

Button and Hamilton would make a strong line - up at McLaren New world champion Jenson Button has emerged as a contender to join Lewis Hamilton in what would be a mouth - watering line - up at McLaren in 2010 .
The Englishman has yet to sign a new contract for Brawn and McLaren are interested having so far failed to secure first choice Kimi Raikkonen .
" We 've talked to a number of drivers , " said team boss Martin Whitmarsh .
" It would n't be appropriate to say more than that .
We 'll hire the two best drivers available as we always have . "
Button 's manager Richard Goddard refused to comment on whether he had held talks with McLaren , but told BBC Sport : " Brawn could have sorted Jenson out weeks ago and none of this would be going on .
" We 've been trying to agree terms with them .
He 's made it clear he wants to stay and had they agreed a contract there would be no speculation .
A lot of quality seats may still be available so it 's down to Brawn to make us an offer
Richard Goddard
Jenson Button 's manager " The press will speculate that anyone with a free seat next year will be offering Jenson a drive - he has displayed his great talent in a good car this year .
" That speculation wo n't die until Brawn offer him new terms .
" A lot of quality seats may still be available so it 's down to Brawn to make us an offer .
But this stuff certainly did not stem from us . "
Raikkonen , who is also being chased by Toyota after being forced to leave Ferrari to make way for Fernando Alonso , has not yet decided on his future and McLaren are exploring other possibilities .
Their back - up plan if Raikkonen turned them down was to retain his fellow Finn Heikki Kovalainen , despite their reservations about his performances in races .
But following Button 's failure so far to agree terms on a new contract with Brawn , they are now understood to be interested in him - which would put the two most recent world champions , and two Englishmen , in one highly marketable line - up .
606 : DEBATE From a British point of view this would be fantastic if McLaren signed Button to go with Hamilton
ononeleg The Button - McLaren link first emerged in two national newspapers on Friday but it is understood there is substance in the story .
Button said on Tuesday that he wanted to stay with Brawn but that the team had yet to start substantive negotiations on a new deal .
Sources in F1 say the two parties have so far failed to agree on Button 's salary .
He took a pay cut from £ 10 m to about £ 3 m over the winter to help secure the survival of Brawn , who emerged from the ashes of the Honda team after the Japanese company decided to quit F1 last December .
But now he is world champion he is said to be looking for a pay rise more substantial than the one Brawn are offering .
McLaren , one of the better funded teams on the grid , would be able to pay more money than Brawn .
Button may also consider that McLaren are likely to have a faster car than Brawn in 2010 , having already overtaken them for pace this year despite a poor start to the season .
Could Button and Hamilton be driving the same cars for McLaren in 2010 ?
But Button might be wary of teaming up with Hamilton , who is widely regarded as the out - and - out fastest driver on the grid .
Cynics will claim that the Button - McLaren link could have been leaked for one of two reasons .
It could be either a means for Button to get Brawn to up their offer to him , or it could be a way of McLaren trying to persuade Raikkonen to make up his mind .
In the background , there is also the fact that McLaren 's long - term engine partner Mercedes is considering buying a large stake in the Brawn team , a move that is not popular in some parts of McLaren .

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) -
The founders of Skype have sued owner eBay Inc and an investor group that has agreed to buy the Webphone service , accusing them of copyright violation and potentially disrupting the $ 1.9 billion deal .
Skype Co-Founder and CEO Niklas Zennstroem speaks during the " Digital 2.0 : Powering a Creative Economy " session at the World Economic Forum ( WEF ) in Davos , Switzerland January 27 , 2006 .
REUTERS / Sebastian Derungs
The lawsuit brought by Joltid Ltd , a Swedish firm owned by Skype founders Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis , says Skype used its technology without authorization .
It comes on the heels of a legal dispute between Joltid and Skype in Britain over software rights .
Filed in Northern California U.S. District
Court this week , the latest suit seeks a permanent injunction against Skype and damages .
EBay has denied the allegations .
Joltid believes damages are piling up at a rate of more than $ 75 million a day .
“ The Skype companies have continued to infringe Joltid ’s copyrighted works on a massive scale , ” the lawsuit said .
“ Each day that the Skype Companies continue to make available its Internet telephone software for download , Skype users download Joltid ’s copyrighted works approximately six times per second . ”
Ebay licenses peer - to - peer technology from Joltid for Skype , but has begun to develop its own alternative software given the uncertain outcome of pending litigation with Joltid .
“ Their allegations and claims are without merit and are founded on fundamental legal and factual errors , ” eBay said in a statement .
Analysts have said the once - celebrated Skype business is an incongruous division of an Internet sales and auction house , and many have long urged the firm to spin off the unit or unload it .
The Internet auction house said on Wednesday it remained on track to close the Skype transaction in the fourth quarter .
JOOST BUSINESS
Ebay agreed to sell a 65 percent stake in Skype for $ 1.9 billion to a consortium including Netscape founder Marc Andreessen ’s Andreessen Horowitz , venture firm Index Ventures , private equity firm Silver Lake , and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board .
Joltid ’s suit named those investors as defendants , along with Skype , eBay , and Mike Volpi .
Sources last week said Zennstrom and Friis had contacted several private equity firms to try and buy back their old business .
Days ago , Web TV firm Joost -- also owned by Zennstrom and Friis -- removed Volpi as chairman .
Volpi had joined Index Ventures by that time .
Joost said they were investigating Volpi ’s actions during his tenure at the company , but did not elaborate .
Wednesday ’s developments are the latest in an escalating legal tussle .
Earlier this year , Skype filed a claim in the United Kingdom against Joltid , trying to resolve a dispute over a software licensing agreement between the parties that Joltid was seeking to terminate .
Joltid brought a counterclaim , reiterating that it holds the rights to the peer - to - peer technology and that Skype is in violation of the original agreement .
A trial is expected to take place in early 2010 in the United Kingdom .
Skype , whose 2008 revenue rose 44 percent to $ 551 million , charges for calls to regular telephones but provides free computer - to - computer voice , video and text services .
It had about 405 million registered users at the end of 2008 .
EBay ’s deal valued Skype at $ 2.75 billion but that was well below the $ 3.1 billion eBay spent in acquiring Skype .
Its shares rose slightly in extended trade to $ 24.38 after closing at $ 24.32 .

The more we explore the alternative side of life on this blog , the more we run into hacking .
This writer has a fair knowledge of computers but the finer details of hacking are elusive .
As recent news stories about hacks , DDoS attacks , identity theft and spying illustrate , hacking is just going to get bigger -- so we investigate it .
As a writer , I realised that my goals of increasing my own understanding of ' things in general ' is not dissimilar to what a hacker does .
As I mention in the About section that symbols or imagery may appear familiar and easily understood yet there are many things in the universe that are poorly understood , and one way to find out is to " hack " them .
Definition
In common vernacular " hacking " conveys a negative image of exploiting computers and abusing financial records .
To those familiar with hacking , there are three different types of hacker with their own definitions : Black Hat , White Hat and " Gray " Hat ( edit : I received an email to say that the hacker hats are a false construct see page two for a response to the hacker hats ) .
Black
Hat hacking is closest to the negative image the population has of hackers .
A Black
Hat hacker is there to exploit and abuse computer systems for profit , causing chaos , or increasing personal fame .
They do not trouble themselves with ethical considerations , but do with computer systems whatever their skill allows them to .
The opposite is White Hat hacking , motivated by good intentions , although we 'll leave the terms " good " and " bad " vague for now .
The neutral sense of the term " hacker , " and the one this article is inclined to use , is exemplified by " Gray " Hat hacking .
This definition is simple : the advancement of knowledge and understanding by do - it - yourself exploration .
The something does n't need to be in computing ; see the following definition
7. Computers . to devise or modify ( a computer program ) , usually skillfully .
The mindset required for hacking is that of an inquisitive mind -- a desire to learn more by taking taking something apart .
I can resonate with this sort of thinking but my own skills and knowledge is in physics rather than computing .
Curiosity is a trait common to philosophers , physicists , hackers , engineers , computer scientists and many more .
Curiosity in hacking may lead some to commit fraud ; curiosity in physics lead to the atomic bomb .
Goals
Why hack ?
From the definitions above the point of hacking is self - evident : learn by doing , regardless of The Rules .
Black Hats hack to exploit , perhaps for money or just to cause chaos .
Gray
Hats hack to understand something better and often publish their findings ; the end result is increased understanding and knowledge which could be used either for ' good ' or ' bad . '
White Hats use the information gained to warn people / companies about security risks ; they are ethical hackers .
Doing something exploitive for personal gain and at the cost of others is perhaps uncontentiously illegal .
However , discovering security flaws and making people away of security threats can be a helpful and necessary activity ( provided it does n't contradict previous statement ) .
Security website Sophos recently complained that hacking should always be illegal , but their grounds for making it illegal are
based on Black Hat hacking .
Microsoft recently changed their view towards ethical hacking ;
The article states " Microsoft are starting to get serious about security , in a very progressive move they have said they are ok with ethical hackers finding security flaws in their online services .
It ’s been fairly ok so far to hack away at software installed on your own hardware , but hitting remotely hosted applications has been a big no - no with individuals facing legal action even when they were just trying to help . "
No one wants their private data shared maliciously but unfortunately security companies wo n't find and patch all the loop holes before a ' bad ' guy does .
A recent news story informs us that a blogger who exposed a security risk in a banking website is under pressure to remove his website .
From my understanding of the story , the blogger is n't a hacker but rather someone that is concerned about a security loophole .
Instead of being praised for finding the flaw he is being harassed by the security company .
This story seems to be typical of the experience of White Hat hackers : they find loop holes in security then warn companies that flaws exist .
Instead of being thanked they are automatically assumed to be an abuser : this response is most likely due to the vernacular meaning of ' hacking ' which is negative .
Gary McKinnon
I 'd place Gary McKinnon as a Grey Hat , I do n't think he was trying to abusive or exploitative although it is n't clear that he was doing it to inform the agencies of better security measures .
While the goals of the different hackers is not coherent there is a common identity of all hackers : an inquisitive mindset .
The curious mind is driven to understand how something works .
2600
This community , started in 1984 by " Emmanuel Goldstein , " identifies itself as a quarterly American publication that specializes in publishing technical information on a variety of subjects including telephone switching systems , Internet protocols and services , as well as general news concerning the computer " underground " and left wing , and sometimes ( but not recently ) , anarchist issues .
The name 2600 traces its routes to phone phreaking or Blue Boxing :
To a young person dabbling in the underground in the early 1980s , few concepts were as powerful , alluring , or exciting as the " Blue Box " .
A number of simple circuits enclosed with push buttons , it changed everything in the relationship between the Phone Company ( Ma Bell ) and her customers ( The Peons ) .
With the blast of a 2600 hz tone down a telephone line ( signifying you Meant Serious Business ) , you could seize the telephone trunk and gain a sort of " Administrator " access to the phone switching equipment .
And since operators were unlikely to do the sort of wild experimentation that a phreak with a blue box would try , all sorts of amazing things would happen with a few button presses .
As part of my own personal research into the hacking community I looked towards the guys at 2600 ( twenty - six hundred ) .
A friend sent me their website in an email , I read the website and thought it sounded vaguely interesting but I did n't continue further .
Well , I recently came across them on twitter and decided to follow them for interests sake .
Since following them and the account Linux Alive I 've been updated with a lot of developments in the computing / software .
The guys from 2600 post news to their twitter feed but also to their forum .
Phrack
Phrack is a magazine that provides A harmony of all hats of hacking .
See the information file from their most recent magazine issue ( # 66 ) :
" In the previous prophile , we had interviewed probably the most hated " black hat " hacker , and in the current prophile , the most hated " white hat " hacker .
Perceived as such .
But the reality is more faded and every hacker has this paradoxical identity where each side of the barrier suddenly become very familiar to the other . "
I 'm not going to pretend to be overly familiar with all the sites and information I present but I hope to provide information for inquisitive minds .
One article that caught my attention on the Phrack site is the following from issue 64 : The projection of consciousness .
This elucidates the concept of the mind being like a computer but in this article the author is suggesting methods by which you can improve your likelihood to have lucid dreaming .
He suggests some things that you can do in conscious life that will help you to have lucid dreams while unconscious .
A fascinating idea that has the concept of hacking at the root of it .
DefCon
The hacker conference where hackers , feds and others interested in hacking meet to discuss the latest issues .
Attending this conference is likely to boost your own level of paranoia , constantly watching to see if someone is going to exploit your computer or network access .
Elinor Mills of CNET has written some interesting blogs about the most recent DefCon .
The most amusing part of the conference is the Wall of Sheep .
It is what happens when you do n't take good care of your security at the conference .
Your username and part of your password is posted to the wall of sheep for all to see .
Out of curiosity , I looked up some of the twitter accounts mentioned on the wall and to my amusement they exist .
One gem of information that is worth taking away from this conference is : what operating system did they use to administer the ' most hostile network ' on the planet ?
OpenBSD .
That has my attention .
9,000 hackers , security experts and feds are all accessing the same network .
One that needs to be secure and prevent hostility despite the constant attacks .
What to do with this information ?
From Bill Moyers Journal , Simon Johnson paints a bleak picture of what 's ahead for us due to Washington 's unwillingness to regulate the financial industry and Wall Street .
BILL MOYERS : You asked on your blog , just this week , a question I want to put to you now , and to both of you .
You asked , ' Does this crisis reflect something about the disproportionate influence of a few incompetent investment bankers or a deeper breakdown of capitalism ? ''
What 's your answer to your own question ?
SIMON JOHNSON : Well , definitely , this disproportionate influence of some fairly incompetent bankers , that 's for sure .
That 's what we 're seeing today .
That 's what we 've seen over the past few months .
I think on the issue on the issue of capitalism , we have to take this very seriously .
To me , at least , the financial part of our capitalism is very seriously broken .
They persuaded us to allow them to take incredible risks .
And then they pushed all the downside , all those losses onto us , the taxpayer , at the same time as really hammering hard all the people who were duped , essentially , into taking out loans .
People lost their houses .
It 's an absolute tragedy .
This combination cannot go on .
And yet , the opportunity for real reform has already passed .
And there is not going to be not only is there not going to be change , but I 'll go further .
I 'll say it 's going to be worse , what comes out of this , in terms of the financial system , its power , and what it can get away with .
BILL MOYERS : Why ?
SIMON JOHNSON : That 's the .
BILL MOYERS : Why is it going to how is it going to be worse ?
SIMON JOHNSON : Well , there 's four we used to have a dozen or so substantial big banks , now we 're down to four .
Now we 're down to four big banks that have a lot more market power and a lot more political power .
They make the campaign contributions .
They shape agendas in ways that are that are really quite scary .
If you look , for example , at derivatives .
And the debate on whether or not derivatives should be regulated in a sensible manner .
And at this point , actually , the Obama Administration has is leaning in a better direction .
But the big financial players are absolutely against any kind of sensible regulation .

While the researchers can't promise delivery to a parallel universe or a school for wizards , books like Pullman 's Dark Materials and JK Rowling 's Harry Potter are steps closer to reality now that researchers in China have created the first tunable electromagnetic gateway .
The work is a further advance in the study of metamaterials , published in New Journal of Physics ( co-owned by the Institute of Physics and German Physical Society ) .
In the research paper , the researchers from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and Fudan University in Shanghai describe the concept of a " a gateway that can block electromagnetic waves but that allows the passage of other entities " like a " ' hidden portal ' as mentioned in fictions . "
The gateway , which is now much closer to reality , uses transformation optics and an amplified scattering effect from an arrangement of ferrite materials called single - crystal yttrium - iron - garnet that force light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation in complicated directions to create a hidden portal .

I could n't count the number of times I heard the words " transformational " or " inspirational , " or heard the 1960s evoked by people with no apparent memory that what drove the social revolution of the 1960s was not babies in cute T - shirts but the kind of resistance to that decade 's war that in the case of our current wars , unmotivated by a draft , we have yet to see .
It became increasingly clear that we were gearing up for another close encounter with militant idealism — by which I mean the convenient but dangerous redefinition of political or pragmatic questions as moral questions — " convenient " because such redefinition makes those questions seem easier to answer , " dangerous " because this was a time when the nation was least prepared to afford easy answers .

" There is no such constellation .... " - Lars von Trier , Antichrist
The advent of Unicode has been a huge boon for developers , enabling applications to run on computers throughout the world with little or no effort on the part of the developer .
However , there are several quirks in East Asian operating systems that can make applications developed in the west frustrating or difficult to use when installed on an East Asian computer .
This post looks at the most basic issues that every application developer should know .
Although I focus on Japanese and Windows in this post , many of the issues are equally applicable to Chinese and Korean , as well as other operating systems .
Input Method Editor ( IME )
Because of the complex character sets of the East Asian languages , text needs to be entered through a multi-stage interactive process , which is handled by an OS component called the IME .
( I ’ve written an article detailing how the Japanese IME works as a bit of a background for people who are interested ) .
Although the OS does it ’s best to conceal the operation of the IME from the running applications , the fact that the IME needs to intercept keystrokes and display it ’s own UI to the user can create problems for some applications ( including web applications ) in some situations .
Beginning with Windows 98/2000 , a system module called the Input Method Manager ( imm32.dll ) was introduced that offers a common interface that can be used to resolve many IME - related problems .
Disabling the Entire IME
For many games and other applications that do not use text input , the IME is a liability .
First , let ’s take a look at a screenshot from my favorite third - person shooter , Dead Space ( click the image to enlarge ) :
The text across the top of the screen is the intermediate composition string that appears because the IME is performing romaji-kana conversion on the keyboard input that is controlling the player character .
What the screenshot fails to capture is the annoying flickering as the IME and game continually compete to redraw the same section of the screen .
It ’s a bit like one of those gyrating banner ads that claim that you ’re the winning millionth visitor .
Why does this happen ?
This is the result of an IME feature called the floating conversion window .
Although the IME normally performs conversion in - place in the textbox or other control that has the keyboard focus , if the control that has the focus does not have a text input area ( or there are no controls ) , the IME instead displays the floating conversion window temporarily to handle character conversion .
A great example of how this feature is intended to work can be seen in Windows Explorer , where you can jump directly to the first file or folder starting with a particular letter by pressing that key .
The floating conversion window offers similar functionality to East Asian users .
In applications that are not IME aware , IME activation is fully controlled by the user .
In a game , this means that the IME activates if the user bumps any of the IME keys on the keyboard .
In something like a first person shooter , it ’s very easy to bump one of these when the action suddenly steps up a notch , which is exactly the worst moment to have the screen suddenly filling up with garbage .
The problem is also exacerbated by the layout of the Japanese keyboard :
The keys highlighted in red are IME related , and turn on the IME if pressed .
The key highlighted in green is actually the space bar , although ever since Microsoft managed to con manufacturers into adding the two Windows logo keys to the standard 109 key Japanese keyboard , it has become more like a space key .
As a curiosity , this particular keyboard still employs a wire under the space bar despite the space bar actually being narrower than the shift key :
Solution
The solution to this problem is quite simple .
Disable all IME functionality in your application .
On Windows 98/2000 and later , this is handled through the appropriately named ImmDisableIME function , which has to be called before your application creates any windows .
Because this function is only available if East Asian support is installed , we end up with something like this :
typedef BOOL ( WINAPI * pfnImmDisableIME ) ( DWORD ) ; void DisableIME ( ) { HMODULE hImm32 ; pfnImmDisableIME pImmDisableIME ; hImm32 = LoadLibrary ( " imm32.dll " ) ; if ( NULL == hImm32 ) return ; // No East Asian support pImmDisableIME = ( pfnImmDisableIME ) GetProcAddress ( hImm32 , " ImmDisableIME " ) ; if ( NULL == pImmDisableIME ) { FreeLibrary ( hImm32 ) ; return ; } pImmDisableIME ( -1 ) ; // - 1 means disable IME in all threads of current process FreeLibrary ( hImm32 ) ; }
I tested for this bug in my entire game collection , with the result that Morrowind , Fallout 3 , Assassin ’s Creed , and Dead Space all failed .
Only Half - Life 2 correctly disables the IME .
It is important to note that this measure is not limited to games .
Any app that can only handle 7 - bit ASCII input should disable the IME .
An example of an app that handles this correctly is the calculator app that comes with Windows .
IME Contexts
One of the key things to note about the above example is that disabling the IME in your own process does not disable the IME in other processes .
The reason for this is that Windows creates something called an IME Context for each new process that is created , and it is the IME Context that maintains the IME settings that are used when the corresponding app is active .
As an example , imagine a Japanese developer who is running Visual Studio and Thunderbird .
They turn the IME off in Visual Studio because code is written in 7 - bit ASCII , but they turn the IME on in Thunderbird so that they can write their email in Japanese .
Because separate IME Contexts were allocated to both Visual Studio and Thunderbird when they were launched , the IME is able to automatically turn Japanese input on or off as the user switches between the two applications .
Most developers do not need to handle IME Contexts explicitly because a default IME Context is automatically allocated to each process by Windows .
However , the exception occurs when a single process opens multiple windows that operate as separate entities .
Probably the best example of this is the web browser , where individual windows or tabs can be running completely independent tasks .
Windows users are used to the IME Context paradigm ( even if they are not consciously aware of it ) , so you really need to respect this system if you are developing for Windows .
The latest versions of Firefox ( 3.5.3 ) , Chrome ( 3.0.195.21 ) , and Opera ( 10.00 ) all get this wrong .
IE6 , 7 , and 8 all work correctly .
This is one of the reasons why Firefox , Chrome and Opera have such poor adoption rates in Asia .
( I found this interesting article about browser share in China )
Solution
The main API calls are :
HIMC ImmCreateContext ( void ) ; Create a new HIMC for each new window .
HIMC ImmAssociateContext ( HWND hWnd , HIMC hIMC ) ;
Call this on every control you create in each new window .
BOOL ImmDestroyContext ( HIMC hIMC ) ; - Destroy the context when you are done
Implementation is simple .
For each window or tab , define an HIMC variable to store the context handle .
Upon creating each window or tab , call ImmCreateContext to allocate a new context .
Every time you create a new control , call ImmAssociateContext to associate the control with the context for that window or tab .
Finally , after you have closed the window or tab , call ImmDestroyContext to delete the context again .
It is important , however , that all of the controls associated with the context are destroyed before the context is destroyed .
One of the important things to note about the IME Context concept is that it is a Windows - only thing .
Unix and Macintosh treat the IME state as a system - wide property , kind of like part of the keyboard .
However , the simple fact that there is a difference creates problems for OS - agnostic web apps , as we will see below .
Disabling the IME in Individual Controls
Even in Unicode - aware applications that have been designed to accept any kind of text input , there are still situations where the IME should be disabled for certain controls .
The most obvious example of this is the password field .
Since the IME operates interactively and relies on prompting the user to select from candidate lists , it would be impossible to conceal the input characters .
Of course , password fields are a well - known case , and so the OS or web browser automatically disables the IME for password controls .
However , there are many more subtle examples , such as alphanumeric text fields or custom controls that accept the focus but do not accept text .
Let ’s take a numeric field as an example to see how things work when the IME is enabled .
Suppose a Japanese user tabs from a “ name ” input field where they have just entered their name ( and so the IME is in Kanji mode ) to an “ age ” input field asking for their age .
Typing in 34 gives them the following candidate list :
Now there are several problems .
In this example , the first candidate is the number in full - width digits ( U+FF10 to U+FF19 ) .
This is what the user will most probably select , in which case you have to perform full - width to half - width conversion on the input text .
( This also applies to general alphanumeric input since there are full - width characters for the entire ASCII 7 - bit range ) .
The second problem arises if you are trying to use keydown / keypress events to filter out non-numeric key presses .
When the IME is active , keydown / keypress / keyup events follow a different model than normal ( which I will go into later ) , which makes most attempts to filter keyboard input disastrous .
( Google really sucked at this when they first attempted to enter the Japanese market ) .
The final problem is one of usability .
If a field only accepts numbers , you should save your users the hassle of having to go through the conversion process .
( For completeness , the last four candidates in the above list are a bit like writing out “ thirty four ” in English , so you do n’t generally need to worry about them ) .
Solution
In HTML , Microsoft introduced the “ ime - mode ” style for text input fields in IE5 to allow web apps some control over the IME mode .
However , the other browser makers have opposed introducing this into the standard ( I suspect this is largely because it is really a Windows - only concept ) .
Firefox introduced the style in Firefox 3 , but because of the problems it has on the Mac , you really want to specify different values for Mac and Windows users .
IE8 added an alias “ - ms- ime - mode ” .
( Personally , I think the best case would be for the other browser makers to adopt “ - ms- ime - mode ” as something that only has an effect on Windows platform browsers . )
The key values of ime - mode are :
disabled
This style disables the IME only for this control .
When the user clicks on or navigates to another control , the IME returns to the same state as it was in before entering the control .
This is the best mode to use for number - only or alphanumeric - only fields .
Some notes : 1 ) Because the user cannot override this setting , make sure you only use it on fields that will never allow CJK characters .
2 ) Users can still cut / paste exotic characters into the field .
3 ) This setting does n’t work properly on Mac or Linux systems because there is no OS support for this kind of functionality .
inactive
This setting turns the IME off , but allows the user to turn it on again if they wish .
Although you should avoid using this setting on Windows ( unless you really know what you are doing ) , on the Mac you should use “ inactive ” as a replacement for the buggy “ disabled ” style , particularly because this is more inline with the Mac way of handling Japanese input .
For native Windows applications , the easiest way to control the IME is to use the .NET or similar framework that offers an IMEMode property on controls .
( Just set IMEMode=disabled on controls that required only 7 - bit ASCII input ) .
Alternatively , you can disable the IME for a single control using the following Win32 API function :
HIMC ImmAssociateContext ( HWND hWnd , HIMC hIMC ) ;
Simply specify the HWND to the control in the first parameter , and NULL in the second parameter ( NULL disables the IME for that control ) .
As with the ImmDisableIME function , you need to make sure that the imm32.dll module exists before calling the function , or you may run into problems on systems without East Asian support .
Windows Events
Because the IME context is maintained separately within each individual process , the system - wide language bar that displays the IME status needs to communicate with the IME part of your application to keep the language bar icons up to date .
This is achieved through the named Windows messages .
Named messages are messages in the range 0xC000 through to 0xFFFF .
It is essential that you correctly call DispatchMessage on these messages as you receive them in your message loop , or the language bar will stop working .
For those who are interested , the Chinese , Japanese , and Taiwanese language bars are shown below :
Keydown / Keypress / Keyup
Since the IME is intercepting keystrokes to hold a conversation with the user , the keydown / keypress / keyup events take on a slightly new meaning .
However , the processing that takes place depends on the particular control that you are using .
The most important point to note is that you must not attempt to perform validation on text that is in the middle of conversion .
Doing so leads to a terrible end user experience .
Win32 Edit Control
When the IME is actively intercepting keystrokes , it replaces the key value in the WM_KEYDOWN message with the value VK_PROCESSKEY ( 229 ) to indicate that a key was pressed , but has been processed by the IME .
There is also no corresponding WM_CHAR message ( which corresponds to the KeyPress event ) .
However , the WM_KEYUP message is sent with the key code of the correct key .
This process is repeated as the user interacts with the IME to select the text that they want to input .
When they finally accept the text , your application receives a WM_CHAR message for each character in the selected text .
You can look for WM_KEYUP messages where the keycode is 13 ( the enter key ) to indicate that the user has finished conversion .
RichTextbox
The Win32 Edit control and the NET Framework TextBox control actually do n’t interoperate with the IME very nicely , so if you can you should use the RickTextbox control instead .
Although the KeyUp and KeyDown events operate the same as in the Edit box , there is no WM_CHAR ( KeyPress ) message upon the user accepting the input .
Instead , the TextChanged event is called when candidate text is accepted .
HTML INPUT TEXT
Internet Explorer and Chrome send 229 for KeyDown and the actual keycode for KeyUp on each key press .
There are no KeyPress events .
You can therefore trigger on - the - fly validation code on receiving any KeyPress event ( non -IME input ) , and for KeyUp events where the key code is 13 ( IME input ) .
Firefox sends a single 229 key code on KeyDown , and a KeyPress with value 0 when the user first starts interacting with the IME .
A final KeyUp event is then sent once the user has finished interacting with the IME .
This means that you can use the KeyUp event as a trigger to validate user input regardless of the IME state .
Opera does not send any KeyDown / KeyPress / KeyUp events at all for any text entered via an IME .
CAPS LOCK
The final issue , which is primarily related to games , is the caps lock key .
Caps lock on the Japanese keyboard is toggled by holding down shift while tapping the caps lock key .
Simply tapping the caps lock key does not toggle the caps lock state .
This is an issue in both Morrowind and Fallout 3 , which use the caps lock key to toggle running on and off .
Unfortunately , both of these games seem to use a mixed bag of methods to test for caps lock , and it ’s always a lucky dip to see what key combination will toggle running on or off .
Since this is tied to the Japanese keyboard , and not the IME itself , you need to call GetKeyboardLayout and check for a Japanese keyboard , and then maintain your toggle state based on KeyDown events if you want to use caps lock in a game .
Summary
Hopefully this collection of tips will give you some insight into the difficulties of internationalization .
If anyone with Mac experience has anything to add , I would love to hear about it in the comments .
SPF creep has hit the triple digits with Neutrogena ’s SPF 100 + sunblock , leading some dermatologists to complain that this is merely a numbers game that confuses consumers .
— The Times .
SPF 4 — You ’re joking , right ?
This is some kind of joke ?
4 ? We make this stuff for armadillos .
Or maybe you ’re one of those “ adrenaline junkies ” looking for another freakish way to court death .
Seriously , people , the sun is deadly .
It ’s a giant ball of fire , literally , and it will kill you . . . if you let it .
SPF 12 — Great for practical jokes , if your idea of funny is making someone think they are protected from the sun ’s seriously fucking powerful and harmful rays when they ’re actually not .
Bonus : Comes with an “ I AM , OR ONE DAY WILL BE , A DANGEROUSLY NEGLECTFUL PARENT ” visor .
SPF 30 — Perfect for driving all night through a rainstorm .
SPF 50 — Acceptable for most summer daytime use if applied correctly , which is to say , ingested orally via four separate SPF “ sunshakes , ” two in the morning and two after lunch , each made with three parts sunblock lotion to two parts heavy cream .
Tip : Another tasty option is our “ SPF - egg - white omelette . ”
No carbs !
SPF 75 — Slathering oneself in a good SPF 75 says something to the world .
It says , “ I do n’t mind spending a little extra if it means doing what ’s right . ”
And “ Clearly the health of my skin is more important to me than the health of your skin is to you , and , while that is sad , all I can do is lead , because I am a leader . ”
SPF 100 — This is to SPF 99 and below as excellent heroin is to Capri Sun juice boxes .
If you have n’t already , ask yourself :
Are you gonna run with the big dogs ?
Or stay on the porch with the pups ?
SPF 125 — Remember the first time you were allowed into an airport first - class lounge ?
Or experienced oral sex ?
Add using SPF 125 sunscreen to the list of experiences that you will never forget .
SPF 150 — Nothing will make you feel as safe and protected and confident and prepared .
Because SPF 150 does something more powerful than just protect you from the sun a hundred times better than the ridiculous , flimsy , paper - thin skin God gave you .
SPF 150 actually repels the fear and anxiety and vulnerability and paralyzing paralysis that affects so many of us each and every time we walk outside during daylight hours .
It ’s patented , and made in Norway , by Norwegians .
So say it out loud :
The rest of your life starts now .
SPF 175 — Ever wanted to have unprotected sex with a prostitute in Haiti ?
Do n’t answer .
Does n’t matter .
The point is with SPF 175 that ’s now an option .
SPF 200 — The truth is , most people are never going to need the level of protection this lotion provides .
Recently indicted ?
Not a problem .
Being hunted by a pack of rogue genetically mutated polar bears ?
Have a sandwich .
Take a nap .
Seriously , make yourself a sandwich , then go take a nap , because there is nothing out there that you have to worry about ever again .
The nightmare is over .
SPF 233 — Close your eyes .
Good .
Now imagine a world without poverty and disease , where children of all races and religions join hands and sing old Negro spirituals , a place where the vicious cycles of boom and bust are replaced by never - ending Wonder Wheels of boom . . . and boom .
SPF 233 is not inexpensive .
But , in the war against the evil that is the sun , can you put a price on freedom ? ♦
I am a Linux geek .
There I said it .
Actually , I am kind of proud of being a Linux geek .
I slogged through the bad old days to get here .
It seems like every day something new shows up that makes me glad that I chose Linux as my tool of choice .
Because of the break neck speed of change in the open source community , we all seem to be a lot more focused on the future than the past .
For a change of pace , I wanted to look backwards and figure out how I got here .
I mean no one starts out as a Linux geek ( well except for Linus ) , so how did that happen .
But first some disclosures :
I love Linux and Open Source .
I am not a purist !
I dual boot XP ( need me some games ) and carry an iPhone ( though it annoys me ) .
I even have an Xbox360 ( see note about games ) .
Although I use a lot of open source , and have contributed code back ( not enough mind you ) - I also pay for software and do n't think it is morally wrong to have closed source software .
I do n't think Linux is for everyone ( yet ) .
I got my mom a netbook and it runs XP ( I did n't even make it dual boot ) .
I 'm not above exposing people to Linux - but I 'd prefer they get to it when it solves their problems , and they 're ready to move on .
Awkward Upbringing I got my start in computers in a weird way .
Mostly because although my mom had the foresight to know that they were the future - neither of my parents used them .
By that I mean my dad never really used a computer and my mom has slowly gotten the hang of it in the last few years .
So I started with a TI - 99 / 4a .
That is n't that strange .
A lot of people back then started with them .
It is the next part that put me on the path to unusual .
Namely , my second computer was an Atari 1040ST .
This revolutionary device had a mouse and a graphical interface while Microsoft was still grappling with DOS .
That is the computer I actually learned to program on .
I can still remember trying to save up money to buy a C compiler for it .
I just stuck with GFA Basic - which was pretty full featured considering it had a GUI builder included .
I actually got introduced to the BBS scene on that computer .
I can remember buying the mammoth Computer Shoppers and looking in the back for BBSes that supported Atari .
I spent a lot of time downloading demos and trading notes .
My parents spent a lot of time trying to figure out who I knew in Hawaii and what I could possibly say in 2 minutes .
The long distance bills eventually killed my burgeoning BBS experience .
That computer basically lasted me until I went to college 1993 .
As a result , I had very limited exposure to Microsoft , DOS , or Windows I did use it a little - mostly because I had a friend who worked in a computer shop and he introduced me to Sierra Games and Commander Keen .
We would go to my father 's office at night and play games on the secretary 's computer .
When it came time to go to college - I headed off to Texas with a lot of stuff - but no computer .
Hard to believe now .
HP - UX Trinity University had a lot of computing resources available .
The most important thing was getting a crash course in the Internet in the Mac lab .
At the time - that mostly meant news groups , email , and Bolo Yes , while normal people were knee deep in Doom - I was in a computer lab playing a game about tanks and turrets .
One of my roommates had an America Online Account .
He showed me all the stuff you could do over the modem - from a local dial in number .
There was no Internet connectivity in our dorm room .
We resorted to running AppleTalk via phone wire through the AC ducts to build a small LAN for gaming .
I got an account on the VAX mainframe as soon as I landed .
I quickly set out to learn how to make it do stuff .
I can still remember trying to get the library to track down books on the tools for the mainframe .
I suppose that should have been my first sign that I was pursuing a dead technology .
In my second year , Trinity got a grant to do Virtual Reality research for the military .
They put in a huge lab of HP - UX boxes .
I ended up declaring as a Computer Science major just to get access to them .
I started taking Computer Science classes and learning the actually theory of programming .
Unfortunately , learning the practice of programming would n't happen until much much later .
This is when I started learning Unix .
Do n't ask me why but in the back of my head I almost always type : ps - ef instead of ps auxw Since the ef version is what HP UX expected to see what processes are running .
I was just a user on the HP - UX systems .
I could do stuff - but there were a lot of things off limits .
Plus - I had a disk quota .
Which if memory serves - they setup quota but they did n't restrict chown - so I spent some time downloading large files and chmod 777 / chown mail - so they would n't count against me .
It was during this period that I got to see the beginning of the web .
The first time I saw it - I did n't understand why it was any better than gopher ( ask your grandparents ) .
But they added images and things go better .
I would love to say that I used it for scientific research - but in truth - I used it the same way we do now .
Meaning I surfed the web during class when the lecture was boring .
I still remember seeing this guy celebrating his operating system .
I did n't really get it at the time .
I figured it was a class project or something .
Certainly not worth anything .
I just filed it away in my head and continued on .
Outside Academia
My life changed in my senior year of college .
I came back from study abroad and got introduced to a life long friend .
I ended up joining a small company that he had started .
The goal was to build software .
Right out of the gate he told me he was using something called - Linux - and asked if I wanted root access .
How do I explain what that meant at the time ?
Before I was just a user .
A lowly peon who could only kill his own processes .
I could n't install things in / bin .
I could n't use ports below 1024 .
There is a much much longer list - but you get the idea .
Most importantly - and this is an idea that insinuates itself into anyone who spends time with * nix - as root you are a god because you have the power to destroy anything in the system .
When I say anything - I mean it .
You can even destroy the system itself .
A little rm - fR in the wrong place and you can wipe the drive and * nix will happily let you do it because you are root !
Root is not meant for the unwashed masses .
It is meant for people with experience and expertise who know what the right thing to do is and can be trusted to do it .
I was none of those things and he offered it up anyway .
As you can tell I was pretty excited .
It was an incredibly liberating idea to have such complete power .
Of course now I 've had root on Linux boxes ( lots and lots and lots of them ) for over 13 years - so some of the excitement has died down .
RedHat - The Salad Days Although Richard had used Slackware , we quickly shifted to RedHat .
At the time it just seemed like the clear leader .
It had a geek spirit but it seemed to be very commercial friendly .
Since we were trying to run a business that was important .
I think I started with RedHat 3.0 .
I had to look that up and guess .
Mostly because before that Linux used something called a.out format instead of ELF binaries .
I never really knew the difference - only that I started with ELF and found the explanations confusing .
I used RedHat for a long time .
I can remember telling my brother back in Indiana to go to Barnes and Noble and buy an install disk and try it out .
Yes there was a time when Linux was sold in book stores - wacky .
I put up with changes that happen often in the community .
For example , I was writing a lot of C / C++ at the time and a new glibc came out and we had to spend a bunch of time updating everything and keeping the code working on the boxes we had n't upgraded .
It was a good time .
This was early in the revolution .
So early in fact that people could n't agree on how to pronounce it .
Thankfully I was always on the right side of the argument .
Though for many years I looked at anyone who said Line - ix with suspicion .
Although the idea of Open Source was there it was n't a main stream one .
There were a number of companies that appeared on the scene to help people use Linux and charge for support .
All of them failed .
I 'm not sure what they were thinking .
The people who used Linux at the time needed drivers not a help desk .
We were in the beginning of the boom , and the last thing people worry about during a boom is cost savings .
This seemed to sour a lot of business people on the whole idea of Linux .
As if to say , since you can't sell it there is no money to be made and it is therefore worthless .
We ignored a lot of that big picture .
We just liked Linux .
We tried to promote it whenever we got the chance .
Our little band of Linux users even made in roads with the local Unix grey beards .
We were a sort of novelty at the Unix user group in town .
Almost everyone else worked for a government agency or big company and used Sun or some other commercial Unix .
They were the sort of seasoned Unix people that you still read about .
We went for the technical discussion ( and free pizza ) .
When Solaris x86 was launched they convinced us to try it out .
After a week of trying to get it to install , we got it up and running .
And then learned that it did n't ship with anything .
So we ended up putting GNU tools on it .
YellowDog - Huh ?
I had to inject this because I had almost forgotten about this little side jaunt .
This whole time I was running a PowerPC mac .
I would not switch to x86 on the desktop for some time .
I was constantly trying to get Linux onto my Mac .
I had a variety of failed attempts .
Later when I switched to a PowerBook I was able to install YellowDog Linux .
That was basically RedHat recompiled for the PowerPC .
This was before OSX .
Actually when they originally decided to buy NextStep instead of BeOS - I was kind of upset .
I ended up leaving the Apple fold when OSX came in .
I think I said something along the lines of I already have a Unix - it 's called Linux .
I know this is hard to believe if you 're a die hard mac person - but the Reality Distortion Field eventually wears off .
I just got tired of having to fit in to Steve 's world .
From this you can see that my conversion to Linux which had started some time ago was taking hold .
RedHat - The Betrayal RedHat had all potential in the world to be great .
But in a number of ways it just did n't live up to that potential .
There were three different things that ended up pushing me away from them .
First , we used to sell a specially licensed version of RedHat that shipped with a legally licensed version of SSL .
This was before RSA patent wore off .
It started out as a small product .
But we grew and so did sales of the product .
Here 's the rub .
We had to buy physical boxes for the SSL OS .
I tried to get RedHat to just sell me license keys .
But they were to busy to sort that out .
So I had a corner of my office dedicated to stacks and stacks of boxes of unopened SSL disks .
Second , RPM hell .
I started out as a staunch opponent of packages .
I thought that things should be compiled to your specification .
As a matter of fact , I believed this so completely - that if you were an early customer of my hosting company you got a stock RedHat server with a custom compiled version of Apache .
Yup - we compiled it every time .
I am stuck trying to think of an analogy that could express how stupid this was .
Especially because we just straight up compiled it .
Which means it sort of broke the package system .
This is the sort of dumb idea that seems like sound technical thinking at the time .
Let me just say this .
I 'm sure there is some case where compiling from source all the time is a great idea ( Gentoo is built on that idea ) .
It is certainly a maintainable practice when you have a couple of boxes to admin .
But when you start talking about 1,000s of boxes it 's crazy .
Actually , I 've become such a believer in packages that I go out of my way to use software and versions that are already packaged .
I converted over to using RPM - and once I saw how great it could be at scale - I loved it .
There were a couple of things that bugged me .
Often times , no rpm existed for the software I wanted .
Not a big deal - I ended up learning RPM and built a lot of them .
Including an tweaked version of Apache so we did n't have to compile it .
Fine - so there are packages you have to build yourself .
I learned to live with that .
Then the dreaded RPM Hell .
There are two different flavors of this .
One is the case where it just can't figure out all the dependencies or get things you need .
T his could turn a simple install into a research project .
Please note I have n't used RedHat in a long time - maybe they fixed this .
The other is that the process of installing , uninstalling , upgrading , and such especially with your own packages can result in a completely broken RPM database .
You have n't experience true torture until your package system itself starts working against you .
Finally , RedHat did something that changed how I looked at them .
The started an Enterprise edition .
I understand why they did it - they needed to generate revenue .
They were also doing a good thing by raising the awareness of Linux as a viable Linux alternative .
All that is true - but they way they did it made it very clear that they wanted certain kinds of customers - and I was n't one of them .
To be fair , I think they eventually tried to address their geekier fans with RawHide and then Fedora , but by that time I 'd been introduced to something else .
Enter the Debian About this time I was working at a hosting company called ServerBeach .
The main target was a $ 99 / month server .
Needless to say , we were n't going to be using RedHat Enterprise for our internal servers - it was just too expensive .
That 's when they introduced me to Debian .
Truth be told I do n't know if it was Henry Pugsley or Chris Blumentritt that converted me - but once I got exposed to it I was hooked .
I 'll admit I 'd heard of Debian before this time .
It was a distro for the faithful .
It was designed by geeks for geeks and was notorious for its purity and difficulty .
Since I had to give up RedHat anyway I figured I 'd give it a whirl .
After some time spent with apt ( which never had any of the problems that I 'd had with RPM ) and I learned that if software exists there is a deb for it .
( Corollary - if no deb exists then the software is n't any good ) I was in heaven .
I even got used to the idea that our servers ran stable and my workstation ran testing .
We 'd occasionally move packages from testing over to stable because I needed something - but all in all halcyon days .
At the time , Debian felt like coming home .
The more I looked around the more it seemed like people who were into the weird stuff with Linux that I was - used Debian .
I also did n't realize it but I was n't the only one making this switch .
The community was growing - thanks RedHat !
The Dark Side of Debian I had a great time with Debian - until I hit its dark side .
This comes in two parts .
The first is their deep and abiding love for democracy .
I mean that in the most serious way .
Debian wants it to be a completely community effort .
As a distro it has continually stood up for true open source - going so far as to fight Mozilla over icons and even throw out documentation or firmware that was n't open .
This cuts both ways .
On the good side , they are a force for openness on every front .
They are able to mobilize a huge army to that end .
The bad side is that something I do n't care about the principle - I just want to use my video card ( I 'm looking at you Nvidia ) .
So basically I 'm happy they fight the fight but my standards are lower - which in some ways keeps me an outside in the community .
Which leads to the second thing .
When I started I was playing with potato ( all debian releases are named after ToyStory characers ) .
Then out came Woody .
Debian has a very strong belief that stable should be stable .
They did n't care how old it was as long as it was stable .
In the beginning that was n't a big deal .
But then they did n't release for three years .
For a commercial software shop - sending out a new version of the OS once every couple of years is actually pretty brisk .
But that 's now how Linux works .
Distros are collections of a lot of different software projects all updating and releasing all the time .
Three years in the open source world is decades .
In response to this , I switched from testing to unstable .
I ended up having more than a few fights as I tried to get unstable installed on production web servers so I could have modern libraries .
Stable just got crustier and crustier - and I became more and more disenchanted .
It 's Breezy and So Am I I wish I knew how I found it or why I switched .
Now all I remember is that it was called Breezy Badger - and I figure I 'm pretty Breezy myself - so maybe I 'd try it .
Actually , I was corrected by my wife .
My first version of Ubuntu was Warty Warthog .
I just could n't remove the fart joke .
As far as I can remember - I had gotten really frustrated with Debian .
Then I find this distro that had Debian packages ( woot ! ) , they were designing it for the desktop ( which is great since I 've been using a linux desktop for years ) , they had a benevolent dictator in the form of Mark Shuttleworth ( which meant there was someone who could make sure things moved along ) , they did n't mind dealing with proprietary hardware , and they promised a release cycle of every six months .
So basically they gave me everything I loved about Debian - but fixed all the things I did n't like about Debian .
Slowly but surely , Ubuntu has taken over everything I run .
I use it on the desktop and a heck of a lot of servers .
It does n't have the commercial driver support that RedHat enjoys in the datacenter - but I 've found my ways around that .
The Return of the Zombies During my time in the Ubuntu camp , I 've seen the rise of the Apple Zombies again .
One by one , I 've seen my Linux friends switch over to OSX .
They always say the same thing
It just works !
I got tired of tinkering with Linux .
They have that look in their eye .
They quickly launch into the sales pitch on how awesome it is .
Little do they know that I 've been on their side before - long before .
remember how comfortable the fuzzy hand cuffs were .
I 'm not anxious to go back .
I do n't miss the ridiculous secrecy or arbitrary decisions .
Now it appears that much like the classic zombie films - I 'm hold up in a house fighting them off with a variety of make shift weaponry .
I can't be the only person on the planet who uses Linux as my main desktop , but some days it certainly feels like it .
Bumpy but Back On Track Truth be told , things have been bumpy lately .
I found a great article that sums it up - Ubuntu Release Quality .
Post Hardy has been a rough time - with a lot of experimentation and a lot of explosions .
Part of me was beginning to think that I was just being pig headed .
Maybe I should join the zombie army and switch over .
They have lots of shiny things .
All the cool kids are doing it - etc .
In the last few weeks , I 've spent a lot of time designing the infrastructure for my next project .
I was trying to design something that would be flexible and easy to maintain .
Something that would use cheap commodity hardware but be able to easily scale into the cloud .
I 've been knee deep in Jaunty , JeOS , LVM , KVM , and puppet .
I 'm loving it .
Jaunty has cleaned up the experience a lot .
Although I was wavering before , my faith has largely been restored .
Mainly because I 'm having fun with Linux again .
There are few things more exciting than to see it dance - and dance it does .
A long long time ago , I saw Tim O'Reilly speak at OSCon .
He talked about how when you choose a technology you also choose the community that goes with it .
I guess that is the thing that keeps me embedded in the Linux world .
Linux people are the ones who say
That just came out - can I put Linux on it - No ?
Let 's get to work !
They 're the ones who fight for our rights to be able to watch a DVD on our computers .
They 're the ones who have come to join Linus and Stallman and others at their invitation to make Stone Soup .
Nothing that eventually turned into something .
They are the ones that are pushing the world to be a better place for everyone .
Even if you do n't use Open Source stuff - know that the stuff you buy is better because it is competing with it .
It 's a Linux / Open Source / GNU World I 've been using Linux for a long long time .
Looking back now , I realize just how primitive it was .
That 's ok - it has grown up a lot since then .
Even The Economist ( one of my favorite magazines ) has declared Open Source the winner .
Every year someone says
This is the year of the Linux desktop .
I 'm not even sure what that means any more .
Or if it even matters .
Looking around my house I see that it is a Linux world .
Sure my file servers in the datacenter run Linux ( one has sarge which I 'm ashamed to admit - but I swear I 'm moving off of it ) , that 's not weird but the list does n't end there : Mythbox - Linux .
My laptop - Linux .
My desktop - Linux .
My router - DD - WRT ( that 's Linux ) .
My iphone - jailbroken running GNU software in debs .
My kindle - Linux .
My home automation - Z Wave via Linux .
My Roku - Linux .
My Popcorn Hour - Linux .
My search engine - Linux .
RedHat has recently been added to the S&P 500 .
This is a first for a Linux based company .
It also clearly demonstrates that Linux is a viable option in the enterprise .
It also shows that although I did n't like their strategy - it seems to have worked for them .
Maybe we should all broaden our minds and realize that Lucas was actually talking about Linux / Open Source / GNU - It 's an energy field created by all living things .
It surrounds us , penetrates us , and binds the galaxy together .
Yes - I just said it - Linux is the force :P
I suppose this is part of that shift that has been happening for some time .
Sure you can be a specialist in computer science , but the real shift is that you can't avoid technology .
Whatever you do - technology is involved .
And that 's the part I love .
People may choose Apple for their desktop or god forbid Microsoft for their server - but when they just consume the output - they 're going to be getting it from a Linux system because " it just works " .
One last thing - this quote is often spoken of in the Linux community First they ignore us , then they laugh at us , then they fight us , then we win .
I think you know which part of the process I think we 're in .
P.S. According to recent news Microsoft has just release drivers for the Linux kernel .
They 're being released under the GPL .
The times they are a changing ...
Cordon Blues ?
Envy the lucky travelers of London .
As you may know , in 2003 the city imposed a congestion toll of £ 5 ( later raised to £ 8 ) on all vehicles entering the central district .
In 2007 , Transport for London , a government agency , did a cost - benefit analysis of the impacts ( find the full report here ) .
It found the following about costs per year to travelers in the central district :
Individuals and business travelers pay about £ 236 million in tolls .
Some trips to the area are canceled , costing would - have - been drivers the equivalent of about £ 31 million .
It costs motorists and firms £ 19 million to comply with the system .
Total burden on travelers : £ 286 million .
And now the benefits to travelers :
Drivers ( individuals and businesses ) reap benefits from saved time and improved travel reliability of about £ 260 million .
Drivers save £ 28 million in vehicle operating costs .
Bus riders save about £ 43 million worth of time .
This adds up to £ 331 million in savings .
Please note that even the driving public ( who , after all , pay the tolls ) come out slightly better than if the tolls did not exist .
Even if the considerable benefits to bus riders are ignored , and even if all the revenue were tossed onto a giant bonfire ( or , even worse , sent off to the EU to subsidize French farmers ) , auto travelers win out or , at the very least , are no worse off .
But the money does not disappear ; government nets a profit of £ 47 million ( after excluding items like operating costs , infrastructure expenditures , and lost tax and parking revenue ) .
Obviously , this money can be used for many worthy causes , transportation - related and otherwise .
And there are other social benefits : reduced accidents and pollution are worth about £ 17 million .
This study is n’t perfect ; it excludes changes in the business climate for stores and other firms within the cordon .
And after all , it was performed by Transport for London , which is hardly a disinterested party .
But the numbers are probably in the ballpark , and they indicate that cordon pricing for the central area nets society about £ 99 million per year in total benefit .
The reaction of the British public to this win / win / win situation has been vigorous and spirited :
Eighty percent of Manchester voters recently voted no on a cordon pricing proposal , a level of unpopularity among Mancunians that even the Liverpool football club would find hard to match .
In 2005 , 75 percent of Edinburgh voters rejected a cordon charge .
London Mayor Boris Johnson recently conducted a survey on expanding the London Congestion Charge Zone and found that 67 percent of respondents were opposed .
Johnson scrapped the plans and is toying with reducing the size of the existing charge zone instead .
Why such ingratitude , British drivers ?
There are a couple of possibilities .
First , people may not be appreciating their time savings .
While the out - of - pocket expenditure on the tolls is very visible and quite annoying , there is very little way for drivers to see what traffic and delay would have been like without the tolls .
Plus , many people underestimate the monetary value of their time .
Second , there are admitted distributional concerns .
Pricing detractors are right to suppose that this policy will disproportionately benefit the well - off .
This is due to the smaller burden the tolls place on the wealthy ’s personal finances and the higher monetary value of their time .
The equity argument is probably the most powerful weapon in the antis ’ arsenal .
And it is the one which proponents of the policy have the toughest time answering .
Like it or not , it resonates politically .
Perhaps this is what rankles British voters .
For these reasons , it may be premature to think about tolling entire downtowns or freeways .
A better plan is to concede that we wo n’t get the most economically efficient , toll - everything outcome ( sorry , transportation economists ) .
Instead we should settle for tolling only portions of facilities while leaving the remainder of them au naturale .
Were , say , two lanes of a four - lane freeway tolled and flowing and the other lanes free but congested , the time savings your money buys you would be very visible to drivers .
Equity concerns would be blunted since the poor have a free option .
In fact , low - income folks would be better off than before , thanks to the chance to use the toll lanes when really necessary , express bus service in the toll lanes , and increased throughput there .
This would leave a situation in which the rich might disproportionately benefit , but all are made at least somewhat better off .
This would probably seem equitable to all but the most egalitarian thinkers .
Perhaps this is why polls conducted after the opening of California ’s SR91 toll lanes found that the concept was supported by over 70 percent of corridor drivers — including a majority of those who used the free lanes exclusively .
Unfortunately for London , none of those satisfied customers are registered to vote in the UK .

NEW YORK , Sept 23 ( Reuters ) - Nintendo Co Ltd 7974 .OS may cut the price of its
Wii video game console by $ 50 to about $ 200 , starting this weekend , according to several technology blogs .
A Nintendo spokesman was not immediately available to comment about the reports , which appeared on blogs including Kotaku and Engadget .
The blogs said the new price takes effect “ beginning on Sept. 27 at Best Buy ” and elsewhere .
Nintendo , the top maker of the current generation of video game consoles , would be the last among its peers to cut prices .
Last month , Microsoft Corp MSFT .O slashed $ 100 off the price of its high - end Xbox 360 console and Sony Corp 6758 .
T cut its PlayStation 3 by $ 100 .
Prices for both now start at about $ 300 , although Microsoft also sells a low - end model , the Xbox Arcade , for about $ 200 .
Sales of the PS3 jumped after the price cut in August , Sony Computer Entertainment of America Chief Executive Jack Tretton told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday .
[ ID :nN23396815 ]
Just after Microsoft cut its price on Aug. 27 , a Nintendo spokesman said the company had no plans for a cut .
Video game industry sales have slumped over the past six months , and hardware sales in August declined by 25 percent , according to research group NPD .
Analysts have pegged the drop to cautious spending by consumers in the tough economic environment , and a dearth of top - selling games .
Long - awaited console price cuts by and new games , including updates to the “ Halo , ” “ Guitar Hero ” and Call of Duty ” franchises are expected to boost sales in coming months .

If you ever questioned the need for serious healthcare reform , here 's why it 's absolutely vital :
Nearly 45,000 people die in the United States each year -- one every 12 minutes -- in large part because they lack health insurance and can not get good care , Harvard Medical School researchers found in an analysis released on Thursday .
" We 're losing more Americans every day because of inaction ... than drunk driving and homicide combined , " Dr. David Himmelstein , a co-author of the study and an associate professor of medicine at Harvard , said in an interview with Reuters .
Brice Hortefeux a trop d'humour .
Je le sais , il m'a fait une blague un jour .
Jeudi 24 avril 2008 .
Le ministre de l'immigration et de l'identité nationale doit me recevoir dans son majestueux bureau .
Un rendez - vous pour parler des grèves de sans - papiers dans des entreprises .
Je ne l'avais jamais rencontré .
Je patiente avec ma collègue Laetitia Van Eeckhout dans cet hôtel particulier de la République .
Brice Hortefeux arrive , me tend la main , sourit et lâche : " Vous avez vos papiers ? "
Trois mois plus tard , lundi 7 juillet , jour de mes 29 ans .
Je couvre le Tour de France .
Je prépare un article sur ces gens qui peuplent le bord des routes .
Sur le bitume mouillé près de Blain ( Loire - Atlantique ) , je m'approche d'une famille surexcitée par le passage de la caravane , pour bavarder .
" Je te parle pas , à toi " , me jette un jeune homme , la vingtaine .
A côté de moi , mon collègue Benoît Hopquin n'a aucun souci à discuter avec cette " France profonde " .
Il m'avouera plus tard que , lorsque nous nous sommes accrédités , une employée de l'organisation l'a appelé pour savoir si j'étais bien son ... chauffeur .
Je pensais que ma " qualité " de journaliste au Monde allait enfin me préserver de mes principaux " défauts " : être un Arabe , avoir la peau trop basanée , être un musulman .
Je croyais que ma carte de presse allait me protéger des " crochets " balancés par des gens obsédés par les origines et les apparences .
Mais quels que soient le sujet , l'endroit , la population , les préjugés sont poisseux .
J'en parle souvent à mes collègues : ils peinent à me croire lorsque je leur décris cet " apartheid mental " , lorsque je leur détaille les petites humiliations éprouvées quand je suis en reportage , ou dans la vie ordinaire .
A quoi bon me présenter comme journaliste au Monde , on ne me croit pas .
Certains n'hésitent pas à appeler le siège pour signaler qu'" un Mustapha se fait passer pour un journaliste du Monde ! "
Ça fait bien longtemps que je ne prononce plus mon prénom lorsque je me présente au téléphone : c'est toujours " M. Kessous " .
Depuis 2001 , depuis que je suis journaliste , à la rédaction de Lyon Capitale puis à celle du Monde , " M. Kessous " , ça passe mieux : on n'imagine pas que le reporter est " rebeu " .
Le grand rabbin de Lyon , Richard Wertenschlag , m'avait avoué , en souriant : " Je croyais que vous étiez de notre communauté . "
J'ai dû amputer une partie de mon identité , j'ai dû effacer ce prénom arabe de mes conversations .
Dire Mustapha , c'est prendre le risque de voir votre interlocuteur refuser de vous parler .
Je me dis parfois que je suis parano , que je me trompe .
Mais ça s'est si souvent produit ...
A mon arrivée au journal , en juillet 2004 , je pars pour l'île de la Barthelasse , près d'Avignon , couvrir un fait divers .
Un gamin a été assassiné à la hachette par un Marocain .
Je me retrouve devant la maison où s'est déroulé le drame , je frappe à la porte , et le cousin , la cinquantaine , qui a tenté de réanimer l'enfant en sang , me regarde froidement en me lançant : " J'aime pas les Arabes . "
Finalement , il me reçoit chez lui .
On pensait que le meurtrier s'était enfui de l'hôpital psychiatrique de l'endroit : j'appelle la direction , j'ai en ligne la responsable : " Bonjour , je suis M. Kessous du journal Le Monde ... "
Elle me dit être contente de me recevoir .
Une fois sur place , la secrétaire lui signale ma présence .
Une femme avec des béquilles me passe devant , je lui ouvre la porte , elle me dévisage sans me dire bonjour ni merci .
" Il est où le journaliste du Monde ? " , lance - t- elle .
Juste derrière vous , Madame : je me présente .
J'ai alors cru que cette directrice allait s'évanouir .
Toujours pas de bonjour .
" Vous avez votre carte de presse ? , me demande - t - elle .
Vous avez une carte d'identité ? "
" La prochaine fois , Madame , demandez qu'on vous faxe l'état civil , on gagnera du temps " , riposté-je .
Je suis parti , évidemment énervé , forcément désarmé , avant de me faire arrêter plus loin par la police qui croyait avoir ... trouvé le suspect .
Quand le journal me demande de couvrir la révolte des banlieues en 2005 , un membre du club Averroès , censé promouvoir la diversité , accuse Le Monde d'embaucher des fixeurs , ces guides que les journalistes paient dans les zones de guerre .
Je suis seulement l'alibi d'un titre " donneur de leçons " .
L'Arabe de service , comme je l'ai si souvent entendu dire .
Sur la Toile , des sites d'extrême droite pestent contre " l'immonde " quotidien de référence qui a recruté un " bougnoule " pour parler des cités .
Et pourtant , s'ils savaient à quel point la banlieue m'était étrangère .
J'ai grandi dans un vétuste appartement au coeur des beaux quartiers de Lyon .
En 1977 , débarquant d'Algérie , ma mère avait eu l'intuition qu'il fallait vivre au centre - ville et non pas à l'extérieur pour espérer s'en sortir : nous étions parmi les rares Maghrébins du quartier Ainay .
Pour que la réussite soit de mon côté , j'ai demandé à être éduqué dans une école catholique : j'ai vécu l'enfer !
" Retourne dans ton pays " , " T'es pas chez toi ici " , étaient les phrases chéries de certains professeurs et élèves .
Le 21 décembre 2007 , je termine une session de perfectionnement dans une école de journalisme .
Lors de l'oral qui clôt cette formation , le jury , composé de professionnels , me pose de drôles de questions : " Etes -vous musulman ?
Que pensez - vous de la nomination d'Harry Roselmack ?
Si vous êtes au Monde , c'est parce qu'il leur fallait un Arabe ? "
A plusieurs reprises , arrivant pour suivre un procès pour le journal , je me suis vu demander : " Vous êtes le prévenu ? " par l'huissier ou le gendarme en faction devant la porte du tribunal .
Le quotidien du journaliste ressemble tant à celui du citoyen .
Depuis plusieurs mois , je cherche un appartement .
Ces jours derniers , je contacte un propriétaire et tombe sur une dame à la voix pétillante :
" Je m'appelle Françoise et vous ? "
" Je suis M. Kessous " , lui répondis - je en usant de mon esquive habituelle .
" Et votre prénom ? " , enchaîne - t - elle .
Je crois qu'elle n'a pas dû faire attention à mon silence .
Je n'ai pas osé le lui fournir .
Je me suis dit que , si je le lui donnais , ça serait foutu , qu'elle me dirait que l'appartement avait déjà été pris .
C'est arrivé si souvent .
Je n'ai pas le choix .
J'hésite , je bégaye : " Euhhhhh ... Mus ... Mustapha . "
Au départ , je me rendais seul dans les agences immobilières .
Et pour moi - comme par hasard - il n'y avait pas grand - chose de disponible .
Quand des propriétaires me donnent un rendez - vous pour visiter leur appartement , quelle surprise en voyant " M. Kessous " !
Certains m'ont à peine fait visiter les lieux , arguant qu'ils étaient soudainement pressés .
J'ai demandé de l'aide à une amie , une grande et belle blonde .
Claire se présente comme ma compagne depuis cet été et fait les visites avec moi : nous racontons que nous allons prendre l'appartement à deux .
Visiblement , ça rassure .
En tout cas plus que ces vigiles qui se sentent obligés de me suivre dès que je pose un pied dans une boutique ou que ce vendeur d'une grande marque qui ne m'a pas ouvert la porte du magasin .
A Marseille , avec deux amis ( un Blanc et un Arabe ) - producteurs du groupe de rap IAM - , un employé d'un restaurant a refusé de nous servir ...
La nuit , l'exclusion est encore plus humiliante et enrageante , surtout quand ce sont des Noirs et des Arabes qui vous refoulent à l'entrée d'une boîte ou d'un bar .
Il y a quatre mois , j'ai voulu amener ma soeur fêter ses 40 ans dans un lieu parisien " tendance " .
Le videur nous a interdit l'entrée :
" Je te connais pas ! "
Il aurait pourtant pu se souvenir de ma tête : j'étais déjà venu plusieurs fois ces dernières semaines , mais avec Dida Diafat , un acteur - dont je faisais le portrait pour Le Monde - et son ami , le chanteur Pascal Obispo .
Fin 2003 , je porte plainte contre une discothèque lyonnaise pour discrimination .
Je me présente avec une amie , une " Française " .
Le portier nous assène le rituel " Désolé , y a trop de monde . "
Deux minutes plus tard , un groupe de quinze personnes - que des Blancs - entre .
Je veux des explications .
" Dégage ! " , m'expédie le videur .
La plainte sera classée sans suite .
J'appellerai Xavier Richaud , le procureur de la République de Lyon , qui me racontera qu'il n'y avait pas assez d'" éléments suffisants " .
Que dire des taxis qui après minuit passent sans s'arrêter ?
Que dire de la police ?
Combien de fois m'a -t - elle contrôlé - y compris avec ma mère , qui a plus de 60 ans - , plaqué contre le capot de la voiture en plein centre - ville , fouillé jusque dans les chaussettes , ceinturé lors d'une vente aux enchères , menotté à une manifestation ?
Je ne compte plus les fois où des agents ont exigé mes papiers , mais pas ceux de la fille qui m'accompagnait : elle était blonde .
En 2004 , une nuit à Lyon avec une amie , deux policiers nous croisent : " T'as vu le cul qu'elle a ! " , lance l'un d'eux .
" C'est quoi votre problème ? " rétorqué - je .
Un des agents sort sa matraque et me dit en la caressant :
" Il veut quoi le garçon ? "
Le lendemain , j'en ai parlé avec Yves Guillot , le préfet délégué à la police : il m'a demandé si j'avais noté la plaque de leur voiture .
Non ...
En 2007 , la brigade anticriminalité , la BAC , m'arrête sur les quais du Rhône à Lyon : j'étais sur un Vélo'v .
On me demande si j'ai le ticket , si je ne l'ai pas volé .
L'autre jour , je me gare en scooter sur le trottoir devant Le Monde .
Je vois débouler une voiture , phares allumés : des policiers , mains sur leurs armes , m'arrêtent .
Je leur dis que je travaille là .

Probabilistic inference often leads to MapReduce computations of the auspicious form with few distinct cases of mapping .
Indeed , we write models that express generic knowledge about elements of the domain , incorporating specific information we happen to have about particular elements .
The problem is how to automatically discover the auspicious form of the mapping function .
We would like to write the function as an expression in a general purpose programming language -- the expression that we can evaluate as usual .
Our goal is to abstractly interpret the very same expression to find out the particular cases and the default .
The problem is trivial for simple loops .
It becomes harder if MapReduce computations are nested and the mapping function includes ( equality ) comparisons of variables of different loops .
The problem is really interesting if we want to loop over all subsets of the domain , when the straightforward enumeration becomes intractable even for small domains .
One may regard the switch data structure as a representation of the normal form of a term in the lambda - calculus with many - component sums .
Our reification of nested loop bodies is then an instance of normalization - by - evaluation , and a non-trivial application of multi-prompt delimited continuations .

( CNN ) --
There was n't a cloud in the sky early Friday when Dave Samuels trained his telescopes at the moon , hoping to catch a glimpse of a NASA rocket striking the lunar landscape .
The moon , shown shortly before NASA 's rockets hit on Friday morning .
" We saw nothing , " he said .
Samuels is vice president of the Fremont Peak Observatory near Monterey , California , which had invited members of the public to watch Friday 's NASA mission through its telescopes .
The lunar strike happened shortly after 4:30 a.m. on the West Coast ( 7:30 a.m. ET ) .
NASA had encouraged everyone around the country to host " impact parties , " saying the plume of dust generated by the lunar impact would be visible through " mid- sized backyard " telescopes 10 inches or larger .
It said the chances of seeing the plume were greater for people living in areas that were still dark .
The space agency even posted an interactive map on its
Web site so people could find " a public event near you . "
NASA officials had said the impact of the Centaur upper - stage rocket would result in plumes of dust of more than 250 metric tons .
After it hit , the debris was analyzed by a satellite -- launched along with the rocket -- that traveled through the dust cloud before its own impact on the moon .
The goal of the $ 79 million mission was to determine whether there is water on the moon .
After the impact , NASA officials called the mission a success , saying the satellite sent back a good amount of data that now will be analyzed .
Jennifer Stracener of Vilonia , Arkansas , said she got up early to watch NASA 's live telecast of the impact .
She was disappointed , and posted her reaction on CNN's iReport.com .
Do n't Miss NASA 's strike on moon worked , mission official says
NASA 's strike on moon worked , mission official says iReport.com : Stargazer stories on moon crash
" These was no plume , no nothing , " she said by phone .
" It just kind of blacked out . "
She said the telecast did not show the rocket 's impact clearly .
" I was looking for some action -- something happening , " she said .
" I think a lot of people were , because they [ NASA ] hyped it up , you know .
...
No one saw anything . "
Stracener woke up her husband and two children to see the lunar crash .
She said she wishes she had n't .
Darrick Gray , a high school science teacher near Kansas City , Missouri , had planned to take some of his students to the nearby Powell Observatory to watch the lunar impact through their telescopes -- but they decided to skip the field trip because of bad weather .
" This is truly a once - in - a - lifetime thing , " Gray had said beforehand .
Gray -- who is also the director of the Astronomical Society of Kansas City -- said he had hoped the mission would influence his students to think about pursuing careers in science .
" Being as we do live here in Missouri , we 're away from the hub [ of astronomy ] , " he explained .
" We 're not in Florida , we 're not in Texas , we 're not in Silicon Valley -- it 's not something they 're used to seeing .
" So any time you can show them something that 's never been done , and they say , ' Oh this is pretty cool , ' I think they buy into that . "
NASA held an all - night party at Ames Research Center -- located just outside San Francisco -- which was directing the mission .
There were movies , music , food and guest speakers , and it culminated with a live transmission of the lunar impact .
" I would have loved to see , you know , huge amounts of dust flying up and ejecta , but we didn't , " said Liza Coe , who attended the Ames event .
" I thought it was so neat being able to see just as we got closer and closer to the moon and realizing that that was really happening right now .
" It was n't just a picture of the moon that somebody was putting up . "
Back at Fremont Peak Observatory , even though most of the 50 people who attended the " impact party " were disappointed , they were good sports about the " failure , " Samuels said .
Even Samuels , who has been an astronomer since he was 15 years old , said he got a lot out of the viewing party -- which he said was standing - room only .
" I do n't look at the moon so much because it 's always there ... so I got to know the moon 's craters better , " he said .
" And I think the people that attended , some of them that were disappointed , [ still ] felt like it was worth coming and being part of something that was going on . "
He said he hopes the event generates more support for the observatory , which is run by volunteers .
It is located in Fremont Peak State Park , which is on a list of state parks that could close because of California 's recent budget cuts .
" We 're trying to promote interest in the peak and every single person that came was part of that , " he said .
" They all learned something . "
Fremont Peak Observatory has a 30 - inch telescope that Samuels described as " the most accessible public telescope in the [ San Francisco ] Bay area . "
He said he hoped that the reason they did n't see a plume from the rocket impact was n't because of " another case where somebody forgot to carry the one " -- a reference to incorrect mathematical computation , which was blamed for the failure of the Mars Surveyor Climate Orbiter mission to Mars in 1999 .
He suggested that next time , NASA might want to be " a little more careful suggesting people should get out of bed at 4:30 in the morning and haul their kids out there . "

The flow of particles into our solar neighbourhood is uneven
The first results from Nasa 's Interstellar Boundary Explorer ( Ibex ) spacecraft have shown unexpected features at our Solar System 's edge .
Ibex was launched nearly one year ago to map the heliosphere , the region of space defined by the extent of our Sun 's solar wind .
Ibex 's first glimpses show that the heliosphere is not shaped as many astronomers have believed .
A series of papers in the journal Science outlines the results .
Our Solar System is whipping around the centre of the galaxy .
Just like a hand held out of a moving car , the Solar System feels a " wind " of particles from the region between our star and its nearest neighbours .
At the same time , the solar wind - a constant stream of fast - moving particles in all directions - blows outwards from the Sun .
The boundary at which the incoming and outgoing particles are at equivalent pressures , known as the heliopause , defines the heliosphere - the " bubble " in space generated by our own Sun 's exhalations .
True shape
The true extent and shape of the heliosphere has been a subject of debate for more than half a century .
Until now , the best clues came from the two Voyager spacecraft , which are believed to have passed through the heliopause at two different distances .
INTERSTELLAR BOUNDARY EXPLORER ( IBEX ) Completes a large , elliptical orbit around the Earth Measures uncharged atoms that enter the Solar System from the interstellar medium Can detect hydrogen , helium , and oxygen moving at a wide range of speeds through the Solar System Results should explain how interstellar magnetic fields form our heliosphere Through a process known as " charge exchange " at the heliosphere 's edge , fast - moving neutral or uncharged particles are created , and it is these energetic neutral atoms or ENAs that the Ibex spacecraft aims to measure .
It orbits the Earth in a vast ellipse , gathering incoming ENAs flying back from the heliopause at a range of speeds .
What a number of researchers have found is that the flow of the ENAs is uneven , with a significantly higher flow in a " ribbon " across the sky .
" The Ibex results are truly remarkable , with emissions not resembling any of the current theories or models of this never - before - seen region , " said lead researcher Dr David McComas of the Southwest Research Institute in New Mexico .
" We expected to see small , gradual spatial variations at the interstellar boundary .
However , Ibex is showing us a very narrow ribbon that is two to three times brighter than anything else in the sky . "
Near miss
These concentrations of incoming particles were just missed by the Voyager spacecraft , Dr McComas explained .
" The most astounding feature in the Ibex sky maps - the bright narrow ribbon - snakes through the sky between the Voyager spacecraft , where it remained completely undetected until now , " he said .
Further measurements were made by the Cassini spacecraft orbiting Saturn .
It too has a " camera " that can capture incoming neutral atoms , and also observed a ribbon - shaped region across the sky , but from ENAs moving at slightly different speeds .
What is clear is that the heliosphere is not shaped like a comet , as previously thought , with a head pointed at the oncoming interstellar medium and a tail of matter trailing behind .
The research groups agree that the magnetic field interactions at the heliopause have as - yet undetermined effects on the overall shape .
But the exact shape , and the forces that cause it , are still a matter of debate between the teams .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Obama administration on Friday urged a U.S. court to dismiss a lawsuit by gay married couples from Massachusetts who say they were unlawfully denied federal marriage benefits .
Gay marriage supporters are seen through a gay pride flag outside the Massachusetts State House in Boston November 9 , 2006 .

President Barack Obama won strong support from gays during his presidential campaign and has pressed for repealing the 1996 Defense of Marriage
Act that bars the federal government from recognizing same - sex marriages .
But the gay community has been angered by the Obama administration ’s defense of the law in court proceedings .
Justice Department officials say they are obligated to defend federal statutes when they are challenged .
“ In making this filing , the department is bound by the only precedent that exists , which is that no court has found such a right to federal benefits based upon marital status to be constitutionally required , ” said Justice Department spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler .
The filing in the U.S. Court for the District of Massachusetts “ points out the administration ’s position that Congress should extend federal benefits to spouses in same - sex marriages , ” she said .
Massachusetts was the first state to legalize same - sex marriages but those couples cannot access federal protections and programs granted to heterosexual married couples , prompting legal challenges .
The lawsuit , filed on behalf of seven same - sex couples and three survivors of same - sex spouses , says it is unconstitutional to bar them from enrolling in federal healthcare programs , receiving certain retirement and survivor benefits and filing joint income tax returns .
“ No court has found such a right to federal benefits to be fundamental -- and the federal courts that have considered the question in the context of DOMA ( Defense of Marriage Act ) itself have rejected such a claim , ” the Justice Department said in the filing .
The department urged that the lawsuits be dismissed because their claims either were without merit or the individuals did not have a legal right to sue .
Obama in June extended a few benefits , including opening the government ’s long - term care insurance to gay partners of federal employees and allowing federal employees to use their sick leave to tend to a gay partner or the partner ’s children .
Massachusetts in July sued the U.S. government to seek federal benefits for about 16,000 same - sex couples who have been married in the state .
The trade - in program Toys R Us was testing back in March seems to have tested well , as the retailer launches said program nationwide today , accepting used games from the Atari 2600 on up .

Yes , the Toys R Us trade - in program differs from many of their competition in that there is no cut - off point when a game is too old to be traded in .
As long as the customer supplies the original game in the original packaging , they can exchange their games for store credit good at Toys R Us and Babies R Us stores , along with the corresponding online outlets .

" The video game trade - in program is another way we 're providing customers with additional value when they visit our stores , " said Bill Lee , Vice President , Divisional Merchandise Manager , Toys " R" Us , U.S. " This program is designed to make the exchange process completely hassle - free for customers by accepting games from even the oldest systems , including the original Atari 2600 and 32 - bit Sega Genesis . "
Outside of the odd vintage video game shop and online outlets like eBay , there really are n't many places you can take your old Intellivision , NES , or Sega Genesis games for store credit .
Depending on the reaction to the program , this could make the Toys R Us used video game section a very interesting place to shop , with games we 've not seen in ages popping up on store shelves .

That 's a missed opportunity right there .
La ciudad de Buenos Aires esconde una aldea .
Sí : una aldea de verdad , con personas y construcciones rudimentarias ; huertas , ritos y todo eso .
Un extraño rincón de la ciudad que permanece fuera del sistema y donde el tiempo no tiene tiempo .
O , por lo menos , eso es lo que desearían quienes lo habitan y construyen .
Velatropa comenzó a levantarse hace dos años en los cimientos de lo que iba a ser el pabellón cinco de la Ciudad Universitaria , frente al estadio de River Plate .
El espacio , abandonado desde hace décadas , pertenece a la Universidad de Buenos Aires ( UBA ) , que tolera su presencia , y en algún momento hubo en las proximidades otro tipo de asentamientos , como la controvertida " villa rosa " , que ya no está .
Oculta entre los árboles , la vegetación y el hormigón , la curiosa ecoaldea es un secreto para la mayoría de los porteños , pero bastante difundido entre los estudiantes y las autoridades universitarias .
" Sí , claro , los pibes de la aldea están por allá " , indicó el encargado de la playa de estacionamiento del complejo universitario .
Un sendero por detrás de los pabellones paralelo a la orilla del río lleva hasta una especie de portal del que cuelgan unas cintas de tela y un cartel que dice : " Bienvenidos a la ecoaldea Velatropa " .
El camino sigue hacia las entrañas de un espacio en constante construcción .
Allí surge de la nada un " refugio de invierno " que conjuga salón , mesas , sillones y sillas , un espacio de estudio , una cocina de barro y el guardabicicletas comunitario .
Cuentan , también , con un panel solar para proveerse de luz y una canilla de agua corriente cedida por la UBA .
Puede parecer increíble , pero el proyecto gestado al calor de algunos estudiantes creció al punto de que los velatropenses ya son alrededor de un centenar .
Los fines de semana cocinan comidas naturales que comparten entre todos y , al caer el sol , plantan un árbol frutal ( hay cerezos , paltas y ciruelos ) .
Esos retoños pugnan por crecer en una tierra generada a partir de los rellenos sobre el río .
La mayoría de los velatropenses , de entre 20 y 30 años , no vive allí y trashuman entre sus casas céntricas y esta especie de vergel ultraecológico donde no está permitido fumar - hay un sector especial para hacerlo - ni beber alcohol .
Las construcciones están proyectadas a partir de barro y materiales totalmente reciclados - botellas , maderas , plásticos - , con dise ños libres con aires gaudianos o modelos físicos .
También hay carpas .
Y un sistema informal de riego para la huerta .
Los aldeanos se llaman entre sí " hermanos " , se guían por el calendario maya y viven según las directrices de la " permacultura " .
Velatropa no sería tan rara si no fuera porque está enclavada en plena ciudad .
En la Argentina existen otras ecoaldeas , como Gaia , en la localidad bonaerense de Navarro , o Jardín Paz Mundial , en Epuyén .
Pero aquí el contexto es bien distinto .
Mientras los velatropenses meditan en círculo , un avión pasa a muy baja altura y ruge sobre sus cabezas antes de aterrizar en el Aeroparque .
El ruido del tránsito de la avenida Leopoldo Lugones trastoca , por momentos , el silencio natural que anhelan los aldeanos .
Pero a Flor , una de las velatropenses , no parece importarle .
" Esto es de todos , no es nuestro ...
Queremos enseñar que se puede vivir de otra manera con respeto a la tierra , en paz y en armonía con la naturaleza " , dice esta estudiante de física con un nivel de argumentación contundente .
" Mi familia dice que soy otra persona desde que estoy acá y están recontentos , porque antes de encontrar este lugar alquilaba un departamento con amigas , trabajaba de camarera y ni siquiera había terminado el secundario .
Acá encontré un sentido a mi existencia " , agregó .
En realidad , los velatropenses no quisieron participar de esta nota , al señalar que no están " preparados " para enfrentar a la prensa .
Es que quizá resulte muy sencillo encontrar la aldea , pero , en cambio , no es tan fácil conocer a los " aldeanos " un poco más allá de lo que consideran su " obra " .
Ver Velatropa , una aldea oculta en un mapa más grande
Consejos
Velatropa , aunque parezca a primera vista libertaria , está regida por una organización compuesta por dos consejos que toman las decisiones en reuniones programáticas que se realizan dos veces por semana .
Incluso tienen un blog ( aldeavelatropa.blogspot.com ) donde difunden sus técnicas de producción , reciclado y construcción .
La idea es que quien desee participar de la iniciativa realice tareas concretas .
" No podés caer con una carpa y quedarte sin hacer nada " , susurra uno de ellos con el ceño bastante serio .
" Es un nodo ecológico de desarrollo sustentable , interdisciplinario y autogestionado por estudiantes de la UBA " , puede leerse en un folleto sobre la mesa del refugio .
Y sigue : " Nuestro proyecto a futuro es , en combinación con las autoridades de la UBA , poder reciclar toda la basura de la Ciudad Universitaria " .
A estas alturas , la pregunta se plantea sola : ¿y de qué viven ?
Ellos aclaran que tienen un nivel de gasto casi nulo .
No parece extraño a simple vista , aunque también cocinan empanadas que venden entre los alumnos de la Ciudad Universitaria , donde ya son un clásico .
Todos son vegetarianos y buena parte de los productos que consumen son el fruto de las huertas diseñadas sobre terrenos formados con escombros de hormigón .
El secreto no puede mantenerse para siempre .
En Velatropa lo saben , y aunque los perturba , confían en seguir adelante , reciclándose .
Yesterday I did what Free Software authors supposedly do n’t do .
I wrote documentation .
In fact , I had a relatively detailed README already , but I thought this would be a good opportunity to create a more elaborate documentation , using the ubiquitous DocBook .
You can read the HTML documentation for arbtt online , where it ’s automatically updated when I push to the darcs repository .
You can see , I use the same CSS file that most Haskell - related DocBook documentation seems to use .
One motivation to use DocBook was that I can extract manpages from it , which should be present if I package arbtt for Debian .
I was about to complain that references from the manpages to other part of the documentation can not work sensibly , but using the “ profiling ” feature of docbook - xsl , I can replace them by a textual reference to the user ’s manual if the file is processed for manpage output .
Have a look at my changes for that if you want to know how it works .
For some reason , the < refentry >- tags that make up the manpages are split to separate files when generating chunked HTML output , but they do not appear in the table of contents .
You have to find a spot in the text where they are linked , as they are now in the section “ Program references ” , to find them .
This is unfortunate , I expect that a few readers might miss this important part of the documentation .
Am I doing something wrong ?
For the configuration file , I put an EBNF - style grammar description in the documentation .
There is a special DocBook module for that , but I ’m not satisfied with it .
On the right hand side of production rules , it has only special support for nonterminals , but no tags to semantically mark up choice , repetition etc .
I followed the lead found at the YAML specification and put < quote >- Tags around literal parts of the grammar , but this is not valid according to the DocBook DTD .
Speaking of the DTD : I guess since the EBNF - stuff is just a module , the tag < productionset > is not a valid content of < figure > .
So , if I choose to use the EBNF module in a sensible way , I will not have a valid DocBook file .
All in all , I am satisified with the result .
Especially that nobody can say any more “ I like your program , but I ca n’t contribute , because I do n’t know Haskell ” .
Just improve the docs ! :-)

Barter Networks and the Counter - Economy
The late Samuel Edward Konkin III ( SEK3 ) , in the New Libertarian Manifesto , coined the term “ counter - economics ” to describe the building of an economy outside the corporate - state nexus , and operating below its radar .
The counter - economy would evade both state regulations and state taxation , starve the state of the revenues it needed to operate , and eventually supplant the corporate - state economy .
Unfortunately , SEK3 took too narrow a view of the counter - economy : rather than viewing illegality as a means to an end , he viewed it as an end in itself , and as the defining characteric of counter - economics .
That approach is unsatisfactory , since it means we define our efforts in terms of the state rather than in terms of our own self - derived goals .
Indeed , the state ’s own statism is a means to an end , and defined largely in relation to our own self - determined goals : to prevent us from supporting ourselves in comfort , independently of the corporate - state nexus and wage employment , and from receiving the full product of our labor .
If counter - economics is the means , we should also remember that the means is the end in progress .
Evading the state is not an end in itself ; it is , rather , a means of accomplishing what we would want to accomplish for its own sake , even if the state never existed .
Counter - economics is the building of the kind of society and economy we want right now .
And if we define it that way , it dovetails nicely with many similar concepts prevalent on the libertarian , decentralist Left : counter - institutions , dual power , and ( that wonderful Wobbly slogan ) “ building the foundation of the new society within the shell of the old . ”
In that context , I ’d like to welcome a new member to the world family of local currency and barter systems , right here in Northwest Arkansas : the Ozark Hours , or “ Hill Bills ” system , which was established following Ithaca Hours founder Paul Glover ’s visit to Fayetteville .
LETS systems and barter networks are an invaluable counter - economic tool , by which producers can exchange their goods and services directly to one another outside the corporate - state nexus and outside the wage system .
In periods when money dries up in the larger , official corporate economy , they enable under - or unemployed workers with underused tools to put themselves to work producing directly for other members of the barter network .
For that reason , barter systems have tended to proliferate in periods of economic depression or stagnation .
Labour Notes were used by unemployed Owenite trade unionists to coordinate production for barter .
The Worgl local currency system , adopted in an Austrian town at the depth of the Great Depression , enabled unemployed workers to support themselves producing for each other .
The Unemployed Cooperative Relief Organization and the Unemployed Exchange Operation were both formed in California during the Depression , when unemployed workers realized that they still had the skills and the tools , and the demand for each other ’s services , even when there was “ no money . ”
Ted Trainer , a writer on relocalized economies , has pointed out that local currency systems are not enough by themselves .
Too often , most of the people spending local currency simply earn conventional money in the wage system , and then exchange official money for LETS notes at a local bank or other business .
The majority of people in the community have no way of actually producing directly for the network and earning local currency units within the barter system .
At the same time , the LETS system turns into a glorified Green Stamps system for buying stuff at a discount from already - established , conventional local businesses ; a handful of local businesses operating within the system may accumulate a large number of LETS dollars , and find they have nothing to spend them on because of the limited range of local businesses participating in the system .
As Trainer argues , the local currency system by itself is the next thing to useless , if new ways are n’t found for underemployed and unemployed workers to put themselves to work producing for barter , and for those presently employed at wage labor to begin meeting a larger portion of their needs by producing directly for the barter network outside the wage system .
The local currency system , rather than an end in itself , must be seen primarily as a tool of self - empowerment for working people who want the option of producing outside the wage system .
Trainer raises an important question : where is the capital to be found to support self - employment and employment in worker cooperatives ?
One largely overlooked source of such capital is the ordinary household capital goods most people already own .
For example , a home - based microbakery using only an ordinary kitchen oven .
Or an unlicensed cab using a family car and cell phone .
Or a neighborhood childcare or elder care facility , operated out of someone ’s home for the other neighbors .
Or a home - sewing business , repairing clothing or producing new clothes to independent designs .
One benefit of such household microenterprises is their low overhead .
Because they produce using the spare capacity of ordinary household appliances that most people already own , there is no initial capital outlay and no overhead from servicing it .
With no overhead cost , all income over and above current expenses is free and clear .
The microentrepreneur can therefore afford to engage in small batch production , with no pressure to “ get big or get out . ”
He can use the microenterprise as a means to shift a portion of his subsistence needs from wage employment to self - employment , on an incremental basis , with no risk , and ride out periods of slow business or none with no loss .
One of the central functions of business and occupational licensing , and “ health ” and “ safety ” regulations , is to mandate minimum levels of overhead and make such small - batch production effectively illegal .
“ Health ” and “ safety ” codes , for instance , typically require our would - be microbaker to purchase an industrial - sized oven , refrigerator and dishwasher : an enormous debt which can only be serviced by large batch production on a full - time basis , in a separate building with permanent hired staff .
Under such circumstances , the only people who can afford self - employment and entrepreneurship are those who can raise the artificially high , state - mandated capital outlays ; everyone else must offer himself for hire to an employer who can afford such outlays .
And since the entry barriers artificially reduce the number of employers and inflate the number of people seeking wage employment , obviously , the dynamic tends to be one of workers competing for jobs , and the terms of employment being artificially set by the employer .
Such microenterprise is low - overhead in another sense .
Consider the case of an electrician who works for wages , and earns the money to hire plumbing done ( or vice versa ) .
As Scott Burns pointed out in “ The Household Economy , ” assuming for the moment that the plumber and electrician make similar wages , the electrician generally must pay the plumber ’s employer an hourly rate about 250 % the plumber ’s actual hourly wage–and vice versa .
That means the plumber must work two and a half hours to hire the labor of an electrician ( and again , vice versa ) .
But if the two exchange services directly through a barter network , each need only work an hour to obtain an hour of the other ’s services ( plus materials , of course ) .
What ’s more , they evade similar overhead costs from such forms of tribute as the sales tax–a consideration which should be pleasing to the shade of SEK3 .
Networked , crowdsourced , distributed credit also makes it possible to aggregate large sums of capital from many small individual contributions ( the funding of Center for a Stateless Society is an example of this ) .
Such methods are another way of raising capital to organize production within a barter network .
Crowdsourced capital could be used , for instance , for the kind of counter - institutions suggested by Dougald Hine in “ Social Media vs. the Recession , ” and built on by Nathan Cravens ( of Appropedia and Open - Source Ecology ) .
Hine suggested , in general terms , that self - organization through social media might be used by the unemployed and underemployed to find self - organized ways to support themselves .
This might include , he said , organizing common access to tools of various kinds , the use of Freecycle to reduce the cost of living , and the use of social networking to put people with various skills in direct contact with each other .
Cravens called for a three - legged countereconomic stool of Fabrication Labs ( workshops ) , Internet Cafes , and Community Supported Agriculture , financed by local P2P networks .
I ’ve suggested that some sort of open - source housing be added to the mix , as a “ fourth leg ” : some sort of bare - bones cohousing project , perhaps in a cheap refurbished warehouse building with cots and access to water taps and hotplates on something like the YMCA model ; or perhaps as some sort of organized squat movement refurbishing abandoned buildings .
Another benefit of self - employed production for a barter network , besides the low overhead cost , is the level of security it permits .
Participation in the money economy and its wage system involve a lengthy circuit of transactions which is vulnerable to disruption , no matter how many people need each other ’s actual services , if someone currently lacks ready money to hire them .
Consider , on the other hand , a market gardener living next door to a home seamstress .
The seamstress and her family cannot consume the farmer ’s whole output of vegetables , nor can his family keep her fully employed sewing .
But the two families , together , have a secure source for all their vegetable and clothing needs , and each has a secure outlet for the portion of its output consumed by the other .
The more skills and trades are brought into the system , the larger the portion of the membership ’s consumption needs can be securely and reliably met by transforming their labor into use - value , without the vagaries and uncertainties of wage employment in the larger money economy .
As corporate bankruptcies , Peak Oil , and the deterioration of the national transportation system lead to the collapse of corporate logistic chains , a considerable portion of industrial activity is likely to shift from the manufacture of new appliances and machinery to the repair and recycling of existing machinery in backyard and neighborhood workshops .
And the custom production of replacement parts in small machine shops may lead to networked manufacturing of new , open - source product designs .
As the old money economy and wage employment dry up , and idle industrial capacity turns to rust , a growing portion of our economic life may become organized through local barter networks .
I think it ’s quite likely , in twenty years time , that we will meet a majority of our consumption needs through production mediated by the barter network .
Most of our food will come from our own backyard or neighborhood gardens , or from local market gardeners selling to the barter network .
Our bread will come from our own ovens or from the neighborhood microbaker , our milk and cheese from someone whose cow makes too much for one family , and our clothing from the neighborhood seamstress .
Our cars and appliances will be kept going by custom - machined parts from a well - equipped local workshop .
Our primary healthcare will come through a modernized version of “ lodge practice ” ( previously suppressed by the medical licensing cartels ) , with the physician working on retainer for a local barter network in return for credit with the system .
Old age and disability insurance , and provision for support in neighborhood care facilities if needed , will be funded by premiums deducted from one ’s balance in the barter network .
To the extent that people continue to rely on wage labor to meet a significant minority of their needs outside the barter network ( obviously there wo n’t be neighborhood microchip foundries any time soon ) , the fact that most people use wage labor only for supplemental income and can afford to do without it for months at a time will mean that labor finally has the whip hand , and the advantage that comes from the ability to walk away from the table .
The average worker might work , say , one or two days a week to earn money to meet the needs that ca n’t be satisfied within the barter network ( perhaps something from the much smaller product stream of new appliances ) .
And like the cottager of 250 years ago , he can afford to “ retire on the common ” for a spell if he finds the terms of employment too onerous ( it was exactly this very circumstance , in which working people could either take work or leave it , which motivated the employing classes to enclose the commons ) .
If local currency systems are used as just another yuppified “ buy local ” program for the Main Street establishment , I suppose it ’s still better than nothing .
But if a majority of the participants are people actually engaged in self - employed production for the barter network , rather than just cashing in part of their paychecks for local scrip , local currencies could be a powerful counter - economic weapon for ordinary working people to achieve independence from the corporate state .
Biomolecular computers , made of DNA and other biological molecules , only exist today in a few specialized labs , remote from the regular computer user .
Nonetheless , Tom Ran and Shai Kaplan , research students in the lab of Prof.
Ehud Shapiro of the Weizmann Institute 's Biological Chemistry , and Computer Science and Applied Mathematics Departments have found a way to make these microscopic computing devices ' user friendly , ' even while performing complex computations and answering complicated queries .
Shapiro and his team at Weizmann introduced the first autonomous programmable DNA computing device in 2001 .
So small that a trillion fit in a drop of water , that device was able to perform such simple calculations as checking a list of 0s and 1s to determine if there was an even number of 1s .
A newer version of the device , created in 2004 , detected cancer in a test tube and released a molecule to destroy it .
Besides the tantalizing possibility that such biology - based devices could one day be injected into the body - a sort of ' doctor in a cell ' locating disease and preventing its spread - biomolecular computers could conceivably perform millions of calculations in parallel .
Now , Shapiro and his team , in a paper published online today in Nature Nanotechnology , have devised an advanced program for biomolecular computers that enables them to ' think ' logically .
The train of deduction used by this futuristic device is remarkably familiar .
It was first proposed by Aristotle over 2000 years ago as a simple if … then proposition : ' All men are mortal .
Socrates is a man .
Therefore , Socrates is mortal . '
When fed a rule ( All men are mortal ) and a fact ( Socrates is a man ) , the computer answered the question ' Is Socrates Mortal ? ' correctly .
The team went on to set up more complicated queries involving multiple rules and facts , and the DNA computing devices were able to deduce the correct answers every time .
At the same time , the team created a compiler - a program for bridging between a high - level computer programming language and DNA computing code .
Upon compiling , the query could be typed in something like this : Mortal ( Socrates ) ?.
To compute the answer , various strands of DNA representing the rules , facts and queries were assembled by a robotic system and searched for a fit in a hierarchical process .
The answer was encoded in a flash of green light :
Some of the strands had a biological version of a flashlight signal - they were equipped with a naturally glowing fluorescent molecule bound to a second protein which keeps the light covered .
A specialized enzyme , attracted to the site of the correct answer , removed the ' cover ' and let the light shine .
The tiny water drops containing the biomolecular data - bases were able to answer very intricate queries , and they lit up in a combination of colors representing the complex answers .

One night in October
by Jeremy Hooper
Eleven years ago , it could have been any of us .
On Monday , at various theatres across the nation , we vow to never forget :
GLENN CLOSE , JUDY SHEPARD , TO APPEAR AT NEW YORK PREMIERE OF LARAMIE PROJECT : TEN YEARS LATER
NPR ’S NEDA ULABY TO MODERATE LIVE WEB CAST OF POST SHOW DISCUSSION
New York , NY , September 30 , 2009 ..
The groundbreaking epilogue to the Laramie Project , titled THE LARAMIE PROJECT : 10 YEARS LATER , will be performed in New York at Lincoln Center and over 150 other theaters across the country on October 12 , 2009 .
The Lincoln Center premiere will feature a pre-show that will be webcast live to the other productions and include guest host Glenn Close , welcoming remarks by Judy Shepard and a post - production Q and A moderated by National Public Radio Arts and Culture correspondent Neda Ulabay .
“ We now have over 150 theaters participating in this historic event and are thrilled to be joined by Judy Shepard , Glenn Close and our other special guests at the NY premiere ” said Greg Reiner , Executive Director of the Tectonic Theater Project .
“ The interest and enthusiasm that the epilogue is receiving is very exciting and demonstrates to us the power the Shepard story still holds for people , as part of our collective history and as a lesson to all about homophobia , what is means to be gay in a small town and how stories must be re-told to ensure that the legacy of these kinds of incidents is correct , ” continued Reiner .
“ The Laramie Project : 10 Years Later will engage the audience as did the original , and we expect there will be many who are surprised to learn what Laramie is like a decade after Matt ’s murder , ” concluded Reiner .
The writers of this play are Tectonic Theater Project members Moisés Kaufman , Leigh Fondakowski , Greg Pierotti , Andy Paris , and Stephen Belber .
Tickets are still available for the October 12 , 2009 New York City event at Alice Tully
Hall , online at:www.lincolncenter.org or by calling 800-721-6500 .
Information about tickets to all other events can be found on local links via www.laramieproject.org.
The epilogue focuses on the long - term effects of the murder of Matthew Shepard on the town of Laramie .
It explores how the town has changed and how the murder continues to reverberate in the community .
The play also includes new interviews with Matthew ’s mother Judy Shepard and Mathew ’s murderer Aaron McKinney , who ’s serving two consecutive life sentences .
The writers also conducted many follow - up interviews Laramie residents from the original piece , including , Romaine Patterson , Reggie Fluty , Jedediah Shultz , Father Roger Schmidt , Jonas Slonaker and others .
In tandem with the Premiere , an online interactive community will be launched where participants can blog , upload video and photos and share their stories about the play , experiences in preparing and presenting the Epilogue in their communities .
The members of Tectonic Theater Project will be active participants in the online community , offering participants feedback and encouragement .
MORE INFORMATION :
On October 6th of 1998 Matthew Shepard was beaten and left to die tied to a fence in the outskirts of Laramie , Wyoming .
He died 6 days later .
His murder became a watershed historical moment in America that highlighted the violence and prejudice lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( LGBT ) people face .
A month after the murder , the members of Tectonic Theater Project traveled to Laramie and conducted interviews with the people of the town .
From these interviews they wrote the play The Laramie Project , which they later made into a film for HBO .
The piece has been seen by more than 50 million people around the country .

No one who has ever had a baby chimp climb trustingly into her arms ( I have ) can doubt that Pan troglodytes is the nearest living relative to Homo sapiens .
But how close does that make us ?
Should we , as some influential scientists and philosophers have argued , see chimpanzees as fellow humans and accord them the same rights ?
Or does science support the assumption of human uniqueness that has prevailed through most of civilisation ?
As his title suggests , Jeremy Taylor is firmly in the second camp .
A TV science producer , he was driven to distraction by a stream of documentaries showing cute chimps displaying apparently human traits such as empathy , tool - making and language .
Egged on by a tendency to anthropomorphism , some primatologists have argued that the difference between chimpanzee and human cognition is simply a matter of degree .
Taylor is having none of it : " To call the difference quantitative between alarm calls , food - specific grunts , whoops and Shakespeare ; between night nests and twig tools , and the A380 passenger jet ; and between retribution and food sharing and Aristotle and Mill is , to my mind , stretching a point , and a bit of an insult to human ingenuity and culture . "
At a superficial level , science supports the chimps ' R ' us hypothesis .
In 2005 , scientists published a letter - by - letter comparison of the chimpanzee and human genomes , with an overall similarity of 96 % .
For comparison , studies of the human genome now put the similarity between any two individuals at between 97 % and 99 % .
The simplistic implication was that a small handful of genes made us big - brained , hairless , upright , long - lived and able to compose blank verse , baroque opera and the theory of relativity .
The reality has turned out to be much more complex .
Yes , there have been single - letter mutations that have changed the function of some genes .
But much of evolution depends on grosser forms of variation in which whole genes , or parts of genes , became duplicated , moved to other chromosomes or were lost altogether .
Moreover , subtle changes in how they are controlled mean that the same genes can be read in alternative ways to produce a variety of different products .
New research shows that all of these mechanisms have been at work to drive humans and chimpanzees apart at an accelerating rate since they diverged from a common ancestor .
Taylor minutely documents the way that apparently small changes have had disproportionate consequences , particularly in brain development and the immune system .
While the jury is still digesting this barrage of hard biology , Taylor brings on his star witness in the form of Betty the New Caledonian crow .
Betty knocks spots off chimpanzees when it comes to making and using tools .
Her cousins the scrub jays re-cache their food if a potential pilferer was watching when they hid it .
If corvids have such " human " skills , should we give them human rights too ?
Taylor gives no more than a dismissive aside to chimpanzee language studies , most of which he describes as " ridden with wishful thinking , over - exaggeration and even downright fantasy " .
Though this does not make for a scrupulously fair presentation of the evidence , his approach is enjoyably combative and certainly succeeds in mapping the biological , behavioural and social landscape that divides us from our next of kin .

Curvy and proud : America Ferrera shows off her shapely figure as she soaks up the sun in the Bahamas
As one of the curvier actresses on primetime TV , Ugly Betty star America Ferrera represents a positive role model for young women .
While many of her Hollywood contemporaries are starving and wearing size zero clothes , the 25 - year - old has always championed a healthier attitude to body image .
Rarely seen out of her Betty Suarez costumes or in a full - length gown on the red carpet , the actress gave fans a rare change to see her shapely figure as she relaxes in the Bahamas .
Beach babe : America Ferrera shows off her curves in a burgundy and aquamarine bikini as she strolls through the surf in the Bahamas
Wearing a burgundy and aquamarine bikini top and matching shorts , the curvy star strolled through the Caribbean surf as she holidays at the exclusive Atlantic resort .
America is currently enjoying a few days relaxation with friends after she recently completed filming the fourth season of Ugly Betty .
Only two weeks ago , America and her co-star Becki Newton were spotted filming the new series on the paradise island .
Shapely : America lives up to her first ever film role Real Women Do Have Curves
Frumpy : America as Betty Suarez in Ugly Betty
Staying at the same resort , America 's Betty character and Becki as Amanda played on water slides and swam with dolphins as the Mode employees enjoyed a vacation from the New York fashion magazine .
But after returning to the island last week , there were no braces or clashing clothes in sight as America chilled out by the sea .
While her role as Ugly Betty requires America to be curvy , the actress said she is perfectly happy with her figure and refuses to loose weight to conform to the Hollywood ideal .
She said in an interview this year : ' There 's just way too much attention placed on the way we look .
' I think it 's hilarious when people call Jessica Alba or Eva Longoria curvy .
Come on - they 're not curvy .
I 'm curvy !
' I 've been really lucky .
Playing Betty has prepared me to be exactly who I am and not to change .
' What is normal now ?
Is it normal to be size zero ?
Starving yourself is not beautiful .'

Here the same data in some other from :

So the average penis length is 6.16 inches .
The average girth is 4.84 inches .
More recent studies have produced the following results :
A sample of 60 men studied by researchers at the University of California at San Francisco determined that the average size of their erect penises was 5.1 inches long and 4.9 inches in girth .
A Brazilian urologist who measured 150 men reported that the average size of their erections was 5.7 inches long and 4.7 inches in girth .
If Obama = Hitler , then clearly Fox News = Jews during Holocaust :
When they ’re done with Fox , and you decide to speak out on something .
The old , " first they came for the Jews , and I was n’t Jewish . "
When you have a question , and you believe that something should be asked , they ’re a — totally fine with you right now ; they have no problem with you .
When they ’re done with Fox and talk radio , do you really think they ’re going to leave you alone if you want to ask a tough question ?
Do you really think that a man who has never had to stand against tough questions and has as much power as he does — do you really believe after he takes out the number one news network , do you really think that this man is then not going to turn on you ?
That you and your little organization is going to cause him any hesitation at all not to take you out ?
If you believe that , you should open up a history book , because you ’ve missed the point of many brutal dictators .
You missed the point on how they always start .
To recap : in Glenn Beck 's little world , President Obama could be on his way to becoming a " brutal dictator , " and it's all starting with the extermination of the Fox News Channel .
Except the White House has no such agenda .
In fact , just yesterday , White House Communications Director Anita Dunn said that President Obama plans to return to Fox for another interview .
The only caveat is that he 'll be doing it with the understanding that Fox is the political opposition -- not a news organization .
Obviously he ’ll go on Fox because he engages with ideological opponents .
And he has done that before .
He will do it again .
I ca n’t give you a date because , frankly , I ca n’t give you dates for anybody else right now .
But what I will say is that when he goes on FOX , he understands that he is not going on — it really is not a news network at this point .
He ’s going to debate the opposition .
And that ’s fine .
He never minds doing that .
Now if Glenn Beck wants to make the case that Fox is n't an anti-Obama media outlet , he can go right ahead .
Let 's have that debate .
But the White House is n't trying to stamp out Fox News .
They are just calling it what it is : the opposition party 's media outlet .
For 11 years , Cindy Briggs had been collecting fur from her golden retriever , Carly , in plastic bags and storing it in the closet .
She had no specific plans to use it , but something kept her from throwing it away .
The dog kept shedding , and Briggs kept brushing and collecting .
Over those 11 years , she moved the fur to three apartments and always took care never to squish it .
" I did n't know why I was doing it , " she said , " but it turned out to be a blessing . "
Briggs ' beloved dog has been dead for two years , but the dog trainer from suburban Washington , D.C. , has a memento of Carly 's presence in her home .
Through the Pet Yarn Chic Web site ( www.petyarnchic.com), Briggs had the fur she collected spun into a fuzzy golden yarn .
With the yarn she had an afghan knitted , and it now sits on top of a side table in her living room with a piece of glass over it .
" I can touch it any time I like , " she said .
She had planned to drape the afghan over her couch .
The only problem was , it shed .
The Pet Yarn Chic Web site was founded by N'ann Harp , a brand manager from Asheville , N.C. , and the owner of a long - haired cat named Tyler who " shed like a porcupine blowing quills . "
" I was going out of my mind , " she said .
In an attempt to manage the fur deposits blowing through her house like tumbleweeds , Harp began following the cat around with a plastic bag , stuffing it full of the tufts he left behind .
On a whim , she took the collected fur to a local knitting and fiber - arts store , Asheville NC Home Crafts , to see if the owner could spin it into yarn .
She said yes , and a new business was born .
Because most pet owners do not have access to spinners ( they are quite hard to find ) , Harp has set up two Web sites to connect the two .
For the spinners , usually stay - at - home mom hobbyists , she founded the Critter Knitter Guild , a loose association of spinners who get paid to spin yarn .
And for pet owners who have been hoarding dog , cat or bunny fur , she founded Pet Yarn Chic :
You send her $ 49.95 , and she sends you back a handbook , shipping supplies and hair - collection instructions .
The cost to spin the yarn varies , depending on the pet 's hair and any special care and handling it may need , but prices start around $ 10 to $ 12 per ounce .
If you are not a knitter , you can pay an additional fee to have a garment knitted for you .
Pet hair can be difficult to spin , so Harp has had to work hard to find experienced spinners .
Dog and cat fur tends to be shorter and more slippery than wool , requiring more twists per inch to help it stay together , and dog fur , in particular , tends to be stinky because of a natural lanolin in dogs ' skin .
Of course , not every animal 's fur will work .
Only long - haired cat fur and the fluffy undercoat of a dog can be spun into yarn .
Still , Marie Hendrix , a spinner for the Critter Knitter Guild and co-owner of the Asheville NC Home Crafts store , thinks dog and cat fur can be used to create beautiful yarn .
" It is a very soft hair , so it develops a halo around it like Angora does , almost an aura , " she said .
" It is a very comfortable , lovely , luscious fiber . "
WHY THE PUBLIC OPTION ISN ’T DEAD … .
This NYT piece is ostensibly about Democratic divisions over the details of health care reform — headline : “ For Democrats , Cracks in a United Front ” — which is n’t especially interesting .
The article , however , actually raises some interesting angles .
Most notable is the new - found optimism on the left about the prospects for a more ambitious reform bill .
It ’s largely a foregone conclusion that the Senate Finance Committee will wrap up this upcoming week , approving a bill that generates no ( or almost no ) GOP support , but fails to meet liberals ’ expectations .
But as the legislation moves to the floor , progressive lawmakers and their allies “ expect to be able to shape the final product more than they had hoped just weeks ago . ”
What ’s changed ?
Having the caucus return to 60 members does n’t hurt , but the NYT‘s Jackie Calmes point to two other angles .
One is the failure of Senator Max Baucus of Montana , a more conservative Democrat who heads the Finance Committee , to get any Republicans to support his draft legislation , after months of trying .
That doomed President Obama ’s goal of bipartisan backing for a health care overhaul , and now leaves party liberals arguing for a distinctly Democratic health plan .
“ One of the strongest arguments against a public option has been that the Republicans will never go for it , ” [ Sen . Chuck Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) ] said .
“ Well , the Baucus bill does n’t have a public option , and they ’re still not for it in any way , with the possible exception of Olympia Snowe , ” a moderate Republican senator from Maine , who has not ruled out supporting the overhaul that Mr. Obama is seeking .
The second development that has encouraged liberals is recent polling , including some done for The New York Times and CBS News in the last week , that gives Democrats a clear edge over Republicans as the party favored to deal with health care issues .
The same polls show significant support for a public option despite months of criticism from Republicans , who describe it as a government takeover of health insurance .
Congressional Democrats of all stripes have become more upbeat since returning to work after the August recess … .
The sense that something will become law has only strengthened the resolve of liberals , inside the Congress and out , to fight with intensity as Democrats write the legislation this fall .
Like Greg Sargent , I found that Schumer quote of particular interest .
Max Baucus bent over backwards to offer Republicans an insurance - industry - friendly bill , filled with concessions and ideas that Republicans had already embraced .
Every single GOP senator balked anyway .
I ’d hoped it was obvious beforehand , but this apparently sent quite a signal to the Democratic caucus — there ’s no point in watering down the bill to get bipartisan support if the minority is going to slap their hand away anyway .
I ’m also glad to see the polls are having an effect , as they should .
We ’re talking about a provision that would save taxpayers money , lower the costs of reform , and enjoys strong support from the public — including Republicans .
After months of constant whining about the perils of a “ government takeover , ” the public option enjoys broad approval across the country .
That ’s not to say this is going to be easy going forward ; just the opposite is true .
But the landscape looks more favorable than it did as recently as a few weeks ago .
Labour is blossoming or dancing where
The body is not bruised to pleasure soul .
Nor beauty born out of its own despair ,
Nor blear - eyed wisdom out of midnight oil .
O chestnut - tree , great - rooted blossomer ,
Are you the leaf , the blossom or the bole ?
O body swayed to music , O brightening glance ,
How can we know the dancer from the dance ?
– from Yeats , “ Among School Children ”
We are all familiar with Nietzsche ’s pronouncement about god and dance ; Montaigne says the most “ notable ” thing about Socrates is that he learned to dance when old .
It did not occur to me that the origin of this idea is Xenophon – Xenophon I had actually read before – until recently .
I ’ve been reading Dustin Gish , “ Xenophon ’s Socratic Rhetoric : A Study of the Symposium , ” pp. 95-102 , where he discusses the linkage between philosophy and dancing clearly .
Many of the insights below are from his work , if not all .
Xenophon ’s Symposium II , 15 - 16 , trans .
Todd :
At this point the boy performed a dance , eliciting from Socrates the remark , “ Did you notice that , handsome ( kalos ) as the boy is , he appears even handsomer ( kallion ) in the poses of the dance than when he is at rest ? ”
“ It looks to me , ” said Charmides , “ as if you were puffing the dancing - master . ”
“ Assuredly , ” replied Socrates ; “ and I remarked something else , too – that no part of his body was idle during the dance , but neck , legs , and hands were all active together .
And that is the way a person must dance who intends to increase the suppleness of his body .
And for myself , ” he continued , addressing the Syracusan [ the dancing - master ] , “ I should be delighted to learn the figures from you . ”
“ What use will you make of them ? ” the other asked .
“ I will dance , by Zeus ! ”
Gish points out that the relation between beautiful ( kalos ) and more beautiful ( kallion ) is one of motion and proportion .
The “ poses of the dance ” is a word that you could translate as “ forms ” ( 96 ) , but I do n’t want to get into that issue too deeply .
The usual Platonic word for “ forms ” is some variant of eidos , and kalos puts us with the “ noble ” and “ beautiful ” more than “ true . ”
“ Suppleness ” is not unimportant : you can go to Yeats above and see the full significance – this is about a work ( “ labor ” ) where soul does not emerge at the expense of body , in contrast to what marks labor generally , i.e. “ death . ”
Again , philosophy is the practice of dying and being dead : the center of Socrates ’ own list being “ legs ” is about taking oneself from one realm to another willingly , with total control of the destination pursued .
The rhetorical linkage of the philosopher here is between “ life ” ( motion ) and “ beauty , ” and that is because of “ suppleness ” – we have plenty of stories of the gods living well otherwise .
( “ Forms ” – poses of the dance – may be what Socrates is truly deliberating . )
In fact , just as all the other gods laugh because of Hephaestus ’ deformity at the end of Iliad Book 1 , Socrates is laughed at for his pronouncement that he wants to learn how to dance .
Symposium II , 17 – 19 :
This raised a general laugh ; but Socrates , with a perfectly grave expression on his face , said : “ You are laughing at me , are you ?
Is it because I want to exercise to better my health ?
Or because I want to take more pleasure in my food and sleep ?
Or is it because I am eager for such exercises as these , not like the long - distance runners , who develop their legs at the expense of their shoulders , nor like the prize fighters , who develop their shoulders but become thin - legged , but rather with a view to giving my body a symmetrical development by exercising it in every part ?
Or are you laughing because I shall not need to hunt up a partner to exercise with , or to strip , old as I am , in a crowd , but shall find a moderate - sized room large enough for me ( just as this room was large enough for the lad here to get up a sweat in ) , and because in winter I shall exercise under cover , and when it is very hot , in the shade ?
Or is this what provokes your laughter , that I have an unduly large paunch and wish to reduce it ?
Do n’t you know that just the other day Charmides here caught me dancing early in the morning ? ”
“ Indeed I did , ” said Charmides , “ and at first I was dumbfounded and feared that you were going stark mad ; but when I heard you say much the same thing as you did just now , I myself went home , and although I did not dance , for I had never learned how , I practiced shadow - boxing , for I knew how to do that . ”
Gish talks about perfect gentlemanship – that a gentleman must be noble ( kalos ) and good , and how Socrates is playfully leading the gentleman in the Symposium to where they ought to be .
So I think what is happening here is that the philosophic life is condescending to the noble : I mean , the argument about the proportion of the body and expert athletes may not fit with Socrates ’ philosophic endeavors .
Socrates could overpursue a line of thought to the detriment of all others ; love of wisdom does not necessitate expertise in any given subject , but will more than likely end up with a deformed mastery over one or two .
As Aristophanes has noted in the Clouds , “ health ” is not the end of the philosophic life .
To know how man ought to live according to nature is not the same thing as figuring that out in the first place .
Where Gish is exceptionally good is in describing how this private activity of dancing – which looks to be madness – actually appeals to one of the gentlemen .
Socrates has couched the argument for dancing in terms of utility ( 99 ) , and Charmides takes three things from it ( 100 ) : Socrates dances , but without proper training ( love of wisdom vs. wisdom ? ) ; without a ( private ) explanation , Socrates ’ deeds look insane ; finally , Charmides imitates Socrates in his own way .
There is something inherently noble and useful in the philosophic life , but it is very radical : the key to nobility is dancing privately ?
It ’s not hard for us to see how the teaching works at a political level : the football teams West Point and Annapolis field have a very tough time against any other school , because soldiers need to be proportional , whereas modern American football demands a specialized sort of athleticism .
Moreover , the notion that the leading men in society should take time to better themselves privately – not just be concerned to mesmerize people publicly – is advanced directly by this teaching .
Still , Socrates was dancing privately , and not for the sake of being noble .
In a sense , he is always dancing privately , and no criterion of utility can describe or explain that other than the very vague claim that there is a sort of labor unique to those who love wisdom , where the dancer is indistinguishable from the dance .
LAW firm Carter - Ruck is to send you a letter telling you to shut it right now or they will have your house .
The libel lawyers acted after thousands of bloggers and Twitter users ignored a legal bid to suppress information about their client Trafigura and its decision to hose down some Africans with a big boat full of shit .
The injunction , brought against the Guardian , was withdrawn last night after Trafigura and Carter - Ruck decided it would be more fun to try and intimidate everyone with a computer .
The injunctions will be posted later this week , although the firm have also threatened to sue every postman in Britain if strike action affects their delivery .
DHL will be used to deliver injunctions to the postmen , but if anyone from DHL looks at the addresses then it will be sued and its injunctions will be delivered by UPS who will also be sued and have its injunctions delivered by Federal Express .
Senior partner Denys Finch - Hatton , said : " I have taken advice from myself and will see absolutely everybody in court later this month .
As a precaution , I have also taken out an injunction preventing you from telling anyone that I told you that I would see everybody in court and an injunction preventing you from telling anyone that I told you about the previous injunction .
And so on . "
He added : " As for Trafigura , our clients have stated consistently that they only ever intended to poison the west African coastline with 400 billion gallons of shit in a perfectly legal way . "
Nikki Hollis , a Twitter from Grantham , said : " OMG Im going 2 b taken to the fkn cleaners !
Nu shoes or legal advice – wat 2 do ?!? "
Meanwhile Twitter 's ability to reshape the democratic agenda was further underlined today with ' trending topics ' including chocolate milk and paranormal activity , as well as a campaign demanding Lily Allen makes another album full of nursery - rhyme cock .
BUFFALO , Minn .  Representative Michele Bachmann will appear in the 2010 calendar of “ Great American Conservative Women ” ( she will be November ) .
Her likeness has been transformed into an action figure .
And , so far in 2009 , she has been interviewed on a national cable news show every nine days , on average , an analysis by Smart Politics , a nonpartisan blog affiliated with the University of Minnesota shows .
Not bad for someone less than three years on the job .
Here in Ms. Bachmann ’s district , and in much of the country , that outsized celebrity has boiled down to this :
They adore her or they loathe her .
As the health care overhaul moves closer to a full debate in Congress , Ms. Bachmann is under attack from the Democratic National Committee for spreading “ reckless lies ” about the overhaul , one of a handful of Republicans singled out as part of the committee ’s “ Call ’ Em Out ” campaign .
Back home , two Democrats already say they are seeking Ms. Bachmann ’s seat in next year ’s election , and are raising a lot of money to do so .
“ People are struggling to stay in their homes , and she ’s off trying to be on Fox News , ” said one of those Democrats , Tarryl L. Clark , a state senator .

Congressional Republicans scored just 36 percent approval ratings from the American public in a CNN / Opinion Research poll released Friday .
Fifty - four percent of Americans viewed Republicans in Congress unfavorably , while 41 percent said they were rankled by Democrats .
Democrats had a 53 percent approval rating to Republicans ’ 36 .

But despite Democrats ’ edge over Republicans , their handling of Congress receives few plaudits , according to the poll .
Almost 70 percent of those questioned said they disapproved of how Congress was handling its job , with just 29 percent expressing approval .
The full PDF of the CNN poll can be read here .
“ The Republican party may still be battling the legacy left to them by George W. Bush , ” CNN Polling Director Keating Holland was quoted as saying .
“ They have also spent a lot of time in 2009 working against Democratic proposals .
That has n’t left them a lot of time so far this year to present a positive , post - Bush message .
Of course , there is still plenty of time for them to do so before the 2010 midterms . ”
Republicans have branded themselves “ the party of no , ” for their votes against a Democrat - backed stimulus plan and near - unanimous opposition to President Barack Obama ’s healthcare overhaul goals .
An earlier poll published in June was the subject of a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee memo replete with a graph of recent polls .

A Washington / Post ABC poll in June put Republicans at a 36 percent approval , while three other polls gave the party a favorability rating of under 30 percent .
Republicans scored 29 percent , 28 percent and 25 percent respectively in polls conducted by The New York Times , Pew Research and NBC .
First the transcript , and WOW !
" Madame Speaker , I have words for Democrats and Republicans tonight . "
" Let 's start with the Democrats "
" We as a party have spent the last six months , the greatest minds in our party , dwelling on the question , the unbelievably consuming question of how to get Olympia Snowe to vote on health care reform .
I want to remind us all that Olympia Snowe was not elected President last year .
Olympia Snowe has no veto power in the Senate .
Olympia
Snowe represents a state with one half of one percent of America 's population . "
" What America wants is health care reform .
America does n't care if it gets 51 votes in the Senate or 60 votes in the Senate or 83 votes in the Senate , in fact America does n't even care about that , it does n't care about that at all .
What America cares about is this ; there are over 1 million Americans who go broke every single year trying to pay their health care bills .
America cares a lot about that .
America cares about the fact that there are 44,780 Americans who die every single year on account of not having health care , that 's 122 every day .
America sure cares a lot about that .
America cares about the fact that if you have a pre-existing condition , even if you have health insurance , it 's not covered .
America cares about that a lot .
America cares about the fact that you can get all the health care you need as long as you do n't need any .
America cares about that a lot .
But America does not care about procedures , processes , personalities , America does n't care about that at all . "
" So we have to remember that as Democrats , we have to remember that what 's at stake here is life and death , enormous amounts of money , and people are counting upon us to move ahead .
America understands what 's good for America .
America cares about health care , America cares about jobs , America cares about education , about energy independance , America does not care about processes politicians or personalities or anything like that . "
" And I have a few words for my Republican friends tonight as well .
I guess I do have some Republican friends . "
" Let me say this ; last week I held up this report here and I pointed out that in America there are 44,789 Americans that die every year according to this Harvard report published in this peer reviewed journal because they have no health insurance .
That 's an extra 44,789 Americans who die who 's lives could be saved , and their response was to ask me for an apology . "
" To ask me for an apology ? "
" That 's right .
To ask ME for an apology ! "
" Well , I 'm telling you this ; I will not apologize .
I will not apologize .
I will not apologize for a simple reason ; America does n't care about your feelings .
I violated no rules by pulling this report to America 's attention , I think a lot of people did n't know about it beforehand .
But America DOES care about health care in America . "
" And if you 're against it , then get out of the way .
Just get out of the way .
You can lead , you can follow or you can get out of the way .
And I 'm telling you now to get out of the way . "
" American understands that there is one party in this country that is favor of health care reform and one party that is against it , and they know why . "
" They understand that if Barack Obama were somehow able to cure hunger in the world the Republicans would blame him for overpopulation "
" They understand that if Barack Obama could somehow bring about world peace they would blame him for destroying the defense industry . "
" In fact , they understand that if Barack Obama has a BLT sandwhich tommorrow for lunch , they will try to ban bacon . "
" But that 's not what America wants , America wants solutions to it 's problems and that begins with health care , and that 's what I 'm speaking for tonight . "
" I yield back the balance of my time "
Mr Lewis is retiring at the end of the year
Bank of America 's chief executive Kenneth Lewis , who is due to retire at the end of the year , will receive no salary or bonus for 2009 .
The decision was made by the US Treasury Department 's Kenneth Feinberg , who looks at pay at bailed - out firms .
Mr Lewis will pay back the $ 1 m ( £ 612,000 ) he has already received of his $ 1.5 m annual salary .
His management of the firm has been criticised , especially last year 's decision to buy Merrill Lynch .
The $ 50bn deal depleted Bank of America 's cash reserves , and it subsequently needed $ 45bn in government bail - outs as the financial crisis worsened .
Shareholders had already ousted Mr Lewis , 62 , as chairman in April .
He is unlikely to face financial hardship as his pension is reported to be worth tens of millions of dollars .
Bank of America will be the fourth of the big US banks to report when it announces third - quarter results later on Friday .
Mr Feinberg is looking into the pay of the 75 highest - paid executives at companies bailed out by the government , including AIG , Citigroup , General Motors and Chrysler .
As the Hill writes :
Capitol Police stopped Joshua Bowman , 28 , of Falls Church , Va. , at approximately 8 p.m. on Wednesday night several blocks away from the Capitol as he made a " failed attempt to gain access to [ a Capitol ] barricade , " a spokeswoman said .
After consenting to an administrative search of his vehicle , a shotgun in its case with ammunition was found in the vehicle ’s trunk .
...
While the arrest was made by Capitol Police officers , the department was working in conjunction with U.S. Secret Service on Wednesday night as members of the White House and nearly the full body of Congress attended Obama ’s speech .
Okay , let 's review :
-- We 've had people carry guns to Obama events in the month of August .
-- We 've had people hold signs with Obama as Hitler in the past few weeks .
-- We 've had idioticians Sarah Palin and Newt Gingrich accuse Obama of " death panels . "
-- We 've had Glenn Beck agree that Osama Bin Laden is the only way to save America from Obama .
-- We 've had Glenn Beck call the President a racist .
-- We 've had the right wing in this country get up in arms over a speech to school children on Tuesday ( in which the school children acted like adults , and the adults in the Republican party acted like children . )
-- We 've had a member of the South Carolina legislature , Rep. Joe Wilson , shout out at a joint address to Congress that the President lies .
-- We 've had Lindsey Graham say that Obama is disrespecting the office of the presidency .
-- We now have Sarah Palin , today , saying that Obama was a meanie for saying that the death panel claim was a lie .
-- Now we learn that someone was trying to access Capitol grounds with a shotgun and ammunition at a time when the President of the United States was giving a joint session speech to Congress .
Huh ?
I 'm missing something ?
Who 's disrespectful ?
I could ask my 8 year old that question , and he could give the right answer .
Republicans in the US ?
Not so much .
Mr. President , you can't negotiate with these pricks .
Change is difficult , but it's what you were elected on .

Is a banana a herb ?
Public schoolboys everywhere will tell you that it can be if you dry the skin , roll it in a cigarette paper and set fire to it .
According to MPH Entertainment , the production company that is Mr. Millan ’s partner in all its many offshoots and co-owns the TV show with the producers who discovered him , he will be a $ 100 million business in a few years .
And he says he ’s just getting started .
“ Anything that is realistic , if I create it in my mind , it can become a reality , ” he says , evoking one of his favorite authors , the self - help superstar Wayne W. Dyer .
“ That is the power of intention . ”
Like the dogs that he is world - famous for understanding  and , notably , unlike some of their owners  Mr. Millan does n’t judge others .
Instead , he lives in the now and maintains a sort of über - balanced mien .
For without balance , or what he calls “ our most important tool : calm , assertive energy , ” no one can be a pack leader .
And that , more than anything else , is what Cesar Millan dearly wants each of us to be  for our animals , sure , but also for ourselves and the well - being of the planet .
“ World transformation begins with self - transformation , ” he advises .
To achieve that , he says , you need a co-pilot : “ My suggestion is you have somebody next to you that is willing at any time to transform the moment .
That is called dog . ”
THERE are 65 million dogs in the United States , where pet care is close to a $ 40 billion industry .
By one estimate , dog owners spend an average of $ 11,000 over each pet ’s lifetime .
And even during a recession , such spending shows no signs of flagging .
Simply put , Americans are nuts about their pets .
Or maybe we ’re just nuts .
Which is pretty much the underlying message of “ Dog Whisperer . ”
Did you see the episode about Genoa , the golden retriever who was afraid of the garage ?
Mr. Millan quickly sussed out that the woman of the house had strong feelings about the garage , too  namely , she resented it because her husband spent more time puttering there than he did cuddling with her .
Problem solved .
How about the one about Li’l Miss Kisses , the Maltese whose owner was obsessed with pink ?
The woman ’s apartment , her outfit , everything was pink .
Including the dog .
Can you blame Kisses for urinating on the floor ?
Then there ’s the episode in which Mr. Millan sat down with Kathy Griffin , the comedian , and Pom Pom , her Labrador mix .
By By Andrew Moran Sep 23 , 2009 in World Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has ordered the shift of Iran 's foreign currency reserves from the U.S. dollar to the euro .
The Euro will be the calculating factor of the Oil Stabilisation Fund ( OSF ) , which is a fund that is set up to help the Iranian economy against fluctuating oil prices .
It is also set up to help both the public and private sectors with their currency needs by extending loans .
Iran 's Central Bank deputy chief Reza Raei stated in December , according to Since the inception of the Euro in 1999 , it has gain popularity by many nations and businesses across the globe .
Currently , there are more Euros than dollars in circulation .
After it was introduced in 1999 , Iraq , at the time having the second - largest oil reserves , traded its oil in Euros .
Venezuela has also pressured OPEC to abandon the US dollar , according to Arabian Business reports that the Iranian government and its President ordered the removal of the US dollar to be replaced by the Euro , which was introduced in 1999 , in order to protect themselves from the crumbling United States economy and devaluing dollar .
The Euro will be the calculating factor of the Oil Stabilisation Fund ( OSF ) , which is a fund that is set up to help the Iranian economy against fluctuating oil prices .
It is also set up to help both the public and private sectors with their currency needs by extending loans .
Iran 's Central Bank deputy chief Reza Raei stated in December , according to Iran Daily , that the nation ’s foreign exchange reserves were over $ 80 billion .
Since the inception of the Euro in 1999 , it has gain popularity by many nations and businesses across the globe .

It ’s midnight in Texas , the air smells of dang ( hot road kill mixed with beer and truck exhaust ) , and as I hurry to my car I ca n’t help but skip .
I always get this excited when I ’m about to pick up a great sack of schwag , especially because this time it ’s actually green and a little fluffy .
A fifty - dollar investment will last for a few days and I ’ll certainly get about ten fat blunts out of it .
You see , in Texas blunts are quite popular , as they allow for increased sharing possibilities in a social situation , and getting both your tobacco and THC fix simultaneously .
I read my directions from a used napkin and drive through half of a Queen album before arriving at my dead end , where a person I know nothing about leans into my car and tosses in the bud .
I do n’t hand him the money , as I ’ve been instructed to “ gangsterly ” toss it on the hood , so that nothing is exchanged through hands .
This is all new to me and a little shady , but I was hooked up from a friend I trusted , and I really do n’t have any other options .
Typically , my experiences with schwag dealers tend to vary , but most are short and sweet , with little time for inquiries on the current status of politics or the economy .
In Texas , it ’s important not to get attached to a particular dealer or supply , because more often than not , they will disappear one day , never to be heard from again .
It ’s time to cruise home with my illegal greenery , hoping to make it .
A long drive for schwag is required because there ’s a drought right now , and unfortunately the county I travel through has the second - harshest penalties for marijuana possession in the state of Texas , and is well known for prosecuting to the full extent .
The large amount I picked up creates a greater risk , but there ’s a certain thrill in it all , a juvenile excitement in the process of tracking down buds .
In some instances it ’s almost sexual , a kind of turn - on you only feel from the possibility of getting caught .
Maybe that ’s why I take the chance with such a cheap , harsh sack of schwag .
To understand the affection for such low - grade cannabis , one must get into the full element of the Southern pot experience , including the lingo .
The first question all potential purveyors ask is “ ’ dro or reggie ? ” “ ’ Dro ” could mean just about anything , and from that point must be specified as either hydro , kind bud , chronic , or a specific strain .
This is expensive , imported or home grown , and for struggling stoners like myself is reserved for birthdays , holidays , and tax seasons .
“ Reggie ” is what I ’m looking for ; as opposed to paying $ 75 for 3.5 grams of good stuff , I ’ll settle for the less flavorful weed with God - knows - what inside of it .
I do n’t know why , but even when I have money , sometimes I crave schwag .
It ’s strange , but there ’s a feeling of bargain - hunting pride from grabbing that 28 grams for $ 50 .
Five miles from home , my nerves start to really kick in .
I ’m so close to ripping the bong , and everywhere I look there are police .
Police here are like Starbucks – they ’re on every corner , and sometimes even parked next to each other for no apparent reason .
I get this nervous feeling because I ’ve been arrested for schwag before , and I still did n’t learn my lesson .
The charge was for “ Possession of Marijuana ” , and what I possessed at the time was a roach , about the size of my pinky fingernail .
My punishment would span across two years , and includes supervised probation with random urinalysis testing , home visits / searches , 50 - dollar monthly probate fee , $ 3,500 in fines , two Texas drug and alcohol classes ( an additional $ 300 ) , 90 mandatory Narcotics Anonymous meetings within 90 days , and 250 hours of community service .
I was not allowed to leave the county , let alone Texas , without permission from my probate officer .
These traveling privileges were few and far between , and typically are only awarded to first - time offenders who test clean on urinalysis appointments .
In exchange for completing all of the terms of my probation above , I would receive deferred adjudication , or a “ clean slate ” as they say .
I say , what good is a clean slate when all you want to do is drench it in a smoky haze ?
The painful truth of the South is that we have the harshest marijuana possession penalties in the United States , but we also produce / distribute some of the worst weed in the nation , with disturbingly low amounts of THC .
In essence , tons of smokers are busted everyday for herb that might not even be herb at all .
On a potency - level scale out of 10 , schwag ranges from a 1 - 5 .
For those non-recreational smokers with debilitating illnesses , living in the south creates a problem when trying to find your medical - grade cannabis , as it typically must be smuggled in from California or Seattle .
Because of the risk , the prices skyrocket , 1/8 ’s seem smaller , and quality goes down from improper storage and handling .
Because there are no dispensaries ( yet ) , attaining cannabis of this nature can be strenuous , reminiscent of a rat race , and end in disappointment over the quality of the product .
Eventually , many revert to the schwag out of sheer convenience , and even I wondered what it was about schwag that made it worth my while to sit in a jail cell thinking about it .
Was there any possible way I could put in a plea of “ not guilty ” of possession of marijuana based on the fact that what I was smoking was n’t really that good ?
“ What ” , “ where ” and “ how ” were the easy questions to find answers for , but the “ why ” is what interested me most .
Why on earth do I choose to contribute to the perpetuation of schwag when I have tasted great buds from the heavens with my own lips ?
What about my toker friends who purposefully ONLY smoke schwag – why do they do it ?
Some say it ’s because of cost , while others can find really good schwag with no problem and see little difference between it and kind bud .
Some refuse to touch schwag with a ten - foot pole .
Schwag goes by many other names , including but not limited to : shwiggity , shwah , reggie , regs , Tex - Mex , junk - skunk , dirt - weed , dirties , skank , and killz , just to name a few .
It ’s typically brown ( just like dirt ) when it ’s bad schwag , and a dark forest - green when it ’s dough dough or shwah .
Schwag has few crystals ( if any ) , and most is chocked full of seeds with half of the weight being in stems and seeds alone .
Male and female plants are mixed together in the planting of schwag , and when harvest time comes , there is little regard for typical growing methods of finer plants .
In fact , they are grown in such a half - assed manner , smokers will sometimes find various other plants such as sunflowers , bluebonnets , or wild Indian paintbrush chillin ’ in the bag , partying with their weed !
It ’s difficult to place names and strains on schwag , because most of the time it ’s so compressed from cargo travel methods , identification seems impossible .
In fact , travel plays quite a comprehensive role in determining what exactly you are getting when you purchase schwag .
Schwag is shipped across the Mexico - Texas and California border , compressed tightly and hidden in various parts of motor vehicles .
Some bricks weigh in upwards of 150 pounds and are shaped like the giant tires they are sometimes shipped in .
Instead of picking out a gentle bud to puff on , one sometimes needs to utilize the likes of electric turkey carvers to slice the bud into thin disks before smoking or distributing .
JP , a self - proclaimed schwag connoisseur and purveyor , told me , “ I ’ve seen schwag that ’s been shipped in sheet metal , compressed between two gas tanks , all the way from the border . ”
JP has been a schwag - specific smoker for about 12 years now , only smoking quality buds on his birthday and holidays .
Like myself and many other Texas smokers , he has also been to jail and served time for his herb - loving ways .
JP is fond of schwag for several reasons .
“ I ’m Mexican , and I smoke Tex - Mex weed because I like to have a lot around to share with friends .
It ’s cultural .
I ca n’t pull out expensive bud and share it with everyone , but I can afford blunts and blunts of this stuff , ” he said as he rolled one up .
As For the quality of the schwag , JP said , “ You find all sorts of shit in your weed , like dead roaches , sticks , spider webs – and one time I even found a bird feather .
But I do n’t care .
I ’ll still smoke schwag , and always will . ”
In addition to JP ’s own found objects , I ’ve heard some other wild claims of almost everything imaginable in bags of schwag : rat -tails , cockroaches , sticks , dirt , rocks , cough medicine ( pawned off as a strain of kind bud ) , lead ( for weight ) , gasoline , hair , beer tabs , feathers , knitting yarn , fingernails , pesos , oregano , nuts and bolts , and even a birdfoot !
Random objects found in pot are presumably for the purposes of weighing it down to spread further .
JP noted that the profit lies in northern cities ; because schwag still gets you high , it can be sold for inflated prices the further north you travel , and sometimes even carries a 100 % markup value .
Schwag in a border town will run $ 40 by the ounce , while it can easily be sold at up to $ 15 a gram in Colorado or Oklahoma .
Incredible profits and markups keep the schwag industry in the south running at full force , with no end in sight .
Going from a smooth , chronic high to a thick , rough schwag high has been known to cause shock and stress disorders in visitors from the north who were unaware that cannabis also came in the flavor nasty !
Having just returned from Vancouver , British Columbia , where I smoked the best buds of my life , I could n’t help but close my eyes and try to feel the difference in the hits .
The schwag is harsh and thick , similar to smoking a Marlboro Red , with the smoke settling in the back of the throat .
Reggie smokers agree that the harshness grows on you , and after smoking southern “ regs ” , you can smoke just about anything .
There are also some people who refuse to smoke schwag .
Stanley Glass , a glass purveyor and cannabis connoisseur , explained : “ To me , smoking that first bud of ’ dro was like the most amazing sex , and all those years I spent smoking schwag I may as well have been jerking myself off ! ”
As he loaded bowl after bowl of delicious buds with hints of mango , he became increasingly enthusiastic to describe how it felt to jump into the world of hydroponics , chronics , and clones after years wandering through the schwag deserts .
Glass sold schwag in high school , and says that when he graduated , he graduated from schwag as well .
“ I just found that ’ dro was a more functional high with good flavors and very clean , ” he says .
He also points out that he and his friends were purchasing hydroponic buds at $ 240 per half - ounce , so he dedicated his lifestyle to bringing down that price and bringing up the quality .
His theory is that if you ’re going to risk everything , you may as well smoke good chronic .
“ Dank is n’t all about the money , it ’s about variety of life and the wonderful flavors that come from it , ” he says .
“ Schwag is just a negative cycle ; a lot of violence comes with it , because it ‘s all about quantity , not quality .
It ‘s all about making money , not the bud itself … you never know what ’s in it , or what you ’re getting .
Chronic and ‘ dro are just cleaner highs , more functional ” .
However , it is generally agreed that most of the truly great buds are imported from throughout the northern US and California , but in order to get to it one must break through the barrier of low - grade competitors flooding the Gulf Coast with high volumes of cheap schwag .
Because of the high volumes passing through , there has been an influx of sellers that do n’t smoke their product and only focus on the distribution .
With all these ignorant dealers , about the best salesman for schwag I can find is the shady guy at the dead - end street I just paid a visit to .
It ’s understandable that chronic home - grown is hard to find , as growing good bud is not always easy with electrical companies that will not hesitate to report high - electricity readings to the local police .
This creates problems for indoor grow operations because it is still highly illegal to grow even one plant , so people just do n‘t want to risk it .
Growers in Texas beware : spending life in prison for a couple of plants is not unheard of , and judges tend to favor incarceration over rehabilitation because of the profit - driven structure of our prison system .
Also , by releasing marijuana offenders from prisons , the state would have to admit a failure in their staunch reputation for being tough on marijuana crimes .
Southerners are lagging drastically behind in the fight for marijuana reform .
Not just a reform for legalization , but a reform of quality , and a change in mood among the community .
Schwag is in abundance , and is quickly becoming the generic ‘ fast food ’ of pot .
Nice buds should n’t be an expensive rarity ; they should be bountiful , easily attainable , and identifiable .
Before we can heighten quality , we must first educate ourselves and fight for the right to grow properly .

Daily Howler :
In an important front - page report , the Times at long last has changed sides
T HE NEW YORK TIMES CHANGES SIDES !
In an important front - page report , the Times at long last has changed sides : // link // print // previous // next //
FRIDAY , AUGUST 14 , 2009 The New York Times changes sides :
It s a big day in your country today .
Formally , in this front - page report , the New York Times ( at long last ) has changed sides .
Krugmans column is important too .
But about that news report :
Right there on the Times front page , Jim Rutenberg and Jackie Calmes debunk the death panel bull - roar .
In paragraph one , they say the claims about the death panels are false . 
And they are soon saying this :
 There is nothing in any of the legislative proposals that would call for the creation of death panels or any other governmental body that would cut off care for the critically ill as a cost - cutting measure . 
And theres more !
Right on page one , in just their fourth graf , they start naming names of the people who have spread these false claims around .
Betsy McCaughey finally gets her name named fifteen years after Andrew Sullivan let her invent all those false claims about Clintons health plan .
Today , the New York Times is calling such false claims  false . 
The paper is naming the names of many people who have been spreading these false claims around .
In so doing , the Times has at long last changed sides .
Why we say that :
In the 1990s , the New York Times was a principal source of the false claims which were lodged against Clinton , then Gore .
The Times invented , and enabled , that long string of claims .
Today , the Times has switched sides .
There are many things worth noting in todays news report .
Let s start with David Brocks statement .
Quite correctly , David notes what we have just noted at long last , history has started to change .
That said and cheering David on well quibble with one part of his statement , as it has been excerpted : RUTENBERG ( 8/14/09 ) : But as Congress developed its legislation this summer , critics seized on provisions requiring Medicare financing for end of life consultations , bringing the debate to a peak .
To David Brock , a former conservative journalist who once impugned the Clintons but now runs a group that monitors and defends against attacks on liberals , the uproar is a reminder of what has changed the creation of groups like his and what has not .
 In the 90s , every misrepresentation under the sun was made about the Clinton plan and there was no real capacity to push back ,  he said .
 Now , there is that capacity . 
David is the founder of Media Matters , a group which is very active in pushing back .
And David is right about the 1990s .
 Every misrepresentation under the sun was made about the Clinton health planand about Clinton himself , and then about Gore .
( It was in this way that George W. Bush finally ended up in the White House . )
But Davids statement , as excerpted , is wrong or misleading in one key respect .
Many people had the capacity to push back against the blizzard of lies which drove our politics in that decade ; they just kept choosing not to .
Gene Robinson ?
Frank Rich ?
E. J. Dionne ?
Lawrence ODonnell ?
Chris Matthews ?
Bob Herbert ?
Margaret Carlson , who we saw simpering on Countdown last night ?
Charles Lane , editor of The New Republic in 1998 and 1999 ?
They all had the capacity to push back .
So did Arianna Huffington .
So did Keith Olbermann , who instead ran off sobbing to work for Fox Sports .
( Good times ! )
Boo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo !
Dealing with the War Against Clinton would make me ashamed , make me depressed , make me cry ,  Olbermann said in 1998 .
So he put his tail between his legs , abandoned news , and went off to make easy money .
The lies continued , thanks to the people weve named above .
And many , many more .
Others did find a way to push back .
As early as October 1994 , Gene Lyons first article about the Whitewater coverage appeared in Harpers .
In The National Journal , Paul Starobin noted  the Washington press corps 's collective yawn about Lyons reportabout a report which accuses The New York Times of getting the Whitewater story fundamentally wrong .
But then , Lyons 1996 book , Fools for Scandal , was massively deep - sixed too .
And lets return to David Brocks statement :
When every misrepresentation under the sun was made about the Clinton [ health ] plan ,  the press corps yawned about that too !
Plenty of people could have pushed back against that , and against the murder claims , and against the subsequent lies about Gore .
Plenty of people could have pushed back .
They simply didnt want to .
( Some of them were every busy inventing that eras list of lies .
Al Gore said he inspired Love Story ?
It began at the New York Times !
Frank Rich , Maureen Dowd , Melinda Henneberger and their editors . )
Today , on page one , the New York Times is reporting that false claims are false .
The paper is naming the people who spread them .
But in the 1990s , such names would have come from the Times itself .
And from the Washington Post .
In his important column today , Paul Krugman tells a similar story .
It s very important to understand the part of the story which follows .
If you dont understand what Krugman writes here , you will be one of the enablers who wander about , telling the world that the current wild rumors  are all about our favorite toy , racism : KRUGMAN ( 8/14/09 ) : Sure enough , President Obama is now facing the same kind of opposition that President Bill Clinton had to deal with : an enraged right that denies the legitimacy of his presidency , that eagerly seizes on every wild rumor manufactured by the right - wing media complex .
Say what ?
Obama is facing the same kind of opposition Clinton faced ?
A bit later , Krugman expands on this observation : KRUGMAN : So much , then , for Mr. Obamas dream of moving beyond divisive politics .
The truth is that the factors that made politics so ugly in the Clinton years the paranoia of a significant minority of Americans and the cynical willingness of leading Republicans to cater to that paranoiaare as strong as ever .
In fact , the situation may be even worse than it was in the 1990s because the collapse of the Bush administration has left the G.O.P. with no real leaders other than Rush Limbaugh .
Professor Hofstadter to the side , we wouldnt have used the word paranoia ourselves .
In our view , sensible liberals will savage the leaders who mislead average people , not those average people themselves .
( Watch the way Krugmans use of that word becomes an instant classic . 
Politically and on the merits , its hard to defend such statements . )
But once again , its important to understand the continuity here : KRUGMAN ( continuing directly ) :
The question now is how Mr. Obama will deal with the death of his postpartisan dream .
So far , at least , the Obama administrations response to the outpouring of hate on the right has had a deer - in - the - headlights quality .
It s as if officials still cant wrap their minds around the fact that things like this can happen to people who arent named Clinton , as if they keep expecting the nonsense to just go away .
As weve long told you :
In the 1990s , the rules became clear .
You could say any damn fool thing you pleased , as long as you said it about the Clintons , then Gore .
Again , we re going to name some of the people who refused to push back who allowed this disaster to spread .
Well cull names from a very long list , for several different reasons : Frank Rich .
Arianna Huffington .
Lawrence ODonnell .
Chris Matthews .
Keith Olbermann .
Gene Robinson .
Charles Lane . Margaret Carlson .
Bob Herbert .
E. J. Dionne .
Josh Marshall .
Michael Kinsley .
Dana Milbank .
Andrew Sullivan .
Gail Collins , who got so upset when Candidate Gore dared to inquire about a young mothers sick child .
And of course , the ludicrous Dowd and hundreds more .
All those people could have pushed back , as David Brock did .
They just kept choosing not to .
For more than a decade , it was Village Consensus .
Today , the Times has changed sides .
Charles Lane ended up at the Washington Post because he refused to push back .
He crawled his way up your grandmothers back on his way to suitable employment .
Last Saturday , he published this ridiculous column , in the Post , in which he found various ways to pretend that there really is a problem with Section 1233 of that House bill .
The death panel claims were rubbish ,  he said but he didnt much seem to care about that .
Despite the fact that the claims were rubbish , he found a supremely nuanced way , even now , to serve Insider Corporate Washingtons cause .
It s a big day in your country today .
But the wheels of change grind slow .
This morning , Rutenberg and Calmes write , on page one , that the death panel claims are false . 
They name the names of those who have pimped them .
On the op - ed page , Krugman calls these claims a complete fabrication .
He quotes Republican senator Johnny Isakson saying these claims are nuts .
No such push - back occurred in the 1990s sorry , none at all .
At these levels , liberal stars refused to push back .
Some of them were actively inventing the claims .
And even today , we still have the Washington Post : The Post has now published three separate columns lending support to the death panels claim .
( Four , if you count this milquetoast piece by Gene Robinson .
Palin quickly put it to use , for fairly obvious reasons . )
We think Danielle Allens column was especially significant ( see below ) , due to her extremely high status in the academy .
But the errand boy Lane and Kathleen Parker also strained to suggest that the death panels  claim really did have some merit .
( Even though the claims were rubbish !  )
At the Post , the old regime dies hard , if its dying at all .
At the Times , it was overthrown on this mornings front page .
Some things never change , however .
Let s consider two :
In the Times , Tom Daschle brings the eternal note of cluelessness in .
This is the way corporate - friendly fellows like Daschle have justified their refusal to fight for two decades now : RUTENBERG :
The notion [ that health reform would involve euthanasia ] was picked up by various conservative groups , but still , as Mr. Obama and Congress remained focused on other matters , it did not gain wide attention .
Former Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota , an advocate for the health care proposals , said he was occasionally confronted with the ' ' forced euthanasia ' ' accusation at forums on the plans , but came to see it as an advantage .
'' Almost automatically you have most of the audience on your side , '' Mr. Daschle said .
'' Any rational normal person is n't going to believe that assertion . ''
Earth to Daschle : Check the current polls .
Is it dimly possible that someone like Daschle can still be this clueless about the way the publics outlook gets poisoned ?
Can Daschle be this daft ?
Something else hasnt changed this morning ; its AWOL in Krugmans otherwise sterling column .
Lets go back to his presentation of what happened to Clinton and then to the unnamed Gore : KRUGMAN ( 8/14/09 ) : Sure enough , President Obama is now facing the same kind of opposition that President Bill Clinton had to deal with : an enraged right that denies the legitimacy of his presidency , that eagerly seizes on every wild rumor manufactured by the right - wing media complex . [...]
So much , then , for Mr. Obamas dream of moving beyond divisive politics .
The truth is that the factors that made politics so ugly in the Clinton years the paranoia of a significant minority of Americans and the cynical willingness of leading Republicans to cater to that paranoiaare as strong as ever .
In fact , the situation may be even worse than it was in the 1990s because the collapse of the Bush administration has left the G.O.P. with no real leaders other than Rush Limbaugh .
That s part of what happened to Clinton , then Gore .
But Krugman has deep - sixed the rest of what happened .
It s baldly false to keep pretending that Clinton ( and the unnamed Gore ) were done in by the right - wing media complex alone .
Even on this glorious morning , Krugman doesnt tell you the truth .
Here it is :
In the Clinton / Gore era , that so - called right - wing media complex included the whole of the mainstream press corps !
This was the title of Lyons book when it appeared in 1996 : Fools for Scandal :
How the media invented Whitewater
On which media entities did his book focus ?
The Washington Post and the New York Times !
Sorry , but it simply wasnt  the right - wing media complex  which drove the wars against Clinton and Gore .
In very large part , it was Krugmans own newspaper through no fault of Krugmans , of course .
It s easy to tell the truth about this .
The right - wing media complex was part of the war against Clinton and Gorebut so was the mainstream press !
The two groups had virtually converged by that time .
It s easy to state that fact in a column .
Krugman fails to do soagain .
Final note about Charles Lane : Lane was editor of The New Republic from 1997 through 1999 .
A few years earlier , the bungling journal not the right - wing machine  had published Betsy McCaugheys bullshit - laden takedown of the Clinton health plan .
( Her piece was published by editor Andrew Sullivan .
Today , hes a liberal pet . )
In 1998 , Lane fell all over himself kissing the keister of Kathleen Willey , who had come forward with thrilling sex claims about vile President Clinton .
In the end , Willey was denounced as a liar by Kenneth Starrs successor , Robert Ray ; Ray even said that he had considered prosecuting her for perjury .
But in 1998 , the errand boys all knew what to do .
Lane had never set eyes on Willey .
He had no way to judge her character .
But so what ?
With a thrill running up his leg , he joined to rush to proclaim this Faire Ladye the most truthful person in the world .
Chris Matthews almost got Cody Shearer killed , so irresponsible was his own conduct with his Fairest Darling , who accused Shearer of something he plainly didnt do .
( A man with a gun was arrested at Shearer 's home .
Luckily , Shearer was n't home . )
In 1999 , it got worse .
Under the leadership of Ceci Connolly , the Washington Post began its perfectly blatant War against Candidate Gore .
And over at The New Republic , Chuck Lane kept his big trap shut .
The New Republic saw no evil .
At the end of that year , Lane accepted a new improved job at the Washington Post !
Today , Lane continues to serve the view of Upper - Class Corporate Insider Washington , as he did in last Saturdays tortured op - ed piece .
These people have done a great deal of harm .
But theyve made their mommies proud in the process .
Theyve risen to wonderful jobs ; to get there , they kissed the appropriate keisters .
And to this day , their colleagues wont tell you what these people have done .
They tell you the right - wing media did it .
That just is nt what happened .
How ridiculous is the process by which this cult changes sides without admitting to what they have done ?
Last night , Olbermann gave you Margaret Carlson .
And good God !
Carlson complained about the way people overdo it  when they criticize Hillary Clinton !
Well not just any people .
Amazingly , this is what this perfect troll said about the Clinton - trashing : CARLSON ( 8/13/09 ) : But , you know , what the right wing does is it goes too far itself .
You can say something about it .
But you can count on them to overdo it .
Truly , these people see you as toys .
For many years , no one mocked the Clintons and Gore quite the way Carlson did .
But so what ?
As we call the other side dumb , our leaders  keep feeding us this .
They will never admit to what they did .
( What they did was put Bush in power . )
This morning , the Times has formally changed sides .
Carlson of course was re-purposed last year , for new use under King KO .
ITS NOW THREE OCLOCK ON THE MOON : The American public discourse has been crazy for decades .
This predates Senator Grassley s disgraceful claim , delivered this week , about fear of those death panels . 
On Tuesday , things got a little bit crazier .
On Tuesday morning , the Washington Post published this remarkable op - ed column by Danielle Allen , a highly - regarded , much - praised star of the American academy .
Well repeat what we said at the time .
The most remarkable part of this startling column is its author identity line :  WASHINGTON POST ( 8/11/09 ) : The writer is the UPS Foundation Professor of social science at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton , N.J. Good God.
Danielle Allen , 38 , hangs at Einsteins former crib !
A few years back , she was awarded a MacArthur Foundation genius grant .
And oh yes one other thing :
Allen seems to be a pretender .
The professor is incoherent .
Your discourse has been crazed for some time .
George Bush rose the craziness into the White House .
Grassley added to it this week ; increasingly , this sort of lunacy defines our national culture .
But when an honored star of the academy can write an column like this , your nations intellectual culture is badly , deeply broken .
Three cheers then for Jonathan Chait , who tore his hair on Wednesday morning , attempting to discern Allens meaning .
Chait marveled at Allens incoherence .
Well add to what Chait said .
Can we talk ?
As we read Professor Allens column , we thought of another well - known professor .
We thought of her intellectual forebear , the professor named Irwin Corey ( click here ) .
Allens proseand your American culture are truly in that deep a fix .
A nation whose intellectual superstars reason this was is a nation that s in bad trouble .
One last point , before we scan Allens column a column which seems to defend Sarah Palins death panel remark :
For years , we have asked why the professors dont help us with our floundering discourse .
When our journalists fail to serve , who dont the professors step forward to help ?
Where are all the professors of logic , with their vast clarification skills ?
Why dont the professors step in to straighten our broken logic ?
Why dont the professors step in ?
Just read what occurs when they do :
Onward to the piece - in - itself :
In a truly remarkable column , Professor Allen attempts to discuss two recent flaps about health care reform .
In one instance , she attempts to address an important question :
Why have people like Sarah Palin referred to supposed  death panels ? 
Fairly plainly , Allen takes Palins side in the flap which has resulted .
Incredibly , the Post has now published three or four columns which find some sort of justification for the sorts of things Palin has said .
Did we mention that one other point ?
Allens column is incoherent !
Given her status in the academy , its this fact which makes her column so startling .
What do you say we move ahead to the thing - in - itself ?
Concerning Allens column : Allen starts by noting that Obama has changed his mind about a policy matter since the 2008 campaign .
During the campaign , Obama opposed an individual mandate requiring everyone to buy health insurance ,  Allen notes .
Now , he basically favors an individual mandate , she says .
There s nothing astonishing there .
Most people grasp a basic point for good or for ill , politicians sometimes change their positions .
But having described this change by Obama , Allen explains what it means : ALLEN ( 8/11/09 ) :
This change in Obama 's position goes a long way toward explaining the objections to the new reforms that are being raised vociferously through grass - roots action by citizens on the right .
The issue here is not that these citizens consider Obama untrustworthy though they do .
The issue , rather , is that they recognize that the stated goals and structure of a policy may not fully capture its full range of outcomes in practice .
This is why these citizens , including professionally briefed participants such as Sarah Palin , can continue to maintain , in the face of a barrage of insistences to the contrary , that the reforms will ( 1 ) result in rationing and ( 2 ) establish  death panels . 
Let s try to simplify here .
A policy may start out one way but end up as something different .
According to the professor , when Palin posted her claim about Obamas panels , she meant that his policy will end up establish[ing ] death panels ,  though that is nt his current idea .
People like Palin recognize that the stated goals and structure of a policy may not fully capture its full range of outcomes in practice . 
In Allens own language , thats why Palin can continue to maintain that the reforms will establish death panels .
Allen makes no attempt to explain how she can possibly know this .
How does she know that Palin meant that ?
How doe she know that Palins issue is that she  recognize [s ] that the stated goals and structure of a policy may not fully capture its full range of outcomes in practice ?
How does Allen know that Palin was thinking anything like that at all ?
We have no idea .
The professor has forgotten to say !
We re already off to a very bad start but Allen soon turns incoherent .
As she slides into that incoherence , we begin to see why the academy seldom attempts to clarify our struggling public discourse .
Can what follows really be the work of one of our very brightest professors ?
The pomposity here may strike you first .
( We apologize to Williams James for letting him get dragged into this . )
But Allens spectacular incoherence shows up in each of these paragraphs : ALLEN ( continuing directly ) :
These activists do not claim that the proposed reforms include policies whose explicit purpose is to ration , nor do the more careful among them claim that the policies will establish panels to help people decide when to die .
They are not arguing about the semantic content of the policies ; that is , they are not arguing about the meaning of the words that are actually in the relevant drafts of bills .
Instead , they are considering , as the pragmatist philosopher William James put it ,  what conceivable effects of a practical kind the [ policy ] may involve what sensations we are to expect from it , and what reactions we must prepare . 
Their claim is that , whatever the stated goals of policymakers , the concrete outcomes that will flow from the policies on the table will include experiences that feel like rationing and conversations that sound like death panels . 
Those paragraphs are truly stunning , as Chait noted on the day Allens column appeared .
Lets try to paraphrase Allenalthough it is nt entirely clear that shes still speaking English .
To simplify things a bit , lets ignore Allens ruminations about the rationing  claims ; let s limit ourselves to what she says about the death panel comments .
Let s assume shes still speaking about Palin , for whose status ( Palin is  professionally briefed  ) she has already vouched .
According to Allen , when Palin posted on Facebook about those death panels ,  she wasnt claiming that Obamas policies will establish panels to help people decide when to die . 
Of course not !
Using James  language , Allen says that Palin was simply considering ... what conceivable effects of a practical kind the [ policy ] may involve what sensations we are to expect from it , and what reactions we must prepare . 
For ourselves , we have little idea what those words might mean and things get worse as we proceed .
According to Allen , Palins real claim is that ... the concrete outcomes that will flow from the policies on the table will include conversations that sound like death panels .
Like you , we have no real idea what that string of words might mean .
The concrete outcomes will include conversations that sound like  death panels ?
Each word is an English - language word , known to children in all fifty states .
But strung together , this barrel of words has no apparent meaning .
Judged by any normal standard , Allen is barely coherent here .
It s sad that the Washington Post chose to publish such prime bafflegab .
It s more troubling to think that such monstrous gab could emerge from the top of the academy .
But then , Allens column is a monument to broken intellectual culture .
Chait surrendered to the darkness at this point ; he simply ignored the rest of her column .
But Allen continued pretending to speak seeming to vouch for those , like Palin , who have made the claims in question .
These critics have a point ,  Allen now says : ALLEN ( continuing directly ) :
In asking lawmakers to consider not merely the goals of their policies but also the experiential meaning of concrete realities that those policies may bring , they have a point .
One can't answer them by saying :  These policies wo n't ration ; there will be no death panels . 
If these reforms do either of these things , they will do so as a matter of unintended consequences .
The appropriate answer , therefore , is to explain the institutional checks that will prevent the emergence of such unintended consequences .
According to our brightest professor , the Republican stooges at issue here are asking lawmakers to consider ... the experiential meaning of concrete realities that [ their ] policies may bring .
Unfortunately , that string of words has no obvious meaning in English either .
Later , were told it will be an unintended consequence  if death panels do result from this policy .
For that reason , policy makers should explain the institutional checks that will prevent the emergence of such unintended consequences .
Professor Allen has made a great point ; policy - makers should have institutional checks to prevent the emergence of any death panels .
Somewhat similarly , Professor Allens appointment to the Institute for Advanced Study may result in her robbing a string of banks in the Princeton area !
For that reason , her employer should surely create institutional checks that will prevent such misconduct .
Meanwhile , does the Washington Post have institutional checks against the possibility that Allen will start presenting herself as the newspapers owner ?
It would be strange if they dont !
Good God .
Whatever Obamas stated goals might be ,  the concrete outcomes that will flow from his policies will include conversations that sound like  death panels ? 
We can imagine what Allen might mean by that .
But elsewhere , when people say things like that , men in coats help them away .
Almost surely , that isnt anything Palin was claiming and no , that statement doesnt make much sense .
But then , bafflegab rules substantial parts of the world we still call the academy .
In his later work , Wittgenstein seemed to say that large chunks of traditional philosophy are composed of incoherent statements .
( Statements like  It s now three oclock on the moon ,  as opposed to  It s now three oclock in Los Angeles .  )
Alas !
The surface grammar of the incoherent statements so resembled that of their coherent cousins that philosophers couldnt see that their lofty - sounding remarks made no sense !
With the help of the Post op - ed page , Professor Allen has bravely stepped forward to show how the problem has spread .
For the record , Allen wasnt through with those death panels yet .
Having made a joke of your lives , the big muddy just kept on : ALLEN : And perhaps the counseling sessions meant to help us all think about end - of - life issues should be conducted when each of us is in the prime of life .
To demystify such counseling sessions , the president held up as examples himself and his wife , who have living wills .
But they have set these up when the natural end of their life seems remote .
In the context of such counseling sessions , this distance surely provides a certain psychological protection .
Perhaps if we developed a practice of expecting these counseling sessions to occur in our 40s and 50s , we would view them , like financial counseling , simply as a necessary step toward being able to enter retirement with peace of mind .
There is a real debate going on in what appear to be crazy town hall meetings .
If only both sides had ears to hear .
Would somebody please call the otologist ?
[ end of column ]
Allen offers some fatuous thoughts in this passage .
But at least we can pretty much tell what she pretty much means .
Our discourse has been crazy for decades .
The professors have rarely stepped forward to help .
Professor Allen , heir to Corey , seems eager to let you know why .
A nation is in a world of hurt when columns like this emerge from the very top of the academy .
Readers , its now three oclock on the moon !
Do you know where your floundering nations intellectual culture is ?
What hath genius wrought :
Well suggest you take one final look at what the professor has wrought : Lawmakers should consider the experiential meaning of concrete realities that their policies may bring .
Palin is considering what conceivable effects of a practical kind the policy may involve what sensations we are to expect from it .
The concrete outcomes that will flow from Obamas policies will include conversations that sound like death panels .
Have those statements been rendered in English ?
Chait tore his hair , but he couldnt quite tell .
Presumably , Fred Hiatt was resume - cowed by Allen was afraid to acknowledge his own confusion .
Journalists sometimes type murky prose .
But modern journalists never present bafflegab quite like that .
Readers , its now three oclock on the moon half past the cat up in Jersey .
Last week , I asked South Carolina Congressman James Clyburn , the third - ranking Democrat in the House of Representatives , where in the Constitution it authorizes the federal government to regulate the delivery of health care .
He replied : " There 's nothing in the Constitution that says that the federal government has anything to do with most of the stuff we do . "
Then he shot back : " How about [ you ] show me where in the Constitution it prohibits the federal government from doing this ? "
Rep .
Clyburn , like many of his colleagues , seems to have conveniently forgotten that the federal government has only specific enumerated powers .
He also seems to have overlooked the Ninth and 10th Amendments , which limit Congress 's powers only to those granted in the Constitution .
One of those powers — the power " to regulate " interstate commerce — is the favorite hook on which Congress hangs its hat in order to justify the regulation of anything it wants to control .
Unfortunately , a notoriously tendentious New Deal - era Supreme Court decision has given Congress a green light to use the Commerce Clause to regulate noncommercial , and even purely local , private behavior .
In Wickard v. Filburn ( 1942 ) , the Supreme Court held that a farmer who grew wheat just for the consumption of his own family violated federal agricultural guidelines enacted pursuant to the Commerce Clause .
Though the wheat did not move across state lines — indeed , it never left his farm — the Court held that if other similarly situated farmers were permitted to do the same it , might have an aggregate effect on interstate commerce .
James Madison , who argued that to regulate meant to keep regular , would have shuddered at such circular reasoning .
Madison 's understanding was the commonly held one in 1789 , since the principle reason for the Constitutional Convention was to establish a central government that would prevent ruinous state - imposed tariffs that favored in - state businesses .
It would do so by assuring that commerce between the states was kept " regular . "
Aside from the difficulty of persuading residents and businesses to divide their trash , many towns and municipalities have been unwilling to make the significant capital investments in machines like composters that can process food and yard waste .
Yet attitudes are shifting , and cities like San Francisco and Seattle are at the forefront of the changeover .
Both of those cities have adopted plans for a shift to zero - waste practices and are collecting organic waste curbside in residential areas for composting .
Food waste , which the E.P.A. says accounts for about 13 percent of total trash nationally  and much more when recyclables are factored out of the total  is viewed as the next big frontier .
When apple cores , stale bread and last week ’s leftovers go to landfills , they do not return the nutrients they pulled from the soil while growing .
What is more , when sealed in landfills without oxygen , organic materials release methane , a potent heat - trapping gas , as they decompose .
If composted , however , the food can be broken down and returned to the earth as a nonchemical fertilizer with no methane by - product .
Green Foodservice Alliance , a division of the Georgia Restaurant Association , has been adding restaurants throughout Atlanta and its suburbs to its so - called zero - waste zones .
And companies are springing up to meet the growth in demand from restaurants for recycling and compost haulers .
Steve Simon , a partner in Fifth Group , a company that owns Ecco and four other restaurants in the Atlanta area , said that the hardest part of participating in the alliance ’s zero - waste - zone program was not training his staff but finding reliable haulers .
“ There are now two in town , and neither is a year old , so it is a very tentative situation , ” Mr. Simon said .
Still , he said he had little doubt that the hauling sector would grow and that all five of the restaurants would eventually be waste - free .
One of the ever - present trends in electronics is that stuff gets smaller .
Although it does n't get much attention , the fact that electronic features can be scaled continuously in size down to something very close to the single atom level is an important reason why electronic devices are still king .
The pretenders to the throne — optical devices — continue to sit off to one side while their supporters develop cunning plans for a takeover .
All of those plans focus on making optical circuit elements smaller .
One of the main barriers to reducing the size of optical components is the wavelength of light .
Visible light has a wavelength of around 500nm , so devices that manipulate light , like lenses and waveguides , must have comparable sizes .
At least up until now — a long - awaited development has now provided a proof of principle , demonstrating that lasers can be made as small as 50nm , sizes that are comparable to current electronic features .
Normally , the absolute smallest length that laser hardware can have is a half wavelength , so the blue laser diode in your PS3 could be as short as 200nm ( it 's not though ; it 's considerably longer ) .
Even worse , while the length may now be 200nm , the width and height have to be much bigger so that the end mirrors provide a good reflecting surface .
These size issues have kept on - chip optics at something close to a stand - still for well over a decade .
In the last few years , scientists have begun to take fresh interest in the optical properties of metals .
The way that light can cause the electrons in a metal oscillate coherently has led to new ideas for scaling down optical elements .
These electron oscillations , called surface plasmon polaritons , have been shown to travel down wires just a few nanometers in diameter , providing the opportunity to scale things down .
These surface plasmon polaritons do n't last very long though .
The electrons in the metal quickly dissipate their energy by bouncing off the atoms in the wire , heating them up , while the remaining energy is re-radiated as light .
To overcome this , you need an amplifier , and , as an initial source of light , a laser .
Such a laser , called a spacer ( surface plasmon laser ) , has been proposed on several occasions , but until now , nobody had actually produced one .
To create the spaser , researchers took gold nanospheres and coated them with a sodium glass .
On top of that , they placed an outer shell of dye - impregnated glass .
The inner gold sphere acts as the resonator for the light .
The light remains on the outside of the gold sphere as the electrons inside slosh back and forth — the light field extends far enough that it passes through the dye - impregnated outer shell , which provides gain .
The middle layer of sodium glass acts as a separator , preventing the dye molecules from interacting directly with the metal .
Otherwise , the interaction would act to broaden the range of colors the dye molecule could emit and shorten the amount of time it spends in the excited state , where it can emit light .
The basic idea is that blue - green light is shone on the particles and absorbed by the dye .
The excited dye molecules then begin to spontaneously emit green photons , some of which hit the chewy gold center , exciting a surface plasmon .
The surface plasmon starts sloshing back and forth , and its field sweeps through the excited dye molecules , stimulating them to emit , adding to the surface plasmon .
In the meantime , part of the energy stored in the surface plasmon radiates as coherent light .
The researchers observed that their spaser had all the characteristics expected of a laser : a threshold , narrow emission line , and relaxation oscillations .
A threshold means that it requires a certain amount of input energy before a sufficient number of dye molecules contribute light to overcome the losses that occur as the electrons slosh about .
Below this energy , a weak broad range of colors are emitted , while above , only a single color is emitted .
Finally , after the energy is dumped into the dye , it takes some time for the spaser to start going but , once going , it quickly produces short , intense pulses of light , called relaxation oscillations — typically , we prefer to operate lasers so that only a single pulse is emitted on these occasions , but we can't always be choosy .
So , we now have 50nm laser hardware , which could conceivably be combined with nanowires to start developing optical circuits that really do look like electronic circuits ( e.g. , small and cheap ) .
This laser was powered by a very powerful pump laser , meaning that it 's only small if you ignore the enormous power supply .
But that was a side effect of how the experiment was put together .
A single spaser used about 20 microwatts of power , so much smaller pump sources are feasible .
If they can achieve continuous wave operation , the researchers are on to a winner .

An add - on that Microsoft silently slipped into Mozilla 's Firefox last February leaves the browser open to attack , Microsoft 's security engineers acknowledged earlier this week .
One of the 13 security bulletins Microsoft released Tuesday affects not only Internet Explorer ( IE ) , but also Firefox , thanks to a Microsoft - made plug - in pushed to Firefox users eight months ago in an update delivered via Windows Update .
" While the vulnerability is in an IE component , there is an attack vector for Firefox users as well , " admitted Microsoft engineers in a post to the company 's Security Research & Defense blog on Tuesday .
" The reason is that .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 installs a ' Windows Presentation Foundation ' plug - in in Firefox . "
The Microsoft engineers described the possible threat as a " browse - and - get - owned " situation that only requires attackers to lure Firefox users to a rigged Web site .
Numerous users and experts complained when Microsoft pushed the .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 ( SP1 ) update to users last February , including Susan Bradley , a contributor to the popular Windows Secrets newsletter .
" The .NET Framework Assistant [ the name of the add - on slipped into Firefox ] that results can be installed inside Firefox without your approval , " Bradley noted in a Feb. 12 story .
" Although it was first installed with Microsoft 's Visual Studio development program , I 've seen this .NET component added to Firefox as part of the .
NET Family patch . "
What was particularly galling to users was that once installed , the .NET add - on was virtually impossible to remove from Firefox .
The usual " Disable " and " Uninstall " buttons in Firefox 's add - on list were grayed out on all versions of Windows except Windows 7 , leaving most users no alternative other than to root through the Windows registry , a potentially dangerous chore , since a misstep could cripple the PC .
Several sites posted complicated directions on how to scrub the .NET add - on from Firefox , including Annoyances.org .
Annoyances also said the threat to Firefox users is serious .
" This update adds to Firefox one of the most dangerous vulnerabilities present in all versions of Internet Explorer : the ability for Web sites to easily and quietly install software on your PC , " said the hints and tips site .
" Since this design flaw is one of the reasons [ why ] you may have originally chosen to abandon IE in favor of a safer browser like Firefox , you may wish to remove this extension with all due haste . "
Specifically , the .NET plug - in switched on a Microsoft technology dubbed ClickOnce , which lets .NET apps automatically download and run inside other browsers .
Microsoft reacted to criticism about the method it used to install the Firefox add - on by issuing another update in early May that made it possible to uninstall or disable the .NET Framework Assistant .
It did not , however , apologize to Firefox users for slipping the add - on into their browsers without their explicit permission -- as generally the procedure for Firefox add - ons or extensions .
This week , Microsoft did not revisit the origin of the .NET add - on , but simply told Firefox users that they should uninstall the component if they were n't able to deploy the patches provided in the MS09 - 054 update .
According to Microsoft , the vulnerability is " critical , " and also can be exploited against users running any version of IE , including IE8 .
THE HEAVENLY DIVINE COUNCIL
For nearly the past two millennia , there has been a general misunderstanding of the way God governs the earth .
As this study will establish , a heavenly council of spirit beings has exercised rule over our world for millennia .
Paul referred to this group of spiritual entities in the sixth chapter of Ephesians :
EPHESIANS 6:12
For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood , but against principalities , against powers , against the rulers of the darkness of this age , against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places .
( NKJV )
This Scripture clearly tells us that there are evil spiritual powers in the heavens that rule over mankind and oppose God 's people .
This is a fact verified in many other biblical passages .
However , due to scribal changes in the text and the doctrinal leanings of translators , this truth is generally not well understood by most believers .
In this article , we 're going to examine this vital information about the spiritual realm .
Let 's start by looking at a controversial passage of Scripture from the farewell song of Moses in Deuteronomy 32 .
First , we 'll examine the passage as it appears in most translations based on the traditional Hebrew text ( the Masoretic Text , which was finalized between the 8th and 10th centuries CE ) :
DEUTERONOMY 32:7 " Remember the days of old , consider the years of many generations .
Ask your father , and he will show you ; your elders , and they will tell you : 8 When the Most High divided their inheritance to the nations , when He separated the sons of Adam , He set the boundaries of the peoples according to the number of the CHILDREN OF ISRAEL .
9
For the LORD 's portion is His people ; Jacob is the place of His inheritance .
( NKJV )
However , there is a variant rendering of this passage .
It 's based on the 3rd- century BCE translation of the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek , the Septuagint , as well as Hebrew manuscripts of Deuteronomy found among the Dead Sea Scrolls at Qumran :
DEUTERONOMY 32:7
Remember the days of old , consider the years of many generations ; ask your father , and he will show you ; your elders , and they will tell you .
8
When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance , when He separated the sons of men , He fixed the bounds of the peoples according to the number of the SONS OF GOD .
9
For the LORD 's portion is His people , Jacob His allotted heritage .
( RSV )
Here is this same passage as it was rendered by Sir Lancelot C.L. Brenton in his 1851 translation of the Septuagint into English :
DEUTERONOMY 32:7
Remember the days of old , consider the years for past ages : ask thy father , and he shall relate to thee , thine elders , and they shall tell thee .
8
When the Most High divided the nations , when He separated the sons of Adam , He set the bounds of the nations according to the number of the angels of God. 9 And His people Jacob became the portion of the Lord , Israel was the line of His inheritance .
( Brenton's LXX )
The Greek phrase translated " angels of God " is aggelon theou ; this interpretive phrase is found in nearly all the extant Septuagint manuscripts .
However , several earlier manuscripts have instead huion theou , or " sons of God . "
This is a literal rendering of the Hebrew phrase beney ' elohim found among the Dead Sea Scroll copies of Deuteronomy 32:8 .
The Septuagint translators plainly understood that the " sons of God " ( beney ' elohim ) spoken of in Deuteronomy 32:8 and elsewhere were spirit beings ( " angels " ) , and rendered it that way several times ( Job 1:6 ; 2:1 ; 38:7 ) in order to clarify the meaning .
Thus the textual change from huion theou to aggelon theou .
The idea that the separation of mankind into 70 nations at the Tower of Babel was by and for the angelic " sons of God " is supported by the ancient Book of Jasher ( Jos. 10:13 ; II Sam. 1:18 ) :
JASHER 9:31
And they built the tower and the city , and they did this thing daily until many days and years were elapsed .
32 And God said to the seventy angels who stood foremost before him , to those who were near to him , saying , Come let us descend and confuse their tongues , that one man shall not understand the language of his neighbor , and they did so unto them .
( pub .
1887 , J.H. Parry & Company , Salt Lake City , Utah )
The paraphrased Aramaic translation of Deuteronomy 32:8 - 9 found in the ancient Targum Pseudo - Jonathan supports the Septuagint rendering of verse 8 , but also hints at the origin of the later alternate reading ( " sons of Israel " ) :
DEUTERONOMY 32:8
When the Most High made allotment of the world unto the nations which proceeded from the sons of Noach , in the separation of the writings and languages of the children of men at the time of the division , He cast the lot among the seventy angels , the princes of the nations with whom is the revelation to oversee the city , even at that time
He established the limits of the nations according to the sum of the number of the seventy souls of Israel who went down into Mizraim [ Egypt ] . ( Targum Pseudo - Jonathan , translated by J.W. Etheridge )
The dispute over whether the Masoretic Text or the Septuagint represents the original is more than a scholarly argument among biblical text experts .
The implication of the latter rendering of verse 8 is significant with regard to understanding how God governs the earth .
As Targum Pseudo - Jonathan explicitly brings out , Moses ' mention of the separation of " the sons of men " refers back to God 's division of Noah 's descendants into 70 different nations , as recorded in the 10th chapter of Genesis :
GENESIS 10:32
These are the families of the sons of Noah , according to their genealogies , by their nations ; and out of these the nations were separated on the earth after the flood .
( NASU )
Chapter 10 of Genesis is the backdrop for Moses ' statement in Deuteronomy 32:8 that YHVH is responsible for the creation and placement of the nations ( Heb. goyim ) .
In fact , variations of the same Hebrew root word parad ( " separate " ) are used in both Genesis 10:32 and Deuteronomy 32:8 .
If Moses was indeed referencing Yah 's separation of the nations according to Noah 's offspring ( specifically their physical separation at the Tower of Babel ) , it is important to note that Israel is not listed in the index of the 70 nations found in Genesis 10 .
The nation of Israel did not yet exist at that time .
Therefore , the statement that God " set the boundaries of the nations according to the number of the children of Israel " clearly seems out of context here .
However , if we accept the rendering of Deuteronomy 32:8 found in the Septuagint and the Hebrew copies of Deuteronomy from Qumran ( which is supported by the testimony of the Book of Jasher ) , we face the same dilemma that the Jewish scribes later faced .
Did the Hebrew Scriptures at one time suggest polytheism in the religion delivered to the Israelites ?
Ancient Hebrew language expert Michael S. Heiser has shown that there is good reason to accept the earlier version of this Scripture .
In his article on this passage , he writes :
. . .
What could possibly be meant by the textual option that created a correspondence between the number of the nations in Genesis 10 - 11 and heavenly beings ?
Literary and conceptual parallels discovered in the literature of Ugarit , however , have provided a more coherent explanation for the number 70 in Deuteronomy 32:8 - and have furnished powerful ammunition to textual scholars who argued against the " sons of Israel " reading in MT .
Ugaritic mythology plainly states that the head of its pantheon , El ( who , like the God of the Bible , is also referred to as El Elyon , the " Most High " ) fathered 70 sons , thereby setting the number of the " sons of El " ( Ugaritic , bn 'il ) .
An unmistakable linguistic parallel with the Hebrew text underlying the LXX reading was thus discovered , one which prompted many scholars to accept the LXX reading on logical and philological grounds : God ( El Elyon in Deut. 32:8 ) divided the earth according to the number of heavenly beings who already existed from the time of creation .
. . .
Understanding " sons of God " as the correct reading in Deuteronomy 32:8 in no way requires one to view Israelite religion as polytheistic .
( p. 3 , " Deuteronomy 32:8 and the Sons of God " )
Ugaritic is an ancient near eastern language that is closely related to biblical Hebrew .
Evidently , Ugarit developed a divine mythology based on antediluvian truths regarding the one true God and His government of the world through the angelic creation .
Ugaritic literature contains many council scenes where the chief deity ' El presides over the council of his divine sons , who stand before him on the holy Mount of Assembly .
We see a very similar scene portrayed in the Bible at I Kings 22 and II Chronicles 18 , where YHVH 's prophet Micaiah describes a vision of the heavenly council that he had been given in regard to a question posed to him by Ahab , king of Israel and Jehoshaphat , king of Judah :
II CHRONICLES 18:18 Then Micaiah said , " Therefore hear the word of the LORD : I saw the LORD sitting on His throne , and all the host of heaven standing on His right hand and His left .
19 And the LORD said , ' Who will persuade Ahab king of Israel to go up , that he may fall at Ramoth Gilead ? '
So one spoke in this manner , and another spoke in that manner .
20 Then a spirit came forward and stood before the LORD , and said , ' I will persuade him . '
The LORD said to him , ' In what way ? '
21 " So he said , ' I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets . '
And the Lord said , ' You shall persuade him and also prevail ; go out and do so . '
22 Therefore look !
The LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these prophets of yours , and the LORD has declared disaster against you . "
( NKJV )
Here we see mention of the " host of heaven " ( Heb. tzeva ' hashamayim ) which stands before YHVH .
Clearly this is speaking of angelic beings , including those on the heavenly divine council .
This vision seen by Micaiah shows that YHVH is in complete control of events .
He only approves the course of action that suits
His purpose , which in this case was to bring about the death of evil King Ahab ( I Kings 22:20 ; II Chr. 18:19 ) .
The " host of heaven " is spoken of in many Scriptures .
Some Bible scholars attempt to downplay the true meaning of this phrase and imply that it speaks mainly of the stars in the sky .
Contextually , however , it is evident that tzeva ' hashamayim often refers to the realm of spirit beings in the heavens .
The New Bible Dictionary says this about the " host of heaven " :
This phrase ( tzeva ' hashamayim ) occurs about 15 times , in most cases implying the object of heathen worship ( Dt. 4:19 , etc. ) .
The two meanings ' celestial bodies ' and ' angelic beings ' are inextricably intertwined .
The LXX translation , using kosmos , stratia , or dynamis , does not help to resolve this .
No doubt to the Heb[ rew ] mind the distinction was superficial , and the celestial bodies were thought to be closely associated with heavenly beings .
. . .
The Bible certainly suggests that angels of different ranks have charge of individuals and of nations ; no doubt , in the light of modern cosmology this concept , if retained at all ( as biblically it must be ) , ought properly to be extended , as the dual sense of the phrase ' host of heaven ' suggests , to the oversight of the elements of the physical universe -- planets , stars and nebulae .
( p. 495 , " Host , Host of Heaven " )
Regarding the meaning of the related title " Lord of hosts " ( Heb. YHVH tzeva'ot ) , the New Bible Dictionary states :
It is thought by some to have arisen as a title of God associated with his lordship over the ' host ' of Israel ; but its usage , especially in the prophets , clearly implies also a relationship to the ' host of heaven ' in its angelic sense ; and this could well be the original connotation .
( p. 495 , " Host , Host of Heaven " )
The following Scriptures indicate that the " host of heaven " is more than just the stars in the night sky :
NEHEMIAH 9:5 . . .
" Stand up and bless the LORD your God forever and ever !
Blessed be Your glorious name , which is exalted above all blessing and praise !
6
You alone are the LORD ;
You have made heaven , the heaven of heavens , with all their host , the earth and everything on it , the seas and all that is in them , and You preserve them all .
The host of heaven worships You . " ( NKJV )
Only living creatures can worship God.
Clearly , the " host of heaven " here refers to sentient created beings which reside in the heavens .
JEREMIAH 19:13
" And the houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah shall be defiled like the place of Tophet , because of all the houses on whose roofs they have burned incense to all the host of heaven , and poured out drink offerings to other gods . "
( NKJV )
Here Jeremiah draws a parallel between " the host of heaven , " to whom incense was burned and " other gods , " to whom drink offerings were poured out .
This grammatical construction in Hebrew is meant to show that both the " host of heaven " and the " other gods " are the same .
They were " the gods of the nations , " the angelic rulers assigned by God over the nations of the earth .
One of the most grievous sins of the ancient Israelites was their continual idolatry .
Instead of worshiping the one true God , they instead worshiped the inferior " sons of God , " the " host of heaven " :
II KINGS 17:15 And they [ Israel and Judah ] rejected His statutes and His covenant that He had made with their fathers , and His testimonies which He had testified against them ; they followed idols , became idolaters , and went after the nations who were all around them , concerning whom the LORD had charged them that they should not do like them .
16
So they left all the commandments of the LORD their God , made for themselves a molded image and two calves , made a wooden image and worshiped all the host of heaven , and served Baal .
( NKJV )
II KINGS 21:3 For he [ Manasseh ] rebuilt the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed ; he raised up altars for Baal , and made a wooden image , as Ahab king of Israel had done ; and he worshiped all the host of heaven and served them .
4
He also built altars in the house of the LORD , of which the LORD had said , " In Jerusalem I will put My name . "
5
And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD .
6
Also he made his son pass through the fire , practiced soothsaying , used witchcraft , and consulted spiritists and mediums .
He did much evil in the sight of the LORD , to provoke Him to anger .
( NKJV )
The Bible shows that the " host of heaven " was on the scene during the creation of the earth .
In Job 38:4 - 7 , we see YHVH questioning Job in order to prove a point to him .
During that interrogation , He asks Job where he was during the creation of the universe :
JOB 38:4
" Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth ?
Tell Me , if you have understanding , 5 Who set its measurements ?
Since you know .
Or who stretched the line on it ?
6
On what were its bases sunk ?
Or who laid its cornerstone , 7 When the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy ? " ( NASU )
This Scripture clearly indicates that the " sons of God " ( beney 'elohim , also called " morning stars " here ) were present at creation week .
This fact is supported by the first chapter of Genesis :
GENESIS 1:26 Then God said , " Let us make man in our image , in our likeness , and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air , over the livestock , over all the earth , and over all the creatures that move along the ground . " ( NIV )
This verse is often used by modern scholars to attempt to prove that the doctrine of the Trinity can be found in the Old Testament .
Regarding this erroneous contention , The Eerdmans Bible Dictionary states :
The " us " in " Let us make man in our image " ( Gen. 1:26 ; cf. 3:22 ; 11:6 - 7 ) refers to the " sons of God " or lesser " gods " mentioned elsewhere ( 6:1 - 4 ; Job 1:6 ; Ps. 29:1 ) , here viewed as a heavenly council centered around the one God ( cf. Ps. 82:1 ) .
In later usage these probably would be called " angels . " ( p. 1019 , " Trinity " )
Deuteronomy 32:8 is paralleled by a passage from Deuteronomy 4 that speaks of the allocation of the heavenly host :
DEUTERONOMY 4:19 " And beware not to lift up your eyes to heaven and see the sun and the moon and the stars , all the host of heaven , and be drawn away and worship them and serve them , those which the LORD your God has allotted to all the peoples under the whole heaven .
( NASU )
The " host of heaven " here is said to be " allotted to all the peoples under the whole heaven . "
The word allotted in Hebrew is chalaq , which literally means " apportioned " or " assigned . "
In a statement similar to Deuteronomy 32:8 , we are told here that YHVH assigned " the host of heaven " to the peoples of the earth .
The " host of heaven " are the same spiritual " principalities , " " powers , " and " rulers " Paul speaks of in Ephesians 6:12 .
These heavenly " powers " are mentioned many times in the New Testament :
MATTHEW 24:29
" Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened , and the moon will not give its light ; the stars will fall from heaven , and the powers of the heavens will be shaken . "
( NKJV )
MARK 13:24 " But in those days , after that tribulation , the sun will be darkened , and the moon will not give its light ; 25 the stars of heaven will fall , and the powers in the heavens will be shaken . "
( NKJV )
LUKE 21:25
" And there will be signs in the sun , in the moon , and in the stars ; and on the earth distress of nations , with perplexity , the sea and the waves roaring ; 26 men 's hearts failing them from fear and the expectation of those things which are coming on the earth , for the powers of heaven will be shaken . "
( NKJV )
ROMANS 8:38
For I am persuaded that neither death nor life , nor angels nor principalities nor powers , nor things present nor things to come , 39 nor height nor depth , nor any other created thing , shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord . ( NKJV )
I CORINTHIANS 15:24
Then comes the end , when he delivers the kingdom to God the Father , when He puts an end to all rule and all authority and power .
25 For he must reign till
He has put all enemies under his feet .
( NKJV )
EPHESIANS 1:20 Which
He worked in Christ , raising him from the dead and seating him at His right hand in the heavens , 21 far above every principality , authority , power , and dominion , and every name that is named not only in this age but also in the one to come .
( NAB )
EPHESIANS 3:8
To me , though I am the very least of all the saints , this grace was given , to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ , 9 and to make all men see what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things ; 10 that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the principalities and powers in the heavenly places .
11 This was according to the eternal purpose which he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord , ( RSV )
COLOSSIANS 1:15 He [ Christ ] is the image of the invisible God , the firstborn of all creation .
16 For in him were created all things in heaven and on earth , the visible and the invisible , whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers ; all things were created through him and for him .
( NAB )
COLOSSIANS 2:9
For in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily ; 10 and you are complete in him , who is the head of all principality and power .
( NKJV )
COLOSSIANS 2:13
When you were dead in your transgressions and the uncircumcision of your flesh , He [ God ] made you alive together with him [ Christ ] , having forgiven us all our transgressions , 14 having canceled out the certificate of debt consisting of decrees against us , which was hostile to us ; and He has taken it out of the way , having nailed it to the cross .
15 When
He had disarmed the rulers and authorities , He made a public display of them , having triumphed over them through him .
( NASU )
1 PETER 3:22 [ Christ ] who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God , angels and authorities and powers having been made subject to him .
( NKJV )
In Hebrews 2:5 , the author indirectly establishes the current rulership of our world by powerful angelic beings :
HEBREWS 2:5
It is not to angels that He has subjected the world to come , about which we are speaking .
( NIV )
By saying that God will not subject the coming world to the rule of angels , the author implies that the current world is being ruled by spirit entities .
Chapters 1 and 2 of the book of Job show two instances of the divine council composed of the sons of God ( the beney ' elohim ) gathering in heaven for a meeting of the council :
JOB 1:6
Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD , and Satan also came among them .
7
And the LORD said to Satan , " From where do you come ? "
So Satan answered the LORD and said , " From going to and fro on the earth , and from walking back and forth on it . " ( NKJV )
JOB 2:1
Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD , and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD .
2
And the LORD said to Satan , " From where do you come ? "
So Satan answered the LORD and said , " From going to and fro on the earth , and from walking back and forth on it . " ( NKJV )
What we see described here appear to be accounts of the " sons of God " ( beney ' elohim ) coming to regularly scheduled meetings of the divine council .
Satan also came to these meetings , but from the text we cannot tell if he is one of the members of the council , or if he simply appeared to bring a petition before the council .
Other Scriptures seem to indicate , however , that Satan may be a high - ranking member of the divine council given charge over the kingdoms of the world ( e.g. Luke 4:5 - 7 ) .
A couple of other Scriptures mention the divine council in passing :
JOB 15:7
" Are you the first man that was born ?
Or were you brought forth before the hills ?
8
Have you listened in the council of God ?
And do you limit wisdom to yourself ? " ( RSV )
JEREMIAH 23:16
This is what the LORD Almighty says : " Do not listen to what the prophets are prophesying to you ; they fill you with false hopes .
They speak visions from their own minds , not from the mouth of the LORD .
17 They keep saying to those who despise Me , ' The LORD says : You will have peace . '
And to all who follow the stubbornness of their hearts they say , ' No harm will come to you . '
18 But which of them has stood in the council of the LORD to see or to hear His word ?
Who has listened and heard His word ? " ( NIV )
Psalm 82 is the most detailed description we have of a meeting of the heavenly divine council which was given rulership over the 70 nations of the earth :
PSALM 82:1 { A Psalm of Asaph.}
God has taken
His place in the divine council ; in the midst of the gods
He holds judgment : 2 " How long will you judge unjustly and show partiality to the wicked ?
Selah 3
Give justice to the weak and the fatherless ; maintain the right of the afflicted and the destitute .
4
Rescue the weak and the needy ; deliver them from the hand of the wicked . "
5
They have neither knowledge nor understanding , they walk about in darkness ; all the foundations of the earth are shaken .
6 I say , " You are gods , sons of the Most High , all of you ; 7 nevertheless , you shall die like men , and fall like any prince . "
8 Arise , O God , judge the earth ; for to Thee belong all the nations !
( RSV )
In this psalm , we see God take His place as the leader of the divine council .
The psalmist records that , during this meeting of the council , God criticizes the " gods " ( ' elohim ) for their unfairness and wickedness in carrying out the responsibilities
He has assigned to them .
Asaph tells us that the sin and rebellion of the 'elohim have shaken the foundations of the earth .
He records God 's warning to these divine spirit entities , that their fate for corruption and disobedience will be to " die like men " ( Heb. ' adam ) .
Since clearly all men will " die like men , " attempting to apply this Scripture to human rulers , as some scholars do , is illogical .
Asaph ends the psalm by exhorting God to judge the earth and its divine rulers , because all nations truly belong to Him and not to them .
Psalm 82:7 refers to the governing ' elohim as " princes . "
This designation connects these council members to whom rulership of the nations was given ( Deu. 32:8 ) with another passage of Scripture found in Daniel :
DANIEL 10:5
I lifted my eyes and looked , and behold , a certain man clothed in linen , whose waist was girded with gold of Uphaz !
6
His body was like beryl , his face like the appearance of lightning , his eyes like torches of fire , his arms and feet like burnished bronze in color , and the sound of his words like the voice of a multitude .
. . .
12
Then he said to me , " Do not fear , Daniel , for from the first day that you set your heart to understand , and to humble yourself before your God , your words were heard ; and I have come because of your words .
13
But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty - one days ; and behold , Michael , one of the chief princes , came to help me , for I had been left alone there with the kings of Persia .
( NKJV )
The Scripture above gives us an intriguing glimpse into the order and activities of the spiritual realm .
Gabriel was sent by Yah to give Daniel insight into what would happen to his people ( the Jews ) in " the latter days . "
However , this mighty angel was delayed for three weeks because " the prince of the kingdom of Persia " contested God 's command .
This prince of Persia clearly was not human ; he was the divine council member who had authority over the nation of Persia .
Indeed , if Michael ( who is described in Dan. 12:1 as the great prince who stands over the people of Israel ) had not helped Gabriel , God 's message to Daniel might not have been delivered .
For additional information on Michael , the spiritual prince over God 's portion , Israel , refer to my article " Christ in the Old Testament . "
DANIEL 10:20
Then he said , " Do you know why I have come to you ?
Now I must return to fight against the prince of Persia , and when I am through with him , the prince of Greece will come .
21 But I am to tell you what is inscribed in the book of truth .
There is no one with me who contends against these princes except Michael , your prince . "
( NRSV )
After conveying his message to Daniel , Gabriel states that he must return to again do battle with " the prince of Persia . "
Furthermore , he states that he will also have to combat " the prince of Greece " after he has finished with " the Prince of Persia . "
The picture portrayed by this brief narrative is one of opposition to God 's will by the spirit beings of the council who have been given rule over the nations .
The book of Daniel mentions the fate of some of the " host of heaven " under the coming Antichrist :
DANIEL 8:10
And it [ the little horn ] grew up to the host of heaven ; and it cast down some of the host and some of the stars to the ground , and trampled them .
11 He even exalted himself as high as the Prince of the host [ Yeshua , cf. Eph. 1:21 ; Col. 2:10 ; I Pet. 3:22 ] ; and by him the daily sacrifices were taken away , and the place of His sanctuary was cast down .
( NKJV )
We see from Daniel 8 that the Antichrist will come against these spiritual powers and " cast down some " of them and " trample them . "
It 's likely that the remainder will join his end - time rebellion against YHVH .
Just as Psalm 82 speaks of the eventual fate of these heavenly princes , the prophet Isaiah tells of their coming punishment in a couple of passages :
ISAIAH 24:19
The earth is broken asunder , the earth is split through , the earth is shaken violently .
20
The earth reels to and fro like a drunkard and it totters like a shack , for its transgression is heavy upon it , and it will fall , never to rise again .
21
So it will happen in that day , that the LORD will punish the host of heaven on high , and the kings of the earth on earth .
22
They will be gathered together like prisoners in the dungeon , and will be confined in prison ; and after many days they will be punished .
( NASU )
As Isaiah 24:21 shows , the " host of heaven " ruling from " on high " are differentiated from the kings ruling on the earth below .
Let 's look at another prophecy of their doom :
ISAIAH 34:1 Come near , you nations , to hear ; and heed , you people !
Let the earth hear , and all that is in it , the world and all things that come forth from it .
2
For the indignation of the LORD is against all nations , and His fury against all their armies ;
He has utterly destroyed them , He has given them over to the slaughter .
3
Also their slain shall be thrown out ; their stench shall rise from their corpses , and the mountains shall be melted with their blood .
4
All the host of heaven shall be dissolved , and the heavens shall be rolled up like a scroll ; all their host shall fall down as the leaf falls from the vine , and as fruit falling from a fig tree .
5 " For My sword shall be bathed in heaven ; indeed it shall come down on Edom , and on the people of My curse , for judgment . " ( NKJV )
Like the " host " of the nations that come against the Messiah will be slain , the " host of heaven " ( Heb. tzeva ' hashamayim ) who rule these earthly nations will also be defeated .
The sword of the Eternal , wielded by the Messiah , will " drink its fill in the heavens " as well as on the earth .
We are told in Isaiah 34:4 that " the host of heaven shall be dissolved " ( Heb. namaqu , literally " waste away , " " decay " ) .
In Zechariah 14:12 , the same Hebrew root word maqaq is used to describe the fate of those who come against Jerusalem at the end of the age .
There is a similarity between Isaiah 34:4 and II Peter 3:10 - 12 that deserves some attention .
Peter speaks of an end - time fire in the heavens , which will melt and dissolve the elements :
II PETER 3:10 But the day of the Lord will come like a thief , and then the heavens will pass away with a loud noise , and the elements [ stoicheia ] will be dissolved with fire , and the earth and the works that are upon it will be burned up .
11 Since all these things are thus to be dissolved , what sort of persons ought you to be in lives of holiness and godliness , 12 waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God , because of which the heavens will be kindled and dissolved , and the elements [ stoicheia ] will melt with fire !
( RSV )
The Greek word stoicheia , translated " elements " in the passage above , is understood by many scholars to refer to heavenly spirits .
This understanding can be seen in several passages written by the apostle Paul :
GALATIANS 4:1 I mean that the heir , as long as he is a child , is no better than a slave , though he is the owner of all the estate ; 2 but he is under guardians and trustees until the date set by the father .
3
So with us ; when we were children , we were slaves to the elemental spirits of the universe [ ta stoicheia tou kosmou ] . ( RSV )
GALATIANS 4:9
But now that you have come to know God , or rather to be known by God , how can you turn back again to the weak and beggarly elemental spirits [ stoicheia ] , whose slaves you want to be once more ?
( RSV )
COLOSSIANS 2:8
See to it that no one makes a prey of you by philosophy and empty deceit , according to human tradition , according to the elemental spirits of the universe [ ta stoicheia tou kosmou ] , and not according to Christ .
( RSV )
COLOSSIANS 2:18
Let no one disqualify you , insisting on self - abasement and worship of angels , taking his stand on visions , puffed up without reason by his sensuous mind , 19 and not holding fast to the head , from whom the whole body , nourished and knit together through its joints and ligaments , grows with a growth that is from God. 20 If with Christ you died to the elemental spirits of the universe [ ton stoicheion tou kosmou ] , why do you live as if you still belonged to the world ? . . . ( RSV )
The Dictionary of Paul and His Letters has this to say about the " elements " as spiritual powers :
A number of interpreters , perhaps even a majority , have concluded that ta stoicheia tou kosmou refers to spiritual powers of some sort .
. . .
The earliest extant extrabiblical Jewish evidence for the stoicheia being associated with both spirits and stars is later than the first century ( second and third centuries A.D. ) , but it is well attested and may very well represent beliefs contemporaneous with Paul ( cf. Lohse , 99 n.41 ) .
The Testament of Solomon , a Jewish - Christian work usually dated to the third century A.D. , but possibly containing material dating to the first century , testifies to a belief in star spirits called stoicheia .
Seven bound spirits appear before Solomon and reveal their identity : " We are the stoicheia , rulers of this world of darkness [ kosmokratores tou skotous , cf. Eph 6:12 ] . . . our stars in heaven look small , but we are named like gods " ( T. Sol. 8:2-4 ) . ( pp. 231 , 232 , " Elements / Elemental Spirits of the World " )
If we understand the usage of stoicheia by Peter to be the same as Paul 's usage in the Scriptures cited above , we can see that Peter was simply reemphasizing what the prophet Isaiah had said about the fate of the spiritual powers aligned against YHVH .
Isaiah stated the " host of heaven " would be dissolved ;
Peter said that these same " elemental spirits " would be dissolved by fire .
YESHUA'S RELATIONSHIP TO THE DIVINE COUNCIL
In the tenth chapter of John 's Gospel , Yeshua answers the Jews ' question regarding his identity :
JOHN 10:24
Then the Jews surrounded him and said to him , " How long do you keep us in doubt ?
If you are the Christ , tell us plainly . "
25 Jesus answered them , " I told you , and you do not believe .
The works that I do in my Father 's name , they bear witness of me .
26
But you do not believe , because you are not of my sheep , as I said to you .
27 My sheep hear my voice , and I know them , and they follow me .
28 And I give them eternal life , and they shall never perish ; neither shall anyone snatch them out of my hand .
29 My Father , who has given them to me , is greater than all ; and no one is able to snatch them out of my Father 's hand .
30 I and my Father are one . "
31 Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him .
32 Jesus answered them , " Many good works I have shown you from my Father .
For which of those works do you stone me ? "
33 The Jews answered him , saying , " For a good work we do not stone you , but for blasphemy , and because you , being a man , make yourself God [ theon ] . "
34 Jesus answered them , " Is it not written in your law , ' I said , " You are gods [ theoi ] " '?
35 If He called them gods [ theous ] , to whom the word of God came ( and the Scripture can not be broken ) , 36 do you say of him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world , ' You are blaspheming , ' because I said , ' I am the Son of God ' ?
37 If I do not do the works of my Father , do not believe me ; 38 but if I do , though you do not believe me , believe the works , that you may know and believe that the Father is in me , and I in Him . " ( NKJV )
The passage above starts with the Jews asking Yeshua if he was the prophesied Messiah ( v. 24 ) .
He answered by saying that he had already told them he was , and they did n't believe him ( v. 25a ) .
Yeshua goes on to say that the works he had performed before them in the Father 's name were a testimony to his identity ( v. 25 b ) .
Next he differentiated between those blinded Jews and the sheep his Father had given him ( vv. 26-29 ) .
Yeshua finished his comments to the Jews by proclaiming that he and his Father were " one " ( v. 30 ) .
This answer prompted the Jews to charge him with blasphemy and prepare to stone him ( vv. 31-33 ) .
In verses 34 - 36 , Yeshua addressed the charge that the Jews had leveled against him , namely that he had blasphemed by proclaiming himself to be " God . "
The Greek word theon is the equivalent of the Hebrew ' elohim .
Based on Yeshua 's answer to the Jews , why were they planning to stone him ?
Did they think that he , a man , had proclaimed himself to be YHVH the Father ?
Or did they understand his claim in a way that was different from the common Trinitarian understanding of today ?
Rather than assume that we know , let 's allow the Jews themselves define for us what they took Yeshua 's claim to be :
JOHN 19:6
Therefore , when the chief priests and officers saw Him , they cried out , saying , " Crucify Him , crucify Him ! "
Pilate said to them , " You take Him and crucify Him , for I find no fault in Him . "
7
The Jews answered him , " We have a law , and according to our law He ought to die , because he made himself the Son of God . " ( NKJV )
Clearly the Jews understood Yeshua 's claim to be that he was an 'elohim , one of the divine sons of God.
Carefully notice Yeshua 's specific reply to the charge of blasphemy .
He first references the members of the divine council , who were called " sons of God " in the Old Testament ( Job 1:6 ; 2:1 ; 38:7 ; etc. ) , by quoting from Psalm 82:6 ( v. 34 ) .
Then Yeshua asked the Jews , " Why do you say I 'm blaspheming just because I 've proclaimed myself to be the Son of God , when the Father Himself in the Scripture calls the members of the divine council gods ( ' elohim ) ? " ( vv. 35 -36 ) .
Yeshua 's response , including the reference to Psalm 82:6 , was intended to convey the understanding that Yeshua , the Son of God , had preexisted his mortal appearance and was one of the members ( in fact , the foremost member ) of the divine council addressed in Psalm 82 .
Yeshua here was proclaiming himself to be an ' elohim ( divine ) ; he was NOT saying that he was the ' Elohim , the Most High , YHVH the Father .
Many Christians base their understanding of this passage solely on verse 30 .
They assume that Yeshua 's statement that he and the Father are one is an affirmation of the Trinity doctrine ( or the less popular " Oneness " doctrine ) .
However , the Bible clearly shows that the state of being " one " does not entail being " the same as " ( i.e. , Yeshua = the Father ) .
The example of Adam and Eve clearly illustrates this biblical principal :
GENESIS 2:21
And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam , and he slept ; and He took one of his ribs , and closed up the flesh in its place .
22 Then the rib which the LORD God had taken from man
He made into a woman , and He brought her to the man .
23 And Adam said : " This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh ; she shall be called Woman , because she was taken out of Man . "
24 Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife , and they shall become ONE FLESH .
25
And they were both naked , the man and his wife , and were not ashamed .
( NKJV )
Yeshua himself quoted this passage when defending the sanctity of marriage to the Pharisees ( Matt. 19:3 - 9 ; Mark 10:2-12 ) .
Clearly , a man and woman do not literally become one flesh when they marry .
So out of necessity , it is essential to understand " one " here in a different sense .
The Hebrew word for " one " ( echad ) often means " unity . "
It is this meaning that Jesus intended when he said that he and his Father were " one . "
Jesus was unified with the Father in accomplishing God 's purpose and will ( Matt . 26:39 ; John 5:30 ; 14:10 , 24 ) .
Yeshua 's prayer to the Father before his crucifixion , recorded in John 17 , confirms this understanding of " one " :
JOHN 17:11 " Now I am no longer in the world , but these are in the world , and I come to You .
Holy Father , keep through
Your name those whom
You have given me , that they may be one as we are . " ( NKJV )
Yeshua prayed that the disciples
Yah had given him would become one , just as he and the Father were one .
How then were the disciples to become one ?
Were they to become some sort of divine triune being ?
Or were they to be united through the Holy Spirit to do the will of God , just as Yeshua was united to his Father during his entire life on earth ?
JOHN 17:20 " I do not pray for these alone , but also for those who will believe in Me through their word ; 21 that they all may be one , as You , Father , are in me , and I in You ; that they also may be one in us , that the world may believe that You sent me .
22
And the glory which
You gave me I have given them , that they may be one just as we are one : 23 I in them , and You in me ; that they may be made perfect in one , and that the world may know that You have sent me , and have loved them as You have loved me . " ( NKJV )
When he prayed " that they may be one just as we are one , " Yeshua was not praying for all believers to become a part of the Trinity .
Yeshua clearly tells us that he and the Father are " one " by the Father being in him ( through the Holy Spirit ) and by Yeshua being in the Father ( by doing God 's will instead of his own ) .
Yeshua always knew God 's will because of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit ; he remained in the Father by always doing His will .
Yeshua 's prayer for all believers was that the Father would make them one with both of them ; this would be accomplished by God 's Spirit flowing through Messiah ( the mediator ) to dwell within them .
CONCLUSION
The world is currently ruled over by angelic principalities and powers that Yah gave authority over the nations .
Just as the nations over which they rule , these mighty spirits have often chosen to go against the will of God .
In choosing not to submit to God 's authority , they have become the enemies of YHVH and His chosen people .
Eventually , the rebellion of these wicked spirits will lead to their judgment and punishment .
The Messiah , the ruler of the sons of God on the divine council , will triumph over them at his second coming and will rule the nations according to the will of YHVH .

That bong with the leftover water in it ?
It can get you in big trouble .
The Minnesota Supreme Court ruled 4 - 3 on Thursday that bong water with traces of methamphetamine was a “ mixture ” with a controlled substance — and not just “ drug paraphernalia ” — sending the case of a Rice County mother back to district court for retrial .
Sara Ruth Peck , now 46 , of Faribault , was charged with first - degree drug possession in September 2007 after the South Central Drug Investigation Unit searched her home and found a glass bong , a red butane torch and a glass pipe .
Peck was at home with her children , ages 12 and 8 .
The St. Paul crime laboratory analyzed a sample of the water from the bong ; it tested positive for meth , the complaint said .
Peck also was charged with felony fifth - degree drug possession and child endangerment , a gross misdemeanor .
The district court in Rice County threw out the first - degree drug possession charge after she argued that the pink , fruity bong water did not constitute a “ mixture ” under state law .
Peck intended the bong water to be part of the bong , or drug paraphernalia , the court concluded .
The state Court of Appeals agreed .
The law says that a person is guilty of first - degree possession if he or she possesses one or more mixtures of 25 grams or more of meth .
In Peck ’s case , the bong water weighed 37 grams .
In his majority opinion , Supreme Court Justice G. Barry Anderson wrote that state law was clear and that the courts “ must give the statute ’s words and phrases their plain and ordinary meaning . ”
The law defines a mixture as “ a preparation , compound , mixture , or substance containing a controlled substance , regardless of purity . ”
A dissenting opinion said the majority ruling “ misapplies the plain - meaning rule … runs counter to the legislative structure of our drug laws , does not make common sense , and borders on the absurd , ” wrote Justice Paul H. Anderson , who was joined in dissent by justices Alan C. Page and Helen M. Meyer .
He said the 37 grams of bong water constituted about “ 2 1/2 tablespoons . ”
A first - degree drug conviction calls for a presumptive sentence of more than seven years in prison .
“ Rice County ’s decision to charge Peck in a manner far more serious than what was intended by the legislature represents the kind of counterproductive activity that leads unnecessarily to increasing incarceration rates and wasted taxpayer money , ” Paul Anderson wrote .
If the bong water is treated as paraphernalia , he continued , the defendant would receive a fine of no more than $ 300 and a petty misdemeanor conviction .
Rice County Attorney Paul Beaumaster applauded the majority opinion Thursday .
“ It ’s not just about whether bong water can hold a controlled substance , ” he said .
“ The question before the court is whether or not the Legislature had already set out what controlled substances are . ”
It is the Legislature ’s job — not the courts ’ — to decide “ what qualifies and does not qualify to be a crime , ” Beaumaster said .
His office will pursue prosecution , he said .

A year ago , it looked as if fuel - sipping motorcycles might be the option for motorists facing increasing gas prices .
This year , little seems to be working for bike makers .
Sales of motorcycles plummeted 37.3 % in the third quarter from the same period a year earlier , with the biggest drops coming in cruisers and sport bikes , two of the industry ’s biggest product lines , according to the Motorcycle Industry Council .
Sales of scooters , which were gaining a year ago , also have fallen sharply .
The council , which does n’t release revenue figures of the mostly privately held member manufacturers , said overall sales of bikes fell to 136,876 in the quarter from 218,242 in the previous year ’s quarter .
The only bright spot was that sales were dropping at a slower pace :
The number of bikes sold in the second quarter fell 53.5 % from the same period a year earlier .
Historically , the second and third quarters are strongest for the industry because the weather is warm throughout the country and buyers are gearing up to ride .

Industry leaders tried to put a good face on the numbers , saying the sales climate was “ challenging ” or “ tough . ”
But they also called it “ painful . ”
“ Every category is down , and it keeps going down , ” said analyst Don Brown of Irvine .
“ It ’s not the old , ‘ Let ’s get out there and sell more ’ that works anymore .
. . .
People just do n’t have the money . ”
Despite a federal stimulus that allows new bike buyers to write off the sales tax , companies are cutting staff and other expenses .
Last week , publicly held Harley - Davidson Inc. reported an 84 % drop in quarterly earnings to $ 26.5 million .
The company said it was getting out of the sport bike business , shutting down the longtime Buell line and selling its MV Agusta operation , a high - end Italian brand it bought last year .

Already this year , the Milwaukee manufacturer joined the likes of Honda , Kawasaki , Yamaha , Suzuki and Victory in laying off employees , reducing production and lowering prices to help dealers shrink swollen inventories .
Even high - end motorcycles have been hit .
Confederate Motor Co. , the Alabama maker of the $ 92,000 Wraith , expects to sell 30 bikes this year , down from 37 last year , company founder Matt Chambers said .
His affluent clients are n’t as affected by the economy , he said , but with the deep recession , “ it was very fashionable to not be buying a high - end luxury product like ours . ”
Many manufacturers have introduced programs to add value to their products .

Twice in the last year , for instance , Harley - Davidson operated a “ ride free ” program , which allowed buyers of new Sportsters to get credit for the original retail price of the bikes on trade - ins for more expensive models .
Yamaha Motor Co. introduced its Pro Yamaha initiative , directing dealers to be more informed about products and follow up with customers to ensure that they were happy .
Ducati North America , which has seen a 30 % quarterly drop in sales , began giving its customers one year of free scheduled maintenance .
And Victory Motorcycles , which suffered a 56 % decline in sales in the July - to - September period , began offering a five - year warranty to show “ significant confidence to buyers , ” said Mark Blackwell , Victory ’s vice president .
“ We have n’t laid everybody off .
We have n’t totally stopped advertising .
We ’ve kept up the product development because we ’re positioning this business for when the market stabilizes and grows , ” he said .
Blackwell predicted that the market would n’t begin to stabilize until at least next spring and that growth would n’t come until later .

Harley - Davidson and Victory Motorcycles , a division of Polaris in Minnesota , hope to stem U.S. losses , in part , by growing overseas sales .
Harley is pursuing emerging markets such as India and China ; Victory is going after Europe , where motorcycle sales have n’t fallen as much as in the U.S .
For 14 years , through 2006 , U.S. motorcycle sales had increased every year .
Sales started to drop in 2007 , but still topped the 1 - million mark .
Last year , as gasoline prices pushed toward $ 5 per gallon , fuel - efficient two - wheelers got a boost .
Despite the worsening economy , street bike sales were down only 3.3 % for the year , and scooters had their best year ever , posting a 41.5 % gain from the previous year , the Motorcycle Industry Council said .
“ Last year , with gas prices , we could sell scooters without a whole lot of work , ” said Kevin Andrews , Vespa ’s North American brand manager .
“ With the economy , we ’re talking about operational cost . ”
Advertisement
The cost of owning and operating a car , for instance , is $ 750 a month , Andrews said , citing American Automobile Assn. data .
But owning and operating a scooter costs less than $ 300 .
It ’s a message Vespa is promoting through advertising with its dealers and on its website .
Still , scooter sales are down 62 % through the first three quarters , but , he said , the declines slowed in August .
“ We had a period of constant increases , and I think the industry grew complacent , ” industry analyst Brown said .
“ Then the economy hit hard , and it ’s only gotten worse . ”
Confederate Motor ’s Chambers expects his sales to increase next year , thanks in part to a strategy most manufacturers are using : making lower - priced bikes .
Manufacturers also are coming up with ways to help buyers finance purchases .

Since April , Piaggio Group Americas , which sells Vespa scooters , has offered 7.9 % , 36 - month loans .
And Harley - Davidson Financial Services , aided by $ 300 million in notes placed with Warren Buffet ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. this year and a stronger financial market recently , should support any funding needs throughout 2010 , Harley spokesman Bob Klein said .
Most manufacturers , meantime , are scaling back on advertising , and long - standing enthusiast publications are finding the advertising climate “ harsh , ” with revenue down sharply , said Larry Little , senior vice president of Cycle World magazine .
“ Everybody ’s fighting for survival up and down the food chain . ”
Yamaha spokesman Bob Starr said his company had to be “ very focused on where , when , how and why we ’re advertising . ”
Yamaha experimented this year with low - cost viral marketing on the Internet .
This summer the company produced three YouTube videos featuring some of its biggest names in racing .
Each of the videos have been viewed more than 100,000 times .
Whether they sold any bikes is another issue .
Advertisement
“ Did somebody come in to a dealership and say , ‘ I saw this video . . . and it was so funny I ’m going to buy a bike ? ’
It ’s hard to say , ” Starr said .
Sport bike sales are down 51 % so far this year .
With the riding season over for much of the country , summer 2010 can’t come fast enough for the industry .

Two Metropolitan Police officers and a community officer lied to make a " better " case against a man arrested for cannabis possession , a court heard .
Sgt Marcus Garvey , of south - east London , Pc Wayne Campbell , of Kent , and PCSO Stefanie Loftus , of Essex , all deny perverting the course of justice .
The three officers claimed they found Benjamin Thacker carrying cannabis .
But a recording made by Mr Thacker during his arrest later prompted the arrest of the officers , jurors heard .
Prosecutors claim between them , the three officers created a " false picture " against someone they thought " no - one would believe " .
Sledgehammers Subsequently the Crown Prosecution Service decided Mr Thacker should stand trial .
It was only when a recording Mr Thacker had made in secret using a dictating machine was played to the court during his trial that the case was halted .
Southwark Crown Court heard Mr Garvey , 44 , of Abbey Wood , Mr Campbell , 41 , from Cliffe , and Miss Loftus , 23 , of Ilford , were then arrested .
He [ Mr Thacker ] is someone who these three officers thought did not matter , who these three officers thought no - one would believe
Claire Howell , prosecutor
They were charged with " doing acts tending or intended to pervert the course of public justice " between 25 January and 6 March last year .
Claire Howell , prosecuting , said : " The prosecution case is that three officers sledge - hammered their way in , dragged him outside , found cannabis in the building , arrested him for being in possession of it and lied saying it had been in his pocket . "
She told jurors it would be up to them to decide where the defendants found the drugs after breaking into the squat in Shepherd 's Bush , west London .
The officers are also accused of making false notes in their evidence and action books which led to Mr Thacker going on trial .
Ms Howell said : " He [ Mr Thacker ] is someone who these three officers thought did not matter , who these three officers thought no - one would believe . "
The trial continues .

SEATTLE 
When The Seattle Times became this city ’s only surviving daily newspaper in March , even The Times itself could not muster much optimism about its chances .
Frank A . Blethen , the publisher , said then that the demise of the rival Post - Intelligencer , known as The P - I , was no guarantee that his money - losing paper would make it .
In an article in March on Seattle ’s becoming “ a one - newspaper town , ” The Times asked , “ will it become a no - newspaper town ? ”
But less than five months later , a nearly forgotten word has crept back into Times executives ’ vocabulary : profit .
“ On a month - to - month basis , we are starting to operate in the black , ” Mr. Blethen , who is also chief executive of The Seattle Times Company , said in an interview last week .
How much black ink and by what measure , the privately held company will not say , and amid a sharp advertising downturn , no one denies that its situation remains precarious .
But The Times has improved its prospects by picking up most P - I subscribers and managing to keep them so far .
It says its daily circulation rose more than 30 percent , to more than 260,000 in June , from about 200,000 .

Find out how I became The Infamous Scribbler
Abstract
This paper describes how Prolog was used for the development of a new concurrent realtime symbolic programming language called Erlang .
Erlang was developed by first building a prototype in Prolog - the prototype was used by a user group to test their reactions to the language .
As time passed many features were added ( and removed ) from the interpreter and eventually the language reached a level of maturity where it was decided to try it out on a significant problem .
About 3 years and some 20,000 lines of Erlang later , performance became an issue - we wrote Prolog cross compilers from Erlang to various concurrent logic programing languages followed by a direct implementation of Erlang itself .
The direct implementation of Erlang was loosely based on the WAM and made by writing a Prolog compiler from Erlang to a new abstract machine and an emulator for the abstract machine in ' C ' .
The instruction set for the abstract machine was first prototyped in Prolog - finally the compiler was re-writ ...

Should there be a .gay Internet suffix ?
Two for - profit groups are pushing for one .
The Dot Gay Alliance ( dotgay.org ) , out of New York City , is being led by a longtime gay activist .
And dotGay ( dotgay.com ) is being spearheaded by a heterosexual German man in Riga , Latvia , who has incorporated a company in San Francisco .
In other words , there could be hotels.gay , provincetown.gay , match.gay and pride.gay
Web sites .
( Question :
What would the popular Web site gay.com have as its .gay counterpart ?
Gay.gay ?
Gaydotcom.gay ?
Or does it not get a .gay counterpart ? )
While both groups have left open the possibility of cooperating , they have n’t yet joined forces .
Both groups say they plan on starting the application process with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers , or Icann , to create top - level domains , akin to .com , .edu , .org and .net .
Icann , which coordinates the Internet naming system , has encouraged the creation of other dot - whatever top - level domains ( though only after an expensive application process that costs upwards of $ 400,000 ) .
Both groups will attend the Icann meeting in Seoul , South Korea , that is to start Monday .
The domain - registry business can be lucrative , potentially spinning off millions of dollars per year as each registered Internet site pays annual fees of $ 8 or so .
While neither group is nonprofit , both say they plan on funneling those funds toward supporting gay causes .
“ This could be a significant source of funding for organizations fighting , doing very good , important work , ” said Joe Dolce , founder and executive director of the Dot Gay Alliance , and a longtime gay activist .
Mr. Dolce said he got the idea for a .gay domain as a way to raise money when he was working with Minds and Machines , an Internet - domain consulting service that is helping with the creation of a .eco domain .
He was intrigued when Al Gore , the former vice president , said he would support .eco only if half the proceeds from the registration went to environmental groups , and thought that model could be applied to gay causes as well .
Since June , he has been working with the parent company of Minds and Machines , which will provide the financial backing for the expensive application process .
The plan is for 51 percent of the proceeds from domain registration to go to gay causes , he said .
“ It ’s a very novel way that does n’t involve putting your hand out , does n’t involve another benefit or charity function , ” said Mr. Dolce , 52 , who saw many of his friends die from AIDS in the 1980s .
He added : “ This is a community that has to sustain itself .
There was very little help from the outside world , very little help from the government . ”
The AIDS crisis galvanized the gay community , leading to the creation of groups like Gay Men ’s Health Crisis and Act Up , both in New York .
“ I think New York has trained an entire generation of people to be socially conscious and be activist , ” he said .
Among those is Paula Ettelbrick , a lawyer and longtime gay activist who is serving as a philanthropic adviser to the alliance .
Both the City Council speaker , Christine C. Quinn , and State Assemblyman Daniel J. O’Donnell , both Manhattan Democrats and openly gay , have written letters to support the Dot Gay Alliance .
In contrast , the chief executive of dotGay , Alexander Schubert , does not appear to have substantial local support .
He was born in Berlin but now lives in Riga .
He said he planned to move to San Francisco , where dotGay was incorporated , after he gets his visa sorted out .
Currently dotGay lists the address 799 Castro Street , San Francisco , which is the office of his lawyer .
Mr. Schubert declined to say where he was getting his financing , but he noted that more than half of the proceeds — perhaps as much as two - thirds — would go to gay causes .
As to why he chose the Bay Area over , say , New York , he said : “ I thought it was best done from San Francisco .
San Francisco is the gay capital of the world . ”
Mr. Schubert was the co-founder of a group which pushed for . berlin ( which inspired the .nyc campaign here ) .
That experience made him think more broadly about domain names .
“ All these years , I thought about the perfect top - level domain .
I came to the conclusion that it should be community like the gay community , ” he said .
“ I am personally not gay .
I am born and raised in Berlin , which is the gay capital of Europe . ”
But Mr. Dolce was troubled by the fact that dotGay was founded by a man who was not gay .
“ If you are launching a purely for - profit venture called dotGay and you are heterosexual , then you are in a way continuing a legacy of straight people earning a lot of money off of gay people that has gone on , ” he said .
“ I want to create a community which is run by the community and gives money back to the community . ”
And why .gay and not say , .lgbt — a commonly used short - hand term for “ lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ” ?
Mr. Dolce said one reason was that “ gay ” is an internationally recognized word , while the L.G.B.T. acronym differs across different languages .
Also , he added , “ gay is a nice three - letter word , which fits Internet naming convention . ”
President Obama did n't bring a Top 10 list to the just - completed taping of David Letterman 's show , but he did bring a couple of zingers .
When Letterman asked him about former president Jimmy Carter 's claim that racism is behind a lot of recent political attacks , Obama deadpanned : " It 's important to realize that I was actually black before the election . "
Which he won , if you 'll recall .
Said Obama : " The American people , I think , gave me this extraordinary honor .
That tells you a lot , I think , about where the country is at . "
Although Obama did n't bring a Top 10 list with him , Letterman had a special one ready .
The top reason Obama agreed to appear on Dave 's show -- drum roll , please -- is that he " wanted to congratulate Dave on the big Emmy win . "
Rim shot .
Letterman did n't win an Emmy , losing to talk show rival Jon Stewart .
The president 's chat with the veteran comedian - turned - talk show - host stayed serious for the most part , with discussions of tough subjects like war and health care .
But there were also some jokes and Letterman - style playfulness .
The show gave Obama a relaxed chance to discuss domestic policy before a four - day foreign policy stint with members of the United Nations and G - 20 .
Our friendly pooler Michael Shear of the Washington Post supplied us with these details .
The program airs tonight on CBS at 11:30 ET .
In discussing the high - volume arguments over health care and other proposals , Obama said the country gets " riled up " whenever a president wants to make big changes .
The president said he wants to make to make big changes because inadequate regulation led to near collapse of the financial system and the ongoing recession .
" People are just frustrated and angry right now , " Letterman said , because they have gotten " a raw deal . "
On a less serious note about another serious topic -- health care -- Letterman said that when he does n't feel good he goes to the CBS nurse .
Obama said everyone should have a nurse , but the problem is nearly 30 million people lack insurance .
In hitting familiar notes about his health care plan , Obama said many Americans are confused by misinformation from opponents .
" They 're scared of the devil they do n't know , " he said .
In a discussion of foreign policy , Obama said the military remains on pace to withdraw troops from Iraq , though " Afghanistan is a real difficult situation . "
Before sending any more U.S. troops , Obama said he wants to make sure a new Afghanistan strategy is worthy of the risks .
He said the main threat in Afghanistan remains " extremists who want to kill innocents . "
When Letterman asked the president about his daughters , Obama said they " bascially just goofed off during the summer , which I could n't do . "
" Others have , " Letterman cracked .
Obama said he worries a little about the pre-teen girls as they grow older in the glare of the White House .
" I suppose they are going to want to go on dates , " Obama said , " and I 'll have all these men with guns around .
At that point they may have some stress . "
Obama also spoke about job creation and his economic stimulus plan , and added that recovery " wo n't happen overnight . "
He also discussed " green buildings . "
In a studio notorious for heavy air conditioning , Obama also asked the crowd if they were cold .
During the opening monologue , Letterman joked that he had not seen Obama since the president invited him and Sarah Palin over " for a beer at the White House . "
( Letterman had a notable dust - up after a joke about the former vice presidential candidate 's daughter . )
There was also a gag about a woman in the audience who brought a heart - shaped potato ( which was later presented to the president , who joked that " the main reason I 'm here is I want to see that heart - shaped potato . " )
And here -- courtesy of Mr. Shear -- is the full Letterman Top 10 reasons Obama appeared on the show :
10 .
Heard the lady with the heart - shaped potato was gonna be here .
9 . Thought it would be fun to watch someone else get heckled .
8 . Something to do with that whole Cash For Clunkers deal .
7 . Every president since Teddy Roosevelt has done it .
6 . Someone offers you 600 bucks , you take it ladies and gentlemen .
5 . We told him Megan Fox would be here .
4 . Needed some time to hang out before check - in time at his hotel .
3 . I have no idea .
2 . Said yes , without thinking , like Bush did with Iraq .
1 . Wanted to congratulate Dave on the big Emmy win .
Before introducing Obama , Letterman put a presidential seal on his guest 's coffee mug -- upside down .
" I like the cup , " Obama said after he took the chair next to Dave 's desk .
The president received a standing ovation from the crowd at the Ed Sullivan Theater on Broadway , as Paul Schaffer 's band played a funky , drum - fueled Hail to The Chief .

General relativity , Einstein 's theory of gravity and spacetime , has been pretty successful over the years .
It 's passed numerous tests in the Solar System , scored a Nobel - worthy victory with the binary pulsar , and gets the right answer even when extrapolated back to the first one second after the Big Bang .
But no scientific theory is sacred .
Even though GR is both aesthetically compelling and an unquestioned empirical success , it 's our job as scientists to keep probing it in different ways .
Especially when it comes to astrophysics , where we need dark matter and dark energy to explain what we see , it makes sense to put Einstein to the most stringent tests we can devise .
So here is a new such test , courtesy of Rachel Bean of Cornell .
She combines a suite of cosmological data , especially measurements of weak gravitational lensing from the Hubble Space Telescope , to see whether GR correctly describes the behavior of large - scale structure in the universe .
And the surprising thing is -- it does n't .
At the 98 % confidence level , Rachel finds that general relativity is inconsistent with the data .
I 'm not sure why we have n't been reading about this in the science media or even on other blogs -- it 's certainly a newsworthy result .
Admittedly , the smart money is still that there is some tricky thing that has n't yet been noticed and Einstein will eventually come through the victor , but this is serious work by a respected cosmologist .
Either the result is wrong , and we should be working hard to find out why , or it 's right , and we 're on the cusp of a revolution .
Here is the abstract :
A weak lensing detection of a deviation from General Relativity on cosmic scales Authors : Rachel Bean Abstract :
We consider evidence for deviations from General Relativity ( GR ) in the growth of large scale structure , using two parameters , γ and η , to quantify the modification .
We consider the Integrated Sachs - Wolfe effect ( ISW ) in the WMAP Cosmic Microwave Background data , the cross-correlation between the ISW and galaxy distributions from 2MASS and SDSS surveys , and the weak lensing shear field from the Hubble Space Telescope 's COSMOS survey along with measurements of the cosmic expansion history .
We find current data , driven by the COSMOS weak lensing measurements , disfavors GR on cosmic scales , preferring η < 1 at 1 < z < 2 at the 98 % significance level .
Let 's see if we can't unpack the basic idea .
The real problem in testing GR in cosmology is that any particular kind of spacetime curvature can be a solution to Einstein 's theory -- all you need are the right sources of matter and energy .
So in order to do a real test , you need to have some confidence that you understand what is creating the gravitational field -- in the Solar System it 's the Sun and planets , in the binary pulsar it's two neutron stars , and in the early universe it 's radiation .
For large - scale structure things are a bit less clear -- there 's ordinary matter , and dark matter , and of course dark energy .
Nevertheless , even though there are some things we do n't know about dark matter and dark energy , there are some things we think we do know .
One of those things is that they do n't create any " anisotropic stress " -- basically , a force that pulls different sides of things in different directions .
Given that extremely reasonable assumption , GR makes a powerful prediction : there is a certain amount of curvature associated with space , and a certain amount of curvature associated with time , and those two things should be equal .
( The space - space and time - time potentials φ and ψ of Newtonian gauge , for you experts . )
The curvature of space tells you how meter sticks are distorted relative to each other as they move from place to place , while the curvature of time tells you how clocks at different locations seem to run at different rates .
The prediction that they are equal is testable : you can try to measure both forms of curvature and divide one by the other .
The parameter η in the abstract is the ratio of the space curvature to the time curvature ; if GR is right , the answer should be one .
There is a straightforward way , in principle , to measure these two types of curvature .
A slowly - moving object ( like a planet moving around the Sun ) is influenced by the curvature of time , but not by the curvature of space .
( That sounds backwards , but keep in mind that " slowly - moving " is equivalent to " moves more through time than through space , " so the curvature of time is more important . )
But light , which moves as fast as you can , is pushed around equally by the two types of curvature .
So all you have to do is , for example , compare the gravitational field felt by slowly - moving objects to that felt by a passing light ray .
GR predicts that they should , in a well - defined sense , be the same .
We 've done this in the Solar System , of course , and everything is fine .
But it 's always possible that some deviation from Einstein shows up at much larger distance and weaker gravitational fields than we have access to in our local neighborhood .
That 's basically what Rachel 's paper does , considering different measures of the statistical properties of large - scale structure and comparing them to the predictions of a phenomenological model of the gravitational field .
A crucial role is played by gravitational lensing , since that 's where the deflection of light comes in .
And here is the answer : the likelihood , given the data , for different values of 1/η , the ratio of the time curvature to the space curvature .
The GR prediction is at 1 , but the data show a pronounced peak between 3 and 4 , and strongly disfavor the GR prediction .
If both the data and the analysis are okay , there would be less than a 2 % chance of obtaining this result .
Not as good as 0.01 % , but still pretty good .
So what are we supposed to make of this ?
Do n't get me wrong : I 'm not ready to bet against Einstein , at least not yet .
Mostly my pro-Einstein prejudice comes from long experience trying to come up with alternative theories of gravity that are simultaneously logically sensible and observationally consistent ; it 's just very hard to do .
But more generally , good scientists naturally have a strong suspicion of any claimed observational result that purports to overthrow an extremely well - established theory .
That 's just common sense , not hidebound establishmentarianism ; most such anomalies eventually go away .
But that does n't mean that you ignoreanomalies ; you just treat them with caution .
In this case , there could be an unrecognized systematic error in the data set , or a subtle error in the analysis .
Given 1:1 odds , that 's certainly where the smart money would bet right now .
It 's also possible that the fault lies with dark matter or dark energy , not with gravity -- but it's hard to see how that could work , to be honest .
Happily , it 's an empirical question -- more data and more analysis will either reinforce the result , or make it go away .
After all , some anomalies turn out to be frighteningly real .
This one is worth taking seriously , to say the least .

MIT has publicly stiffed its main rival for the title of the best science university on earth .
That rival is the California Institute of Technology .
CalTech will forever play catch - up to MIT on - line .
It will be “ We , Too On- line University . ”
Students around the world can see for themselves that MIT has what it takes to be the best .
They can test drive the entire curriculum .
Top students all over the world still want to attend MIT .
They want a diploma that has MIT ’s name on it .
The free site does not reduce demand for an MIT diploma .
It increases it .
MIT has up - ended several millennia of higher education .
Let me explain .
THE NATURE OF THIS REVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT
For as long as there have been priesthoods , there has been formal classroom education .
The Egyptian priests had classrooms , lectures , and students taking notes .
The Jews had schools where bright young men came to learn the Hebrew texts and memorize the oral tradition , which began being written down in the second century A.D.
This oral tradition was written down centuries later : the Mishnah and the Talmud .
The Classical Greeks had academies .
Plato and Aristotle taught young men the rudiments of philosophy .
The Greeks also had medical schools .
These programs were closed to most outsiders .
A student had to be accepted .
He also had to pay .
In most cases , the information was secret .
The student was bound by an oath of secrecy .
Here are the opening words of the original Hippocratic Oath .
I swear by Apollo Physician and Asclepius and Hygieia and Panaceia and all the gods and goddesses , making them my witnesses , that I will fulfill according to my ability and judgment this oath and this covenant :
To hold him who has taught me this art as equal to my parents and to live my life in partnership with him , and if he is in need of money to give him a share of mine , and to regard his offspring as equal to my brothers in male lineage and to teach them this art — if they desire to learn it — without fee and covenant ; to give a share of precepts and oral instruction and all the other learning to my sons and to the sons of him who has instructed me and to pupils who have signed the covenant and have taken an oath according to the medical law , but no one else .
The training created a medical guild .
The guild functioned as an oligopoly .
It kept prices high by restricting access to the training .
This is what the college diploma has always done .
It has created a guild that restricts entry by non-certified people .
This keeps wages high .
To obtain the diploma , a person must pay money to the trainers .
The trainers are located at one center or special regional centers .
Journeying to the center adds costs .
Quitting a full - time job back home also adds to the expense .
Forcing students to attend pre-requisites adds to the cost .
Everything is done to screen access to the knowledge .
So , the knowledge does not spread .
This is the crucial function of the academic screening system , especially for practical knowledge : healing people and building things .
For the first time in the history of man , the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has opened the gates to all comers .
It has said , “ You wo n’t get certified by us , but you can get the classroom knowledge .
If you are smart enough to teach yourself , you will have the knowledge . ”
MIT has now removed the most important layers of bureaucracy : the layers associated with classroom instruction .
1 . The fee to obtain the training2 .
The cost of journeying to a training center3 .
The pre-requisite system4 .
The cost of quitting your job
This has de-mystified the entire guild procedure .
It says this : “ If you are smart enough , you can master the initial content . ”
This opens the door for the revival of the local apprenticeship system .
Here is where a student masters the non-textbook basics of a field , which are at least as important as the textbook content .
Think of a written account of how to tie a shoelace .
Then think of a parent ’s training : apprenticeship .
There is one remaining price barrier : the high cost of textbooks .
But Amazon , eBay , and the many on - line used book sellers let you buy older editions for $ 20 instead of $ 150 .
A textbook one edition behind is 99 % effective in every undergraduate major .
The gatekeeping function of the academic guild is now under assault by one of the supreme gatekeepers : MIT .
REMOVING BUREAUCRACY
The next step in the liberation of society is the introduction of certification by examination without diplomas .
There would no requirement to attend a school .
Just pass the exam .
This terrifies every guild .
Smart people could get in just by passing the guild ’s entry - level exam .
The ultimate breakthrough would be a requirement that every certified member of a guild would be required to pass the guild ’s entry exam every five years or else lose his official license to practice .
That would mean the end of exams that screen for wage reasons rather than for technical reasons .
The members would demand easier exams , so that they could pass .
More students would pass .
Wages would decline .
Finally , there would be a removal of state - chartered systems of professional licensing .
It would not be illegal to sell any services at any price .
Combine these , and the bureaucratization of society would end .
If you think , “ This is utopian , ” consider this : MIT has removed the crucial initial layer , which imposes the greatest financial burden .
A student in India who understands English and who has access to the Web can get an MIT education .
If other universities imitate MIT , the world of higher education will be radically changed for the better .
$ 120,000 DEGREES FROM PODUNK COLLEGE
Let me tell you a story I know first - hand .
It happened several years ago .
There is a tiny Christian college — then unaccredited — that has pretensions of being a first - rate Christian university for conservatives .
The librarian put a book by a certain historian on its shelves .
This scholar had written some unconventional books regarding certain controversial aspects of World War II .
This book was not one of them .
Some bonehead faculty member came to him and told him to remove this book .
He refused .
She then told the administration .
The librarian was ordered by the administration to remove the book , because a library - review committee was scheduled to visit the school .
This team could revoke the library ’s accreditation if certain kinds of books or authors with certain views were found on the shelves .
The librarian quit , as he should have .
The book was then removed .
The administration was bluffed by a bonehead faculty member into committing a preposterous assault on intellectual liberty — removing a book from the library — because of the administration ’s utter terror in the presence of a committee of librarians .
There was a day when Christians chose death by lions rather than capitulating to the State .
That day is long gone .
This is the confession of Christian higher education : “ Our government - accredited utmost for His highest . ”
Colleges are staffed by certified bureaucrats who have been trained by certified bureaucrats .
They grew up in the fear of committees , and this fear never leaves them .
The losers ?
The students and their parents , who spend $ 120,000 to earn a degree ( if the student graduates ) from a low - prestige school that provides a third - rate education .
In addition , the school raises another $ 15,000 a year per student from naïve donors who do n’t know how third - rate the place is .
There are accredited universities around the world that offer distance - learning programs where a student can earn a liberal arts degree at home in two or three years for $ 15,000 .
A student can pay his own way by working as an apprentice to a local businessman .
This way , he or she learns a trade .
But no .
The parents send them off to college for $ 30,000 a year ( after taxes ) .
Parents who send their children off to Podunk College are behind the technological curve .
First , about half of college freshmen do n’t graduate , even after six years .
Second , those who do graduate enter a job market in which only 20 % of graduates can find a non-minimum wage job .
The graduates are four to six years older , minimally educated , have no full - time work experience , and have forfeited four to six years of income .
I call this “ formally certified stupidity . ”
What would you call it ?
A college could easily provide free on - line guides to passing the Advanced Placement , CLEP , and DSST exams to quiz out of the first two years .
Total cost : under $ 2,000 for the exams .
That would save parents at least $ 60,000 .
The school would provide conservative guidelines for free on - line in PDF .
It would also provide free YouTube or Blip.tv video courses .
If the school were interested in educating people , it would do all this .
But Podunk College is interested in selling accredited degrees at above - market rates .
It is not interested in educating people .
This includes all of the “ dedicated to furthering God ’s kingdom ” colleges .
They are dedicated to furthering their little kingdoms at parents ’ expense .
If they are really worth the money , they should prove this for free on - line .
MIT has .
Why not them ?
Simple : because they are not worth the money .
They know it .
The parents do n’t know it .
The illusion must go on .
Could a college make its money by teaching upper division courses on - line for 25 % of today ’s tuition — $ 5,000 a year instead of $ 20,000 — with no room and board costs ?
Yes .
Will any of them do this ?
Of course not .
Why not ?
Because they are in debt up to their ears for educationally unnecessary real estate .
They adopted a technologically defunct model before the Web .
There is another reason .
If a school ’s curriculum were 100 % on - line for free , every parent , donor , and prospective student could judge the academic quality of the program .
There is no interest in doing this .
I think the administrators have a sense that their programs are not up to the standards of tax - funded universities .
Their problem is not lack of money and physical plant .
Education is about wisdom , self - discipline , highly motivational teachers , and perspective .
The problem for these schools is a lack of a distinctive Christian academic worldview .
If parents could see the classroom presentations , they might conclude that the academic content is essentially the same , the perspective is the same , and the cost is far higher than tax - funded education .
A prayer before each class is not worth an extra $ 80,000 .
Someday there will be a Christian college aimed at home school graduates that itself is 100 % on - line and priced accordingly .
In the meantime , parents and students have on - line alternatives for under $ 20,000 , total .
There are several universities that offer this , most notably Excelsior and Edison State .
Would a college lose its accreditation if it adopted such a program ?
Not if it played things smart .
It could enroll on - campus students whose parents are eager to spend extra money .
There are still lots of these parents .
Jennie Sue and Billy Bob want to get away from home at their parents ’ expense for four to six years .
They wheedle a free education by pleading a love of classroom education .
Peer pressure from other parents reinforce this .
“ What ?
Your kid is still at home ? ”
Would parents enroll their children at an unaccredited college ?
Maybe not .
They , too , grovel at the feet of accreditation committees .
But since the graduates of accredited schools can’t get decent jobs these days , of what economic value is accreditation ?
I am not talking about students who major in a natural science like engineering or chemistry .
But hardly any American students do .
I am talking about the standard , career - unrelated liberal arts degree .
WHAT DO PARENTS WANT ?
The sad fact is this : most parents do n’t care about education .
They care about accreditation .
The great German social scientist Max Weber commented on this just after World War I .
He wrote this :
If we hear from all sides demands for the introduction of a regulated curricula culminating in specialized examinations , the reason behind this is , of course , not a suddenly awakened ‘ thirst for education ’ , but rather a desire to limit the supply of candidates for these positions and to monopolize them for the holders of educational patents —
[ B] ureaucracy strives everywhere for the creation of a ‘ right to the office ’ by the establishment of regular disciplinary procedures and by elimination of the completely arbitrary disposition of the superior over the subordinate official .
The bureaucracy seeks to secure the official ’s position , his orderly advancement , and his provision for old age .
Parents seek union cards for their children .
But there are so many kids with union cards today that the advantage has disappeared .
What should a wise parent do ?
Keep the child home and away from the bureaucrats .
Get the child apprenticed to a local businessman .
Have the child quiz out of the entire B.A .
Add an incentive .
The child gets $ 50,000 in cash — or half the total cost of college — as a graduation present .
The child pays for his / her college education .
The parent saves a bundle , especially considering how many students drop out .
The child gets starting capital .
Use it for grad school .
Use it for starting a business .
Use it for down payments on a few repossessed houses .
Meanwhile , Podunk College gets nothing .
This is the way it ought to be until it offers something educationally unique and worth the extra money , or else offers its existing run -of - the mill program on - line for a third of the money that it charges today .
Private , campus - based , wildly overpriced colleges with undistinguished academic programs will survive , but only a handful of them will prosper .
They function today as expensive marital matchmaking services .
There are cheaper ways to marry off your children .
They can to use one of these on - line dating services .
To the parent who says , “ I do n’t want my child being certified by a state university like Edison State or Louisiana State , ” I respond : “ So , you prefer to pay $ 120,000 to a private college that gained its accreditation only by kissing the hindquarters of a state - licensed accreditation agency ? ”
There is stupidity and then there is financially suicidal stupidity .
Parents display both .
The older the child , the more suicidal the stupidity .
Under no circumstances — none — should a family or a student go into debt for college .
The average student graduates with $ 20,000 of debt .
This is suicidal .
When graduates marry , they are $ 40,000 in debt .
I offer lots of horror stories here :
CONCLUSION
The end of the high - priced university training system is in sight .
It may take a generation .
These schools are licensed agencies of the state .
They will not surrender without a fight .
But when the best science university in the world says “ Come and get it . . . free ! ” the other schools have a major problem for justifying secrecy .
This response — “ We offer a better program than MIT does ” — is not likely to be widely believed .
Any college that does not have all of its professors ’ classroom lectures on - line on YouTube or Vimeo or Blip.tv is saying , loud and clear , “ We do n’t want people to see how incompetent our faculty really is . ”
Any college that claims to be Christian but which assigns standard secular textbooks and does not publish on - line refutations of these textbooks is saying , loud and clear , “ We agree with the textbooks .
We charge parents $ 30,000 a year so their kids can have a prayer before every class — maybe — and a morally safe environment — maybe . ”
I call it Darwinism with prayers .
It is fraudulent .
It is corrupt .
It is widespread .
Parents , save your money .
Have your college - bound children stay at home and pay for their own educations by using AP / CLEP / DSST exams at $ 60 per course , plus on - line distance education at $ 100 to $ 125 per semester unit , plus local apprenticeship with a salary are the way for your children to pay for their own college educations .
This takes the risk out of the deal for you .
With a 50 % drop - out rate , there is huge risk .
If you say , “ My child is not smart enough or mature enough to learn on his own , ” then do not send him off to college .
Let him stay home and watch Animal House twice a day until he matures .

" WHERE WERE YOU IN APRIL ? "
Lauren Lollini was the first .
Not the first to be exposed , certainly , and probably not the first to get sick .
But she was the first patient to figure out that she had the virus and where it must have come from .
" I 'm one of the people who got the health department off their ass , " she says .
In February , the 41 - year - old mother had checked into Denver 's Rose Medical Center for kidney stone surgery .
The operation seemed to go well .
But six weeks later , Lollini began to experience a wave of alarming symptoms .
She felt exhausted and had no appetite .
At first she thought it was the flu or bronchitis , but that did n't explain the rest of it : dark urine , light stool , a kind of death - warmed - over sense that her body was in great distress .
Lollini lived alone with her fourteen - month - old daughter ; there was no other adult to comment on her daily deterioration .
She phoned the doctor who'd performed the surgery .
" Some office person told me that if I was n't in pain , I was probably okay , " she recalls .
On April Fool 's Day , after a week or so of feeling terrible , she went to an urgent - care clinic .
The medical assistant at the door took one look at her and asked , " Do you realize you 're jaundiced ? "
Lollini checked herself in a mirror .
Her skin was turning yellow .
So were the whites of her eyes .
She went straight from the clinic to Rose 's emergency room .
Her liver seemed inflamed , the doctor said .
Probably hepatitis .
Time for some bloodwork .
She left the ER terrified .
More doctors , more blood tests followed .
After a couple of days , they had a definite diagnosis : hepatitis C , a blood - borne virus that 's one of the leading causes of chronic liver disease .
Fewer than a third of those infected with hep C develop any immediate symptoms .
Some people " clear " the infection on their own and never know they had it ; others may have the virus for decades before it suddenly erupts .
But in severe cases , chronic hep C can lead to cirrhosis , liver cancer and organ failure .
The doctors bombarded Lollini with questions about her lifestyle .
The only way to get hepatitis C is through exposure to contaminated blood .
It 's not easily acquired through sexual contact , and blood transfusions have been screened for the virus since 1992 .
Consequently , most people diagnosed with hep C are intimately familiar with dirty needles — intravenous drug users , amateur tattoo enthusiasts , or both .
( It 's estimated that the virus has infected up to 40 percent of the population of U.S. prisons , where makeshift tattoo and drug needles are frequently shared . )
Another possible explanation is a needle - stick incident in a health - care setting .
Lollini did n't fit any of the profiles .
She believed the exposure had to be a result of her recent surgery .
The two doctors she consulted about the disease , both of whom were affiliated with Rose , were skeptical .
" It was very apparent that I did n't have any of the risk factors other than the surgery at Rose , " she says .
" But I kept hearing , ' Not Rose .
That 's such a great hospital . ' "
State health officials , who are notified of all cases of hepatitis C , were also baffled .
But Lollini insisted that the investigation should focus on the hospital .
" I knew that if I had gotten it , other people were probably getting infected , " she recalls .
" Something was going on .
It was n't until another person tested positive for hepatitis C , and they saw that we had surgery two days apart , that the investigation began to look more seriously at Rose . "
By early May , state investigators were poring over the hospital 's records of both surgeries .
After some delays involving blood tests , Rose officials were notified on June 2 of a hepatitis C investigation centering on the hospital 's operating rooms .
After more reviews of patient and employee files , the hunt focused on Kristen Diane Parker , a 26 - year - old OR scrub tech who 'd tested positive for hepatitis C — and had been fired in April for drug use .
Questioned by state health officials and Denver police , Parker admitted stealing fentanyl , a potent painkiller used in many surgical procedures .
She 'd swipe the syringe right off the cart in the operating room when the anesthesiologist 's back was turned , she said , substituting a syringe filled with saline .
Often the needle she put out for the patient was one she 'd already used on herself .
Parker had been suspended in April after being caught in an operating room where she did n't belong , then fired when she tested positive for fentanyl .
Two weeks later , she was hired at Audubon Surgery Center in Colorado Springs , where she continued to steal drugs and leave dirty needles for patients .
Parker told the detectives she could n't put a number to how many times she 'd done the switch since she 'd started at Rose last October .
Asked why she did it , she shrugged .
" I wish I knew , " she said .
" I 've had trouble with drugs in the past . "
Parker was arrested on June 30 .
She now faces dozens of federal counts of tampering with consumer products and " obtaining a controlled substance by deceit " — charges that neatly avoid having to prove that she knew she had hep C and was intentionally infecting others with the virus .
Two days later , Rose officials announced that the hospital would pay for blood tests for 4,700 patients who'd had surgery there between October and April and may have been exposed .
Audubon began notifying another 1,200 patients .
By early September , 75 patients of the two centers had tested positive for hepatitis C. Federal prosecutors say that 35 of those cases have the same genotype as Parker 's virus and probably came from her , though to date only one has been definitively linked by DNA tests .
When the news broke about how she had become infected , Lollini felt a sudden rush of rage and sadness .
She 'd been plagued for months by waves of anxiety , all the unanswered questions :
How did this happen ?
Is my daughter infected ?
What 's going to happen next ?
Why wo n't anyone tell me anything ?
" I was getting kind of resigned to the fact that nobody was ever going to be held accountable , that there would never be a name or a face to put to what happened to me , " she says .
" Then when all this came out , it was surreal .
It was a lot to try to understand at once . "
Two months later , patients are still trying to understand .
Much of their anger is directed at Parker , but they also have questioned the hospital 's policies and management .
They wonder how a heedless addict could operate so freely inside the hospital , stealing drugs — and possibly infecting patients — dozens of times over six months .
" They never came back to me until after the news broke , " says Lollini , who received a call from Rose 's chief nursing officer after Parker 's arrest hit the papers .
" She said , ' How are you ? '
I wanted to say , ' Where were you in April ? '
She said she'd be my chief point of contact with the hospital if I had questions .
But from my point of view , the damage had already been done . "
Rose has been hailed by hepatitis support groups as a " good corporate citizen " for pledging to pay for the treatment of patients who contracted the virus through Parker 's actions .
But some infected patients are critical of the way Rose notified them of test results and avoided their questions ; they accuse the hospital of being in a quasi-litigation mode , cautious in its offers of assistance .
Others who tested positive but were informed that their virus did n't come from Parker worry that they can't trust the testing procedure .
Even patients who tested negative say the process was more traumatic than it needed to be .
Rose officials maintain that their precautions concerning drugs and infection meet or exceed industry standards and that the hep C outbreak was an aberration involving a particularly determined rogue employee .
" Kristen Parker and people who divert drugs are pretty clever and look at how to work around the system , " says Lindy Garvin , vice president of patient quality and safety for HealthONE , Rose 's parent company .
" She figured out ways to get around what we think are very good policies . "
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , health - care - associated infectious diseases are one of the ten leading causes of death in the United States .
Most infections are n't spread by the kind of needle exchange in which Parker was involved , but the number of cases of hospital employees stealing powerful , injectable medications is on the rise — and so is the potential for more outbreaks like the ones at Rose and Audubon .
In June , a former nurse at Boulder Community Hospital pleaded guilty to five counts of tampering after stealing fifty vials of fentanyl over a period of months and substituting tap water and saline ; other recent , similar cases of drug thefts have occurred at Swedish Medical Center , Denver Health , St. Anthony and other area hospitals .
The confluence of drug diversion and patient - safety issues prompted the formation of a Colorado Hospital Association " medication security " task force and has administrators considering a range of changes in equipment and training , everything from tamper - resistant syringes to more intensive employee screening and monitoring .
" The system is definitely broken , " says Lollini , who still has the bill for the fentanyl she was supposed to receive during surgery .
" I paid $ 89.25 to get injected with hepatitis C. "
Lollini has become an outspoken advocate for improved patient safety and for hepatitis C research .
She agreed to have her full name published in this article in part to combat the stigma associated with the virus .
" Am I angry at Rose ?
Yeah , they fucked up , " she says .
" There are things they could have done to prevent this .
It was far too easy for Kristen to get her hands on those narcotics .
" But the question is , What have they done to change that ?
What are they doing to make sure this does n't happen again ?
If we do n't learn from this , we 're all stupid . "
" I ALWAYS WANTED TO WORK IN SURGERY "
Q. How do you think you were exposed to hep C ?
How did you get it ?
A. Probably in New Jersey .
When I was living in New Jersey .
Q. Just by living there ?
A . Well , I shared needles .
— Denver police interview with Kristen Parker , June 30 , 2009
At the end of Kristen Parker 's tearful , videotaped interview with Denver police , one of the detectives thanked her " for being honest with us . "
" It 's the least I could do now , " she replied , sobbing .
Yet several key statements Parker made to the detectives — such as when she started stealing drugs at Rose , and whether she knew she had hep C when she started work last October — are in conflict with evidence uncovered by the investigation or information from other sources .
The interview sheds less light on events at Rose than it does on Parker 's desire to be thought of as something other than a monster .
" I want to become normal again , " she told her interrogators .
" I know I 'm a good person . "
Many of Parker 's statements have been presented as fact in news coverage and even in the language of the indictment against her .
But that does n't make them true .
In some instances , she did n't even say what others claim she said .
The federal indictment says she admitted diverting drugs fifteen to twenty times , but that was a detective 's guess , not Parker 's — and , judging from the number of Rose surgery patients who 've tested positive for hepatitis with the 1b genotype , it 's a far too conservative estimate .
She told the police she started stealing fentanyl in January ; the suspected hep C infections of surgery patients started months earlier .
Through her attorney , Parker declined an interview request for this article .
But traces of a long and troubled drug history can be found in her police statement and court records , on her MySpace page ( " I have a crazy fascination with needles ... I just like the way they feel ! " ) and elsewhere .
She told the detectives that she'd had jaw surgery at age seven and that the experience " got the ball rolling , " giving her an appreciation for the wonder drugs she received to combat pain .
It may also have sparked an interest in a medical career .
Parker grew up in Houston .
She enrolled in nursing school but apparently found the requirements too daunting , and dropped out in favor of an eighteen - month certification as a surgical technician — someone who helps prepare operating rooms for surgery and cleans up afterward .
" I always wanted to work in surgery , " she told the police .
She began working as a scrub tech at a New York hospital in 2004 , followed by a stint back in Houston and then a move to Colorado last fall .
But the work was sporadic , with considerable downtime and personal turmoil between hospital jobs .
She waited tables in New Jersey and got into a bad car accident .
She was married , divorced , then gave birth to a son in 2007 .
She also shot heroin with friends , reportedly entered a methadone program at one point , and eventually discovered fentanyl , a synthetic opioid a hundred times stronger than morphine .
Often administered in a transdermal patch to control chronic pain , fentanyl is also extensively relied upon in surgery because of its fast - acting but short - lived effects when injected — which have made it a sought - after street drug , too .
Last summer , while living in New Jersey , Parker was back on heroin and sharing needles .
She may have been exposed to hepatitis C before that , but she told investigators she was unaware that she had the virus when she applied for work at Rose Medical Center .
As part of the screening process for new employees , she submitted blood for testing on October 9 , 2008 .
Eleven days later , on her first day of work , she met with Rose representatives to discuss the results .
Parker would later insist that she was told she " might " have hepatitis C : " They said , ' There are some numbers here that are a little higher than normal , you might want to get them checked out . '
The way they explained it , it was n't a pressing issue . "
HealthONE 's Garvin says there 's no ambiguity about Rose 's pre-employment blood screen :
You either test positive for hepatitis C or you do n't .
" I have never seen her file , but it's my understanding that she did test positive , " Garvin says .
" We were following industry standards .
Not all facilities do pre-screening tests for hepatitis and other infectious diseases , so I think we were actually above industry standards . "
Parker told police it was " in the back of my head " to follow up on the tests and see a physician at some point , but she did n't have health insurance and was focused on starting her new job .
Rose officials say she was referred to a free clinic and received standard precautions about managing the disease and not exposing others to risk .
The hospital could n't restrict her from OR work simply because she tested positive .
" There are potential discrimination issues if we keep someone out of a particular medical area , " says Rose spokeswoman Cara Harshberger .
It was Parker 's responsibility to drape instrument trays in the operating room , to assist in gowning and gloving the surgeons — in short , to maintain the sterile environment required for surgery .
She was not supposed to administer any medications .
At Rose , every OR has its own code - operated , automated drug dispensary , which keeps track of what drugs are used , by whom and when .
The anesthesiologist is the only one authorized to operate it , although nurses can also be sent to the pharmacist for additional meds .
Any drugs left over after the operation are supposed to be disposed of in front of witnesses , who sign off on forms that track every ounce of controlled substances .
But the elaborate system is chiefly effective in limiting access to drugs like fentanyl before the preparations for surgery begin .
The drug machine is n't designed to stop a diversion of drugs that occurs at the point of delivery , when whoever is supposed to be supervising turns away or leaves the room .
Such episodes take only a few seconds , but that was sufficient opportunity for Parker .
She carried a syringe loaded with 5 cc of saline — but labeled fentanyl — in her scrubs .
There were plenty of unlocked cabinets with needles and saline , and plenty of occasions when nobody was paying attention .
Not every shift , maybe , but often enough .
After shooting up a patient 's fentanyl , she frequently refilled the syringe with saline and used it to replace the next stolen needle , possibly because it was too much trouble to label a new one every time .
According to court records , the first instance of suspected hep C contamination of a surgery patient at Rose Medical Center occurred on October 22 , 2008 .
It was Kristen Parker 's second day on the job .
" THERE WAS NO EMPATHY "
Call her Ruth .
Like most of the Rose patients who had their pain medication replaced by pure anguish , she asked that her real name not be used .
This has not been her best year .
Already on disability because of health problems , including depression and migraine attacks , in March the 51 - year - old woman went for surgery at Rose to repair breast reconstruction following a bout with cancer .
She thought the operation went well .
But in July , a registered letter arrived from Rose , informing her that she might have been exposed to hepatitis C .
The letter urged her to arrange for a free blood test while assuring her that the test was simply a precaution ; most of the patients contacted probably were n't exposed at all , it said .
No big deal , Ruth figured .
She took the test .
Then weeks went by , and nobody called her with the results .
The waiting seemed interminable .
When someone finally did call , it turned out they were looking for another patient and had mixed up the phone numbers .
" At that point I was starting to get paranoid , " she says .
" Then , on July 27 , I got the phone call .
Two nurses on the phone .
The first thing they say is , ' How was your weekend ? '
Sweet , perky voices . "
The nurses told her they were putting Dr. Edward Septimus , an infectious - disease specialist , on the phone to explain her test results .
Ruth had never heard of him .
" How are you ? " Septimus asked .
" I do n't know , " Ruth replied , her voice shaking .
But she already knew the news was n't going to be good .
As soon as Septimus told her she had hepatitis C , she started crying .
It was five in the afternoon , too late to get in touch with her own doctor .
She did n't know the man on the phone .
She did n't want to talk to him .
And what he had to say just kept getting worse .
" He said my genotype is 1a , and it 's not related to the scrub nurse at Rose , " she recalls .
" I broke down again .
I could n't see how that was possible ....
There was no empathy .
I mainly got the sense that , ' This is the news , we 're delivering it , and because you 're not her genotype , we 're not going to take care of you . ' "
Ruth is one of the 47 patients from Rose and Audubon who have the hep C virus but are considered " not associated " with the infection spread by Parker .
There are six basic genetic strains , or genotypes , of the virus , numbered one through six , and several subcategories .
Unless the tests come back as genotype 1b , the same as Parker 's , health officials do n't count the case as part of the outbreak .
Patients and their attorneys have disputed that conclusion , questioning the testing methodology and Dr. Septimus 's role in the notification process .
Septimus , a much - quoted authority on swine flu and other infectious diseases , is the medical director of infection prevention for the Hospital Corporation of America , which has an ownership interest in HealthONE and Rose Medical Center .
" We wanted to be sure that patients had a physician who was an expert , so they could ask questions and be referred to their appropriate physician , " says HealthONE 's Garvin .
But Septimus has also served as a defense witness in medical malpractice cases , and several patients say they felt put on the defensive by his questions about past blood transfusions , tattoos , surgeries or other factors that might explain their virus .
The conversation confused Ruth , who found herself mentally reviewing five surgeries and various trips to the ER , worrying how she was going to tell her longtime boyfriend — and wondering if the doctor was trying to do damage control for the hospital .
" It was a horrible , horrible way to find out , " she says .
Ruth is in a peculiar limbo now .
She does n't think she can afford the expensive 48 - week interferon treatment regimen that is successful in roughly half of hep C cases .
The side effects of the medications can be serious , too , especially for someone already wrestling with depression .
She feels healthy at the moment — " I do n't have any symptoms .
All I have are nightmares , lots of crying and just feeling alone " — but she still does n't know how she got the virus .
Parker admitted taking needles home , she points out , and perhaps she shared them with others , leading to a different genotype in Ruth 's test result .
" I think I got it from Rose , " she says .
" I really do .
I had these other surgeries , but there was never any situation where people came out with hep C. "
Lisa Miller , the director of the disease - control division of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment , says the number of patients testing positive for hep C who were n't infected by Parker reflects what one would expect in the general population .
Approximately four million Americans have the virus — and half do n't know it yet .
" Those numbers are n't surprising , " Miller says of the test results .
" We estimate that 1.6 percent of the population is infected , so those numbers are in the ballpark . "
As for the theory that other genotypes were introduced by Parker sharing needles with other drug users ?
" There 's no evidence that occurred , " Miller says .
" That never came up in the investigation as a possibility . "
Even patients whose tests reveal the 1b genotype still face weeks of uncertainty before DNA testing at the Centers for Disease Control labs determines a definitive match with Parker 's virus .
" There are few labs that are able to do that kind of detailed genetic sequencing , " Miller explains .
" They 've made us aware from the beginning that it will take a long time . "
That adds another layer of uncertainty for patients like one 61 - year - old woman — call her Diane — who had two hip replacement surgeries at Rose while Parker worked there , doubling her chances in a lottery nobody wants to win .
Diane got the call from Dr. Septimus while sitting alone in the waiting room of her internist 's office : positive for hepatitis C , genotype 1b .
" He told me that my genotype matched hers , and they were going to do more viral testing that was going to take weeks or months , " she recalls .
" Then he asked me if I 'd ever had a blood transfusion .
I told him , ' No , but I had two surgeries at your hospital . '
I felt he was trying to put the onus back on me . "
Diane now faces difficult decisions about whether to undergo the interferon treatment , which could complicate an autoimmune condition she 's had for years .
She worries that Rose could renege on its promise to pay for her treatment if the DNA sequencing fails to establish that Parker was the source of the virus — even though she , like Ruth , has no other apparent risk factors for hepatitis C .
" I 'm afraid they 're going to say that if you do n't match 100 percent , they 're not going to cover it , " she says .
" What do you do if you 're halfway through this treatment and they say they 're not paying ?
There are so many unknowns , and I hate being in the middle of this quagmire .
I resent having to read between the lines and wonder what they 're really saying .
I want to deal with being healthy , not with the rest of this . "
She does n't think being angry at Parker helps her condition .
But she is willing to testify against her if needed .
" She changed my life , " she says , " and I think the hospital should have had better safety precautions in place .
I mean , ca n't you tell from the behavior of someone like her that she has problems ? "
" BE MORE AWARE OF WHAT YOU LEAVE LYING AROUND "
On March 23 , a Rose employee found Parker in an operating room to which she was not assigned .
As Parker brushed past her , the employee felt something prick her arm .
An uncapped syringe was sticking out of Parker 's scrubs .
Parker quickly dropped the needle into a sharps box .
The other employee complained , and Parker was suspended and required to take a drug test .
She passed the test and was back at work a week later .
Rose spokeswoman Harshberger and HealthONE 's Garvin say they can't provide any other details about the incident .
It 's not known whether the other employee was tested for possible infection or whether anyone tried to retrieve the needle to see if it contained anything .
Presumably the drug test would have included a screen for opiates such as fentanyl , but that 's not clear , either .
Scrub techs do n't administer intravenous drugs , but Garvin says Parker 's possession of a syringe would n't necessarily be suspicious , because techs sometimes use them to irrigate wounds or for other procedures .
Two weeks after she returned to work , Parker was again caught in an OR where she did n't belong .
She later claimed to have been looking for another employee to tell her about a car she 'd just bought , but her supervisors were n't buying the story .
She was suspended and required to submit another urine sample , which came back positive for fentanyl .
On April 22 , Rose terminated her by certified letter .
Parker tried unsuccessfully to resign before the test came back , but it did n't matter .
It took her only twelve days to find another job that gave her access to fentanyl .
Audubon Surgery Center snapped her up and honored her request not to contact her previous employer .
Parker 's firing from Rose triggered reports about suspected drug diversion to the Drug Enforcement Administration and state health and pharmacy officials .
But none of that information reached Audubon , where Parker continued her syringe - swapping ways until investigators caught up with her in late June .
And it took almost two months for state investigators to link a hep - C- positive , fired employee with the inexplicable outbreak of the virus among Rose surgery patients .
Two elements stand out about Parker 's story : the twisted recklessness of the scam she was pulling , and the inability of her employers to think like a dope fiend and anticipate or prevent the scam .
On Parker 's part , the brazenness took many forms .
She took fentanyl home , but she also shot up in a hospital bathroom on breaks , figuring it would help her back problems if she had a long OR session ahead , lugging heavy trays around .
Yet none of the trained physicians and nurses who worked with her detected signs of intensive opiate use .
" I guess you 'd say I knew my limit , " Parker boasted to the detectives .
" I did n't want to make it obvious to everyone that I was using . "
The police could n't understand why she reused the syringes , exposing others to hepatitis C .
There was no need , really — clean needles , like the saline she used to replace the fentanyl , were easy enough to come by .
Parker had several responses to this .
First , she did n't know she had hep C — or , to be more precise , she never bothered to confirm that she did .
" If I had known , it would have been different , " she said .
" I did n't know this was going to happen . "
She also gave a garbled answer about carrying two syringes around with her — one clean , one already used .
She did n't keep track of which one was the clean one when she did the swap .
It was just the luck of the draw as to who got what .
This is junkie logic , but entirely consistent with her complete indifference to the fact that she was depriving surgery patients of their pain medication even if she was n't infecting them .
" I always figured if they were in pain , [ the doctors ] would give them something to make the pain go away , " she explained .
Hospitals are complex systems .
As such , they are no match for single - minded addicts intent on getting high .
The high - tech , high - security dispensing machines that are supposed to prevent drug diversion come with sophisticated software designed to detect aberrant patterns of use — for example , if an unusual amount of lidocaine seems to be dispensed on Nurse Crackhead 's shift .
But Ashton Daigle , the Boulder Community Hospital nurse who copped enough fentanyl to treat a few hundred patients , managed to defeat the machine by filling a bogus order for pain medication , canceling it , then " returning " the fentanyl vial to inventory ; the machine did n't know that the vial now contained saline and tap water .
Parker 's game of switching needles on the med tray is even simpler .
Garvin says Rose Medical Center has been reviewing its patient safety and drug security measures in the wake of Parker 's arrest .
Administrators are considering expanding the use of tamper - resistant syringes ; they 're also training managers to recognize the sometimes subtle signs that an employee is diverting drugs .
It 's not out of the question , she admits , that they 'll tap other resources when employees are acting suspiciously — such as checking out their Facebook or MySpace pages for references to drug use or a fascination with needles .
" We 've lowered our threshold for triggering an investigation , " Garvin says .
" This was an exceptional case , but we need to better educate everyone who works in the facility regarding the behavior of people who divert .
Maybe all of health care needs to think about more education for physicians and staff to better understand that behavior .
It 's probably more widespread than any of us think . "
Near the end of her interview , the detectives asked Parker what the hospital could have done to stop her .
" Be more aware of what you leave lying around , " she said .
" A lot of times it would n't be available .
I could n't get it every shift . "
" I DON'T WANT TO FEEL LIKE A NUMBER "
Call her Pam .
Call him Justin .
They are patients with different outcomes but many of the same questions .
Pam had surgery at Rose in December .
The day the news about hepatitis C hit the papers , she called the hospital 's hotline .
After a long time on hold , she was given a series of conflicting answers about where she could get tested , how long the wait was going to be , when the results would be available .
She had trouble sleeping .
She went to one of the labs recommended by Rose and gave them her blood .
Then , because she did n't trust that the results would be timely or accurate , she paid for a second test with another lab .
She went online and found Parker 's MySpace page — the pictures of tattoos , the talk about needles .
She kept calling the hospital with more questions and got different answers .
" I called back and asked if Parker was working the day of my surgery , " Pam recalls .
" They said they could n't tell me , but they were putting some patient records online .
I called back the next day to ask if she 'd been tested for HIV .
The lady started explaining about HIPPA , and I said I felt I had the absolute right to know .
Finally , she asked her supervisor , then told me she was negative . "
After a few days , and much sooner than she expected , she got the test result : negative for hepatitis C. A huge relief , yes — but Pam still felt uneasy .
Did that mean she definitely was not exposed ?
Could she have been exposed and it just did n't take ?
No one could tell her if Parker was working that day , and she could n't shake the sense that she had been violated somehow .
" To me , it was n't just the hep C that was scary , " she says .
" It was thinking that I had shared a needle with a dirty individual , someone I would n't want to share a fork with .
That 's what grossed me out . "
Justin did n't have to deal with lingering uncertainties about whether he was exposed or not .
His test came back positive , genotype 1b .
And his is the first case in which the DNA sequencing tests have been completed , establishing with almost 100 percent certainty that his infection came from Kristen Parker .
Like Lauren Lollini , Justin found out he had the virus before anyone had heard of Parker .
He 'd gone to Rose for surgery in February .
He and his new girlfriend decided to get tested for STDs in May .
The test came back positive for hep C — which shocked the hell out of him , and did n't do much for his new romance , either .
Soon the health department was calling , asking him about tattoos and surgery .
Justin is twenty years old .
He recently left the Marine Corps , where they tested you for everything , and he knew he left with a clean bill of health .
He was studying to be an emergency medical technician and working with a local fire department when he found out that he had the disease , and that this scrub tech at Rose had given it to him .
" I was extremely pissed off , " he says .
" People like that should not be allowed to be around patients .
I 'm surprised someone did n't catch it sooner . "
He just started interferon treatments .
He expects many of his plans will be on hold for the next year , until the treatments and the potentially debilitating side effects — including fatigue , depression , irritability and lack of concentration , none of them conducive to EMT work — are over .
Despite being the only patient whose infection has been positively , unequivocally linked to Parker , he says Rose has n't exactly been reaching out to him .
" They did n't communicate all that well , " he says .
" They offered help if you needed it , but they did n't go into specifics .
The only recommendations I got were from the health department .
I 'm trying to fix it so I 'm not stuck with hepatitis for the rest of my life .
But everything 's coming out of my own pocket right now .
" Their plan seems to be to wait it out and see what happens .
I think that 's a bad way to take responsibility for it . "
Recent blood tests indicate that Justin 's viral load is increasing .
He 's not optimistic that he 's going to be one of the happy 20 percent who " clear " the virus on their own .
He knows there 's only a fifty - fifty chance that the interferon treatment will work .
He 's not even of drinking age yet , and he 's looking at a lifetime of having to be extra-careful about his diet and his liver , avoiding alcohol and certain foods .
He 's got doctors and researchers calling him up , wanting him to join this or that study , but he 's still adjusting to the idea of being a long - term patient .
" I do n't want to feel like a number , with all these people watching me , " he says .
The virus can affect people quite differently , notes Nancy Steinfurth , executive director of Hep C Connection , a national support group based in Denver .
Yet nearly everyone struggles at first with the fear that they will be perceived differently because of their positive status .
" It has a lot of stigma because the majority of the people who 've gotten hepatitis C have done so through drug use , " Steinfurth observes .
" But it also happens because of exposure in medical facilities more than most people realize .
This group did n't choose this .
They 're just caught in it . "
Not everyone chooses interferon treatment , Steinfurth adds , and there 's no right decision for everyone : " There are a lot of things people can do to improve their health without going through treatment .
Even if the treatment is successful , you still need to protect your liver and heal the damage — lots of fresh fruit and vegetables , losing weight if you 're obese .
I know someone who 's had hep C for forty years .
The treatment did n't work , but her lifestyle changes have led to great improvements . "
Lauren Lollini decided to become a subject in a long - term University of Colorado study of the virus .
She is hoping to play a part in unlocking the greater mysteries of hepatitis C — why some cases are acute , others chronic ; why some people clear it on their own ; why some respond to treatment and some do n't .
And maybe some day there will be a more reliable cure , even a vaccine , and fewer of the terrible unknowns now facing so many surgery patients caught in Kristen Parker 's vast carelessness .
" I 'm doing what I can to make myself better , " Lollini says , " and I 'm doing more advocacy work .
I guess you could say it 's less personal for me now . "
" New council members include Daniel Holbach ( Germany ) , Matthew East ( UK ) , Mike Basinger ( US ) , Benjamin Mako Hill ( US ) , Alan Pope ( UK ) and Richard Johnson ( US ) .

According to Shuttleworth , " the new community council takes office immediately " . "
Wow , that could be providing a helluva lot of healthcare .
Washington , D.C. – A campaign finance watchdog ’s analysis of insurance and HMO political contributions and lobbying expenses found the industries spent $ 126,430,438 over the first half of 2009 and $ 585,725,712 over the past two and a half years to influence public policy and elected officials .
The group , Public Campaign Action Fund , found that in the first part of 2009 , the industries were spending money at nearly a $ 700,000 a day clip to influence the political process and that the monthly pace of political spending this year has increased by nearly $ 400,000 over the average spent per month in the previous two years .
In addition to PAC contributions to our " public servants , " that 's funding 875 registered lobbyists for the insurance industry , and 920 for the HMOs .
Which really is hardly a drop in the bucket for the industry , when you take into consideration their CEO compensation , which ranges from $ 3 million to $ 24 million .
Nice to know what our premiums are paying for , huh ?
We could cut out the middleman here .
We could start giving all the money we 're spending on premiums directly to our representative and Senators .
Maybe then they 'd listen to us , the people who hired them , when it comes to vote .
Yeah , right .
One year ago , FreedomWorks astroturfer Dick Armey said the “ bubba vote ” would prevent the election of Barack Obama .
Here ’s the video :
after the election of Barack Obama , he set about encouraging exactly such prejudices .
He had plenty of material to work with .
In the context of a black president , terms like “ communist ” and “ socialist ” automatically come with racial baggage .
They play on the fear and loathing of racist minds .
Dick Armey added that “ Republicans would not encourage ” such prejudices .

In the context of a black president , terms like “ communist ” and “ socialist ” automatically come with racial baggage .
They play on the fear and loathing of racist minds .
The “ official story ” is that tea parties are a revolt against government taxation .
But the nexus of red-baiting , religious fervor , and racism has a long pedigree in American politics ; the clarion call of racist elements has been wrapped up in patriotic - religious fervor since the earliest days of Jim Crow :
The Civil Rights Era saw denunciations of Martin Luther King : “ race mixing is communism ” was a common refrain among reactionaries .
told everyone to bring ugly , racist signs to the “ tea parties ; ” but FreedomWorks certainly has n’t done anything to discourage people from bringing ugly , racist signs .
Indeed , a profusion of racist reactionaries showed up in Washington , DC Saturday , and nothing about them is unfamiliar to a student of American history .
Now , it ’s not that FreedomWorkseveryone to bring ugly , racist signs to the “ tea parties ; ” but FreedomWorks certainly has n’t done anything topeople from bringing ugly , racist signs .
Indeed , a profusion of racist reactionaries showed up in Washington , DC Saturday , and nothing about them is unfamiliar to a student of American history .
There is no way to deny that hatred of “ the other ” abounds in the tea party “ movement . ”
What ’s left unstated by most commentators , though , is that these tea parties are extensions of what we saw at Palin rallies last year .
It ’s the same disgusting racism re-organized .
Also instructive : FreedomWorks posts a few photos from tea party events at their website , but carefully selects photos to sanitize the racism :
wo n’t see on Michelle Malkin ’s HotAir.com :
That pattern reoccurs throughout the right - wing blogosphere .
Here are pictures from Saturday that yousee on Michelle Malkin ’s HotAir.com :
There ’s been a pattern of this ugliness throughout the tea party “ movement : ”
One of the most telling characteristics of the tea party crowds is the prominence of birthers — sore losers upset by the election of the first black president :
There ’s no way that FreedomWorks is unaware of the beast they ’ve summoned .
The grassroots of hate are loud , proud , and convinced of their righteous cause .
The entire “ tea party ” enterprise has been endorsed and driven by Fox News Channel , which has consistently engaged in racist fearmongering and contrived outrage .
Glenn Beck ’s “ secret army of Obama goons , ” for example , turns out to be a Kansas City step - dance troupe — but no one in the mainstream media , much less Fox , is fact - checking anymore .
The Minnesota nurse suspected of urging people via the Internet to commit suicide went to a hospital emergency room the day he was first questioned by police and told medical staff he was “ addicted ” to suicide chat rooms .
But William Melchert - Dinkel , of Faribault , did n’t just listen in on the conversations .
According to an order from the Minnesota Board of Nursing revoking his practical nurse license and made public Tuesday , Melchert - Dinkel , 47 , pretended to be a young female nurse and told people online that his professional experience gave him “ expert knowledge into the most effective ways of killing yourself . ”
As part of its June revocation order , the nursing board determined that Melchert - Dinkel “ aided suicide … by encouraging and advising individuals to commit suicide , ” in violation of Minnesota law .
Melchert - Dinkel has not been charged with a crime .
Reached at his home Tuesday , the married father of two said he has a new career .
He declined to comment on the nursing board findings , citing advice from his attorneys .
An 18 - year - old Canadian woman took her life after communicating online with Melchert - Dinkel , and a 32 - year - old Englishman also committed suicide after Internet chats later traced to Melchert - Dinkel , according to the nursing board order .
The Minnesota Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force is investigating the case , and “ investigators are consulting with various prosecuting authorities to determine the best venue for charges , ” said Sgt. Paul Schnell , St. Paul police spokesman .
A St. Paul police commander leads the task force .
Investigators have identified other online conversations Melchert - Dinkel was involved in , but Schnell said he would not discuss whether other people had committed suicide as a result because the investigation is continuing .
Police told the nursing board Melchert - Dinkel used false identities on the Internet and encouraged people to hang themselves .
He told them he was a 29 - year - old female nurse and watched individuals commit suicide via a webcam , the board ’s order said .
Melchert - Dinkel told police he did not watch any suicides .
In some cases , he made fake pacts with the alleged victims — some minors — writing in one e-mail : “ I can also die on Friday the 20th too !! …
I hope we can talk that day and go somewhat close to the same time if possible , ” according to an application for a search warrant for Melchert - Dinkel ’s computer .
He signed the e-mail , “… ** hugs ** and love … Cami . ”
The nursing board order included detailed information on two hospital visits by Melchert - Dinkel .
On Jan. 7 , Melchert - Dinkel went to an emergency room at a Faribault hospital , saying he was questioned that day by police “ for assisting suicide via the Internet over the past four years . ”
The next day , he was transferred to an Owatonna hospital , where an admissions assessment noted , “ 4 yrs suicide fetish offered medical advice for assisted suicide x2 … posed as 28 yo female formed suicide pacts with some that he had no attention ( sic ) of following thru… wanted to be caretaker or nurturer … feels worthless , guilty . ”
The nursing board documents cite serious problems in Melchert - Dinkel ’s work history going back 15 years .
Incidents of patient abuse or neglect of his duties occurred when Melchert - Dinkel worked at Ebenezer Luther Hall in 1994 , United Hospital in St. Paul in 1996 , Pleasant Manor in Faribault in 1997 and Lyngblomsten Care Center in St. Paul in 2002 .
While working at a Faribault nursing home from 2004 to 2008 , Melchert - Dinkel was issued disciplinary notices for :
Leaving a vulnerable resident unattended and unrestrained in the bathroom , causing the resident to fall .
Being too “ rough ” with residents .
Sleeping while on duty .
08 October 2009 Population Boom Set To Hit Coastal Areas
Revised estimates of Australia 's population growth over the next 40 years could have dire implications for Australia 's coastal communities , according to the National Sea Change Taskforce executive member Cr Debbie Blumel .
And Cr Blumel warns that taskforce research shows that further increases in the rate of population migration to coastal communities is unlikely to be socially , economically or environmentally sustainable .
" The revised Treasury projections indicate the national population will increase to 35 million by 2049 .
This is 7 million higher than previously thought and 13 million higher than the current population , " said Cr Blumel .
" The National Sea Change Taskforce represents non-metropolitan coastal councils around Australia and it has done the maths .
" After analysing the estimates , which were prepared by Federal Treasury , the Taskforce believes the increased population is most likely to head for coastal areas and has the potential to increase the size of coastal communities by up to 90 per cent .
" And let 's not forget that these communities are the most vulnerable to the environmental impacts of climate change .
" Our analysis shows that the capital cities are unlikely to be able to accommodate the population boom due to the effects of the drought on their water supplies and geographical constraints .
" At the same time , people are leaving inland Australia in droves .
There has been a population decline of 30 per cent from inland Australia in the past three years .
It is difficult to see how that can be reversed in the short - term as it is largely being driven by the drought .
" These new figures are a wake - up call for all of us .
It 's time to re-think our future .
" A 90 per cent population increase could devastate our fragile coastal environments and will not necessarily improve community health and well - being .
" We need to reflect on what sort of society we want .
If enough people say ' We 're interested in quality rather than quantity ' , and elect the sort of political representatives who are committed to social sustainability , then we can influence the likely course of events .
" That 's why I have moved a Notice of Motion for the Ordinary Meeting today suggesting that Sunshine Coast and Moreton Bay Councils work together with the National Sea Change Taskforce to play a leadership role by developing policy proposals to put to the Federal and state governments .
" These proposals would be aimed at reducing the impact of growth on coastal communities and would include , among other things , the issues of carrying capacity , the economic and social drivers of settlement patterns and the provision of social services and infrastructure .
" Let 's start with what 's important .
Planning to understand the carrying capacity of our region and to provide services associated with growth is a matter of great urgency and will require an entirely new collaborative approach by the three spheres of government . "
About the National Sea Change Taskforce
The National Sea Change Taskforce was established in 2004 as a national body to represent the interests of coastal councils and communities experiencing the effects of rapid population and tourism growth .
It currently has more than 60 member councils in all Australian states .

The Department of Justice has published a brief that argues why , according to the law , the $ 1.92 million fine applied to Jammie Thomas for illegally sharing 24 songs via Kazaa was constitutional .
In a nutshell : it 's a deterrent .
" The current damages range provides compensation for copyright owners because , , there exist situations in which actual damages are hard to quantify , " the DOJ 's lawyers wrote in a brief .
" Furthermore , in establishing that range , Congress took into account the need to deter millions of users of new media from infringing copyrights in an environment where many violators believe that they will go unnoticed .
" According to a 1999 amendment to the Copyright Act of 1976 , a violator is liable for up to $ 150,000 for each infringed work : in this case , the 24 songs that Thomas shared .
Again , Congress wrote , according to the DOJ : " Many computer users are either ignorant that copyright laws apply to Internet activity , or they simply believe that they will not be caught or prosecuted for their conduct .
Also , many infringers do not consider the current copyright infringement penalties a real threat and continue infringing , even after a copyright owner puts them on notice that their actions constitute infringement and that they should stop te activity or face legal action .
" So , as we all knew : the RIAA is sending a message .

This article is a reader contribution .
Our reader Neeraja Raghavan talks about her tryst with a wonderful Government officer , breaking the myth that everyone out there is inefficient .
Read on in her own words :
I was told by my auditor that IT returns of quite a high amount ( above Rs 25 K ) were due to me , from the filing of tax returns for the financial year 2007 - 2008 .
Although these had been filed before 31st July 2008 , and the returns are supposed to ‘ automatically ’ get credited into one ’s account after six months , my auditor told me : “ Madam !
This is the most corrupt department in the country !
The officer handling this told me he wants a 2 % cut . ”
“ Bribe ? ” I asked .
“ Yes , madam , ” was his answer .
“ I am not going to bribe , ” I replied .
“ Then , Madam , it will take more than 2 years , ” he replied .
I said ok , let it take as long as it takes , but I refused to bribe anyone .
Nevertheless , I filed a grievance on some website in December 2008 , when 6 months elapsed , but apart form getting a fancy and instant acknowledgement on the website with a registration no : , nothing further happened .
( Needless to say , every attempt of mine to get the name of the bribe seeking IT officer from my auditor failed utterly . )
Well , I had an eventful day about two months ago .
Hot as the afternoon was , I decided to invest some of my sleepy time at work , in telephoning the IT department .
So I went onto the Net and searched for every telephone no : there is for IT officers in Bangalore .
Promotion
From the lowest to the highest : that is my usual thumb rule in such cases .
So I patiently telephoned from the lowest rung in the ladder to the highest .
Firstly , every single number of the fifteen EPABX numbers rang off the hook , with no one even bothering to pick up the receiver .
Secondly , the PRO cell by some fortuitous chance , managed to tell me which ward / range my PAN number came under , so that helped in my further tracking .
Very knowledgeably , I then began asking for the IT officer in charge of my Range , if at all I was lucky enough to have a human voice answer me at the other end .
Now this went on and on from 2 to 3:30 pm , after which I was emboldened enough to go all the way upto the COMMISSIONER in charge of my Range , and listen to this : at 3:30 I was told by his peremptory secretary : “ He has gone for lunch and will be back at 4:30 pm .
No , I do n’t know his e-mail address . ”
I laughed : for if an officer goes for lunch saying he will return at 4:30 pm , you can be sure he will not return for the day , for do n’t all Government offices close at sharp 5 pm ?
Well , I made good use of the time between 3:30 and 4:30 pm , and managed to get the e-mail address of this commissioner , from his colleague , yet another commissioner in charge of yet another range / ward .
( Madam , I am sorry this does not fall under my jurisdiction …
OK sir , could you please tell me whose jurisdiction it does fall under ?
And would you be so kind as to give me his e-mail address ? )
I mopped the sweat off my brow and sent off an e-mail to the lunching Commissioner , and no sooner did the clock strike 4:30 pm than I called up his office .
Very reluctantly , his secretary handed him the telephone .
I explained my problem .
I took care to also add that all EPABX numbers were just ringing off their hooks , and since I could not reach the concerned officer , I was sorry but I had no option but to bother a high up person like him .
He not only listened to me patiently , he also asked me if I would be interested in exposing the officer who purportedly asked for a bribe ( to which I said sure , but since I only had my auditor ’s word without a name for it , I really had no authentic proof ) .
“ I am only doing my job ” he said when I thanked him for his work
Then he noted down all my contact numbers , and called me back within 15 minutes .
He explained that due to some new system of computerisation , there had been enormous delay in processing of 2007 - 8 returns , and I was amongst 80 % or more tax payers who were still waiting for the refund .
He said that despite this , since I had been inconvenienced to such a degree , he had arranged for my returns to be credited into my account right away .
( He also clarified that the bribe angle could not have much truth in it , as there were so many whose dues were pending , so my auditor could well have been voicing his won desire !
I agreed that this could well be the case . )
Further , he said the EPABX was indeed not responding as he had himself tried the telephone nos and found my experience to be his as well .
He said he was looking into this as well .
All this happened on that one day .
Now , I am not only in receipt of the full money ( with interest ) , my attempts to thank the concerned officer have met with embarassed brush offs !
“ I am only doing my job ! ” he said .
So there are good Government officers , too !
And it has been my good fortune to encounter one such !

Here 's a startling conclusion by Perry Drake of database marketing firm Drake Direct :
Facebook accounts for 25 % of U.S. online pageviews .
Perry 's analysis was prompted by a study showing that the figure in the U.K. is 1 in 7 .
He pulled some Compete charts and concluded that the number here is 1 in 4 .
Google , meanwhile , accounts for 1 in 12 pageviews ( 8 % ) .
And Facebook is rapidly closing in on Google in terms of visits and uniques .
Facebook 's power , in other words , continues to grow .
Perry Drake :
My research revealed some very interesting facts .
First of all let me say , that in the US , Facebook accounts for a significantly higher percent of our total page views than in the UK .
In the UK , Facebook accounts for 15 % of the total pageviews ( or 1 in 7 ) .
In the US Facebook accounts for , now get this , 1 in every 4 or 25 % of our total pageviews .
Unbelievable !
Google on the other hand accounts for only 8 % of the total pageviews ( or 1 in 12 ) .
See the figure below that I generated using data from compete.com .
Page Views : Google ( blue ) vs. Facebook ( green )
Is this surprising ?
Not really .
Facebook is , by design , much more engaging .
So we should expect this fact .
However , when we look at total number of visits to these two sites , we notice that Google does have an edge as the figure below shows .
But , surprisingly , that edge is quickly slipping away .
Ouch !
Visits : Google ( blue ) vs. Facebook ( green )
Even for the metric " monthly unique visitors , " we can see that Google is also losing its edge here as well .
Unique Monthly Visits : Google ( blue ) vs. Facebook ( green )
Do you think Google is a bit concerned ?
I would imagine so .

Following confirmation by the French military that they definitely were n’t in the process of invading Somalia , the United States military is now confirming that it is , in fact , American forces that are pouring into the southern portion of the country in a helicopter - backed invasion .
US military officials confirmed to the Associated Press today that forces from the US Joint Special Operations Command had invaded the lawless African nation , and were the ones responsible for the attack on the tiny village near Barawa this morning that was the first staging ground of the attack .
What the officials would n’t comment on was exactly why the United States , which launched a failed “ peacekeeping ” operation in the nation in 1993 and backed an Ethiopian invasion in 2007 , had decided to launch yet another foreign adventure , though media outlets speculated that it was probably something to do with al - Qaeda .
The United States has recently been supplying the self - described Somali “ government ” with “ tons of arms , ” according to the State Department .
Yet reports on the ground suggest that forces loyal to this faction , which only controls a handful of city blocks in the capital city of Mogadishu , have generally just sold the US - supplied weapons on the open market .
Though without any concrete information about what the American military actually intends to do in Somalia it will be difficult to speculate about the size and scope of the invasion , with roughly 200,000 soldiers committed to Iraq and Afghanistan ( and more escalations on the way in the later ) it seems hard to imagine the nation is looking to commit to yet another long - term occupation .

Businessman Dick Smith says a local anti-vaccination lobby group is misrepresenting the issue of immunisation .
Mr Smith has thrown financial support behind a campaign to boost vaccination levels in Australia .
He says vaccination is about risk management and the risks of an illness far outweigh that of the vaccination .
Mr Smith says the Bangalow - based Australian Vaccination Network distributes misinformation and presents itself as an authority .
" They are actually anti-vaccination and they should put on every bit of their material that they are anti-vaccination in great big words , " he said .
" They have every right for that belief but they should communicate it clearly so people are not misled . "
He says there are risks attached to everything in life but the risks of vaccination are small .
" I think they 're choosing not to vaccinate because they do n't understand risk management - they are told that there is a risk with vaccination - now everything in life has a risk , " he said .
" There 's a minute risk but it 's been proved all over the world that the advantages far outweigh the risk . "
The festival has Chinese origins and is held during the ninth lunar month of the Chinese calendar and is believed to cleanse the body

After bitterly contesting the case , a British oil trading giant has agreed to a multimillion - pound payout to settle a huge damages claim from thousands of Africans who fell ill from tonnes of toxic waste dumped illegally in one of the worst pollution incidents in decades , reports The Independent .
The Western world has shown remarkable tolerance towards economic / business / environmental / political criminals , while going berserk in response to crimes committed in the name of religion by militants / terrorists .
“ Trafigura , a London - based company which bills itself as one of the world ’s largest oil traders , said it was in talks to reach a ‘ global settlement ’ to the claim by 30,000 people from Ivory Coast , who brought Britain ’s largest - ever lawsuit after contaminated sludge from a tanker ship was fly - tipped under cover of darkness in August 2006 .
“ The incident caused at least 100,000 residents from the west African country ’s most populous city , Abidjan , to flood into hospitals and clinics complaining of breathing difficulties and sickness .
“ Investigations by the Ivorian authorities suggested that the deaths of at least 10 people were linked to the waste .
Trafigura has always insisted the foul - smelling slurry , dumped without its knowledge by a sub-contractor , could not have caused serious injury or illness .
“ The bitterly contested legal action has seen Trafigura repeatedly deploy one of Britain ’s most aggressive firms of lawyers to dispute reporting on the case by media outlets including the BBC .
Under the deal , thousands of Ivorians who suffered short - term illnesses , including vomiting , diarrhoea and breathing difficulties , receive a payout understood to be set at several hundred pounds .
“ But the settlement , which is likely to be confirmed by the end of this month , will mean that claims of more serious injuries caused by the waste – including miscarriages , still births and birth defects – will now not be tested in the £ 100 m court claim , which had been scheduled to start in London ’s High Court next month .
“ Trafigura , a privately - owned multinational which has 1,900 staff working in 42 offices around the world , last year claimed a turnover of $ 73bn ( £ 44bn ) .
The figure is double the entire GDP of Ivory Coast , where half the population of 21 million live on less than a dollar a day . ”

Trafigura company split off in 1993 from an even more controversial group , run by Marc Rich .
Rich was accused by the US of sanctions - busting to Iran and tax evasion , but was pardoned by the US president , Bill Clinton , in 2001 , reports The Guardian .
“ Trafigura ’s own name has been linked not only with Ivory Coast ’s toxic waste , but also with worldwide accusations of bribery , smuggling or improper waste disposal .
“ Saddam Hussein ’s Iraq was under international sanctions in 2001 when Trafigura was involved in the smuggling out of the country of 500,000 barrels of oil , according to the UN Volcker report .
Allegedly , a UN inspector was bribed by Iraq to turn a blind eye . ”

Guy Oulla , a mathematics professor , said he was unable to work for four months after a truckload of sludge was emptied into a dam near his house .
“ To me it smelled like rubber burning .
I began to shiver , and then began to throw up , before the stomach pain started . ”
He said he had spent hundreds of pounds on private medical treatment .
” We need to be told what was in the waste and how this is going to affect us in the future . ”

The West has been using Africa to dump its toxic waste for years and continues despite it having being illegal since 1992 .
In 1998 the EU implemented a ban on the exportation of hazardous waste from the West to the developing world , although the USA , Canada and New Zealand refused to sign .

Meanwhile , a latest news from the BBC reveals that a shipwreck that could contain nuclear waste is being investigated by authorities in Italy amid claims that it was deliberately sunk by the mafia .

We all know how service providers validate the identity of callers .
But , how do you validate the identity of the service provider on the other end of the telephone ?
In the area of computer security , the inexact challenge response mechanism is a useful way of validating identities ; a wrong answer and the response to a wrong answer tell a lot .
Service providers ( electricity , cable , wireless phone , POTS telephone , newspaper , banks , credit card companies ) are regularly faced with the challenge of identifying and validating the identity of the individual who has called customer service .
They have come up with elaborate schemes involving the last four digits of your social security number , your mailing address , your mother ’s maiden name , your date of birth and so on .
The risks associated with all of these have been discussed at great length elsewhere ; social security numbers are guessable ( see “ Predicting Social Security Numbers from Public Data ” , Acquisti and Gross ) , mailing addresses can be stolen , mother ’s maiden names can be obtained ( and in some Latin American countries your mother ’s maiden name is part of your name ) and people hand out their dates of birth on social networking sites without a problem !
So , apart from identity theft by someone guessing at your identity , we also have identity theft because people give out critical information about themselves .
Phishing attacks are well documented , and we have heard of the viruses that have spread based on fake parking tickets .
Privacy and Information Security experts caution you against giving out key information to strangers ; very sound advice .
But , how do you know who you are talking to ?
Consider these two examples of things that have happened to me .
1 . I receive a telephone call from a person who identifies himself as being an investment advisor from a financial services company where I have an account .
He informs me that I am eligible for a certain service that I am not utilizing and he would like to offer me that service .
I am interested in this service and I ask him to tell me more .
In order to tell me more , he asks me to verify my identity .
He wants the usual four things and I ask him to verify in some way that he is in fact who he claims to be .
With righteous indignation he informs me that he cannot reveal any account information until I can prove that I am who I claim to be .
Of course , that sets me off and I tell him that I would happily identify myself to be who he thinks I am , if he can identify that he is in fact who he claims to be .
Needless to say , he did not sell me the service that he wanted to .
2 . I call a service provider because I want to make some change to my account .
They have “ upgraded their systems ” and having looked up my account number and having “ matched my phone number to the account ” , the put me through to a real live person .
After discussing how we will make the change that I want , the person then asks me to provide my address .
Ok , now I wonder why that would be ?
Do n’t they have my address , surely they ’ve managed to send me a bill every month .
“ For your protection , we need to validate four pieces of information about you before we can proceed ” , I am told .
The four items are my address , my date of birth , the last four digits of my social security number and the “ name on the account ” .
Of course , I ask the nice person to validate something ( for example , tell me how much my last bill was ) before I proceed .
I am told that for my own protection , they can not do that .
Computer scientists have developed several techniques that provide “ challenge - response ” style authentication where both parties can convince themselves that they are who they claim to be .
For example , public - key / private - key encryption provides a simple way in which to do this .
Either party can generate a random string and provide it to the other asking the other to encrypt it using the key that they have .
The encrypted response is returned to the sender and that is sufficient to guarantee that the peer does in fact posses the appropriate “ token ” .
In the context of a service provider and a customer , there would be a mechanism for the service provider to verify that the “ alleged customer ” is in fact the customer who he or she claims to be but the customer also verifies that the provider is in fact the real thing .
The risks in the first scenario are absolutely obvious ; I recently received a text message ( vector ) that read
“ MsgID4_X6V…@v.w RTN FCU Alert : Your CARD has been DEACTIVATED .
Please contact us at 978-596-0795 to REACTIVATE your CARD .
CB : 978-596-0795 ”
A quick web search does in fact show that this is a phishing event .
Whether someone tracked that phone number down and find out if they are a poor unsuspecting victim or a perpetrator , I am not sure .
But , what does one do when in fact they receive an email or a phone call from a vendor with whom they have a relationship ?
One could contact a psychic to find out if it is authentic , like check the New England SEERs .
http://twitter.com/ILNorg/status/3786484194
http://twitter.com/NewEnglandSEERs RT @Lucy_Diamond 978-596-0795 do not return call on text .
Call police or your real bank .
Caution bank fraud .
Never give your pin to anyone RT @Lucy_Diamond Warning bank scam via cell phone text remember never give your pin number to anyone .
Your bank wo n’t ask you they know it
Agent :
For your security please verify some information about your account .
What is your account number Me : Provide my account number Agent :
Thank you , could you give me your passphrase ?
Me : ketchup Agent : Thank you .
Could you give me your mother ’s maiden name Me : Hoover Decker Agent :
Thank you .
and the last four digits of your SSN Me : 2004 Agent : Just one more thing , your date of birth please Me : February 14th 1942 Agent : Thank you Agent :
For your security please verify some information about your account .
What is your account number Me : Provide my account number Agent :
Thank you , could you give me your passphrase ?
Me : ketchup Agent :
That ’s not what I have on the account Me : Really , let me look for a second .
What about campbell ?
Agent :
No , that ’s not it either .
It looks like you chose something else , but similar .
Me : Oh , of course , Heinz58 .
Sorry about that Agent :
That ’s right , how about your mother ’s maiden name .
Me : Hoover Decker Agent :
No , that ’s not it .
Me : Sorry , Hoover Bissel Agent :
That ’s right .
And the last four of your social please Me : 2007 Agent : thank you , and the date of birth Me : Feb 29 , 1946 Agent :
Thank you
Agent :
For your security please verify some information about your account .
What is your account number Me : Provide my account number Agent :
Thank you , could you give me your passphrase ?

Thank you .
and the last four digits of your SSN Me : 2004 Agent : Just one more thing , your date of birth please Me : February 14th 1942 Agent :
Thank you .
Could you verify the address to which you would like us to ship the package .
( At this point , I ’m very puzzled and not really sure what is going on ) Me : Provided my real address ( say 10 Any Drive , Somecity , 34567 )
Agent : I ’m sorry , I do n’t see that address on the account , I have a different address .
Me : What address do you have ?
Agent : I have 14 Someother Drive , Anothercity , 36789 .
The address the agent provided was in fact a previous location where I had lived .
What has happened is that the cable company ( like many other companies these days ) has outsourced the fulfillment of the orders related to this service .
In reality , all they want is to verify that the account number and the address match !
How they had an old address , I can not imagine .
But , if the address had matched , they would have mailed a little package out to me ( it was at no charge anyway ) and no one would be any the wiser .
But , I hung up and called the cable company on the phone number on my bill and got the full fourth - degree .
And they wanted to talk to “ the account owner ” .
But , I had forgotten what I told them my SSN was …
Ironically , they went right along to the next question and later told me what the last four digits of my SSN were 🙂
Someone said they were interested in the security and privacy of my personal information ?
We people born on the 29th of February 1946 are very skeptical .
Recession in Britain 'at an end '
More workers are forecasting a better time ahead Confidence among business professionals has surged , suggesting the recession is at an end , a survey has said .
The Institute of Chartered Accountants ' index of business confidence rose to 4.8 at the end of June , from - 28.2 in March , the biggest rise for two years .
However , chief executive Michael Izza warned against " underestimating " the challenges ahead for businesses .
The institute predicts the UK economy will grow by 0.5 % in the third quarter of 2009 .
Its forecast comes after the economy shrank by 0.8 % in the second quarter of the year .
More than 1,000 chartered accountants were surveyed across England , Wales and Scotland .
Investor confidence about the UK economy also appears to be growing , with the UK's main FTSE 100 share index ending Monday trading at a 10 - month high of 4,896 , up 0.9 % on the day .
More optimism " This quarter 's Business Confidence Monitor suggests that the UK recession is at an end , " said Mr Izza .
Many are now more optimistic that the global recession is ending .
Japan , France and Germany have all recently emerged from recession in the second quarter between April and June , as have Asian economies like Thailand and Hong Kong .
US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke has also said that the US , the world 's largest economy , is approaching recovery .
While initial figures showed that neither the US or UK grew in the second quarter , many expect economic output to return to positive territory in the three months to September .
" The considerable stimulus from the easing of monetary and fiscal policy and the past depreciation of sterling should lead to a recovery in economic activity , " the Bank of England said earlier this month .
' Challenge '
The confidence survey said that 41 % of senior professionals were more confident about their business prospects in the next year , but only 6 % were much more confident , indicating that some caution remains .
The banking sector saw a big rise in confidence " While there is no doubt that the UK economy is on its way to recovery , we should n't underestimate the challenges ahead for businesses , " said Mr Izza .
IT was the most optimistic sector , followed by banking , finance and insurance .
The institute said the banking sector in particular had shown " a remarkable upturn given the turmoil of the last two years " .
The least confident professions were health and education , as fears of cuts in the public sector grow .
Reservations Policymakers have been wary of stoking expectations that the UK 's economic woes are over .
" The pace of recovery over the next few years is highly uncertain , " said Bank Governor Mervyn King .
The Bank surprised the financial markets by injecting £ 50bn of new money into the economy earlier this month , more than the £ 25 bn that had been expected .
The move , which took the total to £ 175bn , is viewed as a sign of how divided the Bank committee members that set interests rates are over the recovery in the UK economy .
In addition , the number of jobless in the UK is now at its highest level since 1995 , with 2.4 million people out of work .

Evan Dorkin and Jill Thompson hit the town with " Beasts of Burden " from Dark Horse Comics this week , a four - issue expansion of their Eisner - winning short story about a ragtag band of animals hell - bent on protecting Burden Hill from occult forces .
Could this housebroken band of brothers join the pantheon of great heroic animals in comics ?
Maybe .
Before we knit them a cute hero sweater , though , let 's take a look at some of the bravest animals in comics .
Who got the bad guy ?
Who got the bad guy ?
You did !
You did !
Comet the Super Horse
When choosing a member of the Legion of Super - Pets , the knee - jerk is to pick Krypto or Streaky , with Beppo being reserved for those who think they 're too badass and non-conformist for the rest of us ( they 're not ) .
But one word sets Comet above the rest : trample .
Regular horses can kick and stomp strong enough to turn Craig Venter into Lenny from " Of Mice and Men . "
Think about how powerful Comet 's kick has to be , and the jagged shower of bone fragments and face jelly spewing forth from whatever goop remains of any bad guy 's face .
Supergirl should enter every battle with one objective : get villain to spook Comet .
If Superman is powerful enough to reverse the Earth 's orbit , Comet certainly has the strength to maim and retard at least a continent .
Bandit , Tinker , and Pirate from We3
These poor animals from " We3 " have been cybernetically - augmented with razor blades , projectile weapons , and high - yield explosives .
Despite all that destructive power , that which sets them apart from other super - pets is their freakish ability to choke up their enemies .
Super - expressive eyes and sad , simple dialogue attack the emotion centers like a swarm of ants devouring a lollipop , teasing out wave after wave of tears , blinding their hapless , sobbing victim .
Snf .
Ch'p
You might think it a stupid idea to give a chipmunk a power ring .
You are correct .
Ch'p hails from H'lven , a planet in space sector 1014 populated by creatures with remarkable resemblances to Earth rodents .
Despite his diminutive stature , insatiable desire to gorge on birdfeeders , and severe case of storage pouch envy , Ch'p proved himself a mighty warrior and good friend during his tenure as Green Lantern .
Until he was run over by a yellow tractor - trailer .
Beats being eaten by a golden wolf .
I think .
Rocket Raccoon
Up there in the black hills of Halfword lived a young law officer name Rocket Raccoon , Judson Jakes stole the Halfword Bible , hit young Rocket in the eye , Rocket did n't like that , said " I 'm gonna get that boy . "
So he and the Hulk went go for broke , something something rocket skates , he must be riddled with intergalactic parasites , in space no one can hear you knock over garbage cans , harmonica , and then they found " Gideon 's Bible , " end on G7 to open C .
The story of Rocket , da dah .
Go remasters !
Ace the Bat - Hound
The original Ace was a German Shepherd , a proud , noble dog capable of sniffing out burglars and ripping out a man 's throat .
Post - Crisis ,
Ace was emasculated into a beagle - pug crossbreed : a " puggle . "
Now look here , DC Entertainment .
There is nothing more disheartening than seeing a proud creature reduced to a four - legged joke , a thirty - pound poop machine capable of nothing more than five minutes of rowdy time and a permanently cute expression on its face .
If there remains any justice in this foul , broken tooth of a world , when Batman returns from Cavetime , the real Ace will be waiting for him , mask on and returned to his rightful German Shepherd self , no matter what the odds that his ancestors tortured a few Jews .
That 's not on him .
Like most things , it comes down to the looming Apocalypse : post - Rapture , a German Shepherd is a skilled hunter , loyal protector , and trusted friend .
After Armaggeddon , all a puggle is good for is dinner .
I bet they taste adorable .
Lockjaw
It 's no wonder this fella will be got his own miniseries , " Lockjaw and the Pet Avengers . "
Named after tetanus , endowed with the ability the teleport pretty much anywhere , and , thanks to the tuning fork implanted in his skull , blessed with perfect pitch , LJ is clearly the coolest canine to roam the Marvel Universe .
At what must be 350 pounds of slobber and muscle , it 's never been easier to your " Terrigen Mists " on the dog .
Here 's what people are going to remember about Brutal Legend : Jack Black as Eddie Riggs .
This is n't a star showing up and talking into a microphone for a bullet point on the back of the box and a nice paycheck on the way out of the studio , this is a performance with real heart .
Black introduces the game in a quick video when you first place the disc in , and he 's been working publicity for the title like a champ — all these things add up to make his vocal work one of the high points of the game .
Of course , when you 're speaking the words of the now - legendary Tim Schafer , the mind behind the dialog in games like Full Throttle , Grim Fandango , and Psychonauts , it helps .
This is a man who wrote a game that 's a love letter to heavy metal music ; it 's no surprise he and Jack Black were such a tight fit when it came to making the game as fun to listen to and watch as it is .
The problem is that the game simply is n't very fun to play .
Title Brutal Legend Developer Double Fine Publisher EA Price $ 59.99 Shop.ars Platform PS3 , Xbox 360 ( Reviewed )
The introduction to the game , what you played in the demo , remains fun and funny , not to mention attractive .
When the demo cuts off and the game proper begins , problems pop up immediately .
The frame rate is inconsistent , with frequent stutters , drops , and pauses , and texture pop-in is something you 'll see often .
What 's frustrating is that these issues are constant , and do n't seem to match up with anything that 's on your screen ; even during slow scenes with nothing taxing going on , you 'll see these glitches and hiccups .
It seems like EA had marketing budget to spare , so why not spend the time and money to make sure the game ran smoothly ?
There is nothing special about the graphics of Brutal Legend that would explain these technical problems .
The art direction is great , but the current - generation systems should hardly be taxed by what 's happening on screen .
The fundamentals are n't there
The combat is a combination of using your ax for close battles and your guitar for ranged attacks , and the fighting never feels very precise or satisfying .
In many instances you 'll be fighting alongside your own troops , and the enemy will be nothing but a slightly different - colored version of the same character model , so it 's hard to tell friend from foe .
Sadly , in those cases it 's easiest just to go in swinging ; your friends wo n't react to being hit , and even if you slam into them with your car they simply become immovable objects .
The game features an interesting real - time strategy mechanic for large - scale battles .
Your team constructs a stage , and you " harvest " fans by playing a guitar solo over geysers of what look to be souls from the underground .
Once you 've played the solo and set up your " merch booth " you can select your units and lead them into battle .
It 's a good idea , but in practice the controls for moving your troops and organizing your strategy are imprecise .
It 's often better to simply wade in with Eddie and take out as many enemies as you can before dying .
When you are overtaken , the " fans " simply lift you up and you 're back in the action .
This RTS - lite idea also makes up the game 's single - player , and once again , it 's simply not a very satisfying mechanic .
Instead of mediocre standard combat mixed with a mediocre real - time strategy game , a deeper focus on one or the other would have served the game much better .
This feels more like an experiment that did n't quite live up to its promise .
The rest of the game is filled with " go there and kill these guys " or " go there , kill this boss , and get this and bring it back to me " types of missions .
The side missions that allow you to gain fire offerings to upgrade your car and weapons fall victim to repetition : there are only a few types of repeating missions , and they get old quickly .
Driving around and exploring the land is fun— especially once you gain the ability to set up your own playlist of the over 100 metal songs , all expertly picked — but the graphics of the overworld can be seriously bland .
Even with exploration and leveling up your equipment , the main story will be over a little too quickly .
It 's not all bad
The art direction is great , and the story itself is just about enough to keep you interested in the game until you see the credits .
It helps that the rest of the voice talent is made up of some of heavy music 's biggest names .
Here 's my question : how the hell did they get Ozzy to sound so clear and engaged ?
This is a man who mumbles his way through life , and his voice work is one of the many high points when it comes to the game 's list of characters and cameos .
He sounds world - weary but also spry and rowdy .
It 's either a magic trick , or some great post - processing work .
This is a game that 's going to sell very well , and our disappointment may have come from our high expectations .
There is much to like here , but the things that matter , the gameplay and the action , simply do n't stand up .
Metal fans are in for a treat : this is a game written by someone who understands and loves the music , but gamers may be left cold by the experience .
A great concept , an intriguing world , wonderful writing , brilliant voice acting — but half - baked gameplay , graphics , and technology .
It could have been worse , but man , it could have been a whole hell of a lot better .
Verdict : Rent
I am the almighty !
Fear the fuzzy !
Fear it !

David Bass is known in Washington as an accomplished PR executive and TV commentator , a man with an impressive Rolodex and a fixture on the D.C. social scene .
Or at least he was until Thursday , when word spread through town that Bass had been charged with a federal felony for loutish behavior on a Continental Airlines flight from Houston to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport .
An FBI agent and a couple of flight attendants say in court documents that Bass seemed drunk on the flight , disobeying instructions from the crew , climbing over another passenger to get to the overhead luggage bin , making “ mean faces ” and generally “ upsetting everyone in first class . ”
Bass says he was tired , “ out of it ” on allergy medication and does n’t even know what a “ mean face ” is .
And his friends say that the allegations against him — punishable by as much as 20 years in federal prison — do n’t sound like Bass at all .
“ It runs contrary to my 20 years of knowing him to hear his behavior described as ‘ aggressive ’ or ‘ confrontational , ’ ” said Nick Swezey , advertising director at the Weekly Standard , where Bass was formerly the deputy publisher .
Added Weekly Standard writer Matt Labash : “ Bass is proclaiming his innocence because he thinks he is .
...
Obviously , everybody takes any airplane shenanigans very seriously these days .
But threatening a guy with 20 years in jail because you do n’t like his facial expressions when you deny him service seems a bit extreme . ”
In an interview with POLITICO on Thursday , Bass said , “ The last thing I would ever be is a threat to anyone on a plane . ”
He said his PR clients “ know me better than this .
[ My friends ] would probably say , ‘ Bass was joking a little more than he should have been . ’ ”
And indeed , Bass has an established reputation in Washington as a hale fellow well met .
“ If there ’s a big event and he ’s not there , everyone knows he must be out of town , ” said Potomac Strategy Group political consultant Matt Mackowiak , a friend .
“ I ’m worried for him .
This is a terrible situation .
It does n’t sound like him . ”
As first reported by the Washington Examiner , Bass is charged with violating a federal law that prohibits “ assaulting or intimidating a flight crew member or flight attendant of the aircraft , interferes with the performance of the duties of the member or attendant or lessens the ability of the member or attendant to perform those duties , or attempts or conspires to do such an act . ”
“ Almost anything people see or do that appears hostile could become a federal offense , ” said Kate Hanni , director of the Coalition for Airline Passengers ’ Rights .
“ People really need to understand that they have to have a certain level of behavior on an aircraft . ”
According to an FBI affidavit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia , a flight attendant “ stated that Bass refused to obey the instructions issued by the flight attendants and ‘ disrupted everyone ’ in as much as he entered the aircraft ’s galley several times and crawled over the person seated next to him in order to access the overhead storage compartments and the aircraft ’s lavatory .
[ The flight attendant ] said that Bass ’s behavior was so disruptive that [ she ] moved the passenger seated next to Bass to a different seat . ”
Bass was questioned at the airport and subsequently charged with the federal crime .
He appeared in court Tuesday and was allowed to remain free pending his next court date Oct. 27 .
Bass told POLITICO that he had been in Honduras on a business trip and had n’t slept for three days before boarding Friday ’s flight .
He also said that he ’d taken Benadryl for an allergic reaction .
“ I was extremely sleep deprived , ” he said .
“ I have a bad history of traveling south . ”
But once on the plane , he said he did n’t see any reason why he should n’t be served a glass of wine .
The flight attendants disagreed ; in statements filed with the court , they said they decided among themselves that Bass should not be served alcohol on the flight .
And while the FBI affidavit said that Bass had assumed an “ aggressive posture ” with police at the airport , Bass said the incident was not confrontational at all .
“ The officers were actually very nice .
I had been joking a little bit , talking to them , ” he said .
“ It did n’t seem like reality to me . ”
Bass said he offered to take a blood - alcohol test when he got off the plane , but he said the officers declined .
Bass recently served as vice president and chief development officer at the public relations firm Luntz , Maslansky Strategic Research and also worked at Qorvis Communications .
While at Qorvis , he provided some consulting services for POLITICO ’s parent company , Allbritton Communications , during the publication ’s start - up phase , and he has managed local political campaigns , ballot initiatives and other government affairs campaigns .
He got his start in Washington as a Senate legislative intern on Capitol Hill .
Bass recently founded Raptor Strategies , a public relations firm with energy , media and insurance clients .
The firm ’s slogan : “ New times demand new strategies . ”

Oh no !
Hopefully the same folks who went nuts over the Bigfoot on Mars do n’t see this one !
Could there really be a dragon on Mars ?
Relax , its just a shadow from Opportunity ’s camera mast , distorted by the unusual and bumpy fusion crust surface of the Shelter Island meteorite that the Mars rover has been studying the past few days .
But it seems rather fitting : “ Here Be Dragons ” is a phrase used to denote unexplored territories , and that is certainly where Oppy and Spirit are in their explorations of Mars .
Thanks to Stu Atkinson for the colorized version of this rover image .
Hey there , time traveller !

WASHINGTON -- Scientists are beginning a large - scale effort to identify and analyze the vast majority of cells in or on your body that are n't of human origin .
Only about 10 per cent of the trillions of cells that make up a person are truly human , researchers say .
The other 90 per cent are bacteria , viruses and other microbes swarming in your gut and on your skin .
" We really are a superorganism , " Brett Finlay , a microbiologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver , said in an email .
" From the moment we are born until we die , we live in a symbiotic relationship with our microbes . "
" At birth , babies emerge from a sterile environment into one that is laden with microbes , " said Laurie Comstock , a microbiologist at Harvard Medical School in Boston .
" The infant 's intestines then rapidly become home to one of the densest populations of bacteria on Earth . "
Most of these microbes are harmless , researchers say .
Many are necessary to life and health .
A troublesome minority , however , can cause everything from teenage acne and obesity to autism and cancer .
The National Institutes of Health has launched a $ 115 - million , five - year project to identify , analyze and catalog hundreds of microbial species resident in or on the human body .
Called the Human Microbiome Project , it 's modelled after the Human Genome Project , which decoded most of the human genes in the 1990s .
The first 35 microbiome research grants took effect this summer .
" The composition of the complex microbial communities inhabiting the human body has a tremendous influence on human health and disease , " said Richard Gibbs , a leading human genome researcher at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston .
Gibbs received a grant to sequence the genes of 400 bacterial strains by 2011 .
The goal of the microbiome project , which is international in scope , is to identify which microbes are harmful and to figure out ways to prevent or treat diseases they cause .
It 's a bewildering task , because scientists estimate there are about 1,000 different species of microbes living in the human gut and about as many more separate species on human skin .
The microbes form tiny colonies of bacteria that settle in different areas of the body .
Jeffrey Gordon , a microbiologist at the University of Washington in St. Louis , likened them to " ecosystems , " similar to those that plants and animals form on islands on Earth .
The most popular site for human skin microbes , surprisingly , is the forearm , which is home to 44 different microbial species , according to a recent study by Julia Segre , a microbiologist at the National Human Genome Research Institute in Bethesda , Md . The most barren region is behind the ear , where only 15 species typically settle , she reported in the journal Science last May .
" Hairy moist underarms lie a short distance from dry forearms , but these two niches are as ecologically dissimilar as rainforests are to deserts , " Segre said .
Different tribes of microbes are associated with different maladies .
For example , bacteria associated with the skin disease psoriasis favour the outer elbow , Segre reported .
Eczema bugs prefer the inner elbow .
Microbes also vary between people .
Matthias Tschoep , an obesity expert at the University of Cincinnati's College of Medicine , identified 383 microbial genes that differed significantly between pairs of obese and slender twins .
Microbes in obese people harvest sugars and fats in the diet more efficiently than do others on slender people , he reported in Nature .
" It is possible that drug targets or drug candidates for the treatment of obesity could be identified from the obesity - associated microbiome , " Tschoep said .
At the Conference on the Beneficial Effects of Microbes held in San Diego last fall , scientists described many ways in which microbes can be helpful -- even essential -- to humans .
Bacteria in the gut make it possible to digest food , synthesize vitamins , remove toxins and develop the immune system after birth .
One of the new human microbiome grants went to Robert Modlin , a dermatologist at the University of California , Los Angeles , to study microbes lurking under the skin that cause 17 million Americans -- including 80 per cent of those age 12 to 24 -- to suffer from acne .
" Success may lead to the development of new , effective therapeutic strategies for treatment of acne , " Modlin 's grant announcement declared .

Needless to say , the Boeing 747 was not made to be loaded with tons of fire retardant liquid , let alone fly over fires and smoke while madly maneuvering at low altitude .
One thing is to see the demonstration videos , the other is to see these pilots doing their jobs over real fires .

There is no need to be obsessive about every tiny little detail in order to keep a home that looks and smells as though it has just been freshly cleaned .
Having a schedule for housework and following it is half the battle .
By following a good schedule you can keep your home clean in just minutes a day .
In order to keep your home looking fresh and clean there are some jobs that must be done daily , but others are jobs that can be done weekly , some done monthly .
Some larger jobs only need to be done seasonally .
Start With a Clean Slate
It is not as difficult as you might think to have a home that is neat , tidy , well - organized and easy to maintain , but you must start with a clean slate .
This means a good old fashioned spring cleaning .
Not the kind of spring cleaning where all you do is take an afternoon to clean the windows and re-stack old magazines .
Spring cleaning is a time to purge the home of all unnecessary clutter and debris that has been allowed to build up over the course of the year (s ) and it can be done at any time of the year , not just in the spring .
In some homes , the process of purging can be rather overwhelming .
If your home has a lot of clutter and you can afford it , hiring a professional organizer to help is a good option .
If you are doing it yourself and the family schedule is a hectic one it might take two or even three week - ends to complete , but it is more than worth it in the end .
Here are a few spring - cleaning tips .
Before cleaning begins , always know what is to be done with unwanted items .
Make piles of items to donate , keep and throw away .
Make a list of everything that needs to be done .
After a list of jobs has been made , make sure that you have everything you`ll need to do the job .
For example : plastic bins or cardboard boxes and a permanent marker , plastic garbage bags , mops , buckets , cleaners , rubber gloves and cleaning rags .
Always clean only one room at a time .
Running back and forth from room to room is a waste of time and things tend to be overlooked .
When a room is completely cleaned , remove all of your supplies and move on to the next room .
If the weather is nice on cleaning day be sure to open as many doors and windows as you can .
The fresh air will help to lift spirits as well as giving the house a good airing out .
Multi -task whenever possible .
Make sure that all of the bedding , curtains and throw rugs that need to be washed are in either the washer , dryer or laundry line while the rooms where they belong are being cleaned .
When the rooms are finished , they can be replaced right away instead of having to wait .
Now that all of the unnecessary clutter has been removed and your home is nice and clean , it is time to start following a schedule that will allow you to keep it clean without slaving for hours each day .

LONDON ( Reuters Life ! ) -
It was one of the more unusual requests -- but by no means the only weird plea for help that British embassies have received .

A British woman who had gone abroad for breast - enlarging surgery was unhappy with the results and wanted the Foreign Office to step in .
As did a mother in Florida who asked the consulate to help her teenage son pack his suitcase and drop him to the airport because he was feeling sick .
In a round - up of jaw - dropping calls to consulates by Britons abroad , the Foreign Office lists requests like how to control unruly children , what ’s the weather going to be like and how to make home - made jam .
“ We ca n’t tell you who is allowed to use your swimming pool , pay your taxi fares for you -- or do anything about the exchange rate , ” said Juliet Maric at the British Consul in Alicante , Spain .
British consulates have a network of 261 branches globally and are there to help UK travelers stay safe abroad and provide help if something goes wrong .
But some of the requests they receive hardly fall into those categories .
“ We regularly get enquiries from people who think we ’re a one - stop - shop for any problem they might encounter abroad , ” said Maric .
Minister for consular affairs , Chris Bryant , said : “ Consular staff are there to help Britons in real difficulty abroad -- from victims of crime and bereaved families to those involved in accidents or who have lost their passports .
“ It ’s important that British nationals understand what the Foreign Office can and ca n’t do for them so our staff can focus resources on more serious situations where people really do need our help . ”
( CNN ) -- NASA 's Kepler space telescope has already made a discovery , and its science operations are n't even officially under way yet .
The planet used in the test is a giant gas planet about the size of Jupiter that orbits a star called HAT P - 7 .
NASA scientists who put the telescope through a 10 - day test after its March 6 launch said this week that Kepler is working well .
Its ability to detect minute changes in light has enabled scientists to determine that a planet orbiting a distant star has an atmosphere , shows only one side to its sun and is so hot it glows .
Kepler 's ability to take measurements that precise at such a great distance " proves we can find Earth - size planets , " William Borucki , Kepler 's principal science investigator told reporters at a recent briefing .
The powerful scope is looking at thousands of stars in its vision field in the Milky Way on a 3 ½ - year mission to find planets the size of Earth and to determine how common these planets are .
The planet used in the test , a giant gas planet about the size of Jupiter , orbits a star called HAT P - 7 in just 2.2 days and is 26 times closer than Earth is to the sun , according to NASA .
It is called an exoplanet because it orbits a star outside the solar system .
Kepler detected the planet 's atmosphere , demonstrating the telescope 's capabilities and giving astronomers what NASA says is " only a taste of things to come . "
" It learned that this planet is like 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit .
That is so hot .
And it 's 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit just on one side only .
The other side would be closer to 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit , " said Sara Seager , a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a Kepler science team member .
" This particular planet showed an unusual change in brightness , " she said .
" As the planet is orbiting the star , it goes through phases just as the moon goes through phases as seen from Earth . "
" Kepler learned something new about an old planet , " she said .
" The new discovery was that planet is extremely hot , very , very hot .
And it 's very , very hot on one side , compared to the other . "
Borucki compared it to " an element in your toaster or stove . "

This is a short demo of the 606 with a 303 called Icecream , by Niklas Winde .
The Long Bow documentary film group has asked a state superior court to throw out a lawsuit charging that its use of the website meta tag " Jenzabar " on some of its pages represented trademark infringement against an educational software company with that name .
Meta tags are HTML code designed to direct searchers to a webpage .
The suit is " preposterous , " Public Citizen attorney Paul Allen Levy declared in an appeal to Massachusetts superior court filed on Tuesday .
" The filmmakers ' use of Jenzabar 's name as a keyword meta tag on their informational webpages about Jenzabar is far beyond the concern of trademark law , " Levy insisted .
" This is a frivolous lawsuit meant to censor the examination of a historic event . "
The historical event in question was the Chinese government 's violent suppression of demonstrators in Tiananmen Square , twenty years ago .
The upheaval is remembered in Long Bow 's film The Gate of Heavenly Peace , shown on the PBS Frontline series .
But one of the participants in the uprising , Jenzabar founder Ling Chai , says that the film distorts her role in the crisis .
The documentary suggests that " the actions of radical protesters [ herself prominent among them ] undermined moderates in the government , " she complained in her trademark suit against Long Bow , filed in 2007 .
Long Bow 's producers were " openly critical of Chai 's conduct as a student leader " and " misrepresented aspects of her involvement in the Protests , " she bitterly insists .
Since a defamation suit against Long Bow has failed , Chai is now going after the site 's HTML meta tags — one in particular .
Monopolizing loudspeakers
One of the biggest hazards that a documentary film team faces is that some of the real life characters in their film will actively hate the final product .
The hotter the issue , the more passionately key figures in the story will want to guard their public or self - image .
If they think that the final release challenges that image , relations between the producers and the subject can go south very fast .
Nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize , Ling Chai is remembered as one of the heroes of the Tiananmen upheaval — but not to everyone .
A college psychology student at the time , Ling quickly established herself as a militant force during the crisis , the public mourning of a deceased Chinese anti-corruption official that effectively became the center of a revolt against the government .
With troops and tanks ready to step in , some students at the Tiananmen pro-democracy sit -in counseled strategic retreat , but Heavenly Peace portrays Chai as rigidly refusing to concede this , calling these moderates " opportunists " and " traitors . "
" Thus , the film sets up its central irony , " one film reviewer noted in 1996 when the documentary came out , " having come to power through undemocratic means , the student leaders stifled the dissemination of opposing views by monopolizing the loudspeakers , even as the Communist leaders monopolized the national press . "
How do meta tags fit into this ?
The tags are HTML code usually placed at the top of webpages .
Developers debate their usefulness today , but at their inception meta tags were designed to make it easier for search engines to locate a site by allowing coders to include various key words in the " meta " line — e.g. " Jenzabar , " the consulting company that Chai established after fleeing to the United States .
Long
Bow put that word into tags on some of its pages .
Long
Bow 's filmmakers are " motivated by ill - will , their sympathy for officials in the Communist government of China , and a desire to discredit Chai , " her suit continues , and it says they are publishing " half - truths and falsehoods " on their website .
" In an effort to attract attention to the Site , and disseminate its disparaging content as widely as possible , Long Bow is using the JENZABAR Marks as metatags embedded within the Site . "
The complaint charges the production group with trademark infringement and dilution , insisting that the tag word made the film company 's site popular among Google searchers looking for Jenzabar .
A truthful statement
Public Citizen 's motion for summary judgment responds that this is all nonsense .
Jenzabar has no proof that the meta tags Long Bow used on a few websites strengthened their position with Google .
Even if they affected Google 's search rankings , " The First Amendment protects the right to make the truthful statement that a particular Web page contains information about Jenzabar , " attorney Levy insists .
And Public Citizen contends that the Long Bow pages that used the tags contained " purely non-commercial speech reporting information and expressing opinions about Jenzabar and its principals . "
Thus they enjoy free speech protections not usually extended to commercial trademarks .
Nor did the tags deceive or confuse consumers about Jenzabar 's services — one of the purposes of trademark infringement law being to prevent that .
The pages with these tags included articles about Jenzabar 's various legal disputes and its " long - time strategy of exploiting Chai ’s unique biography ( as a student leader at Tiananmen Square ) " in its marketing campaigns .
" No reasonable consumer , " Levy continues , " could read this information and be confused about whether Jenzabar created , sponsored , or approved of Long Bow ’s goods or services or is affiliated in any way with Long Bow . "
Ling Chai understandably disagrees with Long Bow 's assessment of her role in the Tiananmen crisis and of her work today , but her trademark action against the company could strengthen the perception that her passion for free speech begins and ends with her own — a megaphone hog then and a meta tag bully now .
Hopefully this lawsuit will be dealt with soon .
It 's yet another example , however , of the nasty and unusual legal risks that filmmakers take in their bid to document living history .
This is a short tutorial on how to make night - time photos like this one :
and this one :
This image was obtained with a simple point - and - shoot camera like the Powershot A570 IS , empowered by the CHDK software and with a combination of image stacking and HDR Tonemapping .
With the aid of a tripod and of a simple intervalometer script , I shot 40 photos with a 10 " exposure each .
The shots were taken at ISO 100 to reduce noise .
Another shot was taken with identical parameters but covering the lens with a cloth , to have a dark frame also used to reduce noise .
I did not shoot in RAW ( CHDK would have allowed this ) but used the standard Jpeg setting ( at the maximum quality available in the camera )
Each frame looks like this :
As you can see , everything is very under - exposed .
One could try to correct the image using " Levels " , but two prolems would arise :
If you try to give enough light to the sea , you get a lot of noise and a strongly overexposed area on the right :
If you keep the image darker , the sea stays almost black :
This is not bad , but not the result I wanted .
I wanted stronger colors and to see the reflection of the tower in the sea .
I then used a program called ImageStacker to " stack " all the images together ( there are other programs that do this , but ImageStacker is one is the one I prefer )
Basically , stacking is an operation of adding a lots of images together , pixel by pixel .
This can be used to obtain two different results :
1 ) adding all the pixels , you get an image similar to the one you would obtain with an extremely long exposure .
2 ) averaging all the pixels , you get an image with an identical exposure but where ( hopefully ) most of the noise gets averaged out .
This is the image obtained with the " average " method :
This image is as dark as the original was , but at least we can do levels without suffering because of all that noise :
This is instead the image obtained using the " add " method :
The last two images look very similar , but there is an important difference in the dark areas : each pixel of an image only has values between 0 and 255 .
In the very dark areas , let\\\ 's suppose we have a pixel with a value of about 3 .
In some of the photos , the pixel will have a value of 3 , and in some other photos this pixel will have a value of 4 .
Let\\\ 's suppose we have 10 photos , and that the same pixel has this values in each photo :
4 4 3 4 3 4 3 3 3 3
we could think that this values represent a luminosity that is slightly more than 3 but less than 4 .
If we average these photos , the result will be :
( 4+4+3+4+3+4+3+3+3+3) /10 = 34/10 = 3 ( because of rounding )
and we lose this additional information
If we just sum the images we will have the following result :
( 4+4+3+4+3+4+3+3+3+3 ) = 34
and we could hope that this 34 has kept some information about that dark pixel .
The problem is that if a pixel was very bright ( about 150 , for example ) then we would have some values like these :
150 152 151 150 151 150 151 150 152 150
The average would be :
( 150+152+151+150+151+150+151+150+152+150 ) = 1507/10 = 151
The sum would instead be :
( 150+152+151+150+151+150+151+150+152+150 ) = 1507 = 255
because 255 is the maximum value !
To put it short , average is good for bright areas , while adding id good for dark areas .
The idea is then to use both two images to make an HDR : the average for the bright areas and the sum for dark areas .
Actually , ImageStacker also allows to generate images that are a mix between average and add .
I did a mix with a divisor of 4 , meaning that with my 40 images I had :
Average
( p1+p2 + ... +p39+p40)/40
Sum
( p1+p2 + ... +p39+p40 )
Mix
( p1+p2 + ... +p39+p40 ) /
4
This is the " mix4 " image :
As you can expect , the mix4 image is an itnermediate between the average and the plain sum .
Using the " average " and the " mix4 " image an HDR was generated ( I used Photomatix ) and after tonemapping , the final image shown above was obtained :
Sure , the " aesthetical " results can be discussed ( and are far from optimal , in my opinion ) , and the look is completely un-natural for a night shot , but I think that the technique is interesting and is very useful in very high - contrast situations ( like often night shots are ) where you want to keep information across strongly lighted and dark areas .
Another example :
In this case , the strong moon reflection made the things particularly difficoult as the contrast between light and dark was very strong .
Also I had to keep the exposure very short to avoid over - exposing the reflection .
So , I shot 256 frames with exposure of 2 seconds , ISO 100 :
On these images , trying to do levels gives very bad results , with a lot of noise :
The averaged image as always is rather dark :
And doing " Levels " on this image gives very strong artifacts ( as in the example above , luminosity changes from 3 to 4 in discrete , visible steps )
The summed image is extremely over - exposed :
So , instead of the simple sum I used the sum / 4 ( p1+p2 ... +p255+p256 ) /
4
After tonemapping , the final result was obtained , with surprisingly good colours , given the difficoult conditions .
Some backstage material : my a570 on a tripod , running CHDK and capturing the shots from a good vantage point :
WASHINGTON 
In pushing to include a government - run health insurance plan in the health care bill , the Senate majority leader , Harry Reid , is taking a calculated gamble that the 60 members of his caucus could support the plan if it included a way for states to opt out .
Mr. Reid met with President Obama at the White House Thursday to inform him of his inclination to add the public option to the bill , but did not specifically ask the president to endorse that approach , a Democratic aide said .
Mr. Obama asked questions , but did not express a preference at the meeting , a White House official said .
Mr. Reid ’s outlook was shaped , in part , by opinion polls showing public support for a government insurance plan , which would compete with private insurers .
Speaker Nancy Pelosi said again Thursday that the House would definitely include a public option in its version of the legislation .
Just six weeks ago the public option appeared to be dying , under fierce attack by the insurance industry .
A clear majority of Democratic senators favor a government - run plan .
But public statements by other senators indicate that the proposal lacks the 60 votes ordinarily needed to secure Senate approval for hotly contested legislation .
President Paul Kagame his wife , Jeanette Kagame , look on as attendants place a symbolic coffin in a mass - burial site in Nyanza , near Kigali , on April 7 , 2009 to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the 1994 genocide that killed 800,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutus .
( Thomas Rippe / Associated Press )
They call Rwanda the " land of a thousand hills . "
But sometimes it can feel like the land of a thousand questions .
For one , how is it possible that these apparently gentle , quiet people could massacre — in the most brutal manner imaginable — more than 800,000 of their friends , neighbours and colleagues over the course of just three months ?
Jim Handman is Executive Producer with the CBC show Quirks & Quarks .
He is teaching journalism this summer at the National University of Rwanda .
And how can they now coexist , side - by - side , building the " new Rwanda " ?
Yes , the Rwandan genocide is 15 years behind us this month .
But that does n't feel like such a long time in the history of something so horrible .
To seek some answers , I went with some colleagues to the Genocide Museum in the capital , Kigali .
It is a fairly new , modest building , surrounded by memorial gardens .
On the main floor is a highly detailed and well - presented chronology of the genocide , its history , context and aftermath .
It contains some video testimony from survivors and the families of victims as well as some graphic photos of corpses .
It also exhibits some damning descriptions of how the world turned its back on Rwanda during the genocide .
Where was the UN ?
Rather than come to Rwanda 's aid , the UN actually pulled its troops out of this central African country at the height of the massacre , leaving its presiding officer , Canadian general Romeo Dallaire , hung out to dry .
Dallaire , now a senator , has said that he could have stopped the slaughter with just 5,000 troops and the proper mandate .
Instead , the UN decreased his force from 2,500 to just 250 helpless peacekeepers , who were forced to stand by and watch the genocide unfold .
One of the posters in the museum notes that the number of European troops that came to help evacuate Westerners in that spring and summer would have been enough to stop the genocide — had they stayed .
The French come under particular attack , since they arrived near the very end and their attempt to set up a so - called safe zone in the country , under a controversial mission called Operation Turquoise , appears to have helped some of the Hutu killers escape .
The most moving part of the museum is the final room , filled with large blow - up pictures of some of the many children who died in the genocide .
It lists their names , favourite pastimes and hobbies , and the manner in which they were killed : decapitated with a machete , speared , smashed against a wall .
It is difficult to read and I skip most of them .
Not alone
On the second floor is an exhibit dedicated to the other genocides of the 20th century : the Armenian genocide , the Holocaust , the Khmer Rouge slaughter of one - quarter of the population of Cambodia , and the Bosnian wars of the 1990s .
It is a brilliant idea — to show that this kind of unspeakable horror is not just a product of some kind of primitive , African savagery .
But rather a product of man 's inhumanity to man , of which no group has a monopoly .
It leaves a strong and lasting impression , as well as a sense of despair .
To understand more about what happened here , we go on another day to the Genocide Memorial at Murambi , about a half - hour drive from Butare , where we are living .
There are many of these memorials around the country , but this one marks the location of one of the largest single massacres of 1994 .
As many as 50,000 Tutsis sought refuge here , during the height of the killings , at a technical college on a hillside .
They were surrounded by the Hutu army and a Hutu militia , known as the Interahamwe .
For the sheltering Tutsis , their food and water was cut off for two weeks .
And then the militia and soldiers moved in to kill — 50,000 men , women and children slaughtered in a day .
Rooms of skeletons
The memorial consists of room after room in the college filled with skeletons , carefully placed on large white wooden tables .
The bodies have been coated with lime to preserve them and they glisten white in the light .
The smell of the odour - control balls in the rooms is overwhelming .
But what you notice most are the number of tiny bodies — babies , children , teens — many with smashed skulls .
They have all been exhumed from the mass graves on the site and placed in the rooms where they were slaughtered .
The impact is overwhelming and incomprehensible .
Behind the college is a grassy area with a sign that reads : " Here the French troops played volley ( ball ) during Operation Turquoise . "
The sign is just metres away from a huge mass grave and you can't help but conclude these soldiers must have known what had gone on at that spot .
They must have seen the blood in the rooms .
The graves would have been fresh .
A wife remembers
We were taken on a tour of the rooms by a woman who works there , herself a survivor of the massacre .
She tells us , in French , that her husband , a Tutsi , saved her life .
She is a Hutu , who was married to a Tutsi .
When the militia came to kill them , her husband showed them her identity card , which identified her as a Hutu — and they made her run away with the baby on her back .
Then they murdered her husband and her other two young children .
She tells us that she works here at the memorial as a duty to the memory of her family .
She is unemotional and direct .
She does this every day .
We come away numb .
Collective responsibility
One of the many writers on Rwanda that I have read in recent weeks noted that the genocide could have been much more efficient .
After all , the Rwandan army ( entirely Hutu ) was very well armed , by the French , with the latest weaponry .
But instead of shooting Tutsis and moderate Hutus , the militia killed them with primitive weapons — machetes , spears , hoes , clubs — one at a time .
The idea , it was said , was to involve as many people as possible in the killings , to spread the blame and the responsibility .
That might explain why more than one million Hutus fled the country when the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front invaded and stopped the genocide .
What now ?
At this point , it seems , Rwanda is still coming to grips with the aftermath of the killings .
In 2001 , the government established a system of community courts , known as Gacacas , to try those responsible .
The crimes range from robbery and looting to rape and murder .
There are 12,000 of these courts in a country of only eight million people and the result is that those who are judging know the accused very well .
At the Gacacas , sentences have been handed out , although many people who expressed guilt were pardoned and allowed to return to their communities .
The president of Rwanda , Paul Kagame , has said that if they incarcerated all the people involved in the genocide , they would have no country left .
The leaders of the genocide are being tried at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda , in Arusha , Tanzania .
But the process there is painfully slow .
In fact , only last week was the former governor of Kigali convicted of genocide , murder and rape , and sentenced to life .
It had taken 15 years to bring him to justice .
The government of Rwanda is also frustrated with the European countries that refuse to extradite alleged Hutu killers who have been given asylum in their countries .
Britain is one of them .
But it applauds Canada for recently convicting a Montreal man for his involvement in the massacre .
When you drive in the countryside , you often see groups of men in pink jumpsuits , working in the fields beside the highways .
They are " genocidaires , " men who have been convicted of crimes related to the genocide and are now in prison .
We are prohibited from taking their pictures .
We ask people here if something like this could happen again .
They say yes — if the Hutu majority takes power again .
That seems unlikely .
The Tutsi minority now controls the government and the military and they are committed to the idea of erasing ethnic identities .
They want a country where everyone is just a Rwandan .
It is a noble ideal , but is it realistic ?
We can only hope .
Postscript : A few days after this story appeared , someone threw a grenade at the Genocide Museum in Kigala from a passing motorcycle .
Two passersby were injured .
It was the third attack on the museum in just over a year .
Significantly , perhaps , grenades were a favourite weapon of the Hutu militias during the genocide .
They would be tossed into churches and rooms where Tutsis were hiding .
A team of archeologists unveiled the largest and most valuable hoard of Anglo - Saxon treasure ever found , on Sept. 24 , 2009 .

Persistent infection with high - risk types of human papillomavirus ( HPV ) , a sexually transmitted virus , is known to be a cause of cervical cancer .
Current guidelines prioritize HPV vaccination of pre-adolescent girls , which has been shown to be cost - effective in previous studies , but the value of vaccinating boys in the United States has been unclear .
In a new study , Harvard School of Public Health ( HSPH ) researchers found that if vaccine coverage and efficacy are high in girls , a universal recommendation to vaccinate young boys is unlikely to provide comparatively good value for resources , compared with vaccinating girls only .
The study appears online October 9 , 2009 , in The British Medical Journal and will appear in a later print edition .
The HPV vaccine for boys is already licensed in a number of countries and is currently being considered by the U.S Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) .
" With the near - term possibility of the HPV vaccine being available to boys in the U.S. , policymakers will need to decide whether or not to recommend vaccinating boys , " said Jane Kim , assistant professor of health decision science and lead author of the study .
" To inform these deliberations , both the incremental health benefits that would accrue with vaccination of boys and girls and the economic costs of the program should be compared to those associated with vaccination of girls alone . "
Motivated to inform current decision making , Kim and co-author Sue Goldie , professor of health decision science , evaluated the most current epidemiological , clinical and economic data on HPV infections and cervical disease .
Because the most important health benefits ( e.g. , prevention of cervical cancer ) from adolescent HPV vaccination will not be observed for years , and possibly decades , they used computer - based disease models to simulate the course of HPV - related diseases in the U.S. population over time .
The analysis looked at the vaccine 's potential benefits on a comprehensive set of HPV - related conditions among females and males , including cervical and non-cervical HPV - related cancers , genital warts and juvenile onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis , a rare but severe respiratory condition usually diagnosed in infancy that may be related to a mother 's infection with genital warts .
The results showed that , assuming 75 % vaccination coverage and lifelong vaccine protection against cervical disease , routine HPV vaccination of 12 - year - old girls was associated with a cost - effectiveness ratio of $ 40,310 per quality - adjusted life year ( QALY ) , a health metric used to reflect both the excess mortality and reduced quality of life associated with disease .
In the U.S. , interventions with cost - effectiveness ratios below $ 50,000 or $ 100,000 per QALY are informally considered good value for the money .
Including boys in the vaccination program had a cost - effectiveness ratio of $ 290,290 per QALY when compared to vaccinating girls only , exceeding the threshold for good value .
The results were robust across a range of alternative scenarios , such as changes in screening practice , decreased vaccine efficacy in boys , shorter duration of vaccine protection , and the inclusion of other HPV - related outcomes noted above .
The authors acknowledge , however , that there are many uncertain factors that can influence the findings .
For example , if efficacy against long - term HPV - related diseases in both girls and boys remains high , coverage in girls is low , or the vaccine price is substantially lowered , vaccinating boys looks more attractive .
Since the FDA may consider vaccinating boys in the near future , the findings provide important insight about guidelines regarding what groups to include in routine HPV vaccination recommendations .
The authors emphasize , " this analysis does not address decision - making at the individual level ; indeed , families who are considering HPV vaccination for an individual boy may consider the vaccine benefits worthwhile in terms of reducing the future risk of genital warts and possibly other health conditions . "
While the authors conclude that routine vaccination of boys is unlikely to provide comparative value to other public health interventions vying for resources , they emphasize that the study was conducted from a public health perspective and with the objective of informing general policy recommendations at the population - level .
" Based on currently available information , efforts for cervical cancer prevention in the U.S. should focus on HPV vaccination of pre-adolescent girls and continued cervical cancer screening in adulthood , " said Kim .

Opposition politician Boris Nemtsov says Sunday 's polls are a farce Opposition activists in Russia are up in arms as tens of millions of Russians prepare to go to the polls across the country in local elections this weekend .
Opposition groups have been particularly angry in the capital Moscow , openly accusing authorities of rigging the election for the city assembly to ensure the ruling party maintains its tight grip on power .
The vote is the first test of the government 's popularity since the economic crisis hit the country hard a year ago .
In the run-up to the elections , a small group of protesters took to the streets of Moscow , calling for Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and Yuri Luzhkov , the Mayor of Moscow , to be removed from office .
They were venting their frustration after the election commission blocked all serious opponents of the government from running as independent candidates in Sunday 's crucial vote for the Moscow assembly .
' Multiple violations '
The commission said their application forms had mistakes or the signatures needed to support the applications had been faked .
Never before have the authorities gone this far in trying to make campaigning difficult for the opposition
Nikolai Gubenko
Moscow assembly member
One opposition candidate - former minister Vladimir Milov - dismissed this as nonsense , accusing the authorities of fixing the election before people even had a chance to vote .
" There were multiple violations during the process of verifying my signatures and these were severe violations of the Moscow city electoral laws , " said Mr Milov .
" Obviously due to a political order from the top Russian and Moscow authorities , all of the independent candidates were banned from the elections including myself .
" It looks like the Moscow city government chose to ban 100 % of the independent candidates to secure the desired outcome of the election results . "
Opposition politician Boris Nemtsov described Sunday 's polls as " fraud , farce , 100 % " , suggesting Muscovites might boycott the election .
" No parties which have criticised the views of the Mayor of Moscow Yuri Luzhkov are taking part in the elections , and Vladimir Putin 's party of corrupted bureaucracy is the biggest organisation trying to control power for future corruption , " he said .
" That is why this is not an election and it's why an idea of a boycott is quite interesting and I believe that millions of Muscovites do n't want to go at all ( to vote ) . "
Unprecedented pressure
The move has left just the so - called official opposition parties such as the communists in the race .
Critics say they are only tolerated because they do not pose any real threat to the government .
Protesters have called for Mr Luzhkov , right , to be removed from power But Nikolai Gubenko , a communist member of the Moscow assembly , said even his party was facing unprecedented pressure from the authorities in this election .
" Never before have the authorities gone this far in trying to make campaigning difficult for the opposition - any opposition , regardless of party affiliations , " he said .
" We are having enormous difficulties meeting people , holding campaign events , even putting up paid advertising posters . "
Certainly , on the streets of the capital , all I have seen has been posters and activists for the ruling party , United Russia , and for a couple of other Kremlin - friendly parties .
Allegations denied A recent opinion poll showed that almost 40 % of Muscovites believe Sunday 's election will be rigged .
One Muscovite I spoke to said the election had already been decided .
" This is a show , not an election , " he said .
" My vote will not count anyway . "
Another voter said she was pessimistic about the poll .
I can look you in the eye and promise you that people will be free to vote for any of the registered candidates
Gennady Raykov
Central election commission " It does n't matter how I vote , or how other people vote - the authorities will effectively appoint the people who they think are right , " she said .
The election commission strenuously denied the allegations .
" If you look up the laws , you 'll see that it is now a crime to rig an election , " said Gennady Raykov , who is co-ordinating the Moscow city election .
" We already have cases where people have been prosecuted .
I can look you in the eye and promise you that people will be free to vote for any of the registered candidates . "
Critics say that may well be true , as the genuine opposition has already been eliminated .
Election observers say what is happening in the capital is particularly worrying because methods used for elections in Moscow - if successful - are then copied across the country .
It all flies in the face of President Dmitry Medvedev 's recent promise to renew the country 's political system and develop Russia in a democratic way .

On the morning of September 1 , 1939 , the German battleship Schleswig - Holstein ushered in WWII when it opened fire on the 180 - strong Polish contingent stationed on Westerplatte .
Donald Tusk , the Polish prime minister , and Lech Kaczynski , the nation 's president , were due to lay wreaths at a memorial to the garrison at 4:45 am , 70 years to the minute that the ship 's shells first tore into the Polish defences .
Later in the day there was scheduled to be a formal memorial ceremony , attended by dignitaries including British Foreign Secretary David Miliband and the German chancellor , Angela Merkel .

The recession is proving to be an opportune time for Linux vendor Red Hat ( NYSE : RHT ) as it continues to grow revenues and earnings .
According to Red Hat executives , the growth is coming at the expense of rivals and as a result of customer confidence in the abilities of Linux and Red Hat 's JBoss middleware platform .
The growth of Red Hat 's business is not however a sign of bloat .
During Red
Hat 's second quarter earnings investor call on Wednesday , Red Hat CEO Jim Whitehurst responded to an analyst question about Linux founder Linus Torvalds ' comment earlier this week that Linux was bloated .
" As Linux has continued to grow and its applicability continues to expand , there 's just more feature functionality that people are looking for to be built into the operating system , " Whitehurst said .
" I do n't think of that as bloat . "
Whitehurst added that in his view , bloat is when vendors add features that people do not want .
Linux , he said , is growing but with features that people do want .
" The key differentiator is it can continue to do that in a very modular way , so I actually look at the growth as much more of a reflection that it continues to add features that people do want , and that 's a good thing , " Whitehurst said .
Red Hat 's customers are seeing it as a good thing too , if the financial results are to be taken as an indicator .
For Red Hat 's second quarter of its fiscal 2010 year , ending Aug. 31 , revenues hit $ 183.6 million .
That 's a 12 percent increase over the second quarter of fiscal 2009 and ahead of Wall Street forecasts of $ 179.1 million , according to Reuters Estimates .
Net income also rose , coming in at $ 28.9 million , or $ 0.15 per diluted share -- up from the $ 21.1 million , or $ 0.10 per diluted share , for the year - ago quarter .
Minus one - time items , the company said it took home a $ 0.16 per share profit .
Wall Street analyst had expected a $ 0.15 per -share profit .
Moving forward , Red Hat provided Q3 revenue guidance to be in the range of approximately $ 187 million to $ 189 million .
How Red Hat does it
The growth of Red Hat 's business is not necessarily a sign of renewed spending in the IT sector .
Rather in Whitehurst 's view , Red Hat 's growth is coming by way of taking share from other operating system vendors .
" I would say we are seeing some signs of life out there as customers are talking a bit more about new projects , " Whitehurst said .
" But I do n't think we actually saw that in new volume in the second quarter .
I think it 's mainly taking share still at this point . "
For example , the current ownership status of Sun Microsystems is creating some opportunities for Red Hat in Whitehurst 's view .
Oracle is trying to acquire
Sun in a deal that is currently being held up by approvals in the EU .
Sun 's Solaris operating system is a rival to Red Hat Enterprise Linux .
" I think that any time there 's change in a company like what 's going on at Sun , it creates opportunity , " Whitehurst said .
" HP , IBM , and Dell are squarely focused on that opportunity and when there are replacements like that in many , if not most cases , Red Hat software is involved , so I would say that we are seeing some opportunity there . "
It 's not just Sun Solaris that Red Hat is winning customers from , but from other Linux distributions as well .
Earlier this year , Whitehurst noted that Red Hat was beginning to make a committed effort to target free Linux users for conversion to paying enterprise Linux subscriptions .
It 's an effort that is now paying off , the company said .
Whitehurst noted that Red Hat struck two sizable free - to - paid deals during its second quarter .
" One of the free - to - pay deals was a multimillion dollar deal with a financial services customer , " Red Hat CFO Charlie Peters said .
" This customer chose to migrate back to Red Hat after using a competitor 's Linux provided to them through free coupons . "
While Peters did n't disclose further details on the parties involved , the transaction may have been related to the Microsoft Novell agreement , which involves Microsoft reselling Linux through a coupon offer .
" This customer returned because our technology roadmap was clear and our value proposition is strong , " he added .
Peters also said that Red Hat 's other major free - to - paid deal was with a large technology company .
" This customer has attempted to support the software themselves but realized that they were incurring significant costs and risks to do so , " he said .
" They were able to achieve significant cost savings by buying Red Hat subscriptions and their CIO now sleeps more securely at night . "
Earlier this summer , Fox aired a movie / pilot named Virtuality created by Ronald D. Moore , the master behind the reimagined Battlestar Galactica .
That show has a very stark resemblance in some regards to Defying Gravity .
Now I 'm not going to claim that one show copied from the other , but I would like to point out some similarities and differences .
Both shows involve long term space travel , but the goal in Virtuality is to find an inhabitable world outside our solar system .
In Defying Gravity , they are on a preset course around the universe .
It seems more in reach , but nonetheless challenging for all .
First of all , the reality show .
The Virtuality reality show is shown in a Real World / Surreal Life / Big Brother sort of way .
There are hidden cameras and quality cameras used to record the person speaking to the audience .
It 's much more surreal in the fact that it 's a fucking space mission , but it 's also a show for huge profit with a huge audience .
The Defying Gravity show is more toned down , less intrusive , more instructional .
It 's not about showboating or revealing the despair of the travelers .
In this regard , I think Defying Gravity did a better job .
The characters of each crew has both men and women , but where Defying Gravity has the usual cliches , Virtuality has a very broad base of characters .
There are unusual people and personalities in Virtuality .
I know they ;re not really astronaut material , but neither are those in Defying Gravity , so the hell with it .
If you 're not going to portray realism , go all out and be crazy .
The " scifi elements " are very different .
There is almost no discussion of science in Defying Gravity , and we do n't know the propulsion or the sustainability .
All we know is that they have the capability to go around the solar system within 6 years and stay alive .
Virtuality explains the oxygen production and how they will get out of the solar system .
The way each show deals with the long term nothingness is very interesting .
Defying Gravity deals with it in a way that shows a disturbing lack of creativeness from the creators .
Essentially , the astronauts will have to spend 6 years with the same people doing god knows what .
They are specifically given " Halo " patches that decrease libido , but what are they supposed to do ?
If someone offered me the chance to spend 6 years doing research on a cramped ship I 'd decline in a heart beat .
I do n't dream about the stars and I certainly would n't want to come back to Earth with 6 - years passed by .
Virtuality takes a page from Ron Moore 's other new show Caprica with the virtual reality .
The astronauts put the devices on and they can enter any scenario of their choice .
This leads to some wild experiences and insight into the character .
Both shows have a twist with a little mystery behind it .
The Defying Gravity ship Antares has something on board that controls people .
The Virtuality ship Phaeton has a virus or something on board that is hurting people in the virtual world , even raping a member .
In the end , the captain kills himself , but " downloads " himself into the virtual world .
The human reactions to the journey are different and odd .
In Defying Gravity , the astronauts seem fine , upbeat , and even indifferent even though they will engage in a journey with probably dire consequences .
Virtuality takes a much deeper tone reflecting on the real psychological impact on how people would react to long term space flight bolstered by weird virt modules .
-- The National Hockey League and the National Hockey League Players ’ Association announced tonight that forward Theoren Fleury has been cleared to return to on - ice competition .
Fleury , who in June , 2006 was placed in Stage 4 of the Substance Abuse and Behavioral Health Program of the NHLPA and the NHL , will continue to participate in the after - care phase of the Program .
The program 's doctors , Dr. Dave Lewis on behalf of the NHL and Dr. Brian Shaw on behalf of the NHLPA , continue to administer Fleury 's care .
travels through space
Time passes , and space with it .
I do n't like airplanes overmuch , so I caught a train up to Paris last weekend , and from there Kate & I took a plane to Dublin to visit Jan Jaime Jingle Hemmett Schmidt .
Dublin was lovely , lovely -- performing for us in weather and in song , in light and dark -- the dark being the fine stout , of course .
I could n't pick a favorite part , though the one that keeps popping into mind is Newgrange , a 5000 - year - old neolithic passage tomb , forty - some meters in diameter , aligned so that a shaft of light would pass into the chamber on the winter solstice .
That image aligns nicely with my Mumford readings of late .
Before the construction of such artifacts , either as sticks planted in the ground or as massive monuments , time did not exist -- at least , not as we know it now , as an outside thing ticking on discretely without us -- as opposed to the spurting yet continuous flow experienced within .
I spent the rest of last week hanging out in deserted August Paris , the city - time of open - air cinema and ambles in unpeopled streets .
But I wo n't lie : I spent a fair piece of it indoors , hack on the mind .
travels through time
At my last dispatch , I was in 1987 , implementing flat closures , described in Dybvig 's dissertation .
The recent spatial travel to Dublin , unaccompanied by the laptop , left my mind unusually clear .
So spatially back in Paris on Wednesday I left again for 2002 , implementing Fixing Letrec .
The important contribution of that paper was a systematic , direct way to translate mutually recursive lambda expressions to a generalized form of the fixed - point operator , also known as the Y combinator .
Quoth the prophets Waddell , Sarkar & Dybvig :
The transformation converts letrec expressions into an equivalent mix of let , set ! , and fix expressions .
A fix expression is a variant of letrec that binds only unassigned variables to lambda expressions .
It represents a subset of letrec expressions that can be handled easily by later passes of a compiler .
In particular , no assignments through external variables are necessary to implement mutually recursive procedures bound by fix .
Instead , the closures produced by a fix expression can be block allocated and “ wired ” directly together .
This leaves the fix - bound variables unassigned , thus simplifying optimizations such as inlining and loop recognition .
fix is identical to the labels construct handled by Steele ’s Rabbit compiler and the Y operator of Kranz ’s Orbit compiler and Rozas ’ Liar compiler .
For me , this passage was tantalizing , but I did n't quite understand the optimizations that a transformation to fix allowed .
Yes , I had read Steele 's dissertation a number of times , but Guile 's compiler does n't do a CPS rewrite , so it was unclear how some of the optimizations applied .
But my recent " flat closure " work had pointed out one optimization , the " block allocation " mentioned in the above paragraph .
Consider two mutually recursive functions :
( define ( analyze n ) ( define ( even ? n ) ( or ( = n 0 ) ( odd ? (- n 1 ) ) ) ) ( define ( odd ? n ) ( or ( = n 1 ) ( even ? (- n 1 ) ) ) ) ( cond ( (< n 0 ) ' negative - number ) ( ( even ? n ) ' even - number ) ( else ' odd - number ) ) )
Ignore for the moment the dubious " analysis " that this function performs .
( Can you spot the bug ? )
What I want to focus on are the internal definitions , even ? and odd ? .
Using define in a nested context like this is simply sugar around letrec , so this is equivalent to :
( define ( analyze n ) ( letrec ( ( even ? ( lambda ( n ) ( or ( = n 0 ) ( odd ? (- n 1 ) ) ) ) ) ( odd ? ( lambda ( n ) ( or ( = n 1 ) ( even ? (- n 1 ) ) ) ) ) ) ( cond ( (< n 0 ) ' negative - number ) ( ( even ? n ) ' even - number ) ( ( odd? n ) ' odd- number ) ) )
Here we see the mutual recursion expressed more clearly .
Looking more closely at the even ?
and odd ?
bindings , we see that each has one free variable :
( lambda ( n ) ( or ( = n 0 ) ( odd ? (- n 1 ) ) ) ) ^ odd ?
is free in even ?
( lambda ( n ) ( or ( = n 1 ) ( even ? (- n 1 ) ) ) ) ^ even ? is free in odd ?
If even ? and odd ?
are compiled as mutually recursive closures ( a point to which I will return shortly ) , they need to capture each other 's bindings -- kindof a chicken - and - egg problem , no ?
In the lambda calculus , this problem is solved via the Y combinator , which basically involves passing the functions of interest to another function , which in turn invokes the functions of interest , passing themselves as their arguments .
It 's pretty neat .
Thomas Holubar and Jos Koot have been discussing this very topic at FLIBUG , incidentally ( see Thomas 's slides on the need for Y for a brief introduction ) .
origins of letrec
To continue the digression , I understand that the letrec construct was originally defined by Peter Landin in a 1965 paper , A Correspondence between ALGOL 60 and Church 's Lambda - Notation .
He uses a very schemely intermediate language to model ALGOL 60's semantics with sugar on top of a slightly extended lambda calculus .
In the following discussion , from the paper , Landin describes how mutually recursive definitions and labels ( goto targets ) can be expressed using letrec .
Take φn to mean an arbitrary expression ; italics are mine .
Definitions can also arise from the block - body -- their definees being the labels that are local to the block .
These are defined in terms of locals , including each other , and they may be referred to by procedure and switch declarations .
Hence labels must be grouped with switches and procedures as a single simultaneously recursive definition .
The overall treatment of a block is therefore as follows .
[ On the left we have ALGOL 60 , on the right Landin 's " Applicative Expression " intermediate language . ] begin let a= φ 1 real a ; and A= φ 2 array A φ 2 ; let rec P= φ3 procedure P φ 3 ; and S= φ 4 switch S φ 4 ; and L= φ 6 φ 5 ; and M=φ7 L : φ 6 ; φ 5 M : φ 7 ; end [ Here is the translation into the lambda calculus .
Note the Y !] { λ ( a , A ) .{λ( P, S, L , M ) .
φ5 } [ Y λ( P , S , L , M ) . ( φ 3 , φ4 , φ6 , φ7 ) ] } [ φ 1 , φ2 ]
Applying Y to mutually recursive procedures / labels binds them together , allowing them to see themselves .
So you see , Y was in letrec from the very beginning .
Note that labels , denoting basic blocks , are modelled as procedures of 0 arguments .
In the light of Steele 's 1977 contribution , which I will discuss shortly , Landin 's 1965 paper was particularly prescient .
Landin says :
The treatment of jumps springs from the observation that the symbol ' go to ' in ALGOL 60 is redundant , and could be ignored by a preprocessor .
That is to say , there is a considerable similarity between labels and the identifiers of parameterless nontype procedures .
It is possible to use the same " calling mechanism " for both , leaving any difference to be made by the thing that is " called " ...
It might therefore be supposed that labels can be eliminated formally by considering each labelled segment of program as a parameterless procedure declaration ( and hence as a definition whose defiens is a λ ( ) - expression ) .
Steele turns this isomorphism around , saying instead :
In general , procedure calls may be usefully thought of as GOTO statements which also pass parameters , and can be uniformly encoded as JUMP instructions .
This is a simple , universal technique ...
Our approach results in all tail - recursive procedure calls being compiled as iterative code , almost without trying , for it is more a matter of the code generation strategy than of a specific attempt to remove recursions .
Landin passed away in June of this year .
mischief managed
Anyway , back to 2002 .
Scheme 's letrec construct is more general than Landin 's let rec ; it allows arbitrary expressions on the right - hand side , not just procedures .
So the first trick Waddell shows is how to transform letrec into " an equivalent mix of let , set ! , and fix " .
Once he has the fix , which is the same as Y , we need to compile it -- and that 's where we were before longjmping back to 1965 .
In the lambda calculus , a very minimal language , often there are more efficient ways to implement higher - order constructs , such as fix .
So fix - bound procedures need to capture an environment including themselves , fine .
The standard way ( in Scheme now , not the lambda calculus ) is to bind e.g. even ?
and odd ?
( as in our example above ) to empty " boxes " , then set !
the contents of the boxes to the procedures .
The fix - bound lambda - expressions have bound the right variables , and after the boxes have been filled in via set ! , those expressions hold each other 's value : mischief managed .
Like this :
( let ( ( even ? # f ) ( odd ? # f ) ) ( set ! even ?
( lambda ( n ) ( or ( = n 0 ) ( odd ? (- n 1 ) ) ) ) ) ( set ! odd ?
( lambda ( n ) ( or ( = n 1 ) ( even ? (- n 1 ) ) ) ) ) ...)
But this is not ideal , because it forces the fix - bound lambda expressions to be allocated on the heap , in boxes , whereas in fact they are never set ! in the source text .
We can do better .
Since the lambda expressions do n't actually run until after the bindings have been made , and thus do n't reference their free bindings until then , we can allocate them on the stack , then fix up their free variables , mutating the closures in place .
Thus we do n't introduce extraneous set !
constructs into the code .
This simplifies inlining and loop detection , as Waddell notes , and also allows the fix - bound variables to be allocated on the stack instead of in boxes , removing an indirection at runtime .
even better
But we can do even better than that .
In this example , we still allocate a closure for even ?
and for odd ? -- but we can avoid that too .
Notice that even ?
and odd ?
are always called in tail position with respect to the letrec construct .
Landin tells us that labels , the targets of go to , may be viewed as procedures of 0 arguments , with respect to the lambda calculus ; Steele goes the other way , in his 1977 paper , Debunking the ' Expensive Procedure Call ' Myth , or , Procedure Call Implementations Considered Harmful , or , Lambda : The Ultimate GOTO .
( If you program , and want just one article to read out of all of these , read this paper . )
So , for a tail - call to a fix - bound procedure , we can simply render the bindings of the procedures inline to the parent procedure , jump over them , then enter the body of the fix .
Any tail - call to a fix - bound procedure compiles a goto -- after setting its arguments .
Since the procedure is lexically bound , and never set ! , we know exactly where those arguments are going to be , so we set them directly -- no need to shuffle them around .
So an empty loop :
( letrec ( ( loop ( lambda ( ) ( loop ) ) ) ) ( loop ) )
Looks like this :
; ; jump over definition of `loop ' 0 ( br : L124 ) ;; -> 16 ; ; definition of `loop ' 8 ( br : L125 ) ;; -> 8 ; ; letrec body 16 ( br : L125 ) ;; -> 8
( You get this by typing , x ( lambda ( ) ( let loop ( ) ( loop ) ) ) into the Guile REPL . )
A loop counting down from 100 looks like this :
scheme@( guile - user ) > , x ( lambda ( ) ( let lp ( ( n 100 ) ) ( or ( zero ? n ) ( lp ( 1- n ) ) ) ) )
Disassembly of #< program b742e6d0 at < unknown port >:51:3 ( ) > : 0 ( br : L141 ) ;; -> 32 8 ( local - ref 0 ) ; ; `n ' 10 ( make - int8:0 ) ;; 0 11 ( ee ? ) 12 ( local - set 1 ) ; ; `t ' 14 ( local - ref 1 ) ;; `t ' 16 ( br - if - not : L142 ) ;; -> 24 19 ( local - ref 1 ) ; ; `t ' 21 ( return ) 24 ( local - ref 0 ) ; ; `n ' 26 ( sub1 ) 27 ( local - set 0 ) ; ; `n ' 29 ( br : L143 ) ;; -> 8 32 ( make-int8 100 ) ;; 100 34 ( local - set 0 ) 36 ( br : L143 ) ;; -> 8
I mean , that 's pretty damn good .
We could do better if we reordered the blocks a bit , and compiled the conditional branch br - if - not into something more specific , but still -- pretty tight for compiling scheme to bytecode .
( The `t ' , if you are curious , is a result of the expansion of or . )
conclusions
Guile has applied Waddell 's " Fixing Letrec " strategy to transform Scheme 's general letrec into more primitive constructs , including fix .
fix - bound lambda expressions that need to be allocated as closures are now faster and cons less , given that they are n't allocated in boxes , and an important subset of fix expressions is now rendered as inline code and wired together using goto , a pleasant illustration that indeed , lambda is the ultimate goto .
It is a rare sunny summer morning and I am on the bus from Stoke Newington to Bloomsbury in central London .
In these old , slightly earnest parts of the capital , leftwing politics runs deep : from Karl Marx writing in the British Library to communes in the 70s to today 's dogged socialist flyposters .
This morning 's bus ride does not disappoint .
Seated in front of me , en route to Marxism 2009 , the pre-eminent British gathering of the international radical left , are a clean - cut man and woman in their early 20s .
He is wearing a crisp new T - shirt that reads " Revolución Bolivarana " .
She has a large rucksack .
They are speaking German , but the word " socialism " recurs .
The papers today are full of the recession as usual .
On the Today programme , David Cameron has been talking about emergency cuts in government spending , and a union leader has been fiercely defending the wages of public sector workers .
It could almost be the heady days of the mid-70s , when capitalism seemed to struggle for breath and all political bets appeared to be off .
At Euston station , the couple get off the bus .
I follow them , past the looming tower of Network Rail headquarters – once the chaotic private - sector Railtrack , until it was nationalised – and into the complex of meeting rooms hosting Marxism 2009 .
But the atmosphere inside comes as something of a shock .
It is the final , supposedly climactic day of the conference .
The speakers are reasonably intriguing and diverse – the radical playwright David Edgar , the dissident Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn , the rising young union boss Mark Serwotka .
And yet , Marxism 2009 feels little different from most such leftwing summits in Britain over the last quarter century .
The corridors are animated rather than feverish .
Attendees greet each other as old friends and comrades rather than eager new converts .
The pavement outside has moderately busy stalls for the usual causes : opposition to Israeli land occupations , opposition to the British National Party .
At one table , a weatherbeaten man sits alone selling DVDs of " activist news " and collecting names and addresses .
The sky above turns overcast , then steadily darkens .
It starts to pour , but he does not move .
As the rain soaks his hair and jacket , he sits still and erect , impressively defiant but a bit absurd .
The ink on his list of names starts to run .
The last year should have been a happy one for the left .
The great global lab experiment in unfettered finance capitalism has blown up .
Bankers have become pariahs .
Taxes on the rich have gone up .
The pages of the financial press have had a frequent air of panic .
New Labour has fallen out of love with the free market .
Above all , the rightwing economic and political ideas first popularised by Margaret Thatcher in the 70s have , finally , lost their air of impregnability .
" These are the best circumstances to make the left case we 've known for an awful long time , " says Neal Lawson , head of the leftwing pressure group Compass , " since way back before 1979 , since back to the 30s . "
Geoff Mulgan , the former Labour strategist and a longtime observer of the left , agrees : " This is a moment that should be incredibly propitious for the left .
Capitalism is collapsing .
You do n't get more propitious than that . "
There is also the widening recognition that free - market countries have deep social as well as economic problems .
Earlier this year Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett , at the time almost unknown outside academia , published The Spirit Level : Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better .
Its findings about the failings of the most fiercely capitalist countries , such as Britain and the US , in everything from obesity to violent crime to mental health , received overwhelming acclaim in both the rightwing and liberal press .
Wilkinson says he is now " absolutely deluged with invitations to speak : to religious groups , to civil servants , to government " .
In academia he senses an intellectual tide running leftwards : " In a lot of different subjects there 's a move towards a fundamental recognition of how social people are .
In neurology , epidemiology , social psychology , child development , there 's lots of evidence that humans do better if they 're collaborative . "
And yet , in Britain and most comparable countries the left is not thriving .
Quite the opposite .
The Brown government 's mild tilt to the left has made it no more popular .
At the European elections in June , left - leaning parties , whether in office or opposition , cautious or militant , were trounced across the continent .
Votes went instead to mainstream conservative parties or far right and anti- immigration groups .
Over the summer the broader political debate , particularly in Britain , has shifted in the same direction : " The crisis of the financial markets has become a crisis of public spending – it's incredible ! " says Hilary Wainwright , editor of leftwing magazine Red Pepper .
" Public servants are going to be scrutinised down to the last paperclip , while bankers are not going to be scrutinised down to the last million they have received from the government . "
Has the left missed its moment ?
The radical American writer Rebecca Solnit fears so .
" It felt like last October [ the peak of the banking panic ] was the golden moment to put forward an alternative vision , " she says .
" What 's been dismaying is that there has been so little coherent response from the left since . "
Lawson wonders whether the sheer size of the political opportunity presented by the financial crisis has induced paralysis :
" All our Christmases have come at once , but we do n't know what to do about it . "
At Marxism 2009 , the best - attended session of the morning is " Where is the radical left going ? " .
The main speaker is Alex Callinicos , for decades now one of the key theorists in the Socialist Workers Party ( SWP ) , the tirelessly agitating British fringe party that has organised the conference .
In the airless main hall , in front of a stage backdrop reading " Capitalism Is n't Working ! " , Callinicos , concise and dapper in a black shirt , delivers a strikingly downbeat speech .
" The forward march of the radical left in Europe has been halted , " he says .
" We 're in a situation that is in a sense quite problematic . . .
It 's not a uniform picture of stagnation or retreat .
The left bloc in Portugal got 10 % of the vote in the European elections . . .
But the ruling classes are desperately grabbing bits of Keynesianism .
So a left economic policy based on Keynesianism , when Keynesianism has entered the mainstream , is n't very powerful . "
This theme – that governments everywhere have borrowed the left 's traditional tools for taming capitalism to deal with the financial crisis , thus stealing the left 's clothes – is repeated often at the conference .
It is met with looks of resignation but also grim satisfaction from the audience .
The infinite deviousness of " the ruling classes " and the immense difficulty of the left 's task are a given in these halls .
In 2004 , Solnit published a much - praised book , Hope in the Dark : the Untold History of People Power , challenging the instinctive pessimism of many leftists .
" A lot of activists , " she wrote , " specialise in disappointment . "
She adds now : " Despair is a black leather jacket that everyone looks good in .
Hope is a frilly pink dress that exposes your knees . "
It is quite hard to imagine Jon Cruddas in a frilly pink dress .
The prominent leftwing Labour MP for the raw suburb of Dagenham in east London is all shirtsleeves and strong handshakes when we meet in Westminster .
But he is one British socialist who still sees the recession as an ongoing political opportunity .
Crisis on the left or not , his own trajectory seems upward : elected as an MP in 2001 , he won the most first - preference votes in the Labour deputy leadership contest only six years later ( Harriet Harman won via second preferences ) , and is spoken of by some as a potential party leader if Labour , as is quite possible , moves truly leftward after a general election defeat .
" The 15th of September 2008 , the day Lehman Brothers went bust , could be the day the world turned , " he begins with characteristic confidence .
" The whole politics of Blair and Cameron looks like the product of more benign times . "
Cruddas , unlike some on the left , supported the subsequent bank bail - outs – " you could n't let the whole system collapse " – and does not think the apparent amelioration of the financial crisis that has followed means a return to economic and political business as usual .
" This is the early knockings of this crisis .
You 've still got trillions of pounds of debt around .
The assumption in here " – he nods impatiently towards the House of Commons – " is that we tinker with this economic system , and then go back to 60 consecutive quarters of growth .
But out in the country people know different .
There is no economic status quo any more .
There is a hunger for political ideas .
I helped do an e-book on the crisis .
Cost £ 250 to produce , put it on the web , 50,000 copies gone – bang .
There is a space for a populist left politics – around [ opposition to ] ID cards and Trident , around taxes , tax justice – that was n't there a year ago . "
But Cruddas says people wanting this politics to crystallise will have to be patient .
Rightwing ideas have been so dominant for so long in western politics and economics that they may only slowly loosen their grip .
" This is going to take years .
There was a long lag between the Wall Street Crash in ' 29 and the New Deal [ the first effective left - of - centre response to it ] . "
In the meantime , he warns , " There could be a different new form of politics , much more populist , dangerous , fascistic , like the BNP . "
With only the faintest hint of ostentation , Cruddas , who has a philosophy PhD , quotes part of a famous passage by the Italian Marxist thinker of the 20s and 30s Antonio Gramsci : " The old is dying and the new can not be born ; in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear . "
To less upbeat observers than Cruddas it is the left that displays " morbid symptoms " .
Mulgan says : " A lot of the left literature feels like it 's just words , just rhetorical .
[ Groups such as ]
Compass do n't feel like they 're part of a real social movement .
It 's very different from a generation ago . "
Until well into the Thatcher era , the left in Britain was a complete and vigorous political world .
It had a mass membership through the unions and the Labour party .
It had credibility and charismatic figures : even establishment papers such as the Times feared and sometimes respected Tony Benn or the National Union of Mineworkers .
And it had potent ideas from the likes of Gramsci and Marx and Keynes .
All of these elements have decayed since the 80s ; but none so damagingly , especially in the light of the financial crisis , as the left 's thinking about the economy .
" The left just gave up on economics , " says the economist Paul Ormerod , who retains sympathy for the cause .
" Marx and Keynes cast such long shadows .
There was too much of the left saying , ' It 's all there in the old masters . ' "
Marx died in 1883 and Keynes in 1946 ; by the 80s – some would say much earlier – the world economy had changed sufficiently to invalidate some of their ideas .
Yet the left was more interested by then , Ormerod argues , in other issues such as race and gender and sexuality .
Lawson agrees : " We 've had a hollowed - out generation of economic thinkers . "
Since the 80s , Ormerod says , rightwing economists " have taken over in treasuries and central banks all over the world " .
Western universities , too , have become production lines for rightwing economics graduates – and for graduates who do not even consider a complete faith in the free market to be a political position at all .
Meanwhile , the left has suffered a broader crisis of confidence : as Lawson puts it , " We've had the intellectual stuffing knocked out of us – the fall of communism , the fall of postwar social democracy . "
By the early 21st century , even fresh and successful leftwing books such as Naomi Klein 's The Shock Doctrine or Empire by Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri assumed that global capitalism was immensely strong , " in the midst of conquering its final frontiers " in Klein 's words .
Most of the left , just like most other political schools of thought , did not see the great financial collapse of 2008 coming .
Since the recession set in , the left has not been able to play what should have been its electoral trump card : " We told you so . "
Solnit considers this picture of universal leftwing retreat too bleak .
She sees signs of radicalism in Barack Obama 's administration , for example on green issues .
She points out that anti-globalisation and left - leaning environmental groups across the west remain energetic and creative , and that some have paid attention to economics .
" I do feel like there are a lot of small alternatives out there : community agriculture , people living by barter , people living off the grid .
That revolution is slow and incremental .
It 's been going on since the 60s .
That continues . "
In Hope in the Dark , she criticises those who " expect . . . a punctual reaction " from the left to big political or economic events " and regard the lack of one as a failure " .
The way politics works , she writes , " is more complicated than cause and effect " .
At Marxism 2009 there is the occasional reminder that leftwing politics still has potential .
In the conference bookshop , for the most part a well - visited mausoleum of nostalgic volumes – Glorious Summer : Class Struggle in Britain 1972 – there is a brief , more forward - looking pamphlet on sale for £ 1 . Visteon : How Workers Occupied and Won is an SWP account of the factory occupations in Northern Ireland and England this spring at the car component manufacturer Visteon .
It is written in the usual overdone party style – " Now we have the template for resistance " – but suggests that the left 's response to the global slump may not be completely toothless .
In March , with the motor industry in free - fall , Visteon , a spin - off of Ford , abruptly closed its UK plants and sacked all its workers .
Staff reportedly received " six minutes " to clear their lockers , and redundancy terms far inferior to those they had been promised when Ford created the company nine years earlier .
Kevin Nolan , a Unite union official at the Visteon factory in Enfield in north London , was one of those fired .
" I 've always been a middle - of - the - road working man , " he says .
" I always voted Labour but I would n't say I was too leftwing . "
Yet the mass sackings radicalised him almost instantly .
" I started thinking , we 've got to come up with something .
This was a corporation which had decided to use the recession to walk away .
The initial plan was to ram a car through the main gates .
Then we found a gate round the back of the factory open – no one knows the plant better than the worker – and we could just walk in . "
Once inside , Nolan and between a third and two - thirds of the Enfield workforce ( accounts vary ) blocked up the entrances to the plant with plastic crates , climbed on to the roof and fire escape , and announced that they would occupy the premises until they were offered satisfactory redundancy terms .
Nolan and many of his colleagues had never been on strike , but they made beds out of cardboard on the chilly shopfloor and dug in .
Local people , some with no connection to the plant , brought them food and blankets .
Members of the SWP arrived .
" I said to them , ' I used to think you were a bunch of nutcases , ' " says Nolan .
" But they were very , very helpful . "
The Enfield occupation acquired a revolutionary tinge : " Do n't Need Politicians , Do n't Need Bosses , Workers Take Control , " read one placard prominent in the TV and web coverage .
The Visteon sit-ins led to pickets of Ford dealerships and the threat of walkouts at Ford factories .
In May , after less than five weeks ' campaigning , the Visteon workers were granted redundancy payments close to what they had originally demanded .
Other British factory occupations have followed , most recently at the Vestas wind turbine plant on the Isle of Wight .
But the ability of such well - publicised local episodes to restore a lasting momentum to the left is far from obvious .
Over the last 20 years , there have been intermittent waves of leftwing militancy – the huge and vivid anti-globalisation protests of the 90s , for example – while the underlying political assumptions of Britain and similar western countries have continued to move rightwards .
The modern left , its internal critics say , has become too fragmented , too utopian and divorced from how most people live .
Wainwright asks : " What is the underlying social force that 's going to be the basis of the left ?
In the mid-20th century it was the factory worker and the union member .
There are far fewer of them now . "
Solnit says : " I do n't see the networks in which great ideas circulate . "
Other people think the left has just run out of ideas .
" The feeling is still around that the left does n't have any solutions , " says Wilkinson .
" Actually , our society is full of alternative ways of organising things " – he cites the success of the Co-operative Bank , built on ethical investments – " but the left desperately needs a developed ideology . . . an analysis of society . "
When capitalism had its last great crisis of confidence in the 70s , the British right had a set of remedies and a whole alternative worldview – later called Thatcherism – ready and waiting , decades in the making .
Neal Lawson refers provocatively but also enviously to the early Thatcherites ' political and intellectual " brilliance " .
This time , perhaps the real challenge to the tottering status quo is not from the left at all .
" The greens share a lot of the ideas of the left , " says Mulgan , " but they are not in coalition with it , they are suspicious of it . "
Climate change is almost certain to make environmentalism more powerful .
" The dominant sectors of the economy in 10 or 20 years ' time , " Mulgan predicts , will not be banking and property but " environmental services , health , education .
This will be good for the left . "
Maybe .
Yet the left used to aim to change society rather than wait for society to change in its favour .
For the bankers , who seemed to be facing near - extinction less than a year ago , the prospect of much more slowly losing their dominance over western economies to Mulgan 's caring capitalists may not seem such a bad deal .
At the closing rally of Marxism 2009 , with all the seats eagerly taken but the air stale as ever in the main hall , the SWP 's national organiser Martin Smith interrupts his speech to read a short poem by the radical American writer Langston Hughes called Dream Deferred .
It is an odd but stirring interlude , at least at first .
The hall goes completely quiet ; the heavyset , middle - aged Smith switches from bare - fisted rhetoric to the ambiguity – half defeatism , half defiance – of Hughes ' verse : " What happens to a dream deferred ?/. . .
Maybe it just sags / Like a heavy load / Or does it explode ? "
But Smith rushes too quickly through the words and the moment is gone .
An interesting way to talk up the USD and appease some G20 members , get Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœhelicopterÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢
Ben to mention that rate hikes are on the table .
When ?
The million dollar question , when the US economy is Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœsufficiently strong enoughÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢.
Wow !
ThatÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s nailing it , a moving target that has capital markets scrambling to undo some of the directional play achieved by different asset classes this week .
Bonds are ending on a loosing streak and the USD has managed to retreat from its yearly lows .
With the long holiday weekend in the US ( Columbus Day ) , positions will be trimmed and some profits booked .
The US $ is stronger in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is higher against 14 of the 16 most actively traded currencies in another Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœwhippyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range .
Yippee !
US initial claims are trading lower .
Is this the new trend ?
Since an Aug. print of +575 k , yesterday we were treated to +521 k .
Skeptics will have us believe that despite a modest improvement w/w ( - 33 k ) , we are still above the psychological +500 k mark .
It was back in July when we last managed to print similar levels .
But , according to optimists , we are building up for a break below the psychological mark in the not too distant future .
Digging deeper , the decline in continuing claims came in better than expected ( +6.04 m vs. +6.11 m ) , however it was offset by a rise in emergency ( +3.32 m vs. +3.27 m ) and extended claims ( +443 k vs. +465 k ) .
This tells us that we continue to see claimants after their 26 - week duration migrate towards the emergency and extended benefit programs .
Over the past few months itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s becoming more of a predictable trend .
It not good news to see that both the emergency and extended benefits programs were revised higher last week .
The bigger question , what Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s going to happen when individuals finally become ineligible for any type of benefit program ?
Not surprising , other data showed that US wholesale inventories again dropped in Aug. ( - 1.3 % vs. - 1.6 % ) , this is the 12th consecutive decline .
Wholesalers have now been working through their inventories stocks on hand for the past year after being caught off - guard by the abrupt drop - off in demand late last year .
The inventory - to - sales ( I/S ) ratio constructively has also managed to tick lower in Aug. from 1.23 in July to 1.20 .
Its also heart warming to see that US retail sales increased + 1.1 % last month , the 1st gain in over a year .
Deep discounting dragged the sales figure along .
Both the BOE and ECB did what was expected of them , hold rates steady at +0.5 % and 1 % respectively .
No maverick tactics like their G20 co-member , the RBA , who hiked earlier in the week to 3.25 % .
Trichet said interest rates are Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœappropriateÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ and that the ECB has no plans to tighten policy any time soon .
Analysts expect them to be on hold well into next year .
Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœThe outcome of their monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium termÃ¢â‚¬â „¢ .
The fear of raising rates too soon , especially in this strong EUR environment , could curtail sustainable growth .
Their recovery is expected to be uneven .
Trichet believes that Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœit will be supported in the short term by temporary factors but will be hampered in the medium term by balance sheet issues at financial and non-financial institutionsÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
The USD $ is currently higher against the EUR - 0.40 % , GBP - 0.37 % , CHF - 0.47 % and JPY - 0.83 % .
The commodity currencies are weaker this morning , CAD - 0.22 % and AUD - 0.22 % .
The loonie is back on course and accelerating towards that psychological parity level vs. its largest trading partner .
Speculators believe that the pace of a global recovery may quicken after the Aussies posted better jobs numbers this week .
This has risk takers coveting commodity and high yielding currencies on pull backs .
The way the short end of the CAD yield curve was performing yesterday , it was like one was expecting the BOC to hike as soon as possible !
BOC governor Carney has been adamant that rates will remain accommodative until well into next year unless inflation concerns become an issue .
Canadian policy makers have been vocal of late expressing their reservations about a strong loonie and its implications on medium term growth .
This morning we get employment numbers , market consensus is already looking for a +5 k gain .
However be warned , do not be surprised to see a much stronger number based on seasonal adjustments to account for the loss of student summer jobs .
With a soft summer job ’s market , the BOC / Stats Canada , making their usual Sep. adjustments to account for the loss of summer positions could make for a higher than anticipated number !
Buying the rumor and selling the fact could endanger the looniesÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ weekly strength being unwound with anything less than +5 k !
Year - to - date , the loonie has gained +16 % vs. its southern partner and incidentally was the best - performing of G7 currencies against the greenback last week .
Combing stronger commodity prices and a weak USD sentiment , achieving parity before Christmas is within speculators grasp !
No wonder Governor Stevens at the RBA remains a firm hawk .
The Sept. Australian employment report this week beat all expectations , increasing by +40.6 k on the month vs. a forecast of - 10 k .
This probably provides another nail in the coffin for a 25 bp rate hike in Nov . !
The futures market is currently pricing in a +86 % chance of another hike .
Will the RBA be Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœgradualÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ in its monetary cycle or show rapid normalization of interest rates ?
( 0.9041 )
Crude is lower in the O/N session ( $ 71.09 down - 60 c ) .
Crude managed to reverse the previous dayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s losses with a vengeance yesterday .
This after falling close to - 2 % in it previous session , prices supported by signs of global economic recovery threatened resistance levels .
On the flip side , the weekly EIA report , while reporting a decline in crude , more importantly was a confirmation of still weak oil product demand in industrial fuels .
It seems that the market is not relying on fundamentals to price the black - stuff .
The EIA report should be bearish for the commodity .
The data showed that inventories of gas and distillate fuel ( includes heating oil and diesel ) increased .
Gas inventories rose + 2.94 m barrels to +214.4 m , w/w .
That was a threefold increase , way more than market consensus .
Distillate stocks advanced +679 k barrels to +171.8 m ( the highest print in 26 - years ! ) .
The gain in gas supplies has left inventories + 6.9 % higher than the 5 - year average .
Not to be outdone , distillate inventories are +30 % higher for the same time period .
Refineries are operating at +85 % of capacity , +0.4 % w/w .
In contrast , crude inventories declined - 978 k barrels to +337.4 m .
The market had expected a +2 m gain .
Despite this , stockpiles remain +10 % above the five - year average .
Strong evidence that demand destruction is alive and kicking .
Global output remains healthy .
Russia increased its production last month and has now surpassed Saudi Arabia as the largest produce .
They have just added to the global glut of the black - stuff .
With energy fundamentals remaining unconvincing , it would be a safe bet that crude should be confined to its $ 10 range of $ 65 -$ 75 .
Store of value , store of value !
Gold , like an unpredictable thoroughbred , has charged forward and managed to print new record highs this week .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s the debate of deflation and inflation that spurring the Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœyellow metalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ higher .
Investors are concerned that an economic recovery will promote inflation , this despite interest rate product telling us otherwise ( $ 1,058 ) .
With the USD gathering some strength in the O/N session , speculators have been content to pare some of their positions .
However support remains on pullbacks .
The Nikkei closed at 9,832 up +32 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 5,689 down - 23 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 5,119 up +30 .
The early call for the open of key US indices is lower .
The 10 - year bonds backed up 10 bp yesterday ( 3.26 % ) and are little changed in the O/N session .
It looks like treasuries are heading for a weekly loss on the back of Bernanke stating yesterday that the Fed is prepared to hike rates when the economic outlook Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœhas improved sufficiently Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
The decline in US jobless claims data is stronger evidence that the the US economic recovery is strengthening .
Most analysts still believe that the Fed will hold off raising interest rates until mid- 2010 as the recovery is likely Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœto be too weak to lift employment and incomes to inflationary levelsÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .

Why Interest - only mortgages are risky EXPERT OPINION : Will mortgage rates rise ?
fall ?
| Bankrate.com 's full rate trend report
Tens of thousands of financially strapped homeowners who have asked lenders to lower their mortgage payments are instead winding up with higher monthly payments and larger debts on their homes .
Homeowners who were hoping for lower payments are discovering to their dismay that lenders roll late fees , back taxes or other costs into the principal , sometimes turning a difficult payment into an impossible one .
That is one reason that many reworked mortgages are sliding back into default .
It 's too early to know if this pattern will continue under the Obama administration 's $ 75 billion initiative to get lenders to reduce monthly payments for homeowners struggling to make their mortgages .
A total of 360,165 mortgage modifications are now in a three - month trial period under the government 's plan announced in March .
But the initiative focuses on reducing interest rates rather than cutting principal , which has been found to be one of the most effective modifications for helping homeowners avoid defaulting a second time ( known as a " re-default " ) .
Of loans modified from Jan. 1 , 2008 , through March 31 , 2009 , monthly payments increased on 27 % and were left unchanged on an additional 27.5 % , according to a recent report by banking regulators .
Many modified mortgages fall delinquent — 25 % to 40 % , depending on the type of mortgage — often because of homeowners ' loss of income or additional outstanding debt , according to a report last month by CreditSights , a financial research firm .
" Payments have gone up …. ( and ) the payment relief can last for the first few years and then go up ( again ) , " says Alan White , assistant professor of law at the Valparaiso University School of Law in Valparaiso , Ind .
He has studied the subprime mortgage situation for 10 years .
" ( The lenders ) focus on today and not on the future . "
Even under the Obama plan , they do n't focus on permanent debt reduction , White says .
The majority of borrowers who 've gotten mortgage modifications have seen their overall principal balance go up , according to an analysis by CreditSights and ICP of about 660,000 mortgages modified this year .
In about 90 % of the modifications , the principal balance after a modification was larger , CreditSights said .
Hit with a 1 - 2 punch
That 's the situation facing Samantha and Steve Jensen .
When the couple bought their $ 550,000 home in Scottsdale , Ariz . , six years ago , they thought they 'd found the perfect place to raise their three children .
But when their adjustable - rate mortgage reset to a higher rate , they could no longer afford the monthly payments that jumped by about $ 1,000 a month , to $ 3,300 .
So they were relieved when their bank in June offered to modify their mortgage by lowering their interest rate .
Under the modification they were to pay $ 2,600 a month — but then they discovered they also had unpaid property taxes .
Once the bank added taxes to their principal , they say , their monthly mortgage payment grew to $ 3,500 .
They got a modification in June and are now two months behind on their mortgage payments and facing possible foreclosure .
" The bank could have done more and reduced our principal , " says Samantha , 40 , a special education teacher .
" You have the anticipation of relief and then you realize it 's not going to make it better .
It 's like being punched in the stomach twice . "
How most modifications work A mortgage modification can take several forms .
Lenders may allow borrowers to skip payments and then add the skipped payments to the amount of the loan .
They may reduce the interest rate charged , extend the loan term , or reduce the total amount of the loan by forgiving principal .
Many lenders say that reducing principal remains the modification of last resort .
More than 80 % of loan modifications that Wells Fargo has done in the past three months have led to lower payments for borrowers , but most involve rate reductions , the bank says .
Wells Fargo has done more than 240,000 modifications , and more than 30,000 of those have been under the Obama administration program .
At CitiMortgage , about 92 % of modifications involve reducing rates , lengthening terms of the loan , or both .
About 8 % provide principal reduction .
Providing relief to borrowers is complicated because of the financial interests of the parties on the other side of the loan .
Many mortgages are commonly sold to investors , and borrowers ' payments are collected by servicers , which may be the original lender or a different company .
Certain types of loans cannot be modified without the investors ' approval .
Lenders and investors may shy away from reducing a mortgage 's principal balance because that requires them to write down the value of the loan .
But temporarily reducing interest payments while adding to the mortgage 's principal avoids any loss .
Some research suggests lenders may gain financially if they do n't modify a mortgage at all .
According to a paper published this year by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston , more than 30 % of delinquent borrowers fix their situation on their own and are able to pay even if no action is taken .
Another reason lenders might resist modifications is the combined impact of high re-default rates and falling property values in many markets .
A lender might calculate that helping a borrower avert foreclosure now only risks a deeper loss if the house goes to foreclosure anyway a year later .
And some lenders say even if they modify loans , so many homeowners are underwater — meaning their homes are worth less than their mortgages — that some borrowers are defaulting on purpose , " walking away " after the lender has spent money and time renegotiating the loan .
" We have customers who can afford the payments but are underwater .
They default not because they have to , but because it 's better for them , " says Jack Shackett , Bank of America 's head of credit - loss prevention .
" They can act like they want the modification and then they still default , so they 've stayed for three to four months in the house for free . "
The Obama administration 's plan tries to overcome some of these barriers by imposing a three - month trial period during which borrowers must pay the renegotiated mortgage , discouraging them from walking away .
Also , the emphasis under the Obama administration plan is on getting lower monthly payments for homeowners .
Servicers must follow an established process to reduce the monthly payment to no more than 31 % of the borrowers ' gross monthly income .
To do that , lenders will first reduce the interest rate on the loan and then extend the original term of the loan to up to 40 years .
" In the past , modification increased the burdens on borrowers .
Under the president 's plan , it reduces payments to a meaningful level , " says Michael Barr , assistant secretary for financial institutions at Treasury .
" Investors and servicers get incentives and are paid only if loans succeed . "
Under the program , mortgage holders and investors receive a one - time government payment of $ 1,500 for each modification agreement completed with borrowers who are current when they begin the program .
Short - term vs. long - term help Mounting unemployment and loss of income threaten to complicate efforts to prevent foreclosures , even for mortgages that are substantially modified .
That 's why some banks and economists are pushing for short - term personal loans to the jobless , or a break for several months in making payments .
A recent Federal Reserve Bank of Boston study suggests that to reduce foreclosures , the government should shift its focus from providing mortgage help to directing more financial assistance to those who lose their jobs .
The authors say one strategy might be giving loans or grants to individual homeowners for a year or two to help them through difficult periods so they do n't lose their homes .
Some lenders are already trying similar tactics on their own .
Bank of America is occasionally offering temporary mortgage forgiveness for three to six months in hopes the borrower will find a new job in that time .
It is pushing the government to initiate such a program nationwide .
" Our view all along is that that will be a very effective way to address the problem , " says Paul Willen , one author on the Federal Reserve study .
" A lot of what 's being done is a misplaced focus on modest , long - term relief when what they need is fast , short - term , massive relief ( due to job loss ) . "
One such homeowner is Carol Cole , 71 , who received a modification in February that cut her payments from more than $ 3,000 a month to $ 2,500 .
That 's still $ 500 more a month than she was paying when she bought her $ 575,000 house in Santa Rosa Beach , Fla. , about five years ago .
With income from her spa business falling , she 's worried she 'll become delinquent on her mortgage as soon as this winter .
Cole has applied for another modification , but she says her bank has told her she has to wait 12 months to qualify for help .
Her lender , Bank of America , said it had to deny her request for a further modification because the investor who holds her mortgage does not participate in the government 's modification program .
However the bank is continuing to pursue the case .
" It 's a terrible challenge ( making the payments ) and I 'm trying not to fall behind , but it 's going to get to the point I can't make it , " Cole says .
" This affects your health , your relationships .
You do n't eat or sleep . "

Regaining control of the body ( Image : Daniel Chang )
A MONKEY sits on a bench , wires running from its head and wrist into a small box of electronics .
At first the wrist lies limp , but within 10 minutes the monkey begins to flex its muscles and move its hand from side to side .
The movements are clumsy , but they are enough to justify a rewarding slug of juice .
After all , it should n’t be able to move its wrist at all .
A nerve connection in the monkey ’s upper arm had previously been blocked with an anaesthetic that prevented signals travelling from its brain to its wrist , leaving the muscles temporarily paralysed .
The monkey was only able to move its arm because the wires and the black box bypassed the broken link .
The monkey was in Eberhard Fetz ’s lab at the University of Washington in Seattle .
The experiment , performed last year , was the first demonstration of a new treatment that might one day cure paralysis , which is typically caused by a broken connection in the spinal cord .
Though much work has focused on using stem cells to regrow damaged nerve fibres , some researchers believe that an electronic bypass like this is equally viable .
The idea is to implant electronic chips in the relevant regions of the brain to record neural activity .
Then a decoder deciphers the neural chatter , often from thousands of neurons , to figure out what the brain wants the body to do .
These messages must then be relayed – ideally wirelessly – to electrodes that deliver a pulse of electricity to stimulate the muscles into action .
Such “ brain chips ” are …
“ Blue haze , ” a common occurrence that appears over heavily forested areas around the world , is formed by natural emissions of chemicals , but human activities can worsen it to the point of affecting the world ’s weather and even cause potential climate problems , according to a study led by a Texas A&M University researcher .
Renyi Zhang , professor of atmospheric sciences who has studied air chemistry for more than 20 years , says blue haze ( tiny particles or aerosols suspended in the air ) can be negatively affected by human activities such as power plants or fossil - fuel burning .
Team members included researchers from Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York , the Molina Center for Energy and Environment in La Jolla , Calif. , and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
Their work is published in the current Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and the project was funded by the Welch Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy .
Zhang says man-made activities , mainly large power plants that emit huge amounts of particles into the air , can worsen blue haze and cause previously unforeseen problems .
“ The study shows that the natural way of blue haze formation is rather inefficient and that human activities make blue haze conditions worse , ” he confirms .
“ What happens is that a mix of natural and man-made chemicals speeds up the formation of these particles in the Earth ’s atmosphere , and there , they reflect sunlight back into space .
The results can affect cloud formations and ultimately , much of the world ’s climate . ”
When you walk through a forest or even a large grassy area , it ’s not uncommon to be able to smell the plants around you , such as pine trees or other vegetation .
That smell is nature ’s way of naturally making organic gases produced by the plants themselves , often millions of tons per day .

Plants , especially trees , emit such gases through their leaves and when an overabundance of such gases is produced , it creates a blue aura , commonly called a “ blue haze . ”
Perhaps the best example occurs in the Great Smokey Mountains National Park area of the Southeast United States , where blue haze exists almost on a daily basis , but the condition also occurs all over the world .
When man -made activities emit sulfur dioxide into the air , they contribute to blue haze , usually in a negative way , Zhang explains .
Aerosols can be produced by many different processes that occur on land and water or in the atmosphere itself , he notes .
“ Weather patterns can be affected worldwide and the blue haze can worsen the breathing problems of many people , such as those who suffer from asthma or emphysema , ” he adds .
“ The chemistry of Earth ’s atmosphere can be directly affected by these aerosols .
From cloud formations to health problems and air pollution , much of it can be traced back to these aerosol particles , ” he adds , noting that aerosol particles can influence the size and rate of cloud droplets , directly affecting cloud cover and precipitation .
Coal plants , Zhang says , often produced sulfur dioxide , a highly toxic substance that reach the Earth ’s atmosphere and helps the formation of aerosol particles .
The problem is not new .
Zhang says former President Ronald Reagan mentioned it during a speech almost 30 years ago .
“ About 80 percent of our air pollution stems from hydrocarbons released by vegetation , ” Reagan noted during a 1980 speech to an environmental group .
Zhang says more research is needed to “ study the full extent of how blue haze is affected by human activities , and perhaps to look at ways to control the situation .
It ’s a problem that can have global consequences . ”

About 44 % of the distinct set of words in this novel , such as " matrimonial " , occur only once , and so are hapax legomena ( red ) .
About 17 % , such as " dexterity " , appear twice ( so - called dis legomena , in blue ) .

About 44 % of the distinct set of words in this novel , such as " matrimonial " , occur only once , and so are ( red ) .
About 17 % , such as " dexterity " , appear twice ( so - called , in blue ) .
Zipf 's law predicts that the words in this plot should approximate a straight line with slope - 1 .
In corpus linguistics , a hapax legomenon ( also or ; [ 1 ] [ 2 ] pl. hapax legomena ; sometimes abbreviated to hapax ) is a word that occurs only once within a context , either in the written record of an entire language , in the works of an author , or in a single text .
The term is sometimes incorrectly used to describe a word that occurs in just one of an author 's works , but more than once in that particular work .
Hapax legomenon is a transliteration of Greek ἅπαξ λεγ όμενον , meaning " ( something ) being said ( only ) once " . [ 3 ]
The related terms dis legomenon , tris legomenon , and tetrakis legomenon respectively ( , , ) refer to double , triple , or quadruple occurrences , but are far less commonly used .
Hapax legomena are quite common , as predicted by Zipf 's law , [ 4 ] which states that the frequency of any word in a corpus is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table .
For large corpora , about 40 % to 60 % of the words are hapax legomena , and another 10 % to 15 % are dis legomena . [ 5 ]
Thus , in the Brown Corpus of American English , about half of the 50,000 distinct words are hapax legomena within that corpus . [ 6 ]
Hapax legomenon refers to a word 's appearance in a body of text , not to either its origin or its prevalence in speech .
It thus differs from a nonce word , which may never be recorded , may find currency and may be widely recorded , or may appear several times in the work which coins it , and so on .
Significance [ edit ]
Hapax legomena in ancient texts are usually difficult to decipher , since it is easier to infer meaning from multiple contexts than from just one .
For example , many of the remaining undeciphered Mayan glyphs are hapax legomena , and Biblical ( particularly Hebrew ; see § Hebrew examples ) hapax legomena sometimes pose problems in translation .
Hapax legomena also pose challenges in natural language processing . [ 7 ]
Some scholars consider Hapax legomena useful in determining the authorship of written works .
P. N. Harrison , in The Problem of the Pastoral Epistles ( 1921 ) [ 8 ] made hapax legomena popular among Bible scholars , when he argued that there are considerably more of them in the three Pastoral Epistles than in other Pauline Epistles .
He argued that the number of hapax legomena in a putative author 's corpus indicates his or her vocabulary and is characteristic of the author as an individual .
Harrison 's theory has faded in significance due to a number of problems raised by other scholars .
For example , in 1896 , W. P. Workman found the following numbers of hapax legomena in each Pauline Epistle : Romans 113 , I Cor. 110 , II Cor. 99 , Gal. 34 , Eph. 43 Phil. 41 , Col. 38 , I Thess .
23 , II Thess .
11 , Philemon 5 , I Tim. 82 , II Tim. 53 , Titus 33 .
At first glance , the last three totals ( for the Pastoral Epistles ) are not out of line with the others . [ 9 ]
To take account of the varying length of the epistles , Workman also calculated the average number of hapax legomena per page of the Greek text , which ranged from 3.6 to 13 , as summarized in the diagram on the right .
[ 9 ]
Although the Pastoral Epistles have more hapax legomena per page , Workman found the differences to be moderate in comparison to the variation among other Epistles .
This was reinforced when Workman looked at several plays by Shakespeare , which showed similar variations ( from 3.4 to 10.4 per page of Irving 's one - volume edition ) , as summarized in the second diagram on the right . [ 9 ]
Apart from author identity , there are several other factors that can explain the number of hapax legomena in a work : [ 10 ]
text length : this directly affects the expected number and percentage of hapax legomena ; the brevity of the Pastoral Epistles also makes any statistical analysis problematic .
; the brevity of the Pastoral Epistles also makes any statistical analysis problematic .
text topic : if the author writes on different subjects , of course many subject - specific words will occur only in limited contexts .
text audience : if the author is writing to a peer rather than a student , or their spouse rather than their employer , again quite different vocabulary will appear .
time : over the course of years , both the language and an author 's knowledge and use of language will change .
In the particular case of the Pastoral Epistles , all of these variables are quite different from those in the rest of the Pauline corpus , and hapax legomena are no longer widely accepted as strong indicators of authorship ( although the authorship of the Pastorals is subject to debate on other grounds ) . [ 11 ]
There are also subjective questions over whether two forms amount to " the same word " : dog vs. dogs , clue vs. clueless , sign vs. signature ; many other gray cases also arise .
The Jewish Encyclopedia points out that , although there are 1,500 hapaxes in the Hebrew Bible , only about 400 are not obviously related to other attested word forms . [ 12 ]
It would not be especially difficult for a forger to construct a work with any percentage of hapax legomena desired .
However , it seems unlikely that forgers much before the 20th century would have conceived such a ploy , much less thought it worth the effort .[ citation needed ]
A final difficulty with the use of hapax legomena for authorship determination is that there is considerable variation among works known to be by a single author , and disparate authors often show similar values .
In other words , hapax legomena are not a reliable indicator .
Authorship studies now usually use a wide range of measures to look for patterns rather than relying upon single measurements .
Computer science [ edit ]
In the fields of computational linguistics and natural language processing ( NLP ) , esp. corpus linguistics and machine - learned NLP , it is common to disregard hapax legomena ( and sometimes other infrequent words ) , as they are likely to have little value for computational techniques .
This disregard has the added benefit of significantly reducing the memory use of an application , since , by Zipf 's law , many words are hapax legomena . [ 13 ]

The following are some examples of hapax legomena in languages or corpora .

Chinese and Japanese characters [ edit ]
Classical Chinese and Japanese literature contains many Chinese characters that feature only once in the corpus , and their meaning and pronunciation has often been lost .
Known in Japanese as kogo ( 孤語 ) , literally " lonely characters " , these can be considered a type of hapax legomenon . [ 15 ]
For example , the Classic of Poetry ( c. 1000 BC ) uses the character 篪 exactly once in the verse " 伯氏吹埙，仲氏吹篪 " , and it was only through the discovery of a description by Guo Pu ( 276-324 AD ) that the character could be associated with a specific type of ancient flute .

Jenson Button sealed the drivers ' championship with a sublime recovery drive at a dramatic Brazilian Grand Prix won by Red Bull 's Mark Webber .
Brawn 's English driver started from 14th but executed a series of spectacular early overtaking moves before finishing the race fifth .
He was already set to clinch the crown when a late puncture dropped main title threat Rubens Barrichello to eighth .
Brawn still took the constructors ' championship in their debut season .
Barrichello , who badly wanted to win on a circuit he was born in the shadow of , was running third before his unlucky puncture smoothed team - mate Button 's path to the title he seemed destined for since his explosive start to the season .
That race , to me , was worthy of becoming world champion .
The perfect way to do it
Jenson Button BMW Sauber 's Robert Kubica was second ahead of McLaren 's Lewis Hamilton while six drivers retired at Interlagos .
Red Bull 's German Sebastian Vettel , who started just behind Button , finished fourth while Toro Rosso 's Sebastien Buemi was a season - best seventh .
Button 's maiden world title overshadowed the grand prix , but the race certainly delivered a fitting scene for a deserved success .
With the stands bubbling over with atmosphere , anticipation was sky - high at the Sao Paulo track where the world championship has now been decided in the past five years .
And the drama began as soon the race got under way .
Barrichello made a rapid start while Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen jumped up to third using his energy - boost ( Kers ) button before suffering front - wing damage in a frenetic first lap .
But a contentious first - lap collision took out Toyota 's Jarno Trulli and Force India 's Adrian Sutil and led the pair to engage in a furious argument at the side of the track - both blaming the other .
The crash also took out Renault 's Fernando Alonso .
In all the title excitement , Webber 's superb win was almost overlooked Trulli was later reprimanded and fined $ 10,000 ( £ 6,140 ) for his behaviour following the incident .
Seconds later , in the pits , McLaren 's Heikki Kovalainen pulled away with the fuel hose still attached to his car .
The leaking fuel immediately caught fire right in Raikkonen 's face , although it quickly died away and both Finns were able to rejoin the race .
After the race , Kovalainen was handed a 25 - second penalty , demoting him from ninth to 12th , and McLaren fined $ 50,000 for releasing him in an unsafe manner .
All the while 29 - year - old Button had managed to steer clear , literally , of any trouble to jump up into ninth place after starting the race down in a potentially - disastrous position near the back of the pack .
Buoyed by another stroke of luck in a season in which he has worked so hard for it , he fearlessly set about improving his position with a superb display of bravery and surgeon - like precision once the safety car came in on lap six .
Charging Button first used persistence to take Romain Grosjean 's Renault on the outside to move into eighth before eating up the Williams of Kazuki Nakajima to go seventh and then quickly setting about Toyota 's Kamui Kobayashi .
The Japanese Formula 1 debutant defended strongly .
But Button , who had been losing time to Barrichello and Webber up front , used all his nous to dummy himself into a clever pass on lap 24 .
Barrichello , meanwhile , had not quite managed to put enough space between himself and Australia 's Webber and the Brazilian lost the lead during the first pit stops .
His hopes of victory faded immediately as he was overtaken by Vettel after rejoining and then got caught up in traffic .
Button continued his aggressive approach despite having moved into a decent position , and after pitting on lap 29 he managed to execute another overtaking manoeuvre as he crucially slipped past Buemi .
Nakajima careered off the track at the end of the back straight on lap 31 after Kobayashi moved over on him .
At this point Webber was clocking fastest laps for fun and team - mate Vettel was driving superbly well , both drivers pushing their impressive Red Bull cars to the limit .
Button - who won six of the first seven races of 2009 but has endured a tough second half of the season - met the test of nerve he faced until the finish head on and in style , unlocking a flood of emotion as he crossed the finish line .
" The last few races have been a bit stressful for me , especially qualifying , " a jubilant Button told BBC Sport .
" But that race today , to me , was worthy of becoming world champion .
Kobayashi is absolutely crazy , very aggressive .
It was a great race , really enjoyable .
That was the perfect way to do it . "
On 89 points , Button heads to Abu Dhabi on 1 November with an unassailable lead in the championship while Vettel has leapfrogged Barrichello into second on 74 with the Brazilian now on 72 .
MARK HUGHES COLUMN
How can a driver who took until his seventh season to even win a race really be mentioned in the same breath as such instant legends as Fernando Alonso or Lewis Hamilton ?
Very easily , actually
Mark Hughes
BBC F1 commentary box producer " It was a great car to drive all year , " said Barrichello .
" Jenson won it and deserved it but he won it in the first six or seven races .
" The second half of the season was mine ... and I fought really hard .
I 'm pleased for Jenson as a friend and as a great champion . "
Hamilton started the race from back in 17th but the man who now hands over his world crown to compatriot Button was typically aggressive as he made the most of the circumstances that he encountered to finish on the podium .
Stewards decided to take ' no further action ' on the Sutil - Trulli incident , though Toyota 's Italian was fined £ 6,000 for failing to leave the track as required and confronting Sutil in an aggressive manner .
Nakajima retired after his crash mid-way through , while Nico Rosberg and Nick Heidfeld could not make the distance .

In Osama bin Laden 's most recent message to the American people , he clearly demonstrates that he knows much more about the real workings of American government and politics than the average voting American .
Most people who waste their time voting sincerely believe that their vote matters and will make a difference .
They do n't realize that the politicians do not have to answer to them , they must instead answer to those who put them in office by giving them grotesque amounts of money and who influence what kind of press coverage they 'll receive .
Osama bin Laden knows better !
In his statement to the American people , bin Laden tries to educate the American people to how the U.S. government really works .
He explains that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were brought about by politicians obeying the Israel lobby and powerful corporate interests .
By voting for Obama , bin Laden explained , the voters only changed the face in the White House , they did not change the official neoconservative policy .
For example , Israel has refused to stop building Jewish settlements and apartments on Palestinian land and continues to occupy all of Jerusalem .
Obama made it clear to the Israelis that he was not pleased with their continued violations of all the peace agreements and ' road maps ' between Israel and the Palestinians that their continued expansion demonstrates .
Yesterday Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told American officials that Israel is continuing with their 2,500 apartments already under constructions as well as with 450 new apartments for Jews authorized just last week .
If bin Laden was wrong , Obama would tell Israel that he is freezing the BILLIONS in U.S. tax dollars he and the other U.S. politicians voted to give to Israel this year until Israel leaves all Palestinian lands and returns to its pre-1967 borders .
Another very important way Obama could prove bin Laden wrong is to promote the Arab League 's call to have Israel 's nuclear weapons monitored by international agencies .
Just as Israel demanded that Iraq 's nuclear programs be inspected and are now demanding inspections of Iran 's nuclear program ( keep in mind that while Iraq never had nuclear weapons and that U.S. intelligence does not believe Iran currently has nuclear weapons , Israel does actually possess nuclear weapons ) , the U.S. should demand the international inspection of Israel 's nuclear program , of their nuclear weapons and of any other weapons of mass destruction the Jewish state may have .
One person bin Laden does prove to be correct is Michael Scheuer , who was the leader of the bin Laden team in the CIA .
He wrote a thought provoking and revealing book called Imperial Hubris .
In the book he writes , ' The question is whether U.S. interests require Americans to be Israel 's protectors and endure the endless blood - and - treasure costs of that role .
Status quo U.S. policy toward Israel will result in unending war with Islam . '
Reinforcing Scheuer 's words , bin Laden said in his address to the American people , ' To the American people , this is my message to you : a reminder of the reasons behind 9/11 and the wars and the repercussions that followed and the way to resolve it .
Ask yourselves to determine your position : are your security , your blood , your children , your money , your jobs , your homes , your economy and reputation dearer to you than the security of the Israelis , their children and their economy ?
The bitter truth is that the neoconservatives continue to cast their heavy shadows upon you . "
Those of us who realize the futility in voting need to do all we can to educate others to the reality of government .
Change can never be brought to a corrupt system by playing by the rules that the corrupt system created .
The Crystal Cave of Giants was accidentally discovered in 2000 by miners working in the silver and lead mine at Naica , Mexico .
It lies almost 300 meters ( 900 feet ) below the surface of the Earth and it contains the largest crystals known in the world , by far .
The largest crystals are over 11 meters long ( 36 feet ) and weigh 55 tons .
The crystals themselves are made of selenite which is crystallized gypsum , the same material used in drywall construction .
Except these crystals formed over a span of about half a million years in a hot water solution , saturated with minerals .
The the temperature inside the cave remained very consistently hot for the entire time the crystals were growing .
It is still incredibly hot in the cave due its proximity to a magma chamber , deep underground .
The air temperature is 50C with a relative humidity of over 90 % , making the air feel like an unbearable 105C ( 228 F )
Entering the cave without special protective suits can be fatal in 15 minutes .
I will be entering the cave wearing a special cooling suit with chilling packs inside and a specialized backpack respirator which will allow me to breath chilled air .
Even with all this equipment , I will still only be able to stay in the cave for no more than 45 minutes at a time .
In extreme heat , the body begins to lose higher brain functions which made the expedition much more difficult with the risk of falling into deep pits , or being impaled on a sharp crystal .
All the camera gear needs to be slowly brought up to temperature beforehand by pre-heating it and most cameras with moving parts and tape mechanisms simply will not work at all .

This may seem strange , since CAPM and the broader work it inspired were based on the assumption that investors make mathematically optimal investment decisions with the information at their disposal .
As a result , Eugene Fama , of Chicago ’s business school , wrote , “ actual market prices are , on the basis of all available information , best estimates of intrinsic values . ”
Fama called a market with this virtue an “ efficient market ” — and argued that the data showed that real - world financial markets are , in fact , efficient , or very nearly so .
But if the markets are already getting it right , who needs finance professors ?
In fact , however , Wall Street was eager to hire “ rocket scientists , ” especially after Fischer Black and Myron Scholes , working at M.I.T. ’s Sloan School , came up with a formula that seemingly solved the puzzle of how to value options — contracts that give investors the right to buy or sell assets at predetermined prices .
The quintessential collaboration between big money and academic superstars was the hedge fund Long - Term Capital Management , whose partners included Scholes and Robert Merton , with whom Scholes shared another finance Nobel .
L.T.C.M. eventually imploded , nearly taking the world economy down with it .
But efficient - markets theory retained its hold on financial thought .
All along , there were critical voices .
Robert Shiller , who has become famous for predicting both the Internet crash and the housing bust , first made his mark by casting statistical doubt on the evidence for efficient markets .
Lawrence Summers , now a senior official in the Obama administration , began a paper on financial markets thus : “ THERE ARE IDIOTS .
Look around . ”
And a whole counter­culture emerged in the form of “ behavioral finance , ” which argued that investors are irrational in predictable ways .
But the sheer scope and sweep of the efficient markets hypothesis — not to mention the fact that so many people devoted their careers to it — allowed it to brush off most of these challenges .
Of course , there have always been men of affairs wise enough to see past the current dogma .
In “ The Sages , ” Charles R. Morris profiles three of them : George Soros , Warren Buffett and Paul Volcker .
Morris , the author of “ The Trillion Dollar Meltdown , ” does n’t have much patience with economic theory , and it shows ; I almost gave up on the book after Morris managed , in the space of just a few pages , to thoroughly misrepresent the ideas of both John Maynard Keynes and Milton Friedman .
But the book comes to life with its personal profiles , especially the surprisingly endearing portrait of Warren Buffett as a young man .
Do the lives of the sages carry useful lessons for the rest of us ?
Soros does n’t really seem to have a method , except that of being smarter than anyone else .
Buffett does have a method — figure out what a company is really worth , and buy it if you can get it cheap — but it ’s not a method that would work for anyone without his gifts .
And Volcker ’s main asset is his implacable integrity , which most mortals would find hard to match .
Indeed , I came away from reading these books wondering if their shared under­lying premise — that the current crisis will put an end to Panglossian views of financial markets — is right .
Fox points out that academic belief in the perfection of financial markets survived the 1987 stock market crash and the bursting of the Internet bubble .
Why should the reaction to the latest catastrophe be any different ?
In fact , what I hear from my finance professor friends is that there ’s a lot less soul - searching under way than you might expect .
And Wall Street ’s appetite for complex strategies that sound clever — and can be sold to credulous investors — survived L.T.C.M.’s debacle ; why ca n’t it survive this crisis , too ?
My guess is that the myth of the rational market — a myth that is beautiful , comforting and , above all , lucrative — is n’t going away anytime soon .

Although IBEX is far from the heliopause ( it ’s orbiting the Earth with an apogee of 322,000 kilometers and a perigee of 16,000 kilometers ) , its instruments are tuned to study energetic neutral particles ( ENAs ) swept up by the solar wind in the boundary between the edge of the heliosphere and interstellar space beyond .
IBEX has been mapping this area since last October .
And here comes the surprise , as explained by IBEX principal investigator David J. McComas ( SwRI ) :
“ The IBEX results are truly remarkable , with emissions not resembling any of the current theories or models of this never - before - seen region .
We expected to see small , gradual spatial variations at the interstellar boundary , some ten billion miles away .
However , IBEX is showing us a very narrow ribbon that is two to three times brighter than anything else in the sky . ”

Yes , we ’ve got two Voyager spacecraft out there , but IBEX is giving us the big picture , imaging the region not with photons but ENAs from its distant vantage in a highly elliptical Earth orbit .
It ’s focusing on the so - called ‘ termination shock , ’ where the solar wind collides with interstellar gas .
As they pass through the region , neutral hydrogen and oxygen atoms are dragged by the plasma at the interstellar boundary , while neutral helium passes straight through .
Tracing their different arrival directions tells the tale .
McComas adds :
“ The most astounding feature in the IBEX sky maps — the bright narrow ribbon — snakes through the sky between the Voyager spacecraft , where it remained completely undetected until now . ”

This image illustrates one possible explanation for the bright ribbon of emission seen in the IBEX map .
The galactic magnetic field shapes the heliosphere as it drapes over it .
The ribbon appears to trace the area where the magnetic field is most parallel to the surface of the heliosphere ( the heliopause ) .

We ’re learning that our Solar System ’s interactions with the interstellar medium are more intense than previously believed .
As helpful as Voyager ’s point measurements are , we now see the region far more clearly .
And because the ribbon these data reveal seems to be governed by the direction of the local interstellar magnetic field , it appears that the interstellar medium has a much greater influence on the heliosphere than we originally thought .

BALI , Indonesia ( Reuters ) - Cases of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis are underdiagnosed around the world and even among those who have been diagnosed , only a fraction are being treated , a Global Fund official said on Monday .
A patient with tuberculosis sits on a bed in " Tuberculosis Village , " a separate health facility at a clinic run by the medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres ( Doctors Without Borders ) , in the town of Nasir in southeastern Sudan , June 20 , 2009 .

“ The Global Fund is funding about 25,000 to 30,000 patients but the estimated total number of cases is 500,000 , ” Michel Kazatchkine , executive director of the Global Fund ’s effort to fight HIV / AIDS , TB and malaria , told an HIV / AIDS conference .
“ So we are very far off .
It is a dangerous epidemic that is spreading , ” he told the conference in Bali .
“ There is an underdiagnosis of MDR - TB . ”
The Asia -Pacific region has the highest number of multi-drug resistant TB ( MDR - TB ) , but only one percent of the cases are being treated , he added .
Most cases of TB can be cured with a drug regimen of 6 to 8 months .
Multi - drug resistant TB emerges when there is improper use of antibiotics in fighting regular TB , such as failure to complete the whole course of treatment .
People with HIV / AIDS are especially susceptible to falling ill with TB because their immune systems are compromised .
An estimated one - third of people living with HIV are co-infected with TB , and TB continues to be the leading cause of death among people living with HIV .
The emergence of multi-drug resistant TB and extensively drug - resistant TB in recent years poses a significant public health threat , especially for countries with high HIV prevalence .
Multi - drug resistant TB is resistant to two of the most powerful TB drugs , isoniazid and rifampicin .
Kazatchkine said treatment for someone with multi-drug resistant TB costs US $ 7,000 a year , about 100 times the cost of treating regular TB .
“ The best way to prevent resistant TB is to get people to take the whole course of standard TB drugs , ” he said .
He stressed , however , there was still an urgency to allocate more money to treat people with multi-drug resistant TB .
“ If we can do it for H1N1 , we can do it for TB .
These epidemics have been at ( pandemic ) level 6 plus plus plus plus for years , ” he said .
Boy , this is looking real familiar for the Philadelphia Phillies .
Ruiz and Raul Ibanez hit three - run homers , reliever Ryan Madson got a key out and Lidge finished off the Phillies ' 8 - 6 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 1 of the NL championship series Thursday night .
" We do have the talent and just that sort of fight , that we 're going to do everything we can to get those big hits in those big moments , " Hamels said .
" Our offense is really what 's setting the tone . "
Philadelphia took a 2 - 0 lead in last year 's best - of - seven NLCS , beat the Dodgers in five games and went on to win the World Series .
" Well , they had our number today , " Dodgers catcher Russell Martin said .
" Tomorrow is a different day , and last year is over with . "
Manny Ramirez homered , but grounded out weakly with two runners on against a struggling Madson to end the Dodgers ' two - run rally in the eighth .
Their 14 hits set a club record in a single LCS game , but they stranded 10 runners .
" It 's like a prize fight , we just came up a little short , " Dodgers manager Joe Torre said .
Lidge worked around a single and a walk in the ninth , helped by a double play that made him for 3 for 3 in save chances this postseason -- he posted three saves against the Dodgers in last year 's NLCS .
Lidge was perfect in save tries all last year , but led the majors with 11 blown opportunities this season .
" The Dodgers are a great team .
They come from behind a lot so you take everyone seriously , " he said .
" Honestly , for some reason I 've really been locked in this postseason .
I felt really good mechanically .
I feel like myself .
I feel pretty comfortable right now . "
Home runs dominated on both sides in a game that lasted 4 hours , 2 minutes .
Ruiz highlighted a five - run burst in the fifth and Ibanez homered in the eighth for an 8 - 4 lead as the Dodgers failed to neutralize the Phillies ' left - handed hitting .
" The Dodgers are n't going to back down .
We know they 're going to come in waves and continue to fight , and that 's what they did , " Howard said .
" We just needed that one big hit to kind of get us over the hump , and Carlos came through .
We got guys on , and guys came through when we needed big hits . "
James Loney also connected for the Dodgers .
Ramirez , baseball 's all - time postseason home run leader with 29 , hit a two - run shot .
Los Angeles will start Vicente Padilla against Philadelphia's Pedro Martinez on Friday afternoon in Game 2 .
Hamels thrived under pressure last October , earning NLCS and World Series MVP honors .
But the left - hander hardly resembled the same pitcher in earning the victory , giving up a postseason career - high eight hits and two homers .
He allowed four runs in 5 1/3 innings .
It was his first outing since he left the ballpark in the division series against Colorado to be with his wife as she prepared to give birth .
" It does n't look good on paper , but there were a lot of times where the counts were in my favor and I kept them off - balance , " Hamels said .
" Unfortunately , some of the results were n't there , but in the key situations , I was able to get what I needed . "
At 21 years and 211 days , Clayton Kershaw was the youngest pitcher ever to start a Game 1 in a league championship series , and it showed .
The Dodgers lefty was tagged for five runs in the fifth , when he set a LCS record for most wild pitches in an inning with three .
He also tied the record for most wild pitches in a LCS game , shared by Tommy John and Juan Guzman .
" The first four innings I felt great , and then I could n't make adjustments fast enough .
In the playoffs , you 're not going to have a lot of leverage .
If you do n't make your pitches , before long you 're out of there , " he said .
" I just got out of the strike zone a little bit , and that 's what happens .
They make you pay for that . "
Kershaw allowed four hits in 4 2/3 innings and walked five in his second postseason career start .
He worked out of the bullpen in last year 's NLCS , which the Dodgers lost 4 - 1 to the Phillies .
He was 0 - 2 with a 5.23 ERA in two starts against them during the regular season .
" It looked like he tried to overthrow the ball , got frustrated out there .
Unfortunately , it got away from him quickly , " Torre said .
" As far as the pressure of the game , he certainly can handle it , but sometimes things get away from you . "
The Dodgers ' usually solid bullpen could n't contain the Phils .
George Sherrill , their fourth reliever of the game , gave up Ibanez 's homer on the first pitch , the first homer off him by a left - handed hitter this year .
Howard and Jayson Werth drew consecutive walks to open the eighth .
" I was trying not to do too much , stroke a line drive , " Ibanez said .
" Fortunately , I got it in the air and it carried out of the park . "
The Dodgers got two runs back in the bottom half on Martin's RBI single and a sacrifice fly by Rafael Furcal .
They had the tying runs at first and third with two outs , but Madson won a showdown when Ramirez grounded to third .
Kershaw retired five of the previous six batters he faced before the Phillies got to him .
Ibanez led off with a single and took second on a wild pitch before Kershaw walked Pedro Feliz .
Ruiz sent a 2 - 1 pitch into the " Mannywood " section in left field for a 3 - 1 lead .
Jimmy Rollins reached on a fielder 's choice , then advanced two bases on consecutive wild pitches .
Chase Utley walked and Howard hit a two - run double , extending the Phillies ' lead to 5 - 1 . Howard passed Hall of Famer Mike Schmidt with his 17th postseason RBI , most in Phillies ' history .
The Dodgers closed to 5 - 4 with three runs in the bottom half .
Ramirez hit his first home run since Sept. 18 , a drive into the left - field pavilion off Hamels .
Martin , who led off with a double , scored on Andre Ethier 's grounder .
Ramirez 's RBIs gave him 78 in the postseason , putting him three away from breaking baseball 's career record of 80 by Bernie Williams .
Los Angeles threatened in the sixth , loading the bases on consecutive singles by Loney and Ronnie Belliard off Hamels and a two - out walk to pinch - hitter Jim Thome by J.A. Happ .
But Happ retired Furcal on a grounder to end the inning .
Loney got his first RBI of this postseason when he drove Hamels ' 2 - 1 pitch just over the right - field fence leading off the second , giving the Dodgers a 1 - 0 lead .
Game notes
The Dodgers have lost Game 1 of the NLCS in each of their last three appearances .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The number of first - time filers for unemployment insurance rose last week , snapping two weeks of significant declines , according to a government report issued Thursday .
There were 531,000 initial jobless claims filed in the week ended Oct. 17 , up 11,000 from an upwardly revised 520,000 the previous week , the Labor Department said in a weekly report .
The week included the Columbus Day holiday .
A consensus estimate of economists surveyed by Briefing .com expected 515,000 new claims .
" [ The initial claims figure ] is somewhat surprising , " wrote Jim Baird analyst at Plante Moran Financial Advisors , in a research note .
" Excess slack in the system and employers ' hesitance to ramp up hiring appear likely to weigh on the labor markets for some time . "
[...]
The government said 5,923,000 people filed continuing claims in the week ended Oct. 10 , the most recent data available .
That was down 98,000 from the preceding week 's ongoing claims , and would -- if not revised -- mark the first time since late March that continuing claims were below 6 million .
But the slide in continuing claims may signal that more filers are falling off those rolls and into extended benefits .
Continuing claims reflect people filing each week after their initial claim until the end of their standard benefits , which usually last 26 weeks .
The figures do not include those who have moved to state or federal extensions , nor people who have exhausted their benefits .
In the sweltering California heat with their placards , posters , red armbands and chants of " no cuts , no fees , education should be free " , the demonstrators packed in to Sproul Plaza at the centre of University of California Berkeley campus today meant business .
The crowd cheered and passing cars hooted as speakers implored them to fight state authorities ' plans to hike student fees and lay off workers .
Daniella , a petite second - year Latina undergraduate sitting quietly in the shade echoed what many making the rallying calls were articulating .
" My whole life I wanted to come here .
If they increase the fees I will have to drop out .
We have to fight this . "
The Berkeley protest was one of many held across California in an unprecedented day of action directed at university authorities and state governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger as he attempts to curb the state 's multibillion - dollar budget crisis .
Faculty , students and unions from the University of California 's 10 campuses including its two most prestigious , UCLA and Berkeley , joined forces in what was the biggest student protest for more than a generation .
The scale of the protests has come as a shock to state authorities .
What began as a marginal dispute in the summer between university faculty and their management over cuts in salaries has in recent weeks escalated into a statewide walkout by students and faculty as well as a day of strike action by campus technical workers against layoffs and diminished terms and conditions .
The turning point came two weeks ago when university authorities warned of savage budget cuts to deal with a $ 750 m ( £ 466 m ) shortfall and mooted huge increases in the cost of tuition .
" UC regents vote next week to raise student fees , already up 250 % over the last decade , by an additional 30 % , " was how one group of protesters summed up the situation today .
In a move that will reignite debates around racial inequities in education one group demonstrating labelled the proposed hike in fees as " twisted and racist " , saying it would mean more low - income and ethnic minority students would be unable to afford a college education .
They also criticised proposals to increase the proportion of out - of - state students - who pay markedly higher fees - to 26 % alleging it would further reduce the opportunities for young people from low - income groups or ethnic minorities living in California to secure a university place .
In a swipe clearly directed at the governor 's office one provocative leaflet read : " Annually the state pays $ 49,000 per prison inmate and less than $ 14,000 per UC student .
If the state can lock us up , it can invest in our education for one - third of the cost . "
A spokesman for the group Graduate Students of Colour said : " Students of colour are asking a crucial question :
Why now , and why us ?
California 's population of college - age adults is majority black and brown .
Whatever other reasons are cited , that underlying condition is left unspoken . "
In recent years student demonstrations in California have been small - scale and largely single issue - led such as those held after Hurricane Katrina when students protested against the Bush administration 's response in the immediate aftermath .
Signs that the latest protests were different and that feelings were running especially high were evident in the run-up to the walkout with fringe meetings mushrooming across campuses to galvanise support .
At UC Berkeley activists could be seen donning red armbands while at UC Davis one preliminary protest yesterday included a " naked " demonstration by a small group of students accusing authorities of " stripping " the education system .
Facebook and Twitter campaigns were also launched while over a thousand faculty members across all campuses signed an online petition rejecting budget cuts and proposing alternative ways to save money such as trimming the salaries of education bosses and senior officials plus tapping into reserve funds .
For many this latest wave of protest in California is reminiscent of the 1960s when UC Berkeley in particular earned a reputation as the epicentre of student activism when it spawned the Free Speech Movement .
It was also the last time a former Hollywood actor , Ronald Reagan , was governor .
Author and scholar at UC Berkeley 's geography department Gray Brechin , who was an undergraduate at Berkeley during the 60s unrest said the current dispute had been " simmering " under the surface for months .
He said many in the university are concerned that California 's budgetary problems are being used as " an excuse " to dismantle the state 's public university system and move it toward a system reliant on private donors for funding .
" California is beyond broke .
The wealthiest state in the nation is bankrupt .
These problems began a long time ago .
What we need is a more progressive tax system to fund the university , not to dismantle it . "
The UC system , the largest network of its kind in the US with over 220,000 students and more than 170,000 faculty , is widely regarded as a flagship public university often outperforming privately - funded prestigious schools such as Stanford just a few miles from Berkeley in the home of hi-tech , Silicon Valley .
University authorities have staunchly denied suggestions of an attempt to undermine public education .
California 's colossal budget crisis has become an ever - increasing thorn in the side of the governor as more people feel the pain of cuts in expenditure on schools and other services on top of the fallout from recession .
The state is an estimated $ 15 bn in debt with no way out in sight .
Today 's protests come close on the heels of another politically sensitive initiative .
Just last week the governor granted early release to thousands of prisoners in a cash - saving exercise .
But if the prisoner release controversy was embarrassing , the dramatic public education furore looks set not only to be a more enduring and contentious problem but possibly one that attracts nationwide attention .
( CNN ) --
A legally insane killer was on the loose in the state of Washington on Saturday , two days after he escaped during a field trip to a county fair , authorities said .
Authorities are combing Washington state for Phillip Paul , who is described as a criminally insane killer .
Phillip Paul was able to elude a massive manhunt in Spokane County , Washington , after escaping Thursday , a spokesman for the sheriff 's department said .
Though Paul had been confined in a mental institution because of a murder confession , he was allowed to be part of a trip to a county fair Thursday .
Paul , 47 , escaped from the fair around noon , which launched the massive manhunt and brought criticism from many , including state government officials .
Sheriff 's officials told CNN affiliate KREM - TV that Paul also escaped briefly in 1991 and assaulted a law enforcement officer .
Sgt. Dave Reagan told CNN that Paul was carrying a backpack full with clothing , leading authorities to believe he may have planned his escape .
" When he left the hospital on Thursday , it appears he took most of his clothing , so we now have an idea of what was in the backpack when he escaped at the fairgrounds , " Reagan said .
" This may be a case of planned escape rather than a spur - of - the - moment , I 'm homesick , runaway , " he said .
Eleven hospital employees were monitoring the 33 inmates , including Paul , on the trip , Reagan said .
A review has been launched on the incident and on the policy that allows patients to take trips , said Susan Dreyfus , secretary of the state 's Department of Social and Health Services .
She said she was concerned about Paul 's escape and another recent brief escape by a patient at a different local mental health facility .
" These incidents , separate and coincidental , have raised serious questions about the security readiness of our two state psychiatric hospitals , " Dreyfus said .
Paul was committed to Eastern State Hospital after admitting he strangled and slit the throat of community activist Ruth Motley in 1987 , KREM - TV reported .
According to court documents obtained by KREM , Paul believed Motley was a witch and killed her in response to voices in his head .
He subsequently burned a deer carcass as a sacrifice , according the documents .
The extent of Paul 's illness was disturbing even to mental health professionals , KREM reported .
" He 's the only paranoid schizophrenic -- I 've seen hundreds , maybe thousands of them -- that frightened me , " Dr. Frank Hardy , a licensed psychiatrist , said in one of the documents , according to KREM .
" The first time I took one look at him -- and I 've never done this before or since -- I asked the jailer to remain in the room while I examined him .
" I believe he would respond to his delusions and his voices again " if released , Hardy wrote .
But Paul " Coyote " Neumann , a disc jockey at Spokane radio station Kix 96 - FM , has an entirely different view of the escapee .
Neumann has known
Paul for 12 years through volunteering at the hospital and correspondence by mail .
Paul is a talented artist , Neumann told KREM - TV .
" I was just amazed by his ability .
I always took him as a savant , " Neumann said .
" I never knew that he had murdered somebody until three or four or five years later . "
Neumann described Paul as a " gentle soul . "
" I 've never seen him raise his voice ; I 've never seen him get frustrated ; I 've never seen nothing but kindness from him , " he told KREM .
" I get mixed emotions because I do see the sweet , softer side of this individual , but I 've never seen him unsupervised , I 've never seen him not medicated , " Neumann said .
" But that 's not to say in another 12 , 15 , 20 hours without those medications that he does n't revert to those demons . "

Senator John McCain ( R - AZ ) is the top recipient of campaign contributions from large Internet service providers like AT&T , Verizon and Comcast over the past two years , according to a new report from the Sunlight Foundation and the Center for Responsive Politics .
McCain has taken in a total of $ 894,379 ( much of that money going to support his failed 2008 bid for the presidency ) , more than twice the amount taken by the next - largest beneficiary , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. ( $ 341,089 ) .
Meanwhile , McCain has emerged as the ISPs ' biggest champion against new " network neutrality " rules from the Federal Communications Commission , which voted Thursday to move forward in the process to adopt such rules .
Shortly after the FCC vote , McCain introduced a bill ( the " Internet Freedom Act " ) that would block regulation of the nation 's largest broadband networks .
Net neutrality rules would amount to a federal mandate that broadband providers cannot block or hinder the internet traffic of any web site or service , regardless of whether or not that site or service completes with a similar site or service offered by the ISP itself .
In other words , a telco ISP could not limit bandwidth used for Skype VoIP traffic , while maximizing bandwidth available for its own VoIP service .
As Congress considers legislation that would codify net neutrality into law , cable and phone companies are hoping to cut a better deal on Capitol Hill than they are likely to get from the FCC , the Sunlight Foundation 's Bill Allison says .
As the network neutrality issue has come to a head over the past year , due in large part to the new FCC 's interest in it , telco and cable lobbyists have been flooding the offices ( and coffers ) of lawmakers .
The Sunlight Foundation study found that some 244 members of Congress were the beneficiaries of contributions -- totaling more than $ 9.4 million -- from January 2007 to June 2009 .
The analysis was based on a survey of giving by eight large broadband providers and two trade associations that represent them , all which have disclosed lobbying on net neutrality issues .
The telecom interests also targeted House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , D - Md. ( $ 275,275 ) , Senate Finance Committee chair Max Baucus , D- Mont . ( $ 248,999 ) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( $ 198,972 ) .
Verizon and AT&T have been particularly active in this effort ; they also were the sources of all the clustered contributions among broadband providers , with AT&T and its outside lobbyists combining to give to 110 members , followed by Comcast ( 105 members ) and Verizon ( 96 members ) .
Love has inspired countless works of art , from immortal plays such as Romeo and Juliet , to architectural masterpieces such as the Taj Mahal , to classic pop songs , like Queen 's “ Love of My Life ” .
This raises the obvious question : why is love such a stimulating emotion ?
Why does the act of falling in love – or at least thinking about love – lead to such a spur of creative productivity ?
One possibility is that when we ’re in love we actually think differently .
This romantic hypothesis was recently tested by the psychologists Jens Förster , Kai Epstude , and Amina Özelsel at the University of Amsterdam .
The researchers found that love really does alter our thoughts , and that this profound emotion affects us in a way that is different than simply thinking about sex .
The clever experiments demonstrated that love makes us think differently in that it triggers global processing , which in turn promotes creative thinking and interferes with analytic thinking .
Thinking about sex , however , has the opposite effect : it triggers local processing , which in turn promotes analytic thinking and interferes with creativity .
Why does love make us think more globally ?
The researchers suggest that romantic love induces a long - term perspective , whereas sexual desire induces a short - term perspective .
This is because love typically entails wishes and goals of prolonged attachment with a person , whereas sexual desire is typically focused on engaging in sexual activities in the " here and now " .
Consistent with this idea , when the researchers asked people to imagine a romantic date or a casual sex encounter , they found that those who imagined dates imagined them as occurring farther into the future than those who imagined casual sex .
According to construal level theory ( CLT ) , thinking about events that are farther into the future or past - or any kind psychological distancing ( such as considering things or people that are physically farther away , or considering remote , unlikely alternatives to reality ) triggers a more global processing style .
In other words , psychological distancing makes us see the forest rather than the individual trees .
A global processing style promotes creative thinking because it helps raise remote and uncommon associations .
Consider , for example , the act of finding a gift for your partner .
If we think about a gift while in a local mindset , then we ’ll probably focus on more literal and concrete options , most of which involve a tangible object wrapped in colorful paper .
We ’ll probably consider the usual suspects , such as a watch , a book , or perfume .
However , thinking about a gift more globally might inspire us to consider a gift as " anything that will make him / her happy " .
This may , in turn , bring to mind more diverse and original ideas , such as going on a joint vacation , writing a song , or cleaning and remodeling the house .
Of course , this does n’t mean we should always think globally .
While local processing might interfere with creativity , it also promotes analytic thinking , which requires us to apply logical rules .
For example , if you are looking for a piece of furniture in a big display according to a pre-defined list of criteria ( e.g. , size , color , price ) , a local mindset may help you find a match , by preventing you from being side - tracked by attractive but irrelevant options and by making you pay more attention to relevant details .
In sum , the authors suggest that , because love activates a long - term perspective that elicits global processing , it should also promote creativity and impede analytic thinking .
In contrast , inasmuch as sex activates a short - term perspective that elicits local processing , it should also promote analytic thinking and impede creative thinking .
The authors present two studies to support this model .
Participants in the first study first imagined one of three situations : a long walk with their beloved one ( the love condition ) , casual sex with a person to whom they were attracted but not in love with ( the sex condition ) , or a nice walk on their own ( the control condition ) .
Participants then attempted to solve three creative insight problems and four problems that assess analytic thinking , which were logic problems from the Graduate Record Examination ( GRE ) ( e.g. , if A < B and C > B then ? )
As predicted , participants in the love condition solved more creativity problems and less analytic problems than those in the control condition .
Participants in the sex condition , on the other hand , solved less creativity problems and more analytic problems compared to participants in the control condition .
The second study examined whether more subtle reminders of love and sex can also elicit similar effects .
First , as part of an alleged attention task , participants were subliminally presented with words related to love ( e.g. " loving " ) , words related to sex ( e.g. , " eroticism " ) , or a non-word letter string ( control condition ; " XQFBZ " ) .
Next , analytic thinking was measured using the same GRE problems as in the first study .
Creative thinking was measured this time using a generation task , in which participants had limited time to generate as many uses for a brick as possible .
Replicating the findings of the first study , participants in the love condition generated more creative uses and solved less analytic problems than those in the control condition , whereas participants in the sex condition displayed the opposite pattern .
One of the most noteworthy implications of these experiments is that love and sex do n’t simply influence the way we think about the people we love or desire .
Instead , they influence the way we think about everything .
The same researchers demonstrate this tendency in yet another experiment .
When in love , it seems , we struggle to distinguish between the different qualities of the beloved person ( e.g. , " If he is so handsome , he must also be kind ! " ) , a phenomenon that is often labeled the halo effect .
Does love also promote halo effects for other objects ?
It seems that the answer is yes .
The same group of researchers reasoned that the halo effect reflects global processing , and therefore it should increase when people think of love and decrease when they think of sex .
They found the predicted pattern of evaluations ( that is , less differentiation between distinct qualities after thinking about love and more differentiation after thinking about sex ) , not only in evaluations of a romantic partner , but also in evaluating different aspects of a chair !
The takeaway lesson is that thinking about love , or anything that promotes a distal perspective or global processing , can make us more creative .
Perhaps love is an especially potent way to induce in us a sense of transcendence – being in the here and now yet also contemplating the distant future and maybe even eternity .

Israel has angrily rejected what it called a " one- sided " resolution by the UN human rights council today that backed a highly critical report on the Gaza war and opened the way to possible international war crimes investigations .
The council voted to endorse the report by a South African judge , Richard Goldstone , which accused both Israel and Hamas of committing war crimes and possible crimes against humanity during the three - week war in Gaza in January .
Goldstone , whose work was hailed by leading international human rights groups , found there may be individual criminal responsibility over the killing of civilians .
The report will go to the UN general assembly and could lead to a rare international criminal court investigation if Israel and Hamas fail to mount their own credible independent inquiries into the war crimes allegations within six months .
Today 's vote carries major implications for the Middle East conflict .
It is the first time such serious investigations have been contemplated at such a high level .
It may encourage reconciliation between the rival Palestinian factions , but it is also likely to complicate US efforts to restart Israeli - Palestinian peace talks .
And in the end it may result in a US veto at the UN security council to protect Israel from scrutiny .
" Israel rejects the one - sided resolution adopted in Geneva by the UN human rights council and calls upon all responsible states to reject it as well , " the Israeli foreign ministry said .
The resolution " provides encouragement for terrorist organisations worldwide and undermines global peace " .
Israel has criticised the council in the past for an anti-Israel bias .
In Ramallah , a spokesman for the Palestinian president , Mahmoud Abbas , welcomed the result but said he wanted to see action .
" What is important now is to translate words into deeds in order to protect our people in the future from any new aggression , " said Nabil Abu Rdeneh .
Hamas for its part welcomed the resolution as " the beginning of the prosecution of the leaders of the occupation , " even though it too risks international investigations .
The resolution not only dealt with the Goldstone report but condemned Israel 's policies in east Jerusalem , particularly over access to Muslim holy sites , demolitions of Palestinian homes and excavation work near the Haram al - Sharif , also known as the Temple Mount .
It was passed with 25 votes in favour , six against and 11 abstentions .
The US voted against the resolution , while Britain and France did not take part after failing to secure a delay .
Neither Israel nor the Palestinians sit on the 47 - member council , which is dominated by countries in the developing world , but both worked hard to influence the outcome of the vote .
Intense US pressure initially led Abbas to drop his efforts to secure a vote endorsing the Goldstone report .
Abbas had wanted to put the vote off for six months , but that was greeted with such an outcry among Palestinians who demanded accountability for the hundreds of civilians killed in Gaza that he quickly backtracked and called for this special council session .
Goldstone had recommended that the human rights council pass his report to the UN security council , the UN general assembly and the international criminal court .
He proposed that both Israel and Hamas should be given six months to conduct their own " appropriate investigations that are independent and in conformity with international standards " .
If either side failed to investigate properly , then he said the security council should pass the case on to the prosecutor of the international criminal court .
Hamas looks unlikely to investigate its actions during the war and Israel 's prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , has already insisted he will not allow any Israelis to face war crimes trials .
Around 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis died in the three - week war .
The US diplomat at the council in Geneva , Douglas Griffiths , criticised the Goldstone report for an " unbalanced focus on Israel , the overly broad scope of its recommendations and its sweeping conclusions in law " .
However , he also said Washington had wanted more time before the vote to allow the two sides to conduct their own investigations into war crimes allegations .
That suggests the US may yet put pressure on Israel to hold a credible inquiry .
Western countries may be concerned that they too could face the threat of similar investigations in future over their conduct in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The UN high commissioner for human rights , Navi Pillay , called on both sides to hold " impartial , independent , prompt and effective investigations " .
Gordon Brown reportedly had a heated telephone call on Wednesday with Netanyahu , who pressed him to vote against the resolution .
Brown spoke again with Netanyahu this morning , hours before the vote , and Britain then decided not to take part at all .
A Downing Street spokesman said : " We did not participate in the vote .
We were involved in discussions with Israel and the Palestinians about potentially substantive improvements in the situation on the ground and therefore asked for a delay to the vote . "
How they voted
In favour ( 25 ) : Argentina , Bahrain , Bangladesh , Bolivia , Brazil , Chile , China , Cuba , Djbouti , Egypt , Ghana , India , Indonesia , Jordan , Mauritius , Nicaragua , Nigeria , Pakistan , Philippines , Qatar , Russia , Saudi Arabia , Senegal , South Africa , Zambia .
Against ( 6 ) : US , Italy , Holland , Hungary , Slovakia , Ukraine .
Absentions ( 11 ) : Belgium , Bosnia , Burkina Faso , Cameroon , Gabon , Japan , Mexico , Norway , South Korea , Slovenia , Uruguay .
Britain , France , Madagascar , Kyrgyzstan and Angola did not vote .

“ They ’d been cooking breakfast : there were a couple of quails dressed out , and a soup going , ” Lieutenant LeGault said .
“ But they were gone . ”
Long a fixture of the nation ’s public lands , such criminal agricultural enterprises , law enforcement officials say , have increased greatly in recent years .
And they were cast squarely into the limelight this week when the authorities said a 90,000 - acre Santa Barbara County wildfire , known as the La Brea fire , had begun with a campfire built by marijuana growers believed to be low - level workers for a Mexican drug cartel .
The fire , which started on Aug. 8 , is expected to be fully contained on Saturday .
About the only thing that did not burn , Lieutenant LeGault said , were the areas where growers had been watering some 30,000 marijuana plants .
“ Ironically , it probably saved their lives , ” he said of the growers , who have eluded arrest .
Officials say the rise in the number of such grows has resulted in part from a tightening of the border with Mexico .
“ It ’s made it much more difficult for the cartels to smuggle into the country , particularly marijuana , which is large and bulky , ” said the Santa Barbara County sheriff , Bill Brown .
“ It ’s easier to grow it here . ”
California is also popular with marijuana growers for all the reasons that customary farmers like it .
“ The conditions are very conducive : the water and the soil and the sunshine , ” Sheriff Brown said .
According to the Campaign Against Marijuana Planting , a multiagency task force managed by the state ’s Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement , this year is already one for the record books .
In more than 425 raids since late June , some 3.4 million plants have been seized , up from 2.9 million all of last year .
And , officials note , they still have roughly a month and a half before the campaign expires with the end of harvest season .
Raids occur daily , from southern counties like Riverside , where some 27,000 plants were found on July 2 , to northern ones like Lake and Shasta , in each of which more than 400,000 plants have been destroyed by the authorities this year .
( Mature plants are usually incinerated , younger ones simply uprooted . )
About 2.7 million plants , nearly 80 percent of the seized crop , have been found on federal , state or other public lands .
Officials attribute the plants ’ prevalence there to the vast area investigators are expected to cover .
“ It ’s rugged terrain , very difficult to get to and very difficult to see , ” said John Heil , a spokesman for the United States Forest Service , which in California has jurisdiction over 20.6 million acres , home to nearly 60 percent of this year ’s seizures .
Mr. Heil said drug operators could be blamed for a handful of wildfires each year in California , which is already dealing with a prolonged drought and budget - stretched firefighting resources .
Environmental damage of a different kind can also be severe , with pesticides seeping into soil and streams , and trash and human waste left behind .
Lieutenant LeGault said he was impressed by how far marijuana growers would go — deeper into forests , higher in the mountains — in an effort to avoid detection .
“ They call it a wilderness because it is , ” he said .
“ Not even the billy goats go there . ”
Once established , Lieutenant LeGault said , the workers , usually in teams of 4 to 10 , must labor hard to cultivate .
Streams and springs are dammed to provide water for irrigation , with miles of irrigation line laid .
Plants are laid out under trees to avoid surveillance by law enforcement aircraft , and large areas for planting are sometimes cleared of brush , rocks and so forth by hand .
Living is rudimentary .
In the case of the camp that started the La Brea fire , workers seemed to have been sleeping in small dirt beds next to a handmade irrigation pool , with tarps hung overhead .
Then there is the natural world to contend with .
Marijuana workers often set traps or diversions for bears , hanging bags of food from far - removed trees .
Poison is laid out for rats and other rodents that apparently do not mind the taste of marijuana , which is usually dried and packaged at the camps .
But the biggest danger for growers is law enforcement .
Lieutenant LeGault and his fellow officers often land at camps via helicopter , dangling in the air on harnesses and ropes .
Yet arrests are rare .
Growers are typically armed , but they most often flee if they hear helicopters overhead or officers hiking toward them .
In Santa Barbara County , officials say that in 18 raids , they have netted 225,000 plants but made no arrests .
Lieutenant LeGault said he would love to catch someone , but he understands the odds of running down anyone so deep in the woods .
“ It ’s like fighting any crime , ” he said .
“ This is just a little more physically challenging . ”

New York City is the marijuana arrest capital of the world , which makes it harsh terrain for seriously ill patients who rely on medical marijuana for relief .
An effort is under way to legalize medical marijuana in New York and remove sick people from the drug war battlefield .
Unfortunately , three of the biggest TV stations in New York City do n't want you to know about it .
ABC , FOX , and CBS affiliates all refused to run ads in support of protecting medical marijuana patients .
This is the message they do n't want you to hear :
These are seriously ill patients fighting for compassion and equality .
To silence them is an act of appalling cruelty and ignorance .
Whatever petty political considerations might motivate these TV stations to censor the medical marijuana debate are trivial compared to the real human suffering that will continue if patients are denied the opportunity to speak up .
Medical marijuana is supported by 76 % of New Yorkers , so to suggest that there 's anything inherently offensive about airing that viewpoint is just pure fiction .
According to MPP 's Bruce Mirken , CBS stated that they rejected the ad because they 're " concerned about viewer reaction . "
Really , CBS ?
Is there anything objectionable about the idea of not arresting people with auto - immune disease ?
The most likely " viewer reaction " is that people will agree to support legislation that protects patients from arrest .
Please help us show these TV stations that their censorship is what 's offensive , not the effort to protect seriously ill patients .
Click to contact ABC FOX , and CBS and let them know that silencing patients is both politically and morally wrong .

Current Poster : March , April - 2020
The headline did n’t shout .
It did n’t need to .
This was n’t a slow news day .
It read , ‘ In one week 10 percent of Australia ’s workforce have lost their jobs ’ .
In India , a nation of 1.3 billion people were given four hours notice to lock down inside their homes for 21 days .
People found outside afterwards were subsequently beaten .
Always , in the world somewhere , there ’s an extreme situation - a flood , a famine , a war .
Less frequent , though , are situations involving the whole world .
The COVID - 19 pandemic is such a time .
Perhaps , for Australians , the shock has been greater than for those who live with poverty and uncertainty each day .
Now , we share that experience … anxious about what happens if we catch the virus or whether we ’ll have a job or even if society will hold together .
So far , our government has met these fears with hope - with a program of social isolation and the ‘ JobKeeper ’ and ‘ JobSeeker ’ packages .
But it would be a mistake to put all our ‘ hope eggs ’ in the government basket .
Australians , indeed all people , need a hope that transcends the weakness of governments .
We need a hope that lasts beyond death .
And the only hope worth having is in Jesus .
In his famous , ‘ Sermon On The Mount ’ , Jesus said ,
“ Therefore I tell you , do not be anxious about your life , what you will eat or what you will drink , nor about your body , what you will put on .
Is not life more than food , and the body more than clothing ?
Look at the birds of the air : they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns , and yet your heavenly Father feeds them .
Are you not of more value than they ?
And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life ?
In the West , death is something that happens mostly in nursing homes to people we do n’t spend much time with .
But COVID - 19 confronts us with our mortality ... reminding us that all must face God eventually .
While the pandemic is at distance , we should take the time to get our hopes into proper shape .
The promises of government and medical technology can only ever be temporary .
But the Bible speaks of ‘ new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead ’ .
That ’s an ongoing and exciting hope where death is not the last word but a portal into a close and complete existence with our heavenly Father .
So , “ set your hope fully on the grace to be given you when Jesus Christ is revealed " .
Prayer : Dear God please help me to put my hope fully in Jesus .
Bible : “… set your hope fully on the grace to be given you when Jesus Christ is revealed " .
- 1 Peter 1:13

LOS ALAMOS , N.M. 
No one knows for sure what is buried in the Manhattan Project - era dump here .
At the very least , there is probably a truck down there that was contaminated in 1945 at the Trinity test site , where the world ’s first nuclear explosion seared the sky and melted the desert sand 200 miles south of here during World War II .
But now a team of workers is using $ 212 million in federal stimulus money to clean up the 65 - year - old , six - acre dump , which was used by the scientists who built the world ’s first atomic bomb .
They are approaching the job like an archeological dig  only with even greater care , since some of the things they unearth are likely to be radioactive , while others may be explosive .
The dump has become part of the $ 6 billion stimulus program to clean up the toxic legacy of the arms race , which is one of the biggest sources of direct federal contracts in the $ 787 billion stimulus act .
More than $ 1.9 billion is being spent at the Hanford site in Washington , the home of the nuclear reactor that made the plutonium for the atomic bomb that was dropped on Nagasaki .
Another $ 1.6 billion is being spent cleaning up a Savannah River site , in South Carolina .
After the stimulus bill passed , some Republicans questioned the wisdom of devoting so much money to nuclear cleanups , noting that the Department of Energy ’s environmental management program had been bedeviled by cost overruns in the past .
Democrats countered that the labor - intensive projects would create many jobs while advancing the stimulus act ’s goal of improving the environment .

This has been a big day in finance , with bankers raking in $ 140 billion in compensation and the Dow cracking the five - digit mark .
Today , the Dow Jones Industrial Average momentarily surpassed 10,000 , a symbolic watershed that rekindles hope in the financial sector 's recovery and boosts optimism for further economic growth .
The Dow - - which peaked at 14,000 in late 2007 , slipped below 10,000 a year ago , and bottomed out around 6,550 this March - - is only one , singularly totemic financial indicator .
But , as both a financial and symbolic measurement , it still carries weight .
Not Yet Out of The Woods CNN Money 's Chris Isidore explains why we have a long way to go .
" Lately , there has been a growing consensus among both investors and economists that the battered U.S. economy hit bottom and turned around earlier this year , and is now in a recovery , " he writes .
" But even economists who agree the economy is in recovery say that growth will be slow and difficult , with continued job losses , tight credit and further declines in home prices .
And even some who believe that the current Dow 10,000 level is justified say there 's still a significant risk that the economy will take a step backward . "
Industry Not Optimistic NPR 's Kevin Whitelaw suggests businesses are far from confident , which means employment may not yet catch up .
" It is bound to boost confidence in the short run , but it wo n't extinguish the lingering doubts about how strong that recovery is going to be , " he writes .
" There 's also the question of how the Fed and other institutions will unwind the massive efforts they have undertaken to prop up the nation 's economy , including keeping interest rates hovering near record lows . [...]
More broadly , there is a sense that the economy is in uncharted waters , which makes businesses , consumers and economists alike leery of taking risks . "
Same Greed That Drove The Crash Forbes 's Stanley Bing thinks it 's bad news .
" It shows that no matter what 's really going on underneath our economic system , investors want to make money and think they can still do so by buying and selling stocks and sometimes even bonds .
Yay for those cockeyed optimists !
They make the world go ' round ! " he scoffs .
" All hope for ridiculous future wealth for each of us resides with the rampant , uncontrolled , irrational exercise of organized greed that drives the markets .
It looks like we 're well on the way to total recovery in more ways than one , ladies and gentlemen . "
What About Jobs and Sales ?
Joe Gandelman sees the Dow climb as little more than a symbol overshadowed by more concrete economic indicators .
" The good news is that the Dow has approached 10,000 .
The bad news is that retail sales are still lousy , " writes Gandelman , the editor of the Moderate Voice .
" In general it looks like it will be a s - l - o - w recovery ... particularly with jobs loss persisting as a national problem ( and notable problem for Democrats heading into 2010 ) . "
Not a Political Marker Steve Benen cautions that the Dow is not a gauge of Obama 's success .
" Of course , using the markets as some kind of financial approval rating for the administration is foolish , " he writes in his Washington Monthly blog .
" The value of Wall Street indexes is hardly the best metric for measuring the strength of the economy .
Dow 10,000 is just a symbolic milestone . "
Compare to March '09 Low Discover Magazine 's Chris Mooney is optimistic .
" Wow , it was only a year ago when the whole financial system seemed on the brink of collapse ; today , by contrast , if only briefly ( so far ) , the Dow topped 10,000 , a huge rebound from its March 09 low of 6,547 .
Do folks think the nightmare is finally coming to an end ? "
Compare to 1999 High Peter Boockvar of the Big Picture asks us to " reminisce about 1999 , the year it first passed that magic level . "
He recalls , " Karl Malone , Pudge , Chipper Jones , Jagr and Kurt Warner won MVP awards and the average price of a gallon of gasoline at the pump was about $ 1.20 .
US nominal GDP ended at $ 9.6 b vs $ 14.1 as of Q2 '09 .
Also , on March 29th 1999 , the DXY was at 100.36 ( now 75.60 ) , the CRB was at 192.40 ( now 269.15 ) , gold was at $ 280 ( now $ 1,060 ) , oil was $ 16.44 ( now $ 74.80 ) , corn was $ 2.32 ( now $ 3.85 ) , copper was $.62 ( now $ 2.83 ) , the 10 yr yield was 5.19 % ( now 3.38 % ) , and the fed funds rate was at 4.75 % ( now 0-.25 % ) .
Oh , how time flies . "

This is the second in a series of blog posts I ’m doing on the upcoming VS 2010 and .NET 4 release .
Today ’s post is about another small , but I think nice , change coming with VS 2010 and ASP .
NET 4 when you create new ASP.
NET
Web projects – which is the ability to create both “ Empty projects ” as well as to create projects that already have some layout and common functionality included in them , and which can help you get started when building a new application .
Creating New Projects
When you use the File -> New Project or File -> New Web Site menu commands within VS 2010 , you ’ll see a “ New Project ” dialog like below that allows you to filter by language and application type and select different project templates to use when creating new projects :
VS 2010 ships with “ empty ” project templates for creating new ASP.
NET applications – which will create minimal projects with just the bare essentials needed to get going .
My last post in this series included a screenshot that shows what the “ Empty ASP.
NET Web Application ” project template creates when you use it to start a new application .
Creating a New Project using a Starter Template
VS 2010 also ships with starter template projects that allow you to create a new ASP.
NET application that has some layout / CSS structure and common functionality already implemented within it .
We first tried this concept with ASP .
NET MVC 1.0 – whose project template provides a master page , CSS file , JavaScript libraries , login system , and a “ home ” and “ about ” page already wired up and implemented .
VS 2010 adds support for this idea when creating new ASP .
NET Web Forms projects as well .
When you choose the default “ ASP. NET Web Application ” project template , you ’ll find that the ASP .
NET Web Forms project created already has some directories and files contained within it :
It includes a Site .
Master master page file that provides an overall layout for the site ( with headers , footers , etc ) , and which uses a CSS stylesheet for all styles .
It has a “ Scripts ” directory that contains jQuery within it ( ASP.
NET AJAX is available via the script manager control ) .
It includes a “ default.aspx ” and “ about.aspx ” pages in the root directory that are based on the master page and include some boiler plate content .
And it includes an “ Account ” directory that has some pages that implement a forms - based authentication system for users to log - in , register and change their passwords :
You can run the project without having to write any code or configure anything , and get a nice site up and running :
The site has full support for forms based security authentication , and is pre-wired up to use the ASP .
NET Membership system for password management :
All of the styles and content within the site are configured using CSS , and take advantage of some of the new features with Web Forms in ASP .
NET 4 – including clean client - side “ id ” names ( no more ctrl_ mangled names – ASP.
NET 4 gives you complete control over the client id ) , and CSS based rendering instead of table based rendering for the built - in server controls .
I ’ll discuss these new Web Forms features in a lot more depth in later posts in this series ( along with a lot of other features being added ) .
Online Template Gallery
In addition to the built - in project templates , VS 2010 also support the ability when inside the “ New Project ” and “ Add Item ” dialogs to search an online gallery of additional templates to use .
You can contribute your own templates to the gallery , rate and review submissions of others , and search and filter them by project type , keyword and community rating .
You can then easily download and install any template locally directly within the dialog :
This will hopefully facilitate the creation of lots of useful project starter kits ( of all types of projects – not just web ) that people can easily discover and use to quickly get going when building solutions .
Hope this helps ,
Scott

Only nine countries are ready for the next - generation of network demands
A study of the global state of broadband has put the UK 25th out of 66 countries in terms of the quality and reach of its networks .
The research for Cisco found that countries such as Latvia and Bulgaria were better prepared than the UK for next - generation net applications .
The UK was listed among countries whose broadband is " meeting needs for today " .
South Korea and Japan continue to dominate the league table , largely due to their commitment to fast networks .
In South Korea , for example , the government has promised universal speeds of up to 1 Gbps ( gigabit per second ) by 2012 .
Despite not being ready for future applications , the UK was well placed to cope with today 's network demands , the study found .
LEADERS IN BROADBAND QUALITY South Korea Japan Hong Kong Sweden Switzerland Netherlands Singapore Luxembourg Denmark Norway
" It can be a bit misleading to look at the rankings .
The important thing is whether the broadband quality of a country is good enough for today 's needs and the UK falls well within this category , " said Joanne Hughes , Cisco 's communication manager .
She expects the UK to improve dramatically next year .
" We forecast the UK will improve because of things such as cable networks being upgraded and the Digital Britain report focusing on next generation access , " she said .
The study was conducted jointly by Oxford University 's Said Business School and Spain 's University of Oviedo 's Department of Applied Economics .
It found that the average download speed globally was 4.75 Mbps ( megabits per second ) , while average upload speed was 1.3 Mbps .
Future demands
Researchers also worked out how fit countries were to cope with the demands of today 's users based on a set of applications consumers are likely to use .
These included sharing photos , using video on Skype , watching YouTube and standard definition BBC iPlayer content .
So why are we so low down the league ?
The answer , it seems is simple - fibre and cable
Rory Cellan- Jones
BBC technology correspondent
Read Rory 's thoughts in full
It found that two - thirds of the 66 countries met the criteria for today 's requirements .
But only nine countries , including Japan , Sweden and Latvia , were ready for future demands , such as watching high - definition video .
This is a big improvement on last year 's study , which found only Japan was ready for the future .
Researchers estimated that countries would need an average download speed of 11.25 Mbps and an upload speed of 5 M bps in order to be comfortably placed for future applications .
' Real speeds '
The research was based on 24 million speed tests done in 66 countries via speedtest .
net .
The test focused on download speeds , upload speeds and latency - the delay that happens as information is routed around the net .
Using this measure alone , the UK was ranked 31st .
However , researchers combined these results with the broadband penetration in individual countries to create its broadband leadership index .
Under this measure , the UK was ranked 25th .
" Most studies are based just on broadband penetration or , if they look at speed they look at advertised speeds rather than real speeds , " said Ms Hughes .
" We wanted to look at the issue of broadband quality which is vital as new applications come along , " she added .
" We also looked at broadband penetration because there is no point having good quality networks if they are not widely available , " she said .

Little over a month ago , Global Gaming Factory ( GGF ) announced that its shareholders had agreed to buy The Pirate Bay - the only thing that stood in their path was the actual money transfer .
Today the deadline to transfer the money passed silently , putting an end to the deal and three turbulent months .
Ever since GGF announced that it would take over The Pirate Bay , the company has bombarded the press with optimistic plans for the site , but was later featured largely due to the financial position of its CEO .
All along the company had confidence in its plans for the new and ‘ legal ’ Pirate Bay , but now it seems that they were too good to be true .
After GGF ’s shareholders agreed to acquire the world ’s largest BitTorrent tracker , the company had a month to come up with the proposed $ 7.8 m ( SEK 60 million ) , half of which would be paid in shares .
After several anonymous investors decided to pull out of the deal the company was faced with a problem .
To get the required funds in place GGF ’s shareholders – including the CEO who holds more than half of the shares – decided to finance the acquisition themselves .
But today , after a month has gone by and the deadline for the sale has passed , there is no joyful press release from the company , just silence .
To get the latest information about the upcoming deadline , TorrentFreak contacted GGF ’s CEO Hans Pandeya yesterday .
However , thus far we have n’t received any response and his phone has been switched off .
In addition to these dark signs , sources close to Resevella – the company selling The Pirate Bay – could not confirm that the promised money had been transferred or that an arrangement had been made to deliver ‘ the goods ’ .
Based on these observations we think it ’s safe to conclude that The Pirate Bay will not be sold to GGF , something that ’s not really that much of a surprise considering all the financial troubles the company and its CEO have , not to mention the fact that GGF was recently thrown off the Swedish Stock exchange .
So what ’s next ?
We assume that Hans Pandeya will soon offer an explanation for his failure to transfer the funds .
In the meantime , the people involved in the Pirate Bay will probably be looking for a new buyer , perhaps one that will actually be able to pay for the site .

The South African motorsport body has slammed FIA presidential candidate Jean Todt for comments made about the country .
Speaking in an interview with the Telegraph newspaper , Todt played down the importance of the role of F1 Commissioner , suggesting countries like South Africa are not interested in Formula 1 .
" The FIA has over 172 mobility clubs and sporting clubs , " Told told the Telegraph .
" And I am not sure that they are concerned with who is going to be the F1 Commissioner .
" Do you think people in South Africa care what is happening in F1 ? "
On Monday , Beaulah Schoeman , Managing Director of Motorsport South Africa , the country 's FIA - affiliated motorsport regulator , was very critical of Todt 's remarks .
She said the Frenchman had shown the " arrogance and the contempt " the FIA has treated African countries with .
" Mr Todt 's comment questioning ' whether people in South Africa care ( about ) what is happening in F1 ' , is a perfect example of his arrogance and the contempt with which African countries have been - and are being treated - by the FIA and confirms that if he is elected , this will continue , " said Schoeman .
" Todt 's comment is not only an insult to South Africa , but to all African countries .
South Africa is extremely proud of the fact that a past F1 World Champion ( Jody Scheckter ) is a South African - and that many very successful F1 Grands Prix were held in our country , which presently broadcasts every grand prix throughout Africa .
" In fact , South Africa had a F1 world champion fully six years before Todt 's homeland , and while South Africa does not presently have a race on the F1 calendar , France does not , either .
Accordingly it is very pleasing to note that Jody 's name does not appear on the list of F1 drivers who support Todt . "
What is social networking etiquette ?
There is a lot to be said for someone who has good etiquette .
In life , etiquette is very important whether in business or personal relationships .
That said social networking etiquette mimics that of etiquette in daily life .
There is not a day that goes by that I do n’t experience some sore of etiquette faux pas , and often times they are repeat offenders .
Are any of these considered socially acceptable to you ?
Decide someone is your friend without properly introducing yourself ?
Approach your friends and those you barely know every day asking them to come to your event ?
Only talk about yourself and promote yourself all day long ?
Hopefully you answered no to all of these .
However , if you did answer yes to any of the above , I would suggest taking a class on social etiquette before you login to Facebook again - seriously .
I hope that this will serve as an overview of social networking etiquette violations and help you to avoid making them .
Being an educated social networker will help you manage and maintain better online relationships and strengthen your network .
Abusing friend requests .
Do you send out friend requests to everyone ?
People you do n’t know included ?
There is nothing more irritating than someone who is only trying to build up their numbers and sending out friend requests to everyone .
If you must add someone you do n’t know , be sure to send a message with your name , a proper introduction , and why you want to connect .
Adding users as friends without proper introductions is just plain rude and diminishes the strength of your network .
Obnoxious application overload .
Do you send everyone on your friends list a “ Gift ” or a “ Drink ” every week ?
Well cut it out , nobody wants to get a “ Gift ” or a “ Drink ” unless it ’s real and or has vodka in it .
There are so many useless applications out there and for some reason some people feel the need to consistently invite friends to participate .
Many would consider this spam .
I do n’t want to join your group !
Do you send out invites to your friends list every week to get them to join your group ?
If your friends are interested , they ’ll likely join without your “ reminders ” .
And if they do n’t accept , please do n’t send the group request more than once or start asking them to join via email , wall post , or message , obviously they do n’t want to join !
Become my Fan !
First of all , it is not appropriate to suggest your page to a friend if they do not know you or know of your company .
Additionally , just as with a group , do not suggest the page to your friends more than once .
Do not abuse the “ Suggest Page to a Friend ”
Too Much Information !
Please remember that the Wall feature on Facebook is PUBLIC !
Publicizing a private conversation on a wall post is just in poor taste .
Facebook wall posts are completely public to all your friends ( unless you tweak your privacy settings ) .
Private matters should always be handled privately : via email or through personal messages .
Oh no she did n’t !
Please take discretion when you post those pictures from your trip to Vegas .
When you post pictures of yourself and of friends always be considerate and do not post pictures that may end up costing your friends ( or yourself ) their jobs or business .
If a picture is ever in question , ask permission first before you post !
Me ! Me!
Me !
Constantly using your social networks ( Twitter , Facebook , etc. ) for nothing but self - promotion .
There is nothing , and I mean nothing , that will make me un - follow or de-friend someone faster than this .
Before following anyone , I always check their stream to see the quality of content if I can .
Be proud to be you .
Personalize your profile .
Put your picture up there ( make sure to refer back to # xxx ) .
Tell people who you are in the bio .
Social networking is about real relationships .
Add a custom background and do n’t forget to put up some sort of contact information .
They really liked what you wrote .
Shameless Self - Promotion .
Just as said above about repeated self - promotion , the same goes for streaming only your blog ’s RSS feed .
Point , Un - follow , click .
Bye Bye .
Read all about it !
Please , please do not use social networking sites as a public sounding board for personal and confidential correspondence .
If you were dissatisfied with something that occurred do not publicize it by broadcasting your dissatisfaction with the turnout to your entire audience .
It looks very unprofessional for you and makes you appear untrustworthy .
Nice to meet you .
Send a direct message to every new follower / friend promoting yourself or your products .
Do n’t be surprised if you quickly lose followers / friends .
Spam !
It is never a good idea to export your connections information to add them to your email list that you send an email to every week .
If they wanted your newsletter they would join , trust me .
Buy from me !
It is also never a good idea to find email addresses of individuals you would like to sell to from social sites in order to send them something to try to sell them or promote yourself .
Can you endorse me ?
Please ?!
Please do not ask someone to give you a review or endorsement if you do n’t know them well enough for them to give you an accurate review .
Think- people that you have worked with are the best to ask .
Extra ! Extra !
Read all about me !
When the only articles you post are your own , its time to step away from the social media sites and find a new article you did NOT write to post .
Movie Reel .
Please do not ask me to watch you stupid video any more .
I also do not want to subscribe to your channel so I can watch more of this crap .
And no I will definitely not give you a 5 star rating .
As said previously , etiquette in the social networking world is much like that in real life and everything you do should be done rationally .
These are just a few of the most major etiquette faux pas that should be avoided at all costs if you want to save yourself from dealing with angry friends & followers .
Think before you post anything , whether it be a picture or text because it may come back to haunt you someday .
Foul language , racial slurs or comments , or any sort of insulting words should not be taken lightly and should NEVER be done .
Always remember that friends , family and coworkers may be seeing what you are posting .

I was thrilled when I saw that Mark Shuttleworth announced the election of Elizabeth Krumbach to the Ubuntu Community Council .
Here is my “ open memo ” of congratulations to Elizabeth :
Elizabeth , you earned this honor to serve through your competent and tireless efforts to positively contribute to FOSS ( Free and Open Source Software ) communities like Ubuntu and its upstream , Debian .
Collectively , it is the work done in the FOSS communities that has built a “ game changing ” software infrastructure which already delivers business results to illions of organizations around the world … day in and day out .
Thank you for all that you do by contributing to these vitally important communities !
The Ubuntu Community Council plays an important role in the management and development of the communities which not only build the Ubuntu operating system but also contribute to the FOSS communities that intersect with Ubuntu in so many ways .
Your good judgement and broad experience on the workings ( both socially and technically ) of FOSS communities will help Ubuntu continue producing software to meet the needs of more and more individuals and organizations and thereby grow the whole FOSS ecosystem .
From working with you the past few years , I know you are ready to lead Ubuntu in support of reaching toward the lofty ideal of eternally regenerative software ( ERS ) .
ERS is an emergent property of the Debian GNU / Linux operating system ( which Ubuntu has inherited ) wherein all the component software is integrated to facilitate easy upgrades ( re- generation ) through each and every ( eternally ) major new release of the operating system .
I eagerly look forward to seeing how your contributions to the Council will foster efforts to improve the integration and eternal regenerativity of free and open source software in support of providing business results to all the organizations that have so wisely chosen to use FOSS .

James Kwak has a great response to Robert Shiller 's FT op - ed about financial innovation .
But his line at the end about how " for the sake of argument , I am willing to concede that these are useful innovations that would make people better off " has been misconstrued , and it's worth pointing out that in fact they 'reuseful innovations that would make people better off .

James Kwak has a great response to Robert Shiller ’s FT op - ed about financial innovation .
But his line at the end about how “ for the sake of argument , I am willing to concede that these are useful innovations that would make people better off ” has been misconstrued , and it ’s worth pointing out that in fact they ’re not useful innovations that would make people better off .
Why not ?
Mainly because , at heart , they ’re all variations on the theme of doing - clever - things - with - as - yet - uninvented - derivatives .
But that ’s a theme which really should n’t have survived the financial crisis .
In 2003 , Alan Greenspan famously said that “ “ what we have found over the years in the marketplace is that derivatives have been an extraordinarily useful vehicle to transfer risk from those who should n’t be taking it to those who are willing to and are capable of doing so . ”
But , as it turned out , they were n’t .
Lots of people wanted to transfer risk , and precious few were genuinely willing and able to take it on : even hedge funds generally prided themselves on being lower - risk than the stock market as a whole .
The result was a system where derivatives were used to hide risks , and shunt them off , unseen , into the tails .
A system where hidden risks turned out to be much more dangerous than if they ’d all been out in the open all along .
In each of Shiller ’s examples , you start with a risk that an individual wants to lay off : the risk that home prices will fall , or that the market will plunge just before you retire , or that inflation or healthcare costs will kick in after you retire .
And in each case , the individual tries to lay off that risk elsewhere .
Shiller simply takes it on faith , however , that a nice liquid market can and should spring up to provide two - way prices in such risks , solving lots of problems at a stroke ; he does n’t stop to consider that maybe the reason such markets have n’t sprung up is precisely that there ’s no real demand from anybody wanting to take on those risks .
In reality , Shiller should know that better than anyone : his much - vaunted house - price derivatives have gone nowhere , partly because no one ever really had any need or desire to go long .
Shiller ’s first proposed innovation is an attempt to deal with the regrettable move , in recent years , towards a “ popular reliance on housing as an investment ” .
Only except for suggesting the obvious — moving people away from the idea of housing as an investment , and towards good old - fashioned renting — he comes up with a complex mortgage with all manner of embedded options .
As with any derivative , those options will be a zero - sum game , and you can be sure the homeowner is going to end up on the wrong side of it .
But Shiller still seems to think it ’s a good idea for homeowners to buy them , instead of simply getting a plain - vanilla , easily - comprehensible mortgage , with payments which are set over the life of the loan and which are entirely predictable .
Shiller ’s second innovation is target - date mutual funds : I ’m almost surprised that he did n’t suggest some kind of principal - protection scheme , involving derivatives , instead .
( Maybe because that would have sounded too much like portfolio insurance , which caused the 1987 crash . )
But target - date funds are widely misunderstood , and in 2008 some 2010 funds contrived to underperform the S&P 500 .
They ’re a mess , and they ’re expensive , and it ’s not obvious that they do any good .
So color me unconvinced on this front .
Finally , Shiller dreams of annuities which would pay out a set amount of money per month for life , after adjusting for inflation , and which on top would include all healthcare costs .
Nice dream , Bob .
But there ’s a good reason such things do n’t exist : no insurer wants to take on a large amount of those kind of risks , and nor would any self - respecting insurance regulator allow them to do so .
There is n’t a long - dated derivatives market in future health - insurance costs , but if there were , very few people would have any reason to sell protection against those costs rising , at any price .
Sure , a few hedge funds might dabble in the market .
But they could never satisfy demand .
And in any case , as with the mortgages , the buyer of the annuity would generally lose out , just because of the zero-sum nature of derivatives .
Since the cost of the embedded options would be hidden in the price of the annuity , the insurer would have a license to charge through the nose for it , and the buyer of the annuity would never know .
Simplicity and transparency are good things , and Shiller ’s innovations go the other way instead .
That ’s nothing to get excited about .
私は会社員ですが 、 ” 会社員＝安定 ” と思われがちです。実は転職を2回ほどしました。会社自体がブラック企業だったり、パワハラ上司の下で働かないといけなかったりします。
そして、問題の給料ですが、こちらも安定しているとは言え、役職につかない限りは、残業代で稼ぐしかありませんよね。
でも残業で帰ってからの自由時間は削られるし、それで得た給料もそんなに多いとは言えない。
そういう人生が嫌で投資を始めたんですが、勉強が足りなかったのか、勝ったり負けたりを繰り返してました。この『先乗り投資法』に出会うまでの損失は勉強代だったと今では思いますが、当時は非常に孤独で苦しかったです。
少しでも私と同じ苦しみの人に向けて、体験者として、失敗なく安定した投資法をお伝えするために、口コミや評判をまとめました。よろしければ最後まで読んでくださればと思います。
『先乗り投資法』は稼げるのか
まず一番に詐欺を疑 う
さて、勘の良い人はまず詐欺を疑いますよね。正しい反応だと思います。
私もまずは詐欺を疑いました。というのも、過去に数回、「稼げる！」と謳った投資法に引っかかったことがあったからです。
過去に詐欺に遭った私だからこそ、どういう点が詐欺と違うのか、そういう観点からもお話できると思います。
結論から言えば、現在月400万円くらい稼いでいますから、詐欺ではない、というところを順を追って説明していきます。
大岩川源太先生について
『先乗り投資法』を知った教室の主催の方は大岩川源太先生と言う方です。
こちらの源太先生のプロフィールから説明していきます。
どんな方か、と言うと、ラジオNIKKEI
にラジオ側から依頼されて出演している方です。私はこのラジオを聞いてからセミナーに参加しました。いきなりセミナー参加はハードルが高い、という方はこのラジオを聞くことをおすすめします。
さらに、ラジオ放送というものは、 ” ラジオ枠を買い取って配信する”のが普通なんです。そこを依頼されて放送している、となると、信頼度もかなり高まります。
これはラジオ側の信用問題にもなりますから、それなりの社会的な信頼がない限り、依頼はしませんよね？ここだけでかなり信頼への高さが伝わると思います。
ここまでは、源太先生の信頼度について話してきました。重要なところは、『先乗り投資法』に失敗はないのかどうか、ですね。
ではこの教室の実績を紹介します。
7万円を1億円に
生徒さんの中にこの『先乗り投資法』で7万円を1億にした生徒さんがいらっしゃいます。
この人がたまたますごかったのでは？と思う方いらっしゃるかもしれませんが、他の生徒さんも億万長座を数十人いらっしゃるそうです。懇親会があるので、たまたまそのうちの一人と話しました。
私も早く仲間入りしたいものです。
失敗しない！三種の神器
では、源太先生の３ステップによるテンプレート化されたメゾットなので迷うことなくベストな銘柄にベストなタイミングで売り買いできる三種の神器をお伝えします。
STEP1 高騰銘柄が自動発掘できる ” 源太指 数 ”
初心者はここがダ メ
まず、初心者の勝てない理由を説明します。
だいたいネットや教室で初心者に教えるのは「チャートを見なさい」だと思います。チャートだと見た目が入りやすそうでいかにも初心者用、と思いがちですが、チャートばかり見ていても勝てません。
何故なら大勝ちしてる億万長者の投資家はチャートなんて見ていないからです。
『源太指数』を使 う
さて、チャートを見ずにどうやって勝つのか、と言うと、『源太指数』を使って解析します。これを使えば爆勝ちできる銘柄を簡単に見つけ出すことができますよ。
先程お話した、7万円を1億円にした生徒さん、実は『源太指数』の情報だけで１億円にしたんです。もちろん他の億万長座の方々もこちらの『源太指数』の情報で勝っています。それだけ実績があるということです。
ここまで聞いて、 「 良い銘柄さえ見つかれば大きく勝てるのは誰だってわかる。でもその良い銘柄を毎日毎日見つけるのが難しいんじゃないの？」と思いますよね。私もそう思ってました。
現実に、５０００もの銘柄から良い銘柄を探せないから多くの人が儲からずに挫折してしまうのです。
ところが、『源太指数』を使って、入力しただけで、これから高騰するような銘柄が見付かるようになります。
たとえば、『源太指数』を使って、高騰銘柄が一年で何十個も見つかったとしたら、さらにその中に１０倍２０倍になる銘柄がいくつか含まれていたら…
まるで宝探しのような楽しさを味わえます。
ここまでくると、面白いように資産が増えます。銀行口座の通帳にどんどんお金が増えて、数えたことのないような桁数の残高になっているのが楽しくなります。
STEP2 ベストタイミングで売り買い戦術が出来る『源太カレンダー』
次は『源太カレンダー』で売り買いのタイミングを決めるステップに行きましょう。
『源太カレンダー』とは？
カレンダーと言うからには、文字通りカレンダーです。何のカレンダーかと言うと、大口の投資家の売り買いのスケジュールについてです。これは年間通して、決まっているのでそれを知ればいつまでそのトレンドが続くかわかります。利確のタイイングもバッチリわかります。
自然に効率よく、損小利大の効率の良い投資ができるようになります。
これを身につければ、無駄な負けが少なくなって、大きく勝てるようになるという事です。
コロナ相場にも対 応
『源太カレンダー』は、大口投資家に相乗りして勝つことができます。まさに魔法のようなカレンダーですよね。
昨今、コロナで相場は大荒れしました。実はこの『源太カレンダー』は、コロナの相場にも対応していました。コロナの騒動になった時には、「ああ、さすがに大荒れして負けてしまうな」とある程度覚悟していました。
しかし、負けどころか驚きの安定を見せてくれました。周囲がマイナスということを考えるとこのアドバンテージはかなり大きかったです。
こういった計算式は、何かと例外に弱く、今まで習った他の投資法では、それが顕著に現れていました。しかし、この『源太カレンダー』の実力は、コロナ騒動でも安定していることが証明されました。
一説によるとではオイルショック以上の現象らしく、歴史的な騒動にも対応している、というと安心して使うことができますね。
STEP3 投資に必 須 ” 資金管理 術 ”
さて、突然ですが投資する人なら絶対に１００%知っておくべきこととは何でしょうか。
それは、資金管理術です。実は何よりも先に知っておくべき、と言っても過言ではありません。
これを知らずに、資金管理術をないがしろにしてるから投資で勝てなと言い換えることもできます。
逆にまずこれさえ知っておけば、投資で大きく資金を目減りさせることはほぼなくなります。なぜか勝てない方はまずここから見直すことも有りだと思います。
実はこの資金管理術は、不動産投資でも使えますし、企業への投資や事業投資、金などの購入や、さらにギャンブルでも使えます。
幅広くお金を稼ぎたい人は身につけるべきと言える最強の知見です。
３ステップまとめ
このように、『源太流三種の神器』を使えば、自然に損小利大の投資が効率よくできるようになます。
それをいくつもの優良銘柄に分散していけば、平均化されて安定的に右肩上がりに勝ち続けながら、その中にいくつかの銘柄で時折１０倍２０倍に跳ね上がってさらに急勾配で資産を大きく拡大できるようになります。
” 先乗り投資 法 ” の口コミ・悪評につい て
ここまで 「先乗り投資法」の概要について書いてきました。私の体験談だけでは不足に感じるかと思いますので、私以外の「先乗り投資法」経験者の口コミや評判についても記述していこうと思います。
怪しいかも…と疑っていた私！でも…（20代・派遣社員）
実は最初 は 「怪しそう！」って思ってました…。でも無料のセミナーを受けて、あんまりにサポートが充実しているので、騙されてもいいからここで学びたい！と飛び込みました！それがなんと正解…！私と同じように怪しんでいる人、まずは無料のセミナーを受けてみてほしいです！
早く知りたかったの一言 （40代・男性）
早く知りたかったの一言に尽きる。ここまで安定して勝つことができる投資法は今までになかった。あってもさすがにコロナには対応してなかった…。勝ち続けるということが本当にあり得ることだと、過去の自分に教えてあげたい。
もっと稼ぎたい！（20代・フリーター）
確かに勝てる！でもまだまだ稼ぎたい！想像よりあんまり稼げてないかも…？きっと俺はこの教室に来て数ヶ月だからだろうけど、早く億万長者の仲間入りしたくてウズウズしてる！懇親会で話聞いてるとすごいモチベーションになる！もっと早く始めてたら今頃は…と楽しくなるよね！
人生ピンチからのチャンス（40代・主婦）
パートの人間関係に嫌気が差して半ばヤケクソで参加しました（笑）でもすごく人生が変わった…。前ほどカリカリしなくなったし、パートも今では週２～３に減らしてこっちが副業みたいになってきて、「ここ辞めても私には投資があるし」と別のステージから俯瞰して人生を見てるみたい。良い意味でお金って人を変える力があるんだな～。この教室の懇親会で仲良くなった人も居て、本当に良かった。
教室の交流につい て
口コミでも何人か仰ってる ” 全体交流 ” について補足しておきます。
月 に2回セミナーが開催されています。参加費は無料です。また、懇親会というのも開催されており、こちらは飲食費のみ別途かかります。
他の教室ではなかなかない懇親会を開いている理由は、”孤独による挫折”を防ぐためだそうです。勝てる投資法を知っていても、知らないことや不安なことをシェア出来ずにずっとやり続けることはなかなか難しいですよね。こういった孤独により、挫折してしまう人も少なくないそうです。
そんなことのないように、源太先生がわざわざ懇親会を用意なさっているそうです。
ただセミナーに集まるだけ、となるとなんだが味気ないですが、みんなそれぞれの人生があって、どうして投資に行き着いたのか…そんな話を懇親会ですると、仲間が居るという安心感が得られます。これは何事にも得難いものです。
もちろん、コロナの関係上、開きずらい時期もあります。でも、安全な体制で開いてくださってます。是非同じ成功を志す中との交流をして、楽しくモチベーションアップにして、仲間を増やしましょう。
投資教室のサポート体制について
次に、こちらの投資教室のサポート体制についても説明します。
非常に重要な徹底サポートを提供してくれています。
参加者全員が稼げる徹底サポート
参加した方全員が稼げるようにサポートが充実した環境を実現しています。稼げる人だけが、ではないところが有り難いですね。
サポート期間内であれば、回数無制限で何度も質問が可能だそうです。以前私が通っていた教室では、数件質問した後、それ以上の質問は課金システムでした。今思えばそうやって稼いでいた教室でしたね…。こちらの教室ではそんなことはないので安心してください。
また、メールだけでなく、電話での質問も可能です。メールだけでは分かりづらいところも電話だと助かります。これについても追加の課金システムはありません。
他の教室と比べても、これだけ充実しているサポート体制はなかなかありません。実体験でも、普通はここのサポートの優劣でお金を稼ぐ教室というのが多いです。
そういった点でも非常に安心して参加が出来ました。
まとめ
” 先乗り投資 法 ” について、概要や口コミなどをまとめてきました。いかがだったでしょうか。
ここまで読んで、まだ不安に思う方、いらっしゃると思います。私もそうでした。というのも、詐欺のような教室に引っかかったこともあり、とても慎重になっていました。だからこそ、皆さんも慎重にこうして調べていることと思います。
私も友人に聞いて、この教室に参加をしました。
最初はなぜ私に教えてくれるのか疑問に思っていました。
だいたい投資法などの教室詐欺は、紹介料を貰いますが、もちろん友人に紹介料は入っていませんし、そんな制度は存在しません。友人に聞いたところ、安定して稼ぐようになって、周囲の人に還元したくなった、と言っていました。
確かに私も、1年以上この先乗り投資法で稼いでいますが、恩返しをしたくなる、という友人の気持ちが分かってきました。
その一端としてこの記事を書いて皆さんに紹介している訳です。
源太先生に本当に感謝しています。
これから投資を始める方も、投資はしていたけれど勝ち続けることはなかった、という方も一度是非セミナーにいらしてみてはいかがでしょうか。
最後まで読んでいただき、ありがとうございました。

Scientists studying cognitive decline that accompanies aging have been interested in nicotinic receptors , part of a key neural pathway that not only enhances learning and memory skills but reinforces addictions as well .
The loss of these receptors has been difficult to study in living subjects , but Yale University researchers using advanced imaging technology have successfully tracked the loss of receptors with age , according to a report in the September issue of the journal Neurobiology of Aging .
“ Measurable decline in cognitive abilities is evident by age 50 , but our knowledge of the changes in the brain associated with these deficits has been largely confined to post - mortem studies , ” said Christopher H. van Dyck , senior author of the study and Professor of Psychiatry and Neurobiology and Director of the Alzheimer ’s Disease Research Unit .
The Yale University researchers used SPECT imaging to track concentrations of nicotinic receptors in eight brain regions of 47 subjects aged 18 to 85 .
They observed an age - related loss of receptors in seven of eight brain regions , at a rate of about 5 percent per decade of life .
Nicotinic receptors reinforce addictions such as smoking , but also facilitate learning and memory .
Autopsies of dementia patients have revealed a significant decline of these receptors .
“ Nicotinic receptors are such promising targets that pharmaceutical companies are currently exploring nicotine analogues as potential treatments for Alzheimer ’s disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment , ” van Dyck said .
The findings are additional evidence that nicotinic receptors may play a role in the cognitive decline associated with normal aging .
“ These results may encourage the broadening of therapeutic trials to target the cognitive decline associated with healthy aging , ” van Dyck said .
Other Yale authors of the paper are Effie M. Mitsis , Kelly P. Cosgrove , Julie K. Staley , Frederic Bois , Erin B. Frohlich , Gilles D. Tamagnan , Kristina M. Estok and John P. Seibyl .

* Woodrow Wilson won the 1919 prize in recognition of his Fourteen Points peace programme and work in achieving inclusion of the Covenant of the League of Nations in the 1919 Treaty of Versailles at the end of World War One .
“ The President succeeded in bringing a design for a fundamental law of humanity into present - day international politics , ” the Nobel Committee said .
* Theodore Roosevelt won the 1906 prize for his role in ending the bloody 1905 war between two of the world ’s great powers , Japan and Russia .
The result was the Treaty of Portsmouth signed by Russia and Japan on Sept. 5 , 1905 , at Portsmouth , New Hampshire .

I heard about this note from Linus Torvalds from David Wolever yesterday .
Here ’s Torvald ’s opinion of C++.
C++ is a horrible language .
It ’s made more horrible by the fact that a lot of substandard programmers use it , to the point where it ’s much , much easier to generate total and utter crap with it .
Quite frankly , even if the choice of C were to do * nothing * but keep the C++ programmers out , that in itself would be a huge reason to use C .
Well , I ’m nowhere near as talented a programmer as Linus Torvalds , but I totally disagree with him .
If it ’s easy to generate crap in a relatively high - level and type - safe language like C++ , then it must be child ’s play to generate crap in C .
It ’s not fair to compare world - class C programmers like Torvalds and his peers to average C++ programmers .
Either compare the best with the best or compare the average with the average .
Comparing the best with the best is n’t very interesting .
I imagine gurus like Bjarne Stroustrup and Herb Sutter can write C++ as skillfully as Linus Torvalds writes C , though that is an almost pointless comparison .
Comparing average programmers in each language is more important , and I do n’t believe C would come out on top in such a comparison .
Torvalds talks about “ STL and Boost and other total and utter crap . ”
A great deal of thought has gone into the STL and to Boost by some very smart people over the course of several years .
Their work has been reviewed by countless peers .
A typical C or C++ programmer simply will not write anything more efficient or more robust than the methods in these libraries if they decide to roll their own .
Torvalds goes on to say
In other words , the only way to do good , efficient , and system - level and portable C++ ends up to limit yourself to all the things that are basically available in C .
I ’ve had the opposite experience .
I ’d say that anyone wanting to write a large C program ends up reinventing large parts of C++ and doing it poorly .
The features added to C to form C++ were added for good reasons .
For example , once you ’ve allocated and de-allocated C struct s a few times , you realize it would be good to have functions to do this allocation and de-allocation .
You basically end up re-inventing C++ constructors and destructors .
But you end up with something totally sui generis .
There ’s no compiler support for the conventions you ’ve created .
No one can read about your home - grown constructors and destructors in a book .
And you probably have not thought about as many contingencies as the members of the C++ standards committee have thought of .
I disagree that writing projects in C keeps out inferior C++ programmers who are too lazy to write C .
One could as easily argue the opposite , that C is for programmers too lazy to learn C++.
Neither argument is fair , but I think there is at least as much validity to the latter as there is to the former .
I think there may be a sort of bimodal distribution of C programmer talent : some of the best and some of the worst programmers use C but for different reasons .
I do not claim that C++ is perfect , but I ’ve never had any desire to go back to C after I moved to C++ many years ago .
I ’ll grant that I ’m not writing my own operating system , but neither are the vast majority of programmers .
For my work , C++ is as low - level as I care to go .

I hear Kombucha drinks are all the rage in the States , but you ca n’t find them here in NZ .
So when I got a chance to get a free Kombucha “ Mushroom ” of my own , I jumped at the chance .
The truth is , it is n’t a mushroom at all .
It is a symbiotic colony of bacteria and yeasts aka SCOBY aka a zoogleal mat .
So it is a living beastie , much like a sourdough starter that you have to love and feed .
OK , at least feed .
Many people with one seem to call theirs “ Scooby the SCOBY , ” but I ’ve christened mine “ Z Mat , ” preferrably said in your best ‘ Allo ‘ Allo fake French accent .
Frugal Man says the SCOBY looks like a sheep placenta .
I have no expertise in sheep midwifery , but I do admit the SCOBY itself looks pretty disgusting .
Have a peek and see what you think .
Fortunately , you do n’t drink that part .
For the uninitiated , kombucha tea is slightly tangy and effervescent , reminiscent of a light apple cider that originated in Asia .
Kombucha tea supposedly acts as a detoxifier and most sites that mention this delicious beverage warn you not to drink too much of it .
I could happily drink it all day , so I have to pace myself .
I used to shell out $ 3 per single serve bottle for these back when I was a grad student in Austin , TX so it definitely deserves to go in the “ Expensive to Buy , Cheap to Make ” category .
Now I ’ve got Z Mat , I make up kombucha by the litre for pennies .
If you are n’t too weirded out by seeing Z Mat , here ’s how to make your own tea .
Kombucha Tea Bring 3 litres ( about 3 quarts ) of water to a boil .
Add 1 cup of sugar and stir until the sugar melts .
Add 3 tea bags of black tea and immediately remove the water from heat .
Allow the sweet tea mixture to cool completely then add your SCOBY along with a bit of the liquid surrounding it .
Cover with a cloth and place somewhere warm for 7 - 10 days .
When your SCOBY has produced a “ daughter ” ( another SCOBY ! ) your tea is ready to drink .
Leave for another couple of days for a tangier taste .
Refrigerate when it has reached a taste you like .
Give your extra SCOBY to a friend .
Or if you bury it in the garden , make sure the neighbors do n’t see you a la Rear Window or they will think you are up to no good .
You can use your original SCOBY indefinitely and every time you make Kombucha tea , you ’ll have an extra one .
Think Tribbles and you ’ve got the idea .
Like the idea of a non -dairy probiotic drink , but not fond of Ze Mat ?
Have a look at Water Kefir instead .
Much lower ick factor and still tastes great .
Where can you get a Kombucha SCOBY , you ask ?
Well , first off , not from me , my pretties .
Since I can no longer taste bubbles due to my weird migraine drug side effects , I do n’t keep one any more .

“ What ’s happened is 78 percent of the people who lost their jobs in the recession are men , ” said Joan Williams , director of the Center for WorkLife Law at the University of California Hastings College of Law in San Francisco .
“ That has brought home to many families that having one income places you in a very vulnerable position .
Some women who expected to take a long time out of the work force suddenly felt they needed to re-enter , in some cases much more quickly than they expected . ”
The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics found preliminary evidence of affluent women returning to the labor force .
When it comes to women with a college education who are 25 to 44 years old and living with a spouse , the proportion of those working or looking for work increased to 78.4 percent in the first half of 2009 , from 76 percent in the first half of 2007 .
Economists say this is surprising because the percentage of people in the work force usually drops as unemployed workers grow discouraged and stop looking for work in a recession .
Over the same period , the proportion of men of the same age and circumstance inched down , falling from 97.4 percent to 97.1 percent .
It is too early to tell whether those numbers reflect an increase above and beyond the long - term growth of women ’s participation in the work force .
Examining women ’s work force participation  and especially women with children  has been one of the battlefields of economics .
In the last several years , some researchers have suggested that many affluent working mothers chose to leave the work force during the boom times of the 90’s and early this decade , saying there was a trend of women opting out of careers once they had children .
The suggestion  highlighted in an Oct. 26 , 2003 New York Times Magazine cover article  prompted a huge controversy .
A plantation containing nearly 50,000 marijuana plants discovered in a sweetcorn field near Lelystad on Wednesday belongs to Wageningen University , news agency ANP reported on Thursday , quoting Ton van Scheppingen , director of the university ’s plant research unit .
.
Police found the plantation after a tip - off .
The field has an estimated street value of € 4.4 m , ANP said .
Police had begun clearing the plants but stopped when shown the university ’s official licence to grow cannabis .
ANP did not state why the university needed so many plants and what sort of research was being carried out .
According to Radio Netherlands , the field is part of an experiment to find out if hemp can replace cotton as a textile crop .
Michael Steele goes to a black college and insults a woman whose mother died of cancer because she said that everyone should have good health care .
So people go out to town halls , they go to the community , and they ’re like this .
( SHAKES ARMS )
It makes for great TV .
You ’ll probably make it tonight .
Enjoy it .
First , there 's the insanity of the head of the RNC criticizing anyone for disrupting a town hall meeting .
Second , you have a woman whose mother died , ostensibly because of a lack of insurance , basically being insulted for daring to try to call attention to herself .
And this is not the only example .
I can think of a dozen instances of Republican officials dismissing people trying to explain how the current system is broken .
There was Tom Coburn telling the crying woman whose insurance refused to cover her husband that she should go to her neighbors for help .
There was " Great White Hope " Republican Lynn Jenkins telling an uninsured constituent to be a grown - up and get insurance .
The callousness on display at these things is palpable .
And it could easily be turned into a powerful force for change .
That is , if there was one Democratic strategist interested in making a moral case anymore instead of a bunch of functionaries squandering a progressive agenda in favor of pleasing elites and talking about " bending the cost curve . "
JERUSALEM — Ultra-orthodox
Jews have been rioting the last few weeks against a parking lot the municipality wants to leave open during the Jewish Sabbath , leading to dozens of arrests and quite a few moderate to serious injuries .
Secular activists have held protests in favor of free garaging for those who defy God by driving on Saturday .
All of which is a sign of good times in Israel .
Here ’s why :
It shows that Israelis think there ’s nothing worse to worry about .
When I first came to Jerusalem in 1996 , the ultra-Orthodox , or " Haredim " as they ’re known here ( it means “ those who quake , ” as in quaking before the wrathful God of the Jewish Bible ) used to riot over a major thoroughfare that ran through one of their neighborhoods .
They wanted Bar - Ilan Street closed between sundown Friday and the onset of Saturday night .
The Sabbath , they argued , ought to be sacred to every Jew , but at the very least no one ought to drive along Bar - Ilan , reminding them that its sanctity was being violated ( by people who in turning their keys in the ignition were violating the rabbinic commandment not to kindle a flame on the Sabbath .
It ’s one of 39 tasks “ set aside ” on the Sabbath , because they were used in building the Ark of Covenant and therefore should n’t be carried out on the day of rest .
No ritual slaughtering , tanning — of leather , that is — or separating of threads is allowed either , for example ) .
In my neighborhood , there was one old white - bearded rabbi who used to sit on a stool at the side of the road reading and wagging his finger at me as I drove by .
But in more religious neighborhoods there was real violence .
In Mea Shearim , the heart of ultra-Orthodox Jerusalem , gangs of black - hatted rioters used to light trash cans on fire , throw stones , kick and spit on journalists , and aim rather feeble punches at policemen .
( Feeble because almost all the rioters are full - time yeshiva students who are , to say the least , short on regular physical activity . )
Secular activists used to counter - protest in Jerusalem .
They ’d turn up , too , at shopping malls near largely secular Tel Aviv to barrack the so - called “ Sabbath inspectors , ” non-Jews employed by the government to hand out fines to businesses that opened on the holy day .
This was among the most important issues of those days .
Then came the intifada .
The Sabbath was n’t so contentious anymore with suicide bombers working every day of the week .
Maybe it ’s also that Israeli Jews decided it was time to unite against their attackers .
But a month ago , Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat ( who replaced his ultra-Orthodox predecessor this spring ) decided to leave a parking lot beside city hall open through the Sabbath .
There are plenty of restaurants and bars open Friday night on a nearby street and Barkat ’s aim was to prevent that street from filling with poorly parked cars .
Trouble was the lot was n’t far from the edge of Beit Israel , one of the ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods stretching through central Jerusalem .
Rabbis ordered out their spindly troops and rioting ensued .
Barkat switched the parking lot to one underneath the Old City walls beside the Jaffa Gate .
If he ’d started out there , things might ’ve been different .
But the rabbis had a good head of steam up and had returned to the rhetoric of my early days in Jerusalem — namely that secular Israelis were the worst anti-Semites , because they were self - hating and felt inadequate in the face of the dedication to religion of their ultra-Orthodox compatriots whose observance they wished to destroy .
So this past weekend the rioting reached a new stage of ugliness .
Police arrested 57 ultra-Orthodox protesters , many of whom had bussed in for the Sabbath .
One man fell off a wall and was in serious condition in hospital .
The riots continued throughout Sunday , as the ultra-Orthodox protested for the release of those who had been arrested the previous day .
The riots centered around Sabbath Square in the middle of Mea Shearim .
There are plenty of problems for Israel these days , not least the tortuous attempt by the current right - wing government to persist with settlement building in the face of ( for the first time in years ) genuine American insistence on a construction freeze .
It is n’t beyond the bounds of possibility , too , that Europe might get tough on Israel unless peace talks with the Palestinians show some fruit .
But in comparison to the intifada , these are easy times for Israel .
Long may the Sabbath be a time for rioting .

Reader DavidC posits this nugget about Ricky Nolasco .
It seemed like Ricky was using his change - up more often than he usually does , and I do n’t see that he used his big breaking ball at all .
His change - up sinks very well , which probably explains all the ground balls .
He ’s been using it a lot lately ; maybe he ’s trying to develop it to use on a regular basis , and is toying with it in different scenarios to see how best to use it .
That ’s my take , anyway .
I promised I ’d take a look at it , and the Maniac does n’t go back on his promises .
David said to use data starting from the second Houston Astros start , the one in which Ricky dominated the Astros , going nine innings and striking out 10 batters while walking none and surrendering a homer .
It ’s worth noting that during this span from that game to yesterday night ’s struggle against the St. Louis Cardinals , Ricky has struck out 36 batters , walked eight , and given up four home runs .
Unfortunately , teams have a 24 % LD % against him , which has likely something to do with his 39 hits and 22 earned runs allowed .
Well , despite the small sample that this is ( he only faced 156 batters in these six games ) , I still checked out Ricky ’s changeup to see if anything good was coming out of it .
First off , the amount .
Ricky threw 72 changeups according to Pitch f/x during these six games , out of 609 total pitches .
That comes out to a percentage of 12 % changeups thrown .
According to Ricky ’s FanGraphs page , Pitch f/x has him throwing his changeup 8.1 % of the time in total , including this six game stretch .
So in that sense , David is right , Ricky is using more changeups in this six game set .
David also said that Ricky is throwing his big curve less , which is true ;
Ricky threw the curve 71 times , and as you ’ll see in the movement chart , some of those curves probably were sliders .
Let ’s look at his movement chart and see what he ’s throwing in general .
Get used to the picture , because I like it for Ricky .
In any case , you can see that there ’s good separation between each of his pitches .
The irregular moving fastballs are definitely faster than the changes , so those are OK .
There are some curves that straddle the line between curve and slider , and some that are most certainly sliders .
Ricky throws most of his breaking pitches at an equal amount , but the slider gets thrown the most of the three .
Now let ’s look at the changeup .
The first chart has the ones that did not go in play , the second has the batted balls that did go in play .
Let me tell ya .
There ’s a definite reason why many of those pitches are on the left side of the plate .
Ricky has to use the change and fastball primarily versus lefties , as he ca n’t throw his slider against them .
It ’s imperative that the pitch be somewhat effective , because we ’ll definitely be facing lefties and switch hitters , especially in our division with the Philadelphia Phillies , and Ricky needs to be able to work efficiently against them .
In any case , when you see the changeups not in play , the first thing that pops out are the good whiff counts .
Thouhg it ’s a small sample size , Ricky ’s gotten 10 whiffs out of 50 swings , a decent 25 % whiff rate on the pitch .
Compare that 17 % whiffs for his curve , 11 % on his fastball , and 28 % on his slider .
You can also see that he ’s gotten those whiffs out of the zone , with a few more swings out of the zone getting just contacted for balls .
That ’s one of the reasons Ricky can rack up the strikeouts , because he can use the changeup when he ’s ahead to put out lefties if necessary .
He ’s also been able to place it in good locations for the most part , with nothing inside to left handers .
Something else that David pointed out was Ricky ’s ability to get grounders out of the changeup .
So far , so good in that regard .
Of the 18 balls in play off the changeup , half of them went for ground outs , with a few others that went through the hole base hits via the ground ball .
So if there was one pitch for Ricky to get grounders on , it ’s this one .
That being said , this was a small sample , so we ca n’t get too excited ; it could just have been a nice streak for his changeup .
FanGraphs has his change valued at - 0.4 runs total , but it ’s data set seems to think some of Nolasco ’s changes are actually splitters , which they have valued at 5.6 runs total an 2.53 runs per 100 pitches .
I think the two are one and the same and there may be some merit to Ricky trying to mix more of them into his gameplan .
They seem like they might be able to get more ground balls and help him perhaps limit his use of a below average fastball ( FanGraphs values it at - 1.21 runs per 100 pitches ) .
It has n’t helped his luck any , but the results seem pretty good so far .
Let ’s keep an eye on Ricky ’s approach .
Oh , and good job spotting that DavidC .
I believe you were right on all points within the sample .
To improve the chances that hard - core heroin addicts will stick with their treatment for opioid dependence and forgo the use of illicit drugs , they should take … heroin .
That ’s the controversial conclusion of a study being published in Thursday ’s edition of the New England Journal of Medicine .
The study focused on addicts who took heroin for at least five years and had already failed two attempts at treatment .
One of those attempts had to involve methadone , which helps manage heroin cravings and blocks the drug ’s euphoric effects .
The goal was n’t necessarily to get study participants to stop using heroin altogether , but to turn their addiction into a manageable fact of life instead of a source of high - risk , illegal and / or anti-social behavior .
Canadian researchers randomly assigned 115 addicts in Vancouver and Montreal to receive diacetylmorphine – the active ingredient in heroin – and 111 others to a control group that got standard methadone treatment .
Those who took diacetylmorphine injected themselves up to three times a day in treatment clinics with medical supervision .
Then they had to remain in the clinic for 30 minutes so they could be monitored for overdoses , seizures and other serious problems .
Overall , the addicts who took diacetylmorphine did better than the ones who took methadone .
After one year , 88 % of those in the diacetylmorphine group were still in treatment , compared with 54 % in the methadone group .
They were also more likely to curb their illegal behavior – including use of illicit drugs – by a margin of 67 % to 48 % .
Patients treated with diacetylmorphine also saw bigger reductions in their illicit heroin use .
They had taken the drug for an average of 26.6 days in the month before the study started , and that number fell to 5.3 days by the end of the study .
In the methadone group , illicit heroin use fell from an average of 27.4 days per month to 12.0 days per month during the course of the study .
The researchers also reported that addicts who were treated with diacetylmorphine “ had greater improvements with respect to medical and psychiatric status , economic status , employment situation , and family and social relations , ” according to the study .
One patient from the methadone group died of an opioid overdose during the 12 - month trial .
But overall , serious adverse events were more than 2 ½ times more common among the diacetylemorphine group .
Sixteen of those participants experienced a life - threatening seizure or overdose ; all received prompt treatment at their clinic and recovered .
The researchers emphasized that most heroin addicts should continue to be treated with methadone .
But when methadone does n’t cut it , they concluded , “ prescribed , supervised use of diacetylmorphine appears to be a safe and effective adjuctive treatment for this severely affected population of patients who would otherwise remain outside the health care system . ”
That advice may sound radical , but it has already been followed in several European countries .
Switzerland , the Netherlands and Great Britain currently treat some heroin addicts with diacetylmorphine , according to an editorial accompanying the study .
In the United States , only methadone has the imprimatur of a “ medical ” drug , writes Virginia Berridge of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine at the University of London .
That bias may help explain why the Canadian researchers were unable to collaborate with their colleagues south of the border .
Perhaps , Berridge speculates , the Canadian results will have more influence on American policymakers since the study was practically “ homegrown . ”

To help lower the global warming impact of one of the world 's largest natural gas fields , General Electric has supplied Chevron , Exxon Mobile and Shell with enough compression " trains " -- the pumps and turbines that do the sequestering -- to create the world 's largest carbon sequestration project .
The trains will pump 3.3 million tons of CO2 released from natural gas mining back into the ground every year .
That 's the equivalent of taking 630,000 cars off the road .
Market prices do n't reflect hundreds of billions of dollars in hidden costs of energy production to human health and the environment , a National Research Council panel said in a report released today .
" There are many external effects of energy production and use , " said Jared Cohon , president of Carnegie Mellon University and chairman of the panel that wrote the report .
" These are important because they can lead to distortions in decision making . "
The report estimates $ 120 billion in hidden damages not related to climate change in the United States in 2005 , the primary year used in the study , which was requested by Congress .
The tally mainly reflects hidden costs of health problems from air pollution in electricity generation and transportation .
The amount does not include damages from climate change , ecosystem destruction or risks to national security .
While the report does not estimate specific costs related to damages resulting from climate change , it notes that climate - related damages done by each ton of carbon dioxide emissions will be worse in 2030 than now .
Even if total emissions remain steady with the present , the report says , the damages caused by each ton would increase 50 percent to 80 percent .
Electricity generation accounted for $ 63 billion , or more than half the quantified damages in 2005 , Cohon said in a teleconference .
Coal - fired power plants accounted for $ 62 billion of that amount , the report says .
Non-climate damages , primarily caused from sulfur dioxide , nitrogen oxide and particulate matter emissions created by burning coal , average about 3.2 cents per kilowatt - hour of energy produced .
The report says damages will fall to 1.7 cents per kilowatt - hour by 2030 .
Electricity produced from natural gas produced $ 740 million in aggregate damages in 2005 , primarily associated with air pollution .
Nuclear and renewable electricity generation such as wind and solar produced fewer hidden costs than fossil fuels , the report says .
But issues related to nuclear waste storage and uranium mining could result in additional costs and warrant further study , it says .
Heat energy , primarily produced by natural gas , resulted in about $ 1 billion of the total $ 120 billion in estimated costs , the report says .
Motor vehicles produced $ 56 billion in health and other non-climate damages , the report says .
The cost estimate includes damages for both light - and heavy - duty vehicles and a variety of fuels , and it covers their full life cycles from extraction and transportation of the fuel to manufacture and operation of the vehicle .
The report found relatively small differences in terms of damages related to different fuel types and technologies .
" In vehicle operation ... what comes out of the tailpipe accounted for less than one - third of damages from transportation , " Cohon said .
" Vehicle manufacturing made up a significant portion of the other damages . "
Corn - based ethanol resulted in similar or slightly higher non-climate damages than gasoline , the report says , because of the energy needed to produce the corn and convert it into fuel .
Cellulosic ethanol , however , had lower damages .
Electric and plug - in hybrid vehicles resulted in higher non-climate damages than other technologies , in both 2005 and in 2030 projections .
While operating the vehicles produces few emissions , production of the electricity to power them currently relies on fossil fuels .
And energy used to create the batteries and electric motors accounts for 20 percent of the manufacturing portion of life - cycle damages .
Diesel , which had some of the highest damages in 2005 , is expected to have some of the lowest in 2030 , according to the report .
Implementation of federal rules , which now require vehicles to use low - sulfur diesel , should decrease damages from diesel by 2030 .
The report notes that the change is an indication of how regulatory actions can affect energy - related damages .
The report suggests implementing other major initiatives to reduce emissions , improve energy efficiency , and shift to cleaner energy sources in order to reduce the hidden damages , but it does not recommend specific strategies .

Alleged ringleader in custody as Hillary Clinton says raid shows militants ' increasingly threatening authority of the state '
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
Commandos freed 42 hostages from captivity in a dramatic dawn raid today , ending a 22 - hour militant assault on Pakistan 's military headquarters that had embarrassed the army as it prepared for an offensive in the Taliban 's tribal stronghold .
Nineteen people , including two senior officers and eight militants , were killed during the audacious raid in central Rawalpindi , a garrison city 10 miles from Islamabad .
One militant whom the army identified as the ringleader , Dr Usman , was captured alive and was being treated for his wounds .
Major cities in Pakistan wore a tense air today , as security forces moved into high alert and ordinary Pakistanis digested the news of the brazen raid on the nerve centre of their powerful military machine .
It was the third militant spectacular in a week – last Monday , a suicide bomber disguised as a soldier killed five staff in a United Nations building , while on Friday , a huge bomb in central Peshawar killed 53 people .
Analysts said the operation underscored the potency of extremist networks despite a recent defeat by the army in Swat and a stream of US drone attacks in the tribal belt , one of which killed the Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud in August .
In London , the US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , said it showed that militants were " increasingly threatening the authority of the state " .
But , she added , " we see no evidence they are going to take over the state " .
The raid also raised questions about the degree of insider co-operation that allowed nine heavily armed attackers to penetrate the country 's most sensitive and heavily guarded area .
According to reports , the militants were wearing army uniforms and driving a vehicle bearing military licence plates when they attacked a gate leading to the headquarters , known as GHQ , at 11.30 am yesterday .
An intense 45 - minute gunfight ensued , in which a brigadier , a lieutenant colonel and several soldiers were killed .
Five militants died but another four managed to flee into a nearby security building , where they took about 45 people hostage .
The army sealed off the area and imposed strict media controls , briefly shutting down Geo , the country 's most popular television station .
Journalists were almost entirely dependent on the army for information about the unfolding drama .
The second stage of the drama came at 6 am today , when a barrage of explosions and gunfire rang out across Rawalpindi as Special Services Group ( SSG ) commandos attacked the besieged building .
Three hostages , two of them civilians , and two soldiers were killed .
Four of the remaining five militants were killed , and the army later released blurry photos of their faces .
Army spokesman Major General Athar Abbas said 20 of the hostages were kept in a room guarded by a militant wearing a suicide vest , who was shot dead before he could detonate the explosives .
But the fifth militant , later identified as the ringleader , Dr Usman , was captured alive after his suicide vest failed to explode .
He was taken to hospital and is being treated for his wounds .
Also known as Aqeel , Usman is reportedly a member of Lashkar - i- Jhangvi , a fearsome sectarian group whose members have developed strong ties with al - Qaida in recent years .
A militant of the same name was accused of orchestrating an attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team earlier this year .
Some reports described him as a former army medical corps officer .
Analysts said it appeared to be a pre-emptive strike against the army before a much - heralded assault on the Taliban stronghold of South Waziristan , where warplanes have started " softening " up militant targets in recent days .
The interior minister , Rehman Malik , said the Waziristan offensive was now " inevitable " .
He warned the militants : " We are going to come heavy on you . "
Yesterday , military intelligence raided a house where the attackers were believed to have stayed , finding military uniforms and bomb making equipment .
This morning , soldiers folded a green and white Pakistani flag over the coffin of the most senior victim of the attack , Brigadier Anwar ul Haq , who was buried in Islamabad .
One of the topics I asked most of my Coders at Work interviewees about was C ++.
I am not an expert , or even a competent C++ programmer and recognize that my own opinions about C++ are not well - informed enough to be worth much .
1
But C++ fascinates me — it ’s obviously a hugely successful language : most “ serious ” desktop apps are still written in C++ despite the recent inroads made by Objective C on OS X and perhaps some C# on Windows ; the core of Google ’s search engine is written in C++ ; and C++ dominates the games industry .
Yet C++ is also frequently reviled both by those who never use and by those who use it all the time .
That was certainly reflected in the responses I got from my Coders interviewees when I asked them about it .
Jamie Zawinski , as I ’ve discussed recently , fought tooth and nail to keep C++ out of the Netscape code base ( and eventually lost ) .
Some of that was due to the immaturity of C++ compilers and libraries at the time , circa 1994 , but it seems also to have to do with his estimation of the language as a language :
C++ is just an abomination .
Everything is wrong with it in every way .
So I really tried to avoid using that as much as I could and do everything in C at Netscape .
Part of Zawinski ’s issue with C++ is that it is simply too complex :
When you ’re programming C++ no one can ever agree on which ten percent of the language is safe to use .
There ’s going to be one guy who decides , “ I have to use templates . ”
And then you discover that there are no two compilers that implement templates the same way .
Note that Zawinski had started his career as a Lisp programmer but also used C for many years while working on Netscape .
And he later enjoyed working in Java .
So it ’s not that C++ was either too high - level or too low - level for him or that he could n’t wrap his head around object orientation .
Joshua Bloch , who also hacked low level C code for many years before becoming a big - time Java head , told me that he did n’t get into object - oriented programming until quite late : “ Java was the first object - oriented language I used with any seriousness , in part because I could n’t exactly bring myself to use C++. ”
He echoed Zawinski ’s point about how C++ forces programmers to subset the language :
I think C++ was pushed well beyond its complexity threshold and yet there are a lot of people programming it .
But what you do is you force people to subset it .
So almost every shop that I know of that uses C++ says , “ Yes , we ’re using C+ + but we ’re not doing multiple - implementation inheritance and we ’re not using operator overloading . ”
There are just a bunch of features that you ’re not going to use because the complexity of the resulting code is too high .
And I do n’t think it ’s good when you have to start doing that .
You lose this programmer portability where everyone can read everyone else ’s code , which I think is such a good thing .
Ken Thompson , who still mostly uses C despite working at Google which is largely a C++ shop , has had as long an exposure to C++ as just about anyone , having worked with with Bjarne Stroustrup , C++ ’s inventor , at Bell Labs :
I would try out the language as it was being developed and make comments on it .
It was part of the work atmosphere there .
And you ’d write something and then the next day it would n’t work because the language changed .
It was very unstable for a very long period of time .
At some point I said , no , no more .
In an interview I said exactly that , that I did n’t use it just because it would n’t stay still for two days in a row .
When Stroustrup read the interview he came screaming into my room about how I was undermining him and what I said mattered and I said it was a bad language .
I never said it was a bad language .
On and on and on .
Since then I kind of avoid that kind of stuff .
At that point in the interview I almost changed the topic .
Luckily I took one more try at asking for his actual opinion of C ++.
His reply :
It certainly has its good points .
But by and large I think it ’s a bad language .
It does a lot of things half well and it ’s just a garbage heap of ideas that are mutually exclusive .
Everybody I know , whether it ’s personal or corporate , selects a subset and these subsets are different .
So it ’s not a good language to transport an algorithm — to say , “ I wrote it ; here , take it . ”
It ’s way too big , way too complex .
And it ’s obviously built by a committee .
Stroustrup campaigned for years and years and years , way beyond any sort of technical contributions he made to the language , to get it adopted and used .
And he sort of ran all the standards committees with a whip and a chair .
And he said “ no ” to no one .
He put every feature in that language that ever existed .
It was n’t cleanly designed — it was just the union of everything that came along .
And I think it suffered drastically from that .
Brendan Eich , the CTO of the Mozilla Corporation , whose Mozilla browser is written almost entirely in C++ , talks about “ toe loss due to C and C++ ’s foot guns ” and when I asked him if there are any parts of programming that he does n’t enjoy as much as he used to , he replied :
I do n’t know .
C++.
We ’re able to use most of its features — there are too many of them .
It ’s probably got a better type system than Java .
But we ’re still screwing around with ’ 70s debuggers and linkers , and it ’s stupid .
I do n’t know why we put up with it .
At least among my interviewees , even the most positive comments about C++ tended to fall in the category of “ damning with faint praise ” .
I asked Brad Fitzpatrick , who used C++ in college and again now that he ’s at Google , whether he likes it :
I do n’t mind it .
The syntax is terrible and totally inconsistent and the error messages , at least from GCC , are ridiculous .
You can get 40 pages of error spew because you forgot some semicolon .
But — like anything else — you quickly memorize all the patterns .
You do n’t even read the words ; you just see the structure and think , “ Oh , yeah , I probably forgot to close the namespace in a header file . ”
I think the new C++ spec , even though it adds so much complexity , has a lot of stuff that ’ll make it less painful to type — as far as number of keystrokes .
The auto variables and the for loops .
It ’s more like Python style .
And the lambdas .
It ’s enough that I could delude myself into thinking I ’m writing in Python , even though it ’s C ++.
Dan Ingalls , who helped invent modern object oriented programming as part of Alan Kay ’s team that developed Smalltalk , never found C++ compelling enough to use but is n’t totally adverse to using it :
I did n’t get that much into it .
It seemed like a step forward in various ways from C , but it seemed to be not yet what the promise was , which we were already experiencing .
If I had been forced to do another bottom - up implementation , instead of using machine code I would ’ve maybe started with C++.
And I know a couple of people who are masters of C++ and I love to see how they do things because I think they do n’t rely on it for the stuff that it ’s not really that good at but totally use it as almost a metaprogramming language .
Joe Armstrong , similarly , has never felt the need to learn C++:
No , C++ , I can hardly read or write it .
I do n’t like C++ ; it does n’t feel right .
It ’s just complicated .
I like small simple languages .
It did n’t feel small and simple .
And finally Guy Steele , who probably knows more about more languages than anyone I interviewed ( or possibly anyone , period ) , has also not been drawn to C ++.
But he did go out of his way to try to say something nice about Stroustrup ’s effort :
I have not been attracted to C ++. I have written some C++ code .
Anything I think I might want to write in C++ now could be done about as well and more easily in Java .
Unless efficiency were the primary concern .
But I do n’t want to be seen as a detractor of Bjarne Stroustrup ’s effort .
He set himself up a particular goal , which was to make an object - oriented language that would be fully backwards - compatible with C .
That was a difficult task to set himself .
And given that constraint , I think he came up with an admirable design and it has held up well .
But given the kinds of goals that I have in programming , I think the decision to be backwards - compatible with C is a fatal flaw .
It ’s just a set of difficulties that ca n’t be overcome .
Obviously with only fifteen interviewees in my book I have only a sampling of possible opinions .
There are great programmers who have done great work with C++ and presumably at least some of them would have had more enthusiastic things to say about it if I had spoken with them .
But this is what I heard from the people I spoke with .

Leonid Poretsky , chief of endocrinology at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York and director of the Gerald J. Friedman Diabetes Institute there , said that the MannKind system will face many problems even if it is approved .
“ Injections today are essentially painless , ” he said of the short , thin needles that are commonly used to inject insulin .
And you do n’t necesssarily “ have to draw from a bottle into a syringe .
Injections work so well that the advantages of a new route like this are unclear . ”
Dr. Poretsky was also concerned about using the lungs to transport drugs .
“ It ’s possible for people to stay on insulin for decades , ” he said .
“ The whole issue of exposing the lungs to insulin for a long period of time has to be examined carefully . ”
Dr. Gerald Bernstein , a New York - based endocrinologist who is a former president of the American Diabetes Association , agreed that the long - term use of inhalable insulin might carry risks for some patients .
Dr Bernstein is vice president of the Generex Biotechnology Corporation , which is developing an insulin delivered through the lining of the mouth .
“ It ’s counterintuitive to use the fragile cells of the alveoli , ” the tiny air sacs within the lungs , “ to get insulin to the bloodstream , ” he said .
“ The lungs were developed to transport gases , not proteins . ”
Mr. Pfeffer of MannKind said that the company ’s clinical data included no signs of damage to lungs .
DR . DAVID M. NATHAN , a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and director of the Massachusetts General Hospital Diabetes Center , said that even if safety issues were addressed , there could be other long - term problems with Afresa .
He questioned whether MannKind ’s inhalable product could achieve the same level of blood sugar control as that obtained with injections or insulin pumps .

The target vehicle is seen being pursued by the bomb , which changes direction at the last minute
In the video , which has been classified until now , the Paveway IV bomb - marked by the small moving black dot - is seen being laser - guided from the moment of release .
The Harrier jump jet pilot had tracked the Taliban commander in his vehicle and released the Paveway .
But while the smart bomb was racing to its target , the commander can be clearly seen pulling up outside a compound alongside civilians who would have been blown up with him .
So the pilot redirected it into a remote area of desert where it exploded safely .
None of the civilians or the property were harmed .
But the RAF kept up the hunt - and two days later got their man .
The RAF says it has so far avoided any civilian casualties in Afghanistan since operations began in 2001 .
Being the one and only writer on staff who likes some CW shows , or at least the only one who will admit it , I drew the short straw and threw myself on the grenade that was the new slate of shows from the beleaguered network .
So now it ’s time to find out if they were as bad as you thought they ’d be , or if , by some act of God one of them ended up being watchable .
First we get The Vampires Diaries , which in my Fall Preview I posed as a question mark .
Would this be good like True Blood or Buffy The Vampire Slayer ?
Would it suck beyond belief like Twilight ?
Or would it land somewhere in between ?
Well that question has been answered loudly and definitively , but before I get ahead of myself , lets first lay the groundwork .
The story revolves around Elena , whose parents have recently died in a car accident which prompts her to turn to her diary as a way to cope with the loss .
Herein lies the high point of the show , Nina Dobrev , who may be one of the hottest girls currently on television .
Is her character compelling ?
Not really .
If anything she is the least developed of all the characters on the show , which you might find odd seeing as she is the main character .
She is pretty much just hot .
The writers may be trying to build her slowly or add a layer of mysteriousness to her character , though , honestly I ’d wager they have no idea where they are taking anything .
Secondly we get the vampires .
Paul Wesley , who looks like a vampire version of Zach Morris and Ian Summerhalder who we shall discuss in length very soon .
Wesley plays Stefan Salvatore , yeah , for real , that ’s his f’n name , is a vampire who can go out in the sun because he wears a ring , hmm I guess someone saw that episode of Angel .
Being a few hundred year old vampire , of course the one thing he wants to do more than anything in life is Geometry homework as he quickly appears as the mysterious new guy at high school , who , of course every girl in school wants to mount and screw in every scene .
This is quickly where the show falls to shambles .
Its absolutely ridiculous plot .
I can suspend belief but you have to make an effort .
I mean really , why would anyone on earth who had the powers a vampire has choose to go back to high school ?
If he wanted Elena the characters go to parties and out every night , could n’t he just meet up with her there ?
Or wait for her outside the school like the decades old pervert he is ?
But we ’ll put that aside because there is plenty more wrong with this show .
The token black friend seems to be a haphazardly written rip off / mash up of true bloods Sookie and Tara , by haphazard I mean BLATANT .
Which is another problem .
This show steals from everything that preceded it .
Nothing is fresh or original .
Everything seems like a retread or a poorly done rendition of far superior material .
The frights are cliche to say the least and the plot seems to be taken right from the Buffy / Angel playbook , well , a really , really , really , really crappy fan fiction version of Buffy .
The worst however is the acting of Ian Summerhalder who redefines the meaning of trash .
Moments when his character is supposed to be menacing and the most bad ass dude in town he instead chooses to act like a flaming homosexual .
That ’s not a slur , I mean he really acts as if he is playing Bruno .
The more serious the moment the more he acts like a vampire Clay Akin .
Kerr Smith ’s gay character on Dawson ’s Creek acted more manly .
Hell Michelle Williams character on Dawson ’s Creek acted more manly .
I ’m not going to say Ian may be hiding something but his character is surely ready to come out of the closet .
Actually I lied , that is n’t the worst part of the show , that would be the pacing .
To say this show moves at a snail ’s pace would be an insult to snails .
I have seen paint dry faster then things develop on this show .
Imagine the pilot of Flashfoward in reverse , instead of cramming too much into episodes this show crams little to nothing .
So skip it , unless you really need to see a hot girl write in a diary and look sad , your time would be better spent doing , well pretty much anything else .
Fail .
The 12 Moonwalkers : Where Are They Now ?
What happens after the mission of a lifetime ?
July 16 , 2009  --
It 's the most exclusive fraternity on Earth .
Only 12 men have ever walked on the surface of the moon , kicking up lunar dust while making human history .
And it was 40 years ago today that the first of those men blasted off into space on the missions of their lifetimes .
Apollo 11 launched from Cape Kennedy on July 16 , 1969 , carrying Neil Armstrong , Michael Collins and Edwin " Buzz " Aldrin .
Four days later , the world watched as Armstrong stepped onto the moon and made his " giant leap for mankind . "
Between 1969 and 1972 , five more NASA missions landed on the moon , giving a total of 12 people the chance to walk , run and , even , golf on the lunar surface .
" For the astronauts , going to the moon was professional first and a personal experience second , " said Andrew Chaikin , a science journalist who has spent more than 100 hours interviewing the lunar astronauts for his books " Voices From the Moon " and " Man on the Moon . "
" Imagine getting to do the most important thing that you could possibly do in your profession , doing it for national prestige and doing it with the whole world watching and knowing that it was something only a handful of people could accomplish , " he continued .
" That 's what it was . "
These men were as prepared as they could be for their out of world experiences .
" But when they came back from the moon , we gave them the mission they never trained for , " Chaikin said .
Fame , adulation , the constant stream of questions .
These were the challenges they wrestled with in the aftermath .
" But they came through .
And they came through in spectacular fashion , " he said .
Some struggled more than others -- and some changed more than others – but they were all , in some way , moved by having seen Earth shrink before their eyes .
Here are their stories .
Neil Armstrong
His were the first human feet to touch the extraterrestrial .
As the world watched on July 20 , 1969 , Neil Armstrong stepped onto the moon and gave American history one of its most memorable quotes .
But , though he 's the most famous moon walker , he 's also one of the most quiet , very selective about offers to speak and be interviewed .
He resigned from NASA in 1971 and accepted a teaching position at the University of Cincinnati's Department of Aerospace Engineering , which he held until 1979 .
For the next decade or so , he was chairman of an aviation software company , Computing Technologies for Aviation , Inc. in Charlottesville , Va .
Along the way , he 's collected honors from 17 countries , including the Presidential Medal of Freedom , the Explorers Club Medal and the Congressional Space Medal of Honor .
He had two sons with his first wife Janet , who divorced him in 1994 .
He later re-married .
In 2005 , he stepped back into the public spotlight to endorse a biography , titled " First Man " by James Hansen .
The book was as much an exploration of " American hero worship " as it was an exploration of the man himself .
" Friends and colleagues all of a sudden looked at us , treated us slightly differently than they had months or years before when we were working together .
I never quite understood that , " Armstrong said .
In an interview with CBS News ' 60 Minutes soon after the book 's release , he commented on his discomfort with his celebrity .
" I guess we all like to be recognized not for one piece of fireworks , but for the ledger of our daily work , " Armstrong said .
" I was n't chosen to be first .
I was just chosen to command that flight .
Circumstance put me in that particular role .
That was n't planned by anyone . "
Edwin " Buzz " Aldrin
As the second man to walk on the moon , Edwin " Buzz " Aldrin has cemented a spot in history , but the now 79 - year - old has spent much of his career looking to the future .
In the decades since the moon landing , Aldrin has lectured and written extensively about the country 's future in space .
He retired from NASA in 1971 but continued to work on space exploration , proposing a plan to reach Mars and receiving three patents for a modular space station .
He has also penned several books , including an autobiography , " Return to Earth . "
In an interview with Chaikin for " Voices From the Moon , " he shared the difficulty in articulating his experience .
" I 'm not really sure how a layperson reader is going to grasp whatever words are going to try and describe this .
I 've felt totally inadequate in ever trying to do it with spoken words , " he said .
In a rare show of violence , he punched filmmaker and skeptic Bart Sibrel in 2002 when Sibrel challenged him to prove that he actually went to the moon .
Charles " Pete " Conrad
Pete Conrad was n't the first to walk on the moon , but some remember him as the first to dance on it .
In " Rocketman , " a book about the astronaut 's " incredible ride to the moon and beyond , " his wife Nancy Conrad and Howard A. Klausner , describe the third man to walk on the moon as an adventurous , free - spirited space cowboy .
As the world listened to Conrad 's first moments on the moon , he hummed .
And then he shouted .
" Whoopie !
That may have been one small step for Neil , but it 's a long one for me ! " he roared .
Conrad was selected as an astronaut by NASA in 1962 and traveled to the moon in November 1969 as the commander of Apollo 12 , the second lunar landing .
Years later , in an interview with Chaikin , he said , " I remember thinking I got to go to the moon .
And I can also remember thinking , it 's going to change a lot of people , to do that .
…
I thought very hard about that I did n't want it to change me …
[ And now ] I do n't think it changed me . "
After 20 years of service , including 11 as an astronaut in the space program , Conrad retired from the U.S. Navy to begin a career in business .
He accepted an executive position with the American Television and Communications Corp. , a cable television company in Denver , and later became vice president for the Douglas Aircraft Company .
In July 1999 , at age 69 , Conrad died after a motorcycle crash near Ojaj , Calif .
He was survived by his wife , three sons and several grandchildren .
In his book , " Carrying the Fire , " fellow astronaut Michael Collins describes his courageous and notoriously puckish colleague as " One of the few who lives up to the image . "
Alan Bean
In 1969 , Alan Bean touched down on the Moon .
But through his paintings , the astronaut cum artist says he tries to extend the moment .
" Our time on the Moon ended much too quickly and , in the years since then , I have created paintings to try to capture the feeling of our Apollo 12 mission , as well as all the other the Apollo missions , too , " he says in an introduction on his Web site .
After 18 years with NASA , in 1981 , the Apollo 12 moonwalker decided to pursue painting full - time to share the sights no other artist had ever seen .
But he approached it the way he might a moon mission .
" So I took some time off and painted full - time to see if I 'd like it .
I simulated it , which is always good .
I learned that at NASA ; and the more I simulated being an artist , the more I realized it 's much more difficult than I 'd thought , " he said .
" But at the same time I liked it .
I cared about it !
I had many nice job offers for a lot of money , but I did n't care about them .
I care about these paintings .
I care about them every day . "
After landing on the moon 's Ocean of Storms with Pete Conrad in 1969 , Bean stayed with NASA , painting on the side .
But after retiring at age 49 , he devoted his time to painting in his Houston studio .
In 1984 , he publicly displayed his work for the first time in Houston .
His exhibit , " First Artist on Another Planet , " is currently at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum .
Each of his paintings includes small pieces of moon memorabilia – from parts of his name tag to Apollo mission patches and the U.S. flag .
( His Web site points out that " each of the fragments is embedded with small amounts of lunar dust . " )
" I remember thinking in lunar orbit , that if I got back from this , I was going to live my life differently , in that I was going to try to live it … like I want to live it , " he said in an interview with Chaikin .
" Mostly it made me have a lot of courage to do what I wanted to do and be happy about it … that 's one thing that really allowed me to be an artist .
I probably would n't have had the courage to be an artist . "
Alan Shepard
Ten years after becoming the first American to journey into space , Alan Shepard logged another extraterrestrial milestone – he became the fifth person to walk on the moon .
In February 1971 , at age 47 , Shepard reached the moon with the Apollo 14 mission .
He had n't flown anything since he rocketed 116 miles above Florida in 1961 .
At the end of the second moonwalk , the avid golfer carried out a different kind of scientific experiment : he pulled out a makeshift golf club and whacked two golf balls .
One landed in a nearby crater .
The other , he said , traveled " miles and miles and miles . "
" All of us wanted to think of something which would demonstrate – especially to young people – the lack of atmosphere and the difference of gravity , " he said in a 1991 interview with the American Academy of Achievement .
Shepard wanted to show that with only one - sixth the gravitational pull of Earth , the ball would travel six times as far .
But he did n't see the moon as just a giant golf course .
" The first time really seeing it in the black sky , the blue planet all by itself up there .
That was an emotional moment .
Some of the emotion was a result of having successfully arrived , a little sense of relief , but I think all of us , in our own ways , have expressed the same kind of feeling , " Shepard said in 1991 .
" Maybe if people had a chance to see this , they would n't be so parochial , they would n't be so interested in their own particular territories , " he said .
" To me and , I think , to all of us , it was a realization that our world is finite , it is small , it is fragile , and we need to start thinking about how to take care of it . "
After Apollo 14 , he reprised his role as chief of the Astronaut Office ( a position he held before the mission ) and remained in that administrative role until retiring to a corporate position in Houston in 1974 .
In 1984 , he joined other astronauts in founding the Mercury Seven Foundation to raise money for scholarships for science and engineering college students .
In 1995 , it was renamed the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation and he was president and chairman until 1997 .
After a long illness , said to be leukemia , he died in July 1998 .
In the 1979 book " The Right Stuff , " author Tom Wolfe said he had two sides , " the Icy Commander and Smilin ' Al , '' but also that he but he '' set a standard of coolness and competence that would be hard to top . ''
Edgar Mitchell
One of the more controversial moonwalkers , in the years after his 1971 journey to the moon , Edgar Mitchell has made headlines for arguing that alien visits to Earth have been covered up by governments for more than 60 years .
" I happen to be privileged enough to be in on the fact that we have been visited on this planet and the UFO phenomenon is real , " Mitchell said on Britain 's Kerrang Radio in July 2008 .
" It has been covered up by governments for quite some time now , " added Mitchell , who grew up in Roswell , N.M. , the location of the controversial 1947 incident ( or perhaps non-incident ) in which some believe the U.S. military covered up the crash scene of an alien spacecraft .
The Apollo 14 astronaut was the sixth man to walk on the moon but retired from NASA the following year .
In 1973 , he founded the Institute of Noetic Sciences to sponsor research into the nature of consciousness .
He published " Psychic Exploration " in 1974 .
He traces his interest in consciousness back to his moments on the moon .
" There was a vague feeling that something was different .
That my life had gotten very disturbing , very distressing at a subconscious level , " he said in an interview with Chaikin .
" What I do remember is the awesome experience [ on the trip back from the moon ] of recognizing the universe was not simply random happenstance …
That there was something more operating than just chance …
I 've assiduously spent the last fifteen years figuring out what was true . "
In April , the 78 - year - old spoke at the National Press Club in Washington after the X - Conference , a convention of UFO researchers and activists .
" We are being visited , " he said , according to the U.K. 's Guardian .
" It is now time to put away this embargo of truth about the alien presence .
I call upon our government to open up ... and become a part of this planetary community that is now trying to take our proper role as a spacefaring civilization . "
James Irwin
Reaching the moon was a spiritual experience for astronaut James Irwin .
" I felt the power of God as I 'd never felt it before , " he said about the July 1971 Apollo 15 mission .
He was the lunar module pilot for the flight and explored the moon 's surface for three days .
One year after the mission , Irwin resigned from NASA and the Air Force to form the religious organization High Flight Foundation in Colorado Springs , Colo .
According to High Flight 's
Web site , the astronaut started the organization to encourage others to experience " the Highest Flight possible with God . "
" Jesus walking on the earth is more important than man walking on the moon , " it quotes Irwin as saying .
The group organizes religious retreats and trips to the Holy Land .
Irwin even led expeditions to Turkey 's Mount Ararat in search of evidence of Noah 's Ark .
In 1991 , at age 61 , he died of a heart attack .
" The Earth reminded us of a Christmas tree ornament hanging in the blackness of space .
As we got farther and farther away , it [ the Earth ] diminished in size .
Finally it shrank to the size of a marble , the most beautiful you can imagine , " Irwin said .
" That beautiful , warm , living object looked so fragile , so delicate , that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart .
Seeing this has to change a man . "
David Scott
Not even 40 years old , David Scott reached the pinnacle of his career and then wondered , " what 's next ? "
" When I landed on the moon and came back from the moon , I was 39 years old .
My career had been finished .
I 'd finished my career .
That 's it .
Now go find a new career , " the Apollo 15 astronaut said in an interview with Chaikin .
But after his voyage to the moon in 1971 , Scott stayed with NASA for about six more years , as deputy director and then director of the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center at Edwards Air Force Base .
In 1977 , he left the space agency to found Scott Science and Technology , a specialized space project management and technical services company .
In 2004 , he published " Two Sides of the Moon : Our Story of the Cold War Space Race " with Russian astronaut Alexei Leonov , the first man to walk in space .
John Young
Of the 12 men to have walked on the moon , John Young was the last to retire from NASA .
After 42 years with NASA in various administrative and leadership positions , the Apollo 16 astronaut retired in 2004 .
In a 2004 interview with the Houston Chronicle , he described his experience on the moon .
" One - sixth gravity on the surface of the moon is just delightful .
It 's not like being in zero gravity , you know .
You can drop a pencil in zero gravity and look for it for three days .
In one - sixth gravity , you just look down and there it is , " he said .
He also advocated for a return to the moon and beyond .
" The moon has a lot of resources that we 'll learn how to use in this century and that will be great .
...
The technologies we need to live and work on the moon will save us right here on this planet , " he said .
" Bad things are inevitably going to happen to us , like comet or asteroid impacts or super volcanoes .
Flying in space is risky business , but just staying on this planet is risky business too . "
Charles Duke
At 36 years old , Charles Duke was the youngest man to walk on the moon .
In 1972 , he flew on Apollo 16 and spent more than 71 hours on the moon .
But he has said that it was his hero 's welcome was overwhelming .
" When I came back , I got so many questions about , " How did it feel ?
Did it change your life ?
How do you view Earth ?
You almost have to manufacture a response to that question , " he said .
Her retired from NASA and the space program in 1975 to enter private business .
He started a beverage company , Orbit Corp. , and has been active in real estate development and public speaking .
He is also president of Duke Ministry for Christ .
" My father was born shortly after the Wright brothers .
He could barely believe that I went to the moon , " he said in the documentary " In the Shadow of the Moon . "
" But my son Tom was 5 -- and he did n't think it was any big deal . "
Eugene Cernan
The commander of the last scheduled manned U.S. mission to the moon , Cernan spent more than 73 hours on the lunar surface in 1972 .
The experience left him believing in a greater power .
" I felt that the world was just too beautiful to have happened by accident .
There has to be something bigger than you and bigger than me , " Cernan said " In the Shadow of the Moon . "
" And I mean this in a spiritual sense , not a religious sense .

Harrison " Jack " Schmitt
After 10 years with NASA , Harrison Schmitt left science for politics .
The Apollo 17 astronaut was one of the last to walk on the moon .
Three years after his 1972 lunar mission , he left NASA to run for the U.S. Senate in his home state of New Mexico .
He spent one six - year term as a Republican , serving on the Commerce , Science and Transportation Committee , the Science , Technology and Space Subcommittee of Commerce and others .
He later worked as consultant , freelance writer and speaker on space , technology and public policy issues .
In a 2006 interview with Astrobiology Magazine , he said that his experience on the moon was almost indescribable .
" Being there is an essential ingredient .
It 's the same as trying to describe to someone what it 's like to stand on the rim of the Grand Canyon .
Or to have your first child .
Any meaningful event that you 've had in your life is probably that kind of experience .
It has a personal meaning , and it will be different for every individual , " he said .
" But sometimes people just want a description of what it was like , " he continued , " The black sky , the brilliantly illuminated slopes of the mountains , the bright sun , and then our Earth as a big blue marble hanging over one of the mountains .
The physical feeling of walking on the moon is like walking on a giant trampoline , to some degree . "
A source moving with speed $ v < c$ at an angle $ \theta < \pi /2 $ from the line of sight may appear to be moving faster than $ c$ in projection onto the sky because the light travel time is reduced by $v t \cos \theta / c$ in time $t$ .
Suppose the radio- emitting component is moving toward the observer with constant speed $v = \beta c$ at an angle $ \theta$ from the line of sight .
Consider two " events " in the moving component , the first occurring a distance $ r$ from the observer at time $t = 0 $ , and the second at time $ t$ .
Radiation from the first and second events will be received at times
$ $t _1 = r/ c , $ $ and
$ $t _2 = {r - vt\cos \theta \over c} + t~ , $$ respectively .
The apparent transverse velocity of the moving component is the actual transverse distance covered in time $ t$ divided by the apparent time interval $ ( t_2 - t_1 ) $ :
$ $v_\bot{\rm ( apparent ) } = {v t \sin \ theta \over t_2 - t_1} $ $ $ $v_\bot{\rm ( apparent ) } = { v t \sin \ theta \over t ( 1 - v \cos \ theta / c ) } $ $ $ $ \bbox [ border : 3 px blue solid,7 pt ] {\beta_\bot{\rm ( apparent ) } = {\beta \sin \ theta \over 1 - \beta \ cos\theta}} \rlap{\quad \rm { ( 5F1 ) }} $ $
For every speed $ \beta $ there is an angle $ \theta_{\rm m} $ that maximizes $ \beta_\bot{\rm ( apparent ) } $ .
That angle satisfies
$ $ {\partial \beta_\bot{\rm ( apparent ) } \over \partial \theta} = 0 = { ( 1 - \ beta\cos\theta_{\rm m} ) \beta \cos \theta_{\rm m} - ( \beta \ sin\theta_{\rm m} ) ^ 2 \over ( 1 - \ beta \cos \ theta_{\rm m} ) ^2 }~. $ $
and
Inserting $ \cos \ theta = \ beta$ and $ \sin \ theta = \ gamma^ { - 1} $ into Equation 5F1 for $ \beta_\bot{\rm ( apparent ) } $ yields the highest apparent transverse speed of a source whose actual speed is $ \beta $ :
$ $ \bbox [ border : 3 px blue solid , 7 pt ] {{\rm max} [ \beta_\bot{\rm ( apparent ) } ] = {\beta ( 1 - \ beta ^2 ) ^{ 1/2} \over 1 - \ beta^2} = \beta \ gamma}\rlap{\quad \rm { ( 5F4 ) }} $ $
$ $ \beta \cos \theta_{\rm m} - \ beta ^2 \cos ^ 2 \ theta_{\rm m} - \ beta ^2 \sin^2 \ beta = 0 $ $ $ $ \beta \cos \theta_{\rm m} - \ beta ^2 = 0 $ $ Thus $ $ \bbox [ border :3 px blue solid, 7 pt ] {\cos \ theta_{\rm m} = \ beta}\rlap{\quad \rm { ( 5F2 ) }} $ $ $ $ \bbox [ border : 3 px blue solid , 7 pt ] {\sin \theta_{\rm m} = ( 1 - \ cos ^2 \ theta_{\rm m} ) ^{ 1/2} = ( 1 - \ beta ^2 ) ^{1/2} = \gamma^{ -1}}\rlap{\quad \rm { ( 5F3 ) }} $ $
Example : A sequence of VLBI ( Very Long Baseline Interfereometry ) observations of the radio jet near the core of the quasar 3C 279 shows an apparently superluminal motion of 25 light years in 7 years : $ \beta_\bot{\rm ( apparent ) } \approx 3.6 $ .

What is the minimum component speed $ \beta$ consistent with these observations ?
What is the corresponding angle $ \theta_{\rm m} $ between that motion and the line of sight ?
$ $ \beta\gamma = {\beta \over ( 1 - \ beta ^ 2 ) ^{ 1/2}} \geq \ beta_\bot{\rm ( apparent ) } $ $ so $ $ \beta \geq \biggl [ { \beta ^2_\bot{\rm ( apparent ) } \over 1 + \ beta ^2_\bot{\rm ( apparent ) }}\biggr ] ^{ 1/2} $ $ $ $ \ beta \geq \biggl [ {( 25/7 ) ^2 \over 1 + ( 25/7 ) ^2}\biggr ] ^{ 1/2} \approx 0.96 $ $
The corresponding $ \theta_{\rm m} $ is given by $ $ \cos \theta_{\rm m} = \ beta \approx 0.96 $ $ $ $ \theta_{\rm m} \approx 0.28 {\rm ~rad} \approx 16^\circ ~. $ $
The relativistic Doppler formula ( Eq. 5E2 ) relates the frequency $
u '$ emitted in the component frame to the observed frequency $
u$ .
Note that we have replaced $ \theta $ by ( $ \pi - \ theta $ ) radians in the current analysis by calling it the angle between the line - of - sight and the velocity of an approaching component , so
$ $
u = {
u ' \over \ gamma ( 1 - \ beta \ cos\theta ) } ~ , $$ where $ \theta = 0 $ now corresponds to a radio component moving directly toward the observer .
The quantity
$ $ \delta \equiv [ \gamma ( 1 - \ beta \cos \ theta ) ] ^{ - 1} = {
u \over
u '}$ $ is called the Doppler factor .
If $ \theta = \pi / 2 $ , there is a transverse Doppler shift
$ $ \bbox [ border : 3 px blue solid , 7 pt ] { \delta = {
u \over
u'} = \gamma^{ - 1}} \rlap{\quad \rm { ( 5F5 ) }} $ $
The transverse Doppler shift has no nonrelativistic counterpart because the source has no component of velocity parallel to the line of sight ; it exists only because moving clocks run slower by a factor $ \gamma$ .
The Doppler factors associated with a given source speed $ \beta$ range from
$ $ \delta \geq ( 2 \gamma ) ^{ - 1} $ $ for directly receding ( $ \theta = \ pi$ rad ) sources to
$ $ \delta \leq 2 \gamma$ $ for directly approaching ( $ \theta = 0 $ ) sources .
Example :
What is the ratio $
u /
u'$ of the observed frequency to the emitted frequency in the example above ( $ \beta = 0.96 $ , $ \cos \ theta = \ beta$ ) ?
$ $ {
u \over
u'} = [ \gamma ( 1 - \ beta \ cos\theta ) ] ^{ - 1} =
[ \gamma ( 1 - \ beta ^ 2 ) ] ^{ - 1} = \gamma$ $ $ $ {
u \over
u'} = ( 1 - \ beta ^2 ) ^{-1/2} \approx 3.6 $ $
The observed flux density $ S$ of a relativistically moving component emitting isotropically in its rest frame depends critically on its Doppler factor $ \delta$ .
The exact amount of Doppler boosting is somewhat model - dependent ( Scheuer , P. A. G. , & Readhead , A. C. S. 1979 , Nature , 277 , 182 ) but probably lies in the range
$ $ \bbox [ border : 3 px blue solid, 7 pt ] {\delta^ {2 + \alpha} < { S \over S_0} < \ delta^ {3 + \alpha} ~ , }\rlap{\quad \rm { ( 5F6 ) }} $ $ where $ S_0 $ would be the observed flux density if the source were stationary and $ \alpha = -d \log S / d \log
u$ is the ( negative ) spectral index .
If $ \gamma \sim 5 $ , then $ 0.1 < \delta < 10 $ depending on the angle $ \theta$ .
Relativistic components approaching at angles $ \theta < \ gamma^ { - 1} $ can easily be boosted by factors $ > 10^3 $ compared with components moving in the sky plane or away from us .
Doppler boosting strongly favors those relativistic jets and components approaching us and discriminates against those with $ \theta > \ gamma^ { - 1} $ in flux - limited samples of compact radio sources .
Radio quasars are n't isotropic candles spread throughout the universe ; they are beamed flashlights .
The brightest are n't always the most luminous ; they are just pointing in our direction .
For every flashlight we see , there are many others in the same volume of space that we do n't see simply because they are not pointing at us .
Example :
What is the amount of Doppler boosting for the approaching jet of 3C 279 if $ \delta =
u /
u ' \approx 3.6 $ and $ \alpha \approx 0.7 $ ?
$ $ \delta^ { 2 + \alpha} < { S \over S_0} < \ delta^ {3 + \alpha} $ $ $ $ 3.6 ^ { 2.7} < { S \over S_0} < 3.6 ^ { 3.7} $ $ $ $ 32 < { S \over S_0} < 114 $ $ The receding counterjet is dimmed by a comparable factor , so the jet / counterjet flux - density flux - density ratio is probably $ > 10^3 $ .
This large ratio explains why so many bright jets have no detectable counterjets .
The fact that the two lobes of very extended radio sources like Cyg A typically have flux ratios $< 2 $ indicates that the lobes are moving outward with speeds $ v \ll c$ .
The radio jets feeding nearly equal lobes often appear quite unequal , with one jet being very strong and the other undetectable .
The jets of very luminous sources often terminate in bright
hotspots
in the lobes .
This VLA image of the radio - loud quasar 3C 175 shows the core , an apparently one - sided jet , and two radio lobes with hot spots of comparable flux densities .
The jet is intrinsically two - sided but relativistic , so Doppler boosting brightens the approaching jet and dims the receding jet .
Both lobes and their hot spots are comparably bright and thus are not moving relativistically .
Image credit
Since the jets feed the lobes , the lobe symmetry suggests that the jets are intrinsically similar , but the approaching jet is boosted while the receding counterjet is dimmed .
Another feature of many radio jets is a gap near the core .
If such jets start out relativistic and inclined by more than $ \theta \sim \ gamma^ { - 1} $ from the line - of - sight , both will be Doppler dimmed .
If they proceed with constant $ \theta $ but gradually decelerate as they move away from the core , one or both may become visible beyond the point where $ \gamma \sim \ theta^ { - 1} $ .
Radio ( red ) and optical ( blue ) images of the radio galaxy 3C 31 .
If the jets are close to the plane of the sky and decelerate from relativistic speeds as they recede from the core , only the inner portions of the jets are Doppler dimmed .

Here is a simulation of how 3C 31 would appear if observed over a range of angles $ \theta $ between the jet and the line of sight .
The best fit to the data occurs at $ \theta = 52 ^\circ $ .
Extragalactic radio sources with jets and lobes can be divided into two morphological classes : ( 1 ) those , like 3C 31 , that appear to fade away at large distances from the center and ( 2 ) sources with edge - brightened lobes ( e.g. , 3C 175 ) .
Such sources are called FR I and FR II sources , respectively , after Fanaroff and Riley ( 1974 , MNRAS , 167 , 31P ) , who first made such classifications and noted that FR I sources are usually less luminous than FR II sources , with the dividing line being $ L_
u \sim 10 ^ { 24} $ W Hz$ ^{ - 1} $ at 1.4 GHz .
FR
I sources generally have lower equipartition energy densities and hence lower equipartition pressures .
The jets of FR I sources are fairly symmetric at distances greater than several kpc from the cores , suggesting that the low - luminosity jets are quickly decelerated to nonrelativistic speeds .
The low - energy FR I jets are easily influenced by ambient matter .
Low - luminosity ralaxies moving through the intracluster medium of a cluster of galaxies frequently have bent or head - tail radio morphologies similar to the wake of a moving boat .
The isolated red dot in this false - color high - resolution image of the radio source 3C 83.1B is the core located in the nucleus of the galaxy NGC 1265 , which is moving through the intergalactic medium of the Perseus Cluster at a velocity of about 2000 km s$^{ - 1} $ .
Drag by the cluster gas bends the radio source , which would otherwise be straight .

Unified Models
The combination of orientation - dependent beaming and obscuration by dust has led to various unified models of active galactic nuclei ( AGN ) .
This cartoon shows the main features of a " unified model " for AGN as reviewed by Urry , C. M. , & Padovani , P. 1995 , PASP , 107 , 803 .
These models attribute some or all of the differences between observationally different objects to the inclinations of their jets relative to the line - of - sight .
If the inclination is small , the base of the approaching jet will be strongly Doppler boosted , and the compact optical broad - line region ( BLR ) and inner accretion disk will not be obscured by the larger dusty accretion torus lying in a plane normal to the jet .
The observed radio emission will be dominated by a one - sided jet that may be variable in intensity and apparently superluminal .
Thermal emission from the inner parts of the accretion disk may be visible as a big blue bump in the optical / UV spectrum , and Doppler - broadened emission lines from the small ( $< 1 $ pc ) broad - line region will not be obscured .
If the optical AGN emission is much brighter than the starlight of the host galaxy , the object will be called a quasi- stellar object ( QSO ) ; otherwise a Seyfert I galaxy .
In extreme cases , optical synchrotron emission may dominate the big blue bump and emission lines .
Objects with lineless power - law optical spectra are often called BL Lac objects after their prototype BL Lacertae , which was originally thought to be a Galactic star ( hence the constellation name ) .
If the inclination angle is larger than about $ 45 ^ \circ$ , the optical core may be obscured by the dusty torus and highly relativistic radio jets may be Doppler dimmed , and we will see a either a double - lobed radio galaxy or a Seyfert II galaxy ( a Seyfert galaxy with only the narrow emission lines directly visible ) .
The ongoing debate over unified models is not about whether relativistic beaming and dust obscuration affect the appearance of AGNs , but how much .
Radio Emission from Normal Galaxies
The radio emission from a normal galaxy is not powered by an AGN .
The continuum radio emission from normal galaxies is dominated by a combination of
( 1 ) free - free emission from HII regions ionized by massive ( $M > 15 M_\odot $ ) main - sequence stars and
( 2 ) synchrotron radiation from cosmic - ray electrons , most of which were accelerated in the supernova remnants ( SNRs ) of massive ( $M > 8 M_\odot $ ) stars .
Stars more massive than $ \sim 8 M_\odot $ have main - sequence lifetimes $ \tau < 3 \times 10^7 $ yr , much less than the age of our Galaxy , which is $> 10 ^ {10 } $ yr . Also , the synchrotron lifetimes of cosmic - ray electrons in the typical interstellar magnetic field is $ \tau < 10^8 $ yr .
Thus the current radio continuum emission from normal galaxies is an extinction - free tracer of recent star formation , uncontaminated by older stars .
The radio emission is roughly coextensive with the locations of star formation , spanning the stellar disks of most spiral galaxies .
Sometimes galaxy - galaxy collisions trigger intense starbursts ( star - formation episodes so intense that they will deplete the available ISM on time scales much shorter than $ 10 ^ { 10 } $ yr ) within several hundred parsecs of the centers of galaxies and produce compact central sources .
Contour plots of the 1.49 GHz continuum emission from a range of nearby galaxies ( Condon , J. J. 1992 , ARA&A , 30 , 575 ) .
The horizontal bars are $ \approx 3 $ kpc long , and the contours are spaced by factors of $ 2 ^ { 1/2} $ in brightness .
Massive stars form by gravitational collapse in dusty molecular clouds .
The dust absorbs most of their visible and ultraviolet radiation , is heated to temperatures of several tens of K , and re-emits the input energy at far - infrared ( FIR ) wavelengths $ \lambda \sim 100\ , \mu$m .
The molecular clouds are not opaque at FIR wavelengths , so FIR luminosity is a good quantitative measure of the current star - formation rate .
Remarkably , the radio luminosities of normal galaxies are very tightly correlated with their FIR luminosities .
The FIR / radio ( 1.4 GHz ) correlation for normal galaxies ( Condon , J. J. ,
Anderson , M. L. , & Helou , G. 1991 , ApJ , 376 , 95 ) .
The physical origin of this famous FIR / radio correlation is not well understood , particularly at low frequencies where most of the radio emission is synchrotron radiation .
It is not surprising that the FIR and free - free radio fluxes would be correlated , since both are roughly proportional to the ionizing luminosities of massive young stars .
However , free - free emission accounts for only a small fraction of the total radio luminosity at low frequencies $
u \ll 30 $ GHz .
The FIR / radio spectrum of the nearby starburst galaxy M82 is typical :
The FIR / radio spectrum of M82 ( Condon , J. J. 1992 , ARA&A , 30 , 575 ) is typical for normal galaxies .
At $
u \approx 1 $ GHz , about 90 % of the radio flux is produced by synchrotron radiation , yet the FIR / radio luminosity ratio is confined to a very narrow range .
If the star - formation rate ( SFR ) in a galaxy is fairly constant on timescales longer than $ 3 \times 10^7 $ yr , then the number of young SNRs would be proportional to the present number of massive stars , so it is plausible that the current production rate of cosmic - ray electrons is proportional to the current star - formation rate .
However , most of the synchrotron radiation from normal galaxies does not originate in the SNRs themselves , but rather from cosmic - ray electrons that have diffused into the interstellar medium ( ISM ) .
The power radiated by each electron is proportional to the magnetic energy density $ U_{\rm B} = B^2 / ( 8 \ pi ) $ in the ISM .
The equipartition fields in normal galaxies range from very low values to $ B \sim 5 \ , \mu$ G in a typical spiral galaxy like ours , to $ B \sim 100\ , \mu$ G in M82 and up to $ B \sim 1000 \ , \mu$ G in a particularly compact and luminous starburst galaxy such as Arp 220 .
Thus the power radiated by each cosmic - ray electron must vary by up to several orders of magnitude from one galaxy to another , yet all obey the same FIR / radio correlation .
The calorimeter model ( Volk , H. J. 1989 , A&A , 218 , 67 ) was devised to explain how the FIR / radio ratio could be independent of $ U_{\rm B}$ .
The total radio energy radiated by each electron might be independent of $ U_{\rm B} $ if the lifetime of the electron is proportional to $ U_{\rm B}^{ - 1} $ .
Thus , a cosmic - ray electron in a strong magnetic field radiates a high power for a short time , while one in a weak magnetic field radiates a low power for a proportionately longer time .
For a given production rate of cosmic - ray electrons , the average power radiated will then be independent of $ U_{\rm B}$ .
The calorimeter model works well to explain the FIR / radio correlation so long as the fraction of the electron energy going into synchrotron radiation is about the same in all normal galaxies .
However , there are many other energy - loss channels .
One is inverse-Compton scattering off the cosmic microwave background , starlight , FIR radiation , etc .
Another is diffusion out of the magnetic field of a galaxy — some electrons escape silently into intergalactic space .
Electrons may also lose energy by colliding with atoms in the ISM .
Despite its weak theoretical basis , the FIR / radio correlation makes radio continuum emission from normal galaxies a very useful , quantitative , and extinction - free indicator of the rate at which massive stars are being formed .
The rate ( measured in units of solar masses per year ) at which stars with masses $ M > 5 M_\odot $ are formed in a galaxy can be estimated from the thermal ( free - free ) and nonthermal ( synchrotron ) spectral luminosities by the following equations ( Condon , J. J. 1992 , ARA&A , 30 , 575 ) :
$ $ \bbox [ border : 3 px blue solid, 7 pt ] {\biggl ( {

Extragalactic Radio- Source Populations and Cosmological Evolution
Surveys of discrete radio sources have been made over large areas of the sky and at many frequencies ranging from 38 MHz to 20 GHz .
The most extensive sky survey is the NRAO VLA Sky Survey ( NVSS ) , which covered the whole sky north of declination ( latitude on the celestial sphere ) $ \delta = - 40 ^ \circ $ and detected nearly $ 2 \times 10^6 $ sources stronger than $ S = 2.5 $ mJy at 1.4 GHz .
Extremely sensitive sky surveys covering much smaller areas have reached flux densities $ S \sim 10 \ , \mu$Jy .
Sources detected by blind surveys covering representative areas of sky give us an unbiased statistical sample of the radio - source population .
The distribution of discrete sources on the sky is extremely isotropic .
Equal - area plot showing the sky distribution of discrete sources stronger than 100 mJy at 1.4 GHz .
The distribution of sources stronger than 2.5 mJy at 1.4 GHz within $ 15 ^ \circ$ of the north celestial pole .
This isotropy indicates that nearly all sources in a flux - limited sample are extragalactic — the center of our Galaxy is barely visible as the curved band at the left of the first plot .
A similar plot of the brightest galaxies selected at optical or near - infrared wavelengths is much clumpier than the radio plots because galaxies cluster on scales $ \sim 10 $ Mpc in size .
The reason for this difference is that the strongest extragalactic sources are much farther away than the optically brightest galaxies .
Radio galaxies are at least as clustered as optical galaxies , but the average distance between radio galaxies is much greater than 10 Mpc , so their clustering can be detected only by sensitive statistical tests .
Indeed , the distribution of radio sources on the sky is so uniform that the small ( $< 1 $ % ) dipole anisotropy in source density caused Doppler boosting from the Earth 's motion relative to the frame defined by distant galaxies has been detected .
The velocity of the Earth deduced from this anisotropy is consistent with the motion deduced from the corresponding anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background radiation produced by the hot big bang ( Blake , C. , & Wall , J. V. 2002 , Nature , 416 , 150 ) .
Only a small fraction ( $ \sim 1 $ % ) of radio sources in a flux - limited sample are nearer than about 100 Mpc .
By identifying those sources with nearby galaxies and determining the Hubble distances of those galaxies , we can determine the space density of radio sources as a function of radio spectral luminosity ; this is called the luminosity function .
The radio luminosity function can be further refined if we specify independently the space densities of radio sources powered AGN and those powered by star - forming galaxies containing HII regions , SNRs , etc .
The 1.4 GHz local luminosity functions of normal star - forming galaxies ( filled symbols ) and of AGN ( open symbols ) .
In a given volume of space , radio sources in star - forming galaxies outnumber radio galaxies containing AGN by an order of magnitude .
However , the rarer AGN produce all of the most luminous sources , so they account for slightly over half of all radio emission produced by discrete sources .
If we assume that the comoving space density of radio sources in the expanding universe is independent of time , we can use the local luminosity function to calculate the total number of radio sources per steradian of sky as a function of flux density .
The resulting source counts are usually tabulated in differential form : $ n ( S ) d S$ is the number of sources per sr with flux densities between $ S$ and $ S + d S$ .
In a static Euclidean universe , the flux density of any source at distance $r$ is proportional to $ r^{ - 2} $ , and the volume enclosed by a sphere is proportional to $ r^3 $ , so the number of sources stronger than any given flux density should be proportional to $ S^{ - 3/2} $ and the differential number $ n ( S ) $ should be $ n ( S ) \ propto S^{ - 5/2} $ .
By plotting the normalized source counts $ n ( S ) \times S^{ 5/2} $ as a function of $ S$ , we would get a horizontal line if we were in a static Euclidean universe .
The actual plot for sources selected at 1.4 GHz is shown below .
The 1.4 GHz Euclidean - normalized luminosity function $ \phi$ and source counts $ S^ { 5 / 2 } n ( S ) $ are consistent with strong ( $ \sim 10 \times $ ) luminosity evolution of all radio sources .
Clearly , the source counts do not reflect a static Euclidean universe , so most radio sources cannot be " local " extragalactic sources .
In an expanding universe with a constant comoving source density , distant sources will be much fainter , and the normalized source counts should decline monotonically at low flux densities .
This is not the case either ; the normalized counts have a clear maximum near $ S \sim 500 $ mJy .
This excess of sources indicates that radio sources must be evolving on cosmological time scales ; that is , their comoving space density varies with time .
The discovery of radio - source evolution was used as evidence against the steady - state model of the universe before the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation decisively confirmed the hot big - bang model .
Detailed models consistent with the local luminosity function , radio source counts , and redshift distributions of radio sources identified with galaxies and quasars have been constructed to measure the amount of evolution .
The results are actually quite simple : cosmological evolution is so strong that most radio sources in flux - limited samples have redshifts near the median $ \langle z \rangle \sim 0.8 $ , where
$ $ \bbox [ border : 3 px blue solid , 7 pt ] { ( 1 + z ) \equiv {\lambda_{\rm observed} \over \lambda_{\rm emitted}}}\rlap{\quad \rm { ( 5F9 ) }}$ $ is the factor by which lengths growing with the universe ( e.g. , distances between widely - spaced galaxies , wavelengths of photons ) have grown .
The universe looks like a nearly hollow shell to radio astronomers .
Most radio sources seen today have distances of 5 to $ 10 \times 10^9 $ light years , and their dominance reflects the higher AGN and star - formation activity of 5 to 10 Gyr ago .
For sources in a thin shell , there is almost no correlation between flux density and average distance ; rather , flux density is more closely correlated with absolute luminosity .
Consequently , luminous radio galaxies and quasars account for most radio sources stronger than $ S \sim 0.1 $ mJy at 1.4 GHz , and the numerous but less luminous star - forming galaxies dominate the microJy radio - source population .
The evolution of the star - formation rate density ( the number of solar masses per year of stars produced per cubic Megaparsec ) was an order of magnitude higher in the past ( $z > 1 $ ) than it is today ( $z = 0 $ ) .
The 1.4 GHz local luminosity function of star - forming galaxies and a simple model for their cosmological evolution yields the black point and solid curve , respectively .

Derzeit sammelt die Piratenpartei Spenden für die Ausstrahlung eines Spots im Privatfernsehen .

Baade hatte diesen Sportartikelhersteller unter anderem mit zwei Einzelhandelsketten verglichen und mit dem Phantasiewort " Schlurchmarke " bedacht .
Diesen
Text wertete die abmahnende Anwältin als eine " unzulässige Schmähkritik " .
Die für die Abmahnung verlangte Gebühr in Höhe von 1.085 Euro und vier Cent errechnete sie aus einem angeblichen Gegenstandswert von 25.000 Euro .
Angesichts fehlender finanzieller Ressourcen löschte der Blogger den
Text umgehend und gab ( wie in solchen Fällen üblich ) eine modifizierte Unterlassungserklärung ab .
Die allerdings reichte der Anwältin nicht , so dass Baade schließlich noch eine weitere unterschrieb .
Auch bei den Kosten wollte die Kanzlei keine Abstriche machen und verdoppelte stattdessen fast auf 1.940 Euro und 80 Cent .
Nachdem bereits eine erste Zahlung erfolgt war , behauptete die für den Konzern handelnde Juristin in einem Schreiben von Anfang August , dass Baade gegen die Pflichten aus der Unterlassungserklärung verstoßen und " nach wie vor genau diese Behauptungen im Internet [ veröffentlichen ] " würde .
Der als " Beweis " für diese Aussage mitgeschickte Screenshot zeigte allerdings lediglich die Site eines obskuren tschechischen Newsaggregators , der offenbar Teile des Textes ohne Kenntnis oder gar Zustimmung des Autors übernommen hatte .
Dass diese Behauptung einer erneuten " Veröffentlichung " schwer haltbar sein dürfte , war möglicherweise auch der Juristin selbst klar , die weiter unten im Schreiben davon sprach , dass der Blogger Sorgfaltspflichten hinsichtlich einer Überprüfung " des Internets " vernachlässigt habe .
Baade sollte deshalb 5.100 Euro " Vertragsstrafe " zahlen und eine dritte Unterlassungserklärung abgeben , nach der er bei " weiteren " Verletzungshandlungen mit 10.000 Euro zur Kasse gebeten werden könnte .
Da schwer vorstellbar ist , wie ein mit einer Forderung in Höhe von 1.000 Euro finanziell überforderter Duisburger etwas bewerkstelligen soll , woran Konzerne wie der Axel - Springer - Verlag unter großem Wehklagen scheitern , wäre bei einer Wertung des Auftauchens von Textteilen auf Seiten Dritter als Verletzungshandlung die nächste Rechnung absehbar .
" Man braucht angesichts der Abmahnungskultur in Deutschland nicht viel Phantasie , um sich vorzustellen , dass es Personen geben dürfte , die einen solchen Mechanismus als Gelddruckmaschine missbrauchen würden - sollte sich diese Rechtsauffassung durchsetzen " meinte dazu der Sportblogger Kai Pahl , der den Fall am Dienstag über einen kleinen Kreis hinaus bekannt machte .
Den Blogeintrag hatten den Angaben Baades zufolge etwa 400 Personen gelesen .
Nach dem Bekanntwerden der Abmahnung und der darüber hinausgehenden Forderungen dürften sehr viel mehr Personen einen schlechten Eindruck von dem Sportartikelhersteller bekommen haben .
Horizont.net , ein Fachportal für Marketing und Werbung , sprach angesichts des " Wutschäumens der Blogosphäre " von einem " PR - Eigentor im Web " :
Erreichte der kritisierte Ursprungsbeitrag nur eine sehr überschaubare Leserschaft , verschafft der Kampf David gegen Goliath dem Vorgang nun ungewollte Aufmerksamkeit und stellt die Marke in Teilen der Web - Welt ins Reputations - Abseits . [...]
Die finanzielle Belastung für den Blogger summiert sich inzwischen auf mehrere tausend Euro [...]
Die Belastung für das Image [ des Konzerns ] dürfte ungleich höher wiegen . [...]
Kritische Blogbeiträge zum Umgang des Unternehmens mit missliebigen Meinungen haben es bei Google bei der Eingabe des [ Unternehmensnamens ] inzwischen auf die erste Trefferseite geschafft .
Bei Google - News führt ein entsprechender Bericht das Ranking an .
Hinzu kommt das negative Echo der digitalen Mundpropaganda via Twitter und Co .
Im Forum eines Fußball - Bundesligavereins , mit dem der Sportartikelhersteller als " Ausrüster " wirbt , war die Empörung eher noch größer als in der Blogosphäre .
Dort kündigten
Fans unter anderem an , wegen dessen Vorgehens keine Vereinstrikots mehr tragen zu wollen .
Auch Google - Suchen nach der Juristin und ihrer Kanzlei brachte bereits am Mittwoch , wie es ein Twitter - User formulierte , " wenig reputationsförderliche Ergebnisse " .
Beim Sportartikelhersteller , bei dem es erst hieß , dass der zuständige Mitarbeiter im Urlaub und kein Stellvertreter verfügbar sei , fand sich nach dem " PR - Gau " schließlich doch jemand , der sich mit der Sache befassen musste .
Heise Online versprach man eine baldige Stellungnahme auf der Website des Unternehmens und dem Ruhrbarone - Blog wurde gesagt , dass man auf Baade zugehen und in einer gemeinsamen Erklärung mit ihm die Angelegenheit " richtig stellen " wolle .
Durch Kosten versperrter Rechtsweg
Um gegen die auch von mehreren befragten Juristen als " gefährlich " gewerteten Rechtsauffassungen der Anwältin vorzugehen , müsste Baade einen Prozess führen , zu dem ihm eigenen Angaben zufolge aber das Geld fehlt .
Unter anderem deshalb , weil der Prozess aufgrund der Höhe des behaupteten Streitwertes vor einem Landgericht verhandelt würde , wo er sich nicht selbst vertreten darf , sondern einen eigenen Anwalt anheuern müsste .
Hinzu kommt , dass die abmahnende Kanzlei aufgrund der Möglichkeiten des so genannten " Fliegenden Gerichtsstandes " möglicherweise vor dem einschlägig bekannten Landgericht Hamburg klagen würde , was für ihn hohe Reisekosten bedeuten und einen weitere Kosten verursachenden Gang zur nächsten Instanz wahrscheinlich machen würde .
Diese im Abmahnrecht , im " Fliegenden Gerichtsstand " und im Prozessrecht verankerten Kostenkeulen machen es möglich , dass manche Anwälte ( ohne selbst Risiken einzugehen ) gegenüber Privatpersonen " exotische " Rechtsauffassungen vertreten können , die sich vor Gericht als nicht haltbar erweisen würden .
Dies ist möglicherweise auch ein Grund dafür , warum die Blogosphäre sich hierzulande wesentlich langsamer entwickelte als in den USA und warum gleich eine ganze Reihe der lesenswertesten Blogs von Juristen geschrieben oder im Ausland gehostet werden .
Zumindest vor dem BGH oder dem Bundesverfassungsgericht scheint Baade jedoch durchaus nicht chancenlos .
Anders als das Landgericht Hamburg setzten diese beiden Instanzen die Schmähkritik - Schwelle für Unternehmen in ihren Entscheidungen nämlich deutlich höher an als für natürliche Personen .
Allerdings stellt sich hinsichtlich der von der Anwältin kritisierten Vergleiche bereits die Frage , ob eine Schmähkritik vorläge , wenn es sich bei dem Sportartikelhersteller um eine natürliche Person handeln würde .
Das maßgebliche Urteil dazu stammt aus einem Verfahren , das Ralph Giordano nach einem Text über Franz Josef Strauß führen musste .
In dieser so genannten " Zwangsdemokrat - Entscheidung " stellten die Karlsruher Richter fest , dass für die Einstufung einer Äußerung als Schmähkritik aufgrund der besonderen Bedeutung des Grundrechts der Meinungsfreiheit für die Demokratie hohe Anforderungen gelten , weshalb eine Meinungsäußerung " nicht schon wegen ihrer herabsetzenden Wirkung für Dritte zur Schmähung " wird .

Aufgrund dieser hohen Anforderungen konnte beispielsweise ein SPD - Politiker Staatsanwälte als " durchgeknallt " bezeichnen , ohne dass er dafür belangt worden wäre .
2 " Die Bezeichnung als ' durchgeknallt ' , so eine Pressemitteilung des Bundesverfassungsgerichts vom 26 .
Juni dieses Jahres , " weist auch nicht einen derart schwerwiegenden diffamierenden Gehalt auf , dass der Ausdruck in jedem denkbaren Sachzusammenhang als bloße Herabsetzung des Betroffenen erschiene und daher unabhängig von seinem konkreten Kontext stets als persönlich diffamierende Schmähung aufgefasst werden müsste , wie dies bei der Verwendung besonders schwerwiegender Schimpfwörter - etwa aus der Fäkalsprache - der Fall sein kann . "
Neben dieser Rechtsprechung müsste ein Gericht außerhalb der Hansestadt Hamburg auch berücksichtigen , dass die Sportmarke von dem Blogger nicht mit Hitler verglichen wurde , sondern mit zwei Unternehmen , die durchaus ihre Vorzüge haben .
Auch wenn eines davon im letzten Jahr durch mehrere Datenschutzskandale Negativschlagzeilen machte , so sind doch die Kassiererinnen beim anderen so schnell , dass Kunden sogar weitere Wege dafür in Kauf nehmen .
Und die Annahme , dass man sich für einen Einkauf dort schämen müsste , scheint zumindest unter Juristen nicht gerechtfertigt zu sein , wo man gerne einmal mit dem einen oder anderen dort gemachten " Schnäppchen " prahlt .
Eine Anfrage bei den beiden Lebensmittel - Einzelhandelsketten , ob sie gegen den Vergleich mit der abmahnenden Sportmarke vorgehen wollen , blieb bisher ohne Ergebnis .
Bei einer davon wusste man noch nichts von dem Vorfall und will ihn zur Prüfung an eigene Anwälte weitergeben , bei der anderen blieben versprochene Rückrufe aus .
Würde sich die Anwältin des Sportartikelherstellers mit ihrer Auffassung davon durchsetzen , was eine " unzulässige Schmähkritik " ist , dann wären der Abmahnbarkeit praktisch aller Vergleiche außerhalb des völlig Identischen Tür und Tor geöffnet , was nicht nur einen massiven Eingriff in Grundrechte , sondern auch in die Alltagssprache bedeuten würde .
Die Juristin selbst konnte leider nicht zu ihrer Rechtsauffassung befragt werden , da sie nach Angaben ihrer Kanzlei bis zum 14 .
September im Urlaub ist .
So ist bis jetzt offen , wie sie den Gegenstandswert in dem Verfahren berechnete , welche Kommentare , Aufsätze oder Urteile sie zu der Frage konsultierte , ob eine unzulässige Schmähkritik vorliegt , aufgrund welcher Rechtsgrundlage sie das Auftauchen des Beitrages bei einem Aggregator als Verletzung der Unterlassungserklärung wertet , wann und wie sie dieses Auftauchen dort entdeckte und wie der Blogger ihrer Ansicht nach das Auftauchen dort verhindern hätte können .

In the Future , let ’s all get caught napping
Recently there have been a number of articles in the MSM about sleep .
They all basically take the general point of view that Americans are ‘ sleep deprived ’ , that we all need 8 hours of sleep but are n’t getting it and that this sleep deprivation takes its ’ toll across all aspects of society .
Many of these [… ]
