Numerous people have asked for an update to Corporate Bond Spreads Key To Continued S&P Rally .
Specifically , inquiring minds are interested in my statement " It will pay to keep one eye on the credit markets to help ascertain long - term equity direction .
In August of 2007 the corporate bond market cracked wide open .
Although the S&P 500 made a new high in November , the corporate bond market did n't .
It was the mother of all warning calls that most missed . "
Here are some charts that show what I mean .
S&P 500 vs. BAA Corporate Bonds vs. 10 - Year Treasuries

The above charts shows that BAA corporate bond yields ( one step above junk ) were rising throughout 2008 and started soaring right before the stock market waterfall plunge .
The 2009 rally started in March with the BAA yield dropping and the 10 - year treasury yield rising .
A falling BAA - 10YR spread is a measure of increased willingness for market participants to take on risk as the following chart shows .

Rising BAA to 10 - year treasury yield spreads starting August 2007 was a big warning sign .

Junk Bond Default Rate Worst Since Great Depression
Last week the junk bond default rate hit 10.2 percent .
The U.S. junk bond default rate rose to 10.2 percent in August from 9.4 percent in July as the worst recession since the 1930s left more companies unable to pay off debt , Standard & Poor 's data showed on Thursday .
The default rate is expected to rise to 13.9 percent by July 2010 and could reach as high as 18 percent if economic conditions are worse than expected , S&P said in a statement .
Default rates have surged from less than 1 percent in 2007 as an economic downturn squeezed corporate revenues and a global credit crunch dried up funding .
A 13.9 percent default rate would be the highest since the Great Depression of the 1930s , when it hit 15.9 percent .
Eighteen companies defaulted in August , bringing the year - to - date total to 147 .
" Credit metrics in the U.S. show continued deterioration of credit quality and restricted lending conditions , " S&P said .

The key to successful marketing is finding the right marketing strategy — including your message , timing , and method of communication — to reach and influence your consumers .
Defining Marketing
Marketing is the process of teaching consumers why they should choose your product or service over those of your competitors , and is a form of persuasive communication .
It is made up of every process involved in moving a product or service from your business to the consumer .
Marketing includes creating the product or service concept , identifying who is likely to purchase it , promoting it , and moving it through the appropriate selling channels .
There are three primary purposes of marketing :
Capturing the attention of your target market Persuading a consumer to purchase your product Providing the customer with a specific , low - risk action that is easy to take
If the objective of your business is to sell more products or services , then marketing is what helps you achieve that goal .
Anything that you use to communicate with your customers in a way that persuades them to buy your products or services is marketing , including advertising , social media , coupons , sales , and even how products are displayed .
Four Stages of Marketing
Companies must go through multiple stages of marketing to ensure their products or services are ready for selling .
Ideation : Marketing starts when you develop an idea for a product or service .
Before launching a product or services , you must decide what you are selling , how many options are available , and how it will be packaged and presented to consumers .

Research and testing :
Before you can take your idea public , you should perform marketing research and testing .
Marketing departments usually test new product concepts with focus groups and surveys to gauge consumer interest , refine product ideas , and determine what price to set .
Researching your competitors can help you set an optimal price and generate ideas for positioning your brand in an existing market .

Advertising :
The information you gather in your research will help you define your marketing strategy and create an advertising campaign .
Campaigns can include different forms of media , events , direct advertising , paid partnerships , public relations , and more .
Before beginning an advertising campaign , set concrete benchmarks that you can use to measure how effective that advertising campaign is .

Selling : Determine where and how you plan to sell to customers .
Consumer product companies , for example , sell to wholesalers who then sell to retailers .
In the industrial market , the buying process is longer and involves more decision - makers .
You may sell locally , nationally , or even internationally , and some companies only sell their products or services online .
Your distribution and sales channels impact who buys your products , when they buy them , and how they buy them .
The Balance
The Four Ps Model of Marketing
The four stages of marketing can also be mapped onto another popular marketing model known as the Four Ps of marketing .
The four Ps in this model are product , price , promotion , and place .
Product :
The procedures you have in place to ensure that your products are ready for selling .
Your product ( or service ) should fill a gap in the market , meet the needs of customers , and stand out from the competition .

Price :
The cost of purchase , including both the sticker price as well as less quantifiable trade - offs that a customer must be willing to make when they purchase your products .

Promotion :
The information you give consumers through targeted advertising to generate interest in your products .
Promotions usually have one of two purposes : generate leads or initiate actual purchases .

Promotions usually have one of two purposes : generate leads or initiate actual purchases .
Place : Refers to how and where products are sold .
All distribution decisions are part of your overall marketing process .
Types of Advertising
There are many kinds of advertising that you can use to promote your business , teach customers about your products , and generate sales .
Print , radio , and television campaigns are types of advertising , as are direct mail , email , and internet marketing .
If you have a website , it should be optimized for search to help customers find it through search engines like Google , Yahoo ! , and Bing .
Newsletters , press releases , and articles are also forms of marketing used to capture leads and generate sales .
Some companies also use referral marketing , where satisfied customers refer others ( often for a reward ) to increase business .
The rise of social media platforms has increased the importance of social media marketing , including connecting with customers on social media by persuading them to follow your business , partnering with social media influencers through product placement or paid sponsorships , and paying for advertising on platforms like Facebook or Instagram .
The types of advertising that you choose will depend on your budget , type of business , and the preferences of your ideal customers .
The Marketing Lifecycle
Advertising , or promotion , is only one component of your marketing plan .
The marketing process begins with the idea for your product and continues until that product is in the hands of a consumer who bought it .
Even after a customer has made a purchase , your marketing should n't end — a portion of your advertising should be targeted at current customers to ensure they remain customers and increase loyalty .
Angry victims of convicted Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff are up in arms over as much as $ 250 million in legal fees they claim will be paid to Irving Picard , the court - appointed trustee overseeing the break - up of the fraudster ’s fake investment firm .
The victims , who claim they are being treated unfairly by Picard and the Securities Investor Protection Corp. ( SIPC ) , the body set up to provide insurance for victims of securities fraud , are set to air their grievances in New York Bankruptcy Court on Thursday .
Chief among their complaints are the massive legal fees Picard and his firm , Baker & Hostetler , are charging .
So far , the firm has claimed more than $ 15 million , or around $ 1 million a week , in fees for 3 ½ months of work .
Picard believes it could take as long as five years to settle all Madoff claims , which means his firm could reap at least $ 250 million from the bankruptcy .
If approved by the bankruptcy court , those fees will be paid out of SIPC ’s coffers .
The victims claim in court papers filed last night that the money being claimed by Picard is rightfully theirs .
Neither Picard , nor Stephen Harbeck , CEO of SIPC , returned calls .
“ It is unconscionable that SIPC should be squandering potentially hundreds of millions of dollars when it does n’t even have enough money to compensate all the victims who have filed a claim , ” said Helen Davis Chaitman , a lawyer representing more than 100 Madoff victims in the case .
ATLANTA , September 15 , 2009 — The abuse of campus sexual harassment policies to punish dissenting professors has hit a new low at East Georgia College ( EGC ) in Swainsboro .
Professor Thomas
Thibeault made the mistake of pointing out — at a sexual harassment training seminar — that the school ’s sexual harassment policy contained no protection for the falsely accused .
Two days later , in a Kafkaesque irony , Thibeault was fired by the college president for sexual harassment without notice , without knowing his accuser or the charges against him , and without a hearing .
Thibeault turned to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education ( FIRE ) for help .
“ If you were to write a novel about the abuse of sexual harassment regulations to get rid of a dissenter , you could n’t do better than the real - life story of Thomas Thibeault , ” FIRE President Greg Lukianoff said .
“ Anyone with a modicum of respect for freedom of speech or simple fairness should be aghast at this blatant abuse of power by East Georgia College . ”
Thibeault ’s ordeal started shortly after August 5 , 2009 when , during a faculty training session regarding the college ’s sexual harassment policy , he presented a scenario regarding a different professor and asked , “ what provision is there in the Sexual Harassment policy to protect the accused against complaints which are malicious or , in this case , ridiculous ? ”
Vice President for Legal Affairs Mary Smith , who was conducting the session , replied that there was no such provision to protect the accused , so Thibeault responded that “ the policy itself is flawed . ”
Two days later , Thibeault was summoned to EGC President John Bryant Black ’s office .
According to Thibeault ’s written account of the meeting , which was sent to Black and which Black has not disputed , Thibeault met with Black and Smith .
Black told Thibeault that he “ was a divisive force in the college at a time when the college needed unity ” and that Thibeault must resign by 11:30 a.m. or be fired and have his “ long history of sexual harassment … made public . ”
This unsubstantiated allegation took Thibeault by surprise .
Black added that Thibeault would be escorted off campus by Police Chief Drew Durden and that Black had notified the local police that he was prepared to have Thibeault arrested for trespassing if he returned to campus .
At no point was Thibeault presented with the charges against him or given any chance to present a defense .
Refusing to resign , Thibeault understood that he was fired .
Most likely realizing that he had fired Thibeault without any of the due process mandated by Georgia ’s Board of Regents , Black then began attempting to justify Thibeault ’s firing after the fact .
On August 11 , Black wrote Thibeault to say that since Thibeault had failed to resign by the deadline , “ EGC has begun dismissal proceedings . … [ A ] faculty committee has been appointed to conduct an informal inquiry . ”
He then paradoxically wrote , “ Their charge is to advise me whether or not dismissal proceedings shall be undertaken . ”
Meanwhile , Thibeault still had not been provided with any charges , he was still banned from campus , and he still appeared to be fired - with the “ dismissal proceedings ” occurring after the fact .
Then , on August 25 , Black wrote Thibeault again , claiming for the first time that Thibeault had actually been suspended , not fired : “ the committee ’s finding was that there is sufficient evidence to support your suspension . ”
Black added that Thibeault was about to be terminated for sexual harassment , that the charges finally would be sent upon request , and that Thibeault finally could request a hearing .
Thibeault requested the charges on August 28 but has received no response .
His lawyer also has inquired for weeks with no response .
“ How can a public college professor in the United States be fired and kicked off campus by the president and police but , more than a month later , still have no idea why ? ” asked Adam Kissel , Director of FIRE ’s Individual Rights Defense Program .
“ Do Georgia ’s taxpayers know this is how their colleges are treating their professors ? ”
FIRE outlined many of these shocking violations of due process and freedom of speech in a letter to University System of Georgia Chancellor Erroll B. Davis Jr. on August 27 , with copies to Black and Smith .
None of them has responded .
Neither Black nor Smith has even bothered to comment on the discrepancies between Thibeault ’s account and Black ’s erratic letters .
“ It is hard to imagine a worse failure of due process in this case , ” Kissel said .
“ Nobody knows what the actual allegations are because they are being kept secret , even from Thibeault himself .
In the stunning absence of any charges , evidence , or hearings , it is clear that EGC has punished Professor Thibeault for speaking out against a flawed harassment policy . ”
FIRE is a nonprofit educational foundation that unites civil rights and civil liberties leaders , scholars , journalists , and public intellectuals from across the political and ideological spectrum on behalf of individual rights , due process , freedom of expression , academic freedom , and rights of conscience at our nation ’s colleges and universities .
FIRE ’s efforts to preserve liberty on campuses across America are described at thefire.org .

In 1971 , when Nixon took America completely off the Gold Standard , he opened the gate for massive federal spending and tantalized and encouraged our shameless leaders to grant the above mentioned non-existent Constitutional rights and many more .
This week I received an email from Congressman Dennis Kucinich of Ohio entitled “ A New Movement : Health Care as a Civil Right ” .
Sure enough , another member of Congress was at it again .
Seems the congressman along with Representative John Conyers of Michigan and 85 co-sponsors in the House have proposed legislation that would make health care for all a civil right .
Get this ; it would be of the single payer variety like they have in Europe .
You know the systems where the citizens boast that their healthcare is free even though they pay exorbitant amounts of taxes to the government and in many situations must wait for care or are denied care altogether .
Kucinich boasts that his plan would eliminate premiums , co-pays , and deductibles .
So I suppose our care would be free as well .
And he also claims that , “ All health care assets in America would become not - for - profit . ”
As anyone with any common sense knows there is no such thing as something for nothing .
This is precisely why we are in the mess we are in today .
Kucinich is promising something huge that he can't deliver .
At the very least , someone will have to pay the basic costs of healthcare .
Certainly , doctors , nurses , scientists that develop drugs , and the janitors that clean the hospitals and labs are not going to work for free .
As a matter of fact , smart people in America will either not enter the medical profession or if they already have will go someplace else to make a decent living given the time and expense it has cost them to become doctors .
But , I am sure that when this happens the good congressman would then propose legislation whereby the federal government pays for all medical educations .
You can see where this is bound to go .
Obviously , if healthcare were to become “ free ” under any plan that resembled Kucinich 's the taxpayer would foot the bill for the huge expenses that would result .
I know this is a logical fallacy of sorts .
You see the biggest problem with the current system is that individuals do not actually pay for enough of their own healthcare .
On average about only 15 cents of every dollar spent on healthcare comes from individual 's pockets .
The other 85 percent of costs is covered by insurance companies , government and other private sources .
If I am only paying for 15 percent of any commodity then I care little what that commodity costs .
The incentive to comparison shop like you would to buy a car or groceries is non-existent in healthcare .
Someone else is paying for most of the cost .
Do n't look a gift horse in the mouth applies .
Obviously , our healthcare system has more wrong with it than that .
But the point here is that Kucinich 's plan would lower personal costs of healthcare from the current 15 percent to zero .
Logically , then , we would see even larger increases in healthcare costs due to the total disconnect between service and payment responsibility .
Put another way , if something is free , then consumers will use more of it and costs will rise astronomically .
You can't fool this golden rule of economics .
Of course , Kucinich and his ilk know very little about economics .
It seems he knows even less about the Constitution .
He quotes the Constitution as his rationale for healthcare as a civil right .
According to him , “ The Preamble to the United States Constitution and Article One , Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution both describe an originating purpose of our United States : to promote the general welfare . ”
The “ general welfare ” clause is an old argument that has been used by the rights granters for a long time .
Of course they take the clause out of context .
They quote it as if it stands alone .
In fact , immediately following the clause in Article 1 Section 8 sixteen enumerated powers of Congress are listed .
What is the purpose of this enumeration of powers if Congress 's powers are unlimited under the “ general welfare ” clause ?
Additionally , general welfare means all of us are affected equally .
No government expenditure affects all of us equally except for those spent on the enumerated powers listed in Article 1 Section 8 .
Thus , there is no Constitutional authority for Congress to legislate , regulate , or grant any rights that are not enumerated in Article 1 section 8 of the Constitution .
This includes so - called “ free ” universal healthcare .
No one knows for sure how the current healthcare reform debate will turn out .
It should be squashed altogether on constitutional grounds .
The proponents of federal socialized medicine do have recourse .
Under Article V of the Constitution they can pursue amending the document to allow them to take up the matter .
Naturally , they wo n't do this because it would be a lot of work .
Instead , they just misquote the Constitution and propose healthcare legislation that will allow them to grant a new right and spend us further into bankruptcy .

New post , new theme !
With this wider theme , the screenshots will no longer fall off the edge .
Although I did not plan to “ build one to throw away ” , this largely became reality nonetheless .
By now I ’ve done so many refactorings on the Scion client code that hardly a single line of the original remains .
But I ’m finally happy with the result .
The Scion client previously used its own command queue , which ensured that commands were sent to the server one after another .
After some investigation , I replaced that by Eclipse ’s job scheduling mechanism .
With proper scheduling rules , we can keep the scheduler from running two commands simultaneously , so it is as powerful as the home - brew command queue .
If one command depends on the result of another , we can make the second job fall asleep and have the first wake the second up when it ’s done .
And it has several advantages over the old system :
We can now set priorities on commands , so that interactive commands ( such as computing the text of a tool tip ) take precedence over longer - running commands ( such as builds ) .
Commands will automatically be shown in the progress report windows .
The sender of a command can either run it asynchronously , or wait for the command to complete before continuing .
Of course , it ’s simply less code to maintain and have bugs in !
Secondly , I introduced a Scion “ manager ” class that ensures that there is always one Scion server running per project .
If the server crashes , it is restarted automatically and brought back to the same state as its previous incarnation .
Thirdly , all significant errors are now logged to the Error Log window in Eclipse .
There should no longer be a need to turn on error tracing to troubleshoot problems in the Scion client / server system .
Finally , if the server fails to start in the first place , this is probably because its executable program could not be found .
Most likely this is because the plugin is used for the first time .
Therefore , we pop up a helpful dialog :
Little things like this go a long way , making it easier to get up to speed with EclipseFP .
In the same vein , I will start working on a “ new project from existing source ” feature that is well known from Java development in Eclipse .
( EclipseFP is already able to import Cabal packages from a . tar.gz , but strangely not from a directory on disk ! )

Thanks again for all your help , Reddit .
Your tips on protein , fat grams , and your general encouragement , have been priceless !
I 've been trying to keep a completely open mind about everything , and it seems to be paying off .
I started off by clicking on the first random thing I saw ; that openness of mind has made it possible for me to receive constructive criticism from sources like Reddit .
LEGEND :
DAILY MEAL ITEMS IN BLACK
THOUGHTS AND PHILOSOPHIES IN BLUE
EXERCISES IN RED ( YOU'LL NOTICE THIS IS VERY SPARSE ...)
I have an extensive plan that I 'm following , but I really wanted to get started , so I 'll be adding pieces of the plan to this blog as time passes - I have n't organized it properly in my head yet .
It 's represented by 5 S ' : SSSSS - but I 'll get to that later .
Inspired by Oprah Winfrey 's struggles , I am determined to do everything possible to make this diet work .
Oprah has lamented many times about how difficult it is to lose weight and keep it off , yet she has managed to lose several times .
I see this as multiple successes , not failures .
I 've followed a similar pattern : in 2000 I lost 25 lbs. ( on WW ) , just to gain it back slowly .
Then in 2004 I lost around 15 to 20 fairly fast - and gained it back fast .
2008 was the turning point for me : I lost 40 pounds slowly and carefully over several months .
That 's the key , I 'm finding : when you lose weight slowly , you keep it off longer .
I was doing well until we moved our entire lives across the country .
I used that jolting experience as an excuse to throw in the towel .
Starting in September of 2008 ( to now - September , 2009 ) , I slowly regained 35 lb.s .
It has not been fun ( well , maybe a little fun ... ) ;
I have acquired multiple pairs of those expandable dress pants from Wal - mart , and just love them .
I 'm still 5 lbs . under what I was at the end of 2007 ( 220 lbs . ) .
I 'm 5 ' 11 " and I 'm trying to stick to between 1800 and 2000 calories a day for now .
I list my weight , exercise ( when I do it ) and calories .
I do n't list fat because - as you 'll see - I have committed to eating a very healthy diet overall .
Some of the stuff does have considerable fat , but I 'm confident that over a week 's period , I 'll be getting an average of around 40 g of fat per day or less .
I 'm actually probably selling myself a little short because I 'm not taking fiber into account .

This jump up in weight makes sense - after the lunch and dessert splurges over the weekend .
Now I 'm off on my journey to make 200 lbs .
I tell you , it 'll be nice if and when I can stand in profile , in those jorts , and not have my belly stick out like that .
Sigh !
I 've been thinking now , once I do reach my goal of 185 lbs. , I 've decided I 'm going to continue on the same regimen ( I hope it 's not much less than 1800 / day ) and do one meal splurge a month and two dessert splurges a month .
Also , the way I 've decided a splurge works is the following : splurge meals and / or desserts are separate from your daily calories .
In other words , keep track of your cals as usual and just drop in a splurge .
Does that make sense ?
That means , if you 've had 1500 cals , for example , and then you have your meal splurge , you can still have 300 cals worth of dessert ( well that 's for me - you might have a different daily calorie count .
From that standpoint , most people would probably have their splurge as early as possible in the day , in order to maximize it . )
Now here 's the thing , if you find you 're starting to put on weight again , just drop the daily calories a little , and keep doing that till you level out .

Mexican Restaurant - Splurge meal - Far more than a day 's calories , no doubt .
What I 've learned ?
Next time I get to enjoy a splurge I 'm going to make sure I carefully plan ahead and determine what it is I really , truly like and want , and get that .
Today 's meal was a bit disappointing .
Now for my next goal : 200 lbs. ( Splurge dessert . )

10/29/2009 - 205.5 lbs. ( OK , my first two tries on the scale produced 204 lbs. , but then a bunch after that were all 205.5 , so I have to go with 205.5 , which means that again I wo n't be splurging for a while . )
Today is the first time I 'm feeling squirrely about this whole thing - the weight - loss and all .
I 'm wondering what the heck I 'm doing it for .
So I have to stand back and figure out what my problem is .
A member of my family just passed away recently and I want to go to the funeral , but I can't , for various reasons .
On top of that , my car is a disaster waiting to happen ( all I need is to break down hundreds of miles from nowhere ) , and I do n't want to use my wife 's car , it needs to be looked at - I 'd also rather not put the wear on her car anyway .
I do n't want her car to become a second " disaster waiting to happen . "
Better me than her . )
So why am I sharing my sob story ?
I 'm not fishing for sympathy , I 'm identifying a key problem that many people miss in their diet plans : you have to be constantly vigilant and honest with yourself about your circumstances and your state of mind .
If you pretend everything 's OK , when it 's not , you will brainwash yourself into believing that nothing 's wrong , when in fact something could be wrong .
If something 's wrong and you do n't address it , you could be sabotaging your diet .
Be honest .
Identify it and write it out .
Now , it 's not necessarily a fail - proof way to stay on your diet , but I promise it will improve your chances .
Any kind of psychological disturbance can cause cravings of any sort to kick in .
This is why people have a much tougher time with food during an economic crisis : for one , there 's the constant underlying fear of losing one 's job .
These sorts of things will sabotage dieting efforts in a heartbeat .
No matter what your problems or misfortunes are in life , they will be much worse if you are n't exactly sure what they are ; in other words , if you know what your fear is , you will lessen the anxiety associated with that fear a bit ( given of course that it 's not , " a meteorite is about to fall on my head . " )
You will thus lessen the impact of that fear on your diet .
Some people would rather not know what their fear is because they do n't want to face it , or they do n't have the energy to deal with it at the moment , hence they push the fear away into their subconscious and it sits there and spins out of control until pretty soon they 're not feeling right , but they do n't know why anymore .
An underlying problem of this nature can be a constant energy drain ( and low energy , or fatigue naturally spurs the urge to eat junk as a compensatory measure , because junk gives a short rush of energy . )
It 's always best to deal with any issues as they come along , confront them head - on and hopefully get them out of the way .
At the very least ( as I just did ) , identify the problem and write it out .
Somehow , I find that to be very therapeutic , and it really seems to help keep me from ending my diet .

I must have gotten on that scale about 10 times .
Although it flickered a couple of times at 206.5 , it always came to rest on 205 lbs. , so I 'm taking it :)
Three more of these and I 'll be able to splurge .
I think I may wait till next weekend to splurge .
Ooooh am I looking forward to it .

Well the package says that 1 / 2 the recipe is just 380 , but it 's not .
I wonder if they meant 1/ 4 is 380 , but even that seems like it would be a little off .
I could barely finish it - definitely not 380 then .
I 'm just going to say that it was the rest of my calories and pray - so much for my 205 milestone :(
10/24/2009 - 206 lbs .
I just noticed something that made me laugh ; if you look at my 10/20/2009 picture , you 'll notice my cat peeking around me and looking at the camera .
I guess he did n't want to be upstaged .
So we had pancakes this morning and although I knew they'd be heavy in calories , I had no idea quite how many calories I 'd be consuming .
At least they 're the first thing I had , so I have the rest of the day to make up for it .
One thing I 've noticed in the past one or two weeks is that my weight loss seems to have slowed down .
The one thing I 'm doing differently is , about two weeks ago I started drinking diet soda quite regularly again .
I know it 's supposed to be 0 calories , but I read somewhere that it can actually cause people to put on weight .
I think the real thing though is , I need to cut back further on calories , so starting today I 'm going to shoot for 1800 .
I 'll probably bump a little over - closer to 1900 - but that 's how my 2000 cal goal went too , yet it seemed to work out .
What 's interesting though is , I guess a regular consumption of 200 calories would keep me around 203-205 pounds .
That 's good to know .
We 'll see what a 1800 calorie regimen does for me .
Butter 7 grams 50
Syrup 100
Pancakes 168 grams calories 587
Banana 90
Peanut butter 16 grams calories 95
So far ...
10/23/2009 - 206 lbs .
( The first two weigh - ins registered 204.5 .
You can imagine how my heart jumped when I saw that !
Sadly , the following 3 or 4 weigh - ins were at 206 , but part of me knew that probably only a pendulum down - swing could explain the sudden drop of 2 lbs .
( and I would n't be happy with the inevitable later balancing up - swing ) , so I 'll take the 206 ; it 's still a drop , albeit only ½ a pound . )
You know , it 's funny ; about 21 years ago I saw the scale dip over 170 lbs. for the first and it made my hair stand on end .
For the first time , my belly was sticking out a little further than my chest - at resting a position .
Now , 21 years later , I 'm dancing for joy when the scale flickers at a promising 204.5 .
When I finally reach my goal of 185 , I 'll be in 7th heaven , but part of me will still be channeling the kid who thinks " 185 is still over 15 lbs. heavier than I used to be . "

10/20/2009 - 206.5 lbs .
You know , it 's strange , I only just now realized that my scale only calculates in units of .5 lbs .
This morning I strayed from the norm : I had leftover pasta for breakfast .
It was awesome !
I woke up at around 5:00 a.m. and was n't able to fall back to sleep till 6:30 a.m.
I sure hope this does n't activate cravings .
Also , I hope the loss of sleep does n't make me relapse ; my bronchitis is pretty much over ( still have the occasional dry hack ) , and I want to keep it that way .
I bet having all those chocolate cookies last night played havoc with my sleep - with the caffeine and all .
If that happens again , I guess I 'll have to moderate my cookie intake .
Why does eating junk have to feel so good ?
You know , so and so on his so and so TV show said that if you drink in order to modify your mood ( example , to " make you happy , " or to " have fun , " then that means you 're addicted . )
I guess I 'm addicted to junk food , because every time I consider how to have fun , it ALWAYS seems to HAVE to involve food ; and I do n't mean that I should n't go out to eat when having fun , it 's just food is the part I seem to look forward to the most ( apropos , I still can't wait for my splurge , mm mmm mmmm ! )
Leftover pasta with sauce calories - 290

Chicken portabella sandwich calories uh - oh .
1500/1600 ( Oh boy , I went to a sandwich place today which is NOT subway ; you know what that means : no calorie information .
I went ahead and ate my sandwich anyway .
It was n't until afterward that I really gave it some thought and realized that the bread alone ( it was deliciously fried in butter ) was probably around 800 calories .
The rest of the sandwich ( actually , it was like 2 sandwiches - even though it 's " one " cut in half ) was probably 700 or 800 ( for a total of approx .
1500/1600 ) calories , so I 'm in trouble .
Because of that I 've probably already reached my calorie limit for today ( or more . )
I 'm going to go ahead and have a light dinner anyway and see what happens .
Maybe I 'll see a pound increase over the next couple of days .
For the future though , when I eat there , I 'm going to take half the sandwich home and eat it the next day ( and count them as 800 calories each . )
We 'll see , I may find the discipline to shave off 200 calories the next 2 or 3 days .
I have to say , I feel a calm that I have n't felt since before I started dieting , though .
That 's tough ; you wonder why it is that eating the right amount of food should cause you to feel anxious , unfulfilled and deprived .
The only thing I can come up with is , again , we 're surrounded with pleasure food 24/ 7 whether it be commercials , smells , billboards , etc .
It 's like if you were single and surrounded by absolutely drop - dead beautiful people ( the sex that you prefer , of course ) , but you were n't able to get close or start a relationship with any of them .
How about the feeling you get when you 're around someone who 's broken your heart ?
That 's obviously far more intense than simple food cravings ; nonetheless , I 've been in that situation ( of being around an " ex " ) and the feelings I experienced are definitely from the same ilk as those that food cravings come from .
How do you solve the ex problem ?
You go somewhere your ex is n't .
Unfortunately , that 's the only solution I can find for diminishing the food cravings too : do n't be around pleasure food when you should n't have it .
For dinner I had :

Well , I guess the rooster 's here .
I like to think though that it 's because I had to get up at 7:30 a.m. after having gotten up considerably later in the last couple days ; it was the Weekend +
Colombus day - and I was sick , so I was really trying to kick the bronchitis .
I think it 's just about gone :)
I have to say , today is the first day I 've felt constant cravings , and I believe ( and this is part of the plan ) that it has to do with my wife being gone for two days ( I miss her ) and the fact that I did n't get eight hours of sleep ; that causes the body to create more grehlin which sends signals to the brain to tell you you 're hungry .
Got to get some sleep tonight !

How do you like them pendulums ?
Boy , if I 'm really that close to 205 , it means that soon I can have my meal + dessert splurge .
Woooohoooo .
I plan on having 2 baskets of chips and salsa , a grilled chicken salad with as much fattening ranch dressing as possible - I actually enjoy the grilled chicken salad more than the other main dishes - and then for dessert I will get a large package of oreos , 2 scoops of my favorite ice cream at my favorite ice cream place , and a pint of Ben & Jerry 's .
Wooohoooo !
Again though , that 's not going to happen tomorrow or the next day , but after I 've hit 205 three days in a row . )

10/9/2009 - 209.5 lbs .
( Well , when I first got on the scale it displayed 208 three times , but I could n't believe it , so I retried and it showed 210.5 a couple times , and finally 209.5 a couple of times ; that was a fair compromise .
The good news :
Yahoo came out with an article about 8 foods that fight fat ; I ran right out , and I bought all but 1 of those ( I could n't find soy beans . )
I used a couple of them in today 's diet .
Bad news : I messed up yesterday ; I forgot that I had salad , so I have to add 120 cals for the oil - just goes to show , you have to have a list .
It turns out I 'm not succeeding in removing 200 cals a day , but hopefully replacing my food with Yahoo's fat - fighting food will help . ) 2 oatmeals calories – 260

The pendulum demons want me to think that I 'm losing so that I 'll run out and stuff my face till I can't see my feet , but I know better .
P.S. - try to ignore the bad hair day - I stayed home from work today because of my constant bronchiole coughing , so that 's bed - head you see there .
On a positive note , I will say that the shorts ( or " jorts " ) seem to be buttoning much more easily .
As you can see below , I went 65 cals over today 's goal ( 1800 ) , so I 'll have to either deduct more tomorrow , or deduct for 3 days rather than 2 .
I can't wait to resume excersizing - this bronchitis is killing me !

You know , I 'd like to think the " rest of the chili " was 800 calories , but as I scarfed it down , I realized that traditional chili does n't have elbow macaroni , and since I used a generic chili posting somewhere online to obtain my calorie count , I 'm probably waayyy off .
No wonder I feel so satiated .
( Sigh ) .
Guess I 'll be cutting off 200 cals a day for the next 2 days ( and I 'm sure my weight will go up . )

10/5/2009 – 210 lbs. ( the first weigh in displayed a 212 , and the next couple showed 208.5 .
Naturally I wanted to take that one , but I tried again for good measure and the next couple were 210 , so I posted that as a compromise . )
OK , my diet has n't instantly improved ( sorry , Redditers ) , but at least I 'm starting to track protein .
I am bringing 90 grams of sandwhich meat with me tomorrow to work ( has 10 grams of protein ) and then I 'll have my usual fruit afterwards - that way I 'm not just having fruit in the morning .
My wife made amazing chili tonight , so I had that and stuck to approximate calories .
I will do eggs and raisins and I did get lentils , so I 'll be eating that for lunch tomorrow - I 'm really looking forward to that .

Notice the great lighting ?
That 's my little sister 's doing ; you 're absolutely right , sis , day time lighting does make a big difference .
Also , notice I 'm finally buttoning my shorts !
My belly 's hanging over , but at least I can button them .
I 'm sure that 's partly due to the fact that I did n't wait till the end of the day this time to take the pictures .
BY THE WAY - IF YOU CLICK THE PICTURE , YOU GET A LARGER VIEW
( Something interesting happened this morning - it has actually also happened many times before , when I 've dieted in the past ; I woke up briefly at around 7:30 a.m. and decided to weigh myself : I was 210.5 lbs .
Now , because I 'm still 100 % sick , I went back to sleep .
I then got up again at 11:00 a.m. , re-weighed myself and this time , although it flickered once at 210.5 , several consecutive weighs displayed a solid 209 - even after moving the scale around .
Like I said , this phenomenon has happened to me in the past .
Whenever I would not get enough sleep ( I need more now that I 'm sick ) , I 'd either stay at the same weight , or actually gain weight .
I wonder if proper sleep helps the body to not retain water , for some reason .
This is part of my plan , by the way : proper sleep .

10/2/2009 – 210 lbs. ( 5 bl. mark )
Today I have something new to introduce : " splurge meal / dessert . "
It really only works if you plan on losing about 8 bl.s or more - otherwise the splurge meal would set you back too much .
You 'll understand as you read on .
You 've probably heard people talk about rewarding themselves at certain points in their diet ; well , I 'm one of those people .
The mistake most make , though , is rewarding themselves based on a time - frame .
If you say " I 'm going to splurge every Friday , " and you do n't actually lose any weight , then the splurges will cause you to gain weight .
If you do lose weight , but say only one pound , then the splurges would cause you to stay about the same weight .
I on the other hand have decided to base my splurges on weight - loss milestones .
Every 5 bls .
I get to splurge - but only for a meal ( and dessert ) or just a dessert .
Here 's what I mean : I want to lose 30 bls .
at least , so I am dividing it into six 5 - pound weight goals .
At each 5 bl . loss I get to splurge for either a meal and a dessert , or just a dessert ( I reserve the 10 bl. losses for the meal + dessert splurges . )
In other words :
at 210 bls. = dessert splurge ( today )
at 205 bls. = meal + dessert splurge
at 200 bls. = dessert splurge
at 195 bls . = meal + dessert splurge
at 190 bls . = dessert splurge
at 185 bls. = meal + dessert splurge
The other mistake people make is giving themselves a full day splurge rather than just a meal + dessert or just dessert splurge .
I think a full day splurge is a bad move .
Having said all this , I do have to concede that I cheated : when I reach each 5 bl. mark , I need to have reached it for three days running before I splurge ( Today 's only the first day I reached it . )
That 's because of what I call my weight pendulum theory : if you look at my weight postings , you 'll notice that sometimes they swing up and down as much as 2 or 3 pounds in just one day .
Overall though , the mean of my weight steadily decreases ; it acts like a swinging pendulum moving slowly down a slope .
That 's something a lot of people do n't realize .
They either get discouraged by the sudden upsurge , or too cocky by the sudden plunge in weight , and they let if affect their diet .
If you can remember that your weight will swing up and down every day , then that should help you have the patience to wait and view it from an overall , broader time frame .
you need to keep the swinging weight pendulum in mind , in order to stay on a steady course with your diet .

HOORAY !
Now THAT’S what I like to see .
P.S. I ’ve been feeling a little under the weather lately ; last week I was getting over a mild bout of bronchitis , and then on Thursday , Sep 24 , I got the flu shot and I think that may have thrust me back a couple steps because now the bronchitis seems to be edging back again .
Starting an exercise regime ( and a diet , for that matter ) can often contribute to getting sick too .
Also – and probably most importantly – the weather has gone through a drastic change recently .

Labels : a detailed daily weight - loss plan
By George Friedman During the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign , now - U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said that like all U.S. presidents , Barack Obama would face a foreign policy test early in his presidency if elected .
That test is now here .
His test comprises two apparently distinct challenges , one in Afghanistan and one in Iran .
While different problems , they have three elements in common .
First , they involve the question of his administration 's overarching strategy in the Islamic world .
Second , the problems are approaching decision points ( and making no decision represents a decision here ) .
And third , they are playing out very differently than Obama expected during the 2008 campaign .
During the campaign , Obama portrayed the Iraq war as a massive mistake diverting the United States from Afghanistan , the true center of the " war on terror . "
He accordingly promised to shift the focus away from Iraq and back to Afghanistan .
Obama 's views on Iran were more amorphous .
He supported the doctrine that Iran should not be permitted to obtain nuclear weapons , while at the same time asserted that engaging Iran was both possible and desirable .
Embedded in the famous argument over whether offering talks without preconditions was appropriate ( something now - U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton attacked him for during the Democratic primary ) was the idea that the problem with Iran stemmed from Washington 's refusal to engage in talks with Tehran .
We are never impressed with campaign positions , or with the failure of the victorious candidate to live up to them .
That 's the way American politics work .
But in this case , these promises have created a dual crisis that Obama must make decisions about now .
Iran Back in April , in the midst of the financial crisis , Obama reached an agreement at the G - 8 meeting that the Iranians would have until Sept. 24 and the G - 20 meeting to engage in meaningful talks with the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council plus Germany ( P - 5+1 ) or face intensely increased sanctions .
His administration was quite new at the time , so the amount of thought behind this remains unclear .
On one level , the financial crisis was so intense and September so far away that Obama and his team probably saw this as a means to delay a secondary matter while more important fires were flaring up .
But there was more operating than that .
Obama intended to try to bridge the gap between the Islamic world and the United States between April and September .
In his speech to the Islamic world from Cairo , he planned to show a desire not only to find common ground , but also to acknowledge shortcomings in U.S. policy in the region .
With the appointment of special envoys George Mitchell ( for Israel and the Palestinian territories ) and Richard Holbrooke ( for Pakistan and Afghanistan ) , Obama sought to build on his opening to the Islamic world with intense diplomatic activity designed to reshape regional relationships .
It can be argued that the Islamic masses responded positively to Obama 's opening — it has been asserted to be so and we will accept this — but the diplomatic mission did not solve the core problem .
Mitchell could not get the Israelis to move on the settlement issue , and while Holbrooke appears to have made some headway on increasing Pakistan 's aggressiveness toward the Taliban , no fundamental shift has occurred in the Afghan war .
Most important , no major shift has occurred in Iran 's attitude toward the United States and the P - 5+1 negotiating group .
In spite of Obama 's Persian New Year address to Iran , the Iranians did not change their attitude toward the United States .
The unrest following Iran 's contested June presidential election actually hardened the Iranian position .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad remained president with the support of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , while the so - called moderates seemed powerless to influence their position .
Perceptions that the West supported the demonstrations have strengthened Ahmadinejad 's hand further , allowing him to paint his critics as pro-Western and himself as an Iranian nationalist .
But with September drawing to a close , talks have still not begun .
Instead , they will begin Oct. 1 . And last week , the Iranians chose to announce that not only will they continue work on their nuclear program ( which they claim is not for military purposes ) , they have a second , hardened uranium enrichment facility near Qom .
After that announcement , Obama , British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and French President Nicolas Sarkozy held a press conference saying they have known about the tunnel for several months , and warned of stern consequences .
This , of course , raises the question of what consequences .
Obama has three choices in this regard .
First , he can impose crippling sanctions against Iran .
But that is possible only if the Russians cooperate .
Moscow has the rolling stock and reserves to supply all of Iran 's fuel needs if it so chooses , and Beijing can also remedy any Iranian fuel shortages .
Both Russia and China have said they do n't want sanctions ; without them on board , sanctions are meaningless .
Second , Obama can take military action against Iran , something easier politically and diplomatically for the United States to do itself rather than rely on Israel .
By itself , Israel cannot achieve air superiority , suppress air defenses , attack the necessary number of sites and attempt to neutralize Iranian mine - laying and anti-ship capability all along the Persian Gulf .
Moreover , if Israel struck on its own and Iran responded by mining the Strait of Hormuz , the United States would be drawn into at least a naval war with Iran — and probably would have to complete the Israeli airstrikes , too .
And third , Obama could choose to do nothing ( or engage in sanctions that would be the equivalent of doing nothing ) .
Washington could see future Iranian nuclear weapons as an acceptable risk .
But the Israelis do n't , meaning they would likely trigger the second scenario .
It is possible that the United States could try to compel Israel not to strike — though it's not clear whether Israel would comply — something that would leave Obama publicly accepting Iran 's nuclear program .
And this , of course , would jeopardize Obama 's credibility .
It is possible for the French or Germans to waffle on this issue ; no one is looking to them for leadership .
But for Obama simply to acquiesce to Iranian nuclear weapons , especially at this point , would have significant diplomatic and domestic political ramifications .
Simply put , Obama would look weak — and that , of course , is why the Iranians announced the second nuclear site .
They read Obama as weak , and they want to demonstrate their own resolve .
That way , if the Russians were thinking of cooperating with the United States on sanctions , Moscow would be seen as backing the weak player against the strong one .
The third option , doing nothing , therefore actually represents a significant action .
Afghanistan
In a way , the same issue is at stake in Afghanistan .
Having labeled Afghanistan as critical — indeed , having campaigned on the platform that the Bush administration was fighting the wrong war — it would be difficult for Obama to back down in Afghanistan .
At the same time , the U.S. commander in Afghanistan , Gen. Stanley McChrystal , has reported that without a new strategy and a substantial increase in troop numbers , failure in Afghanistan is likely .
The number of troops being discussed , 30,000 - 40,000 , would bring total U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan to just above the number of troops the Soviet Union deployed there in its war ( just under 120,000 ) — a war that ended in failure .
The new strategy being advocated would be one in which the focus would not be on the defeat of the Taliban by force of arms , but the creation of havens for the Afghan people and protecting those havens from the Taliban .
A move to the defensive when time is on your side is not an unreasonable strategy .
But it is not clear that time is on Western forces ' side .
Increased offensives are not weakening the Taliban .
But halting attacks and assuming that the Taliban will oblige the West by moving to the offensive , thereby opening itself to air and artillery strikes , probably is not going to happen .
And while assuming that the country will effectively rise against the Taliban out of the protected zones the United States has created is interesting , it does not strike us as likely .
The Taliban is fighting the long war because it has nowhere else to go .
Its ability to maintain military and political cohesion following the 2001 invasion has been remarkable .
And betting that the Pakistanis will be effective enough to break the Taliban 's supply lines is hardly the most prudent bet .
In short , Obama 's commander on the ground has told him the current Afghan strategy is failing .
He has said that unless that strategy changes , more troops wo n't help , and that a change of strategy will require substantially more troops .
But when we look at the proposed strategy and the force levels , it is far from obvious that even that level of commitment will stand a chance of achieving meaningful results quickly enough before the forces of Washington 's NATO allies begin to withdraw and U.S. domestic resolve erodes further .
Obama has three choices in Afghanistan .
He can continue to current strategy and force level , hoping to prolong failure long enough for some undefined force to intervene .
He can follow McChrystal 's advice and bet on the new strategy .
Or he can withdraw U.S. forces from Afghanistan .
Once again , doing nothing — the first option — is doing something quite significant .
The Two Challenges Come Together
The two crises intermingle in this way : Every president is tested in foreign policy , sometimes by design and sometimes by circumstance .
Frequently , this happens at the beginning of his term as a result of some problem left by his predecessor , a strategy adopted in the campaign or a deliberate action by an antagonist .
How this happens is n't important .
What is important is that Obama 's test is here .
Obama at least publicly approached the presidency as if many of the problems the United States faced were due to misunderstandings about or the thoughtlessness of the United States .
Whether this was correct is less important than that it left Obama appearing eager to accommodate his adversaries rather than confront them .
No one has a clear idea of Obama 's threshold for action .
In Afghanistan , the Taliban takes the view that the British and Russians left , and that the Americans will leave , too .
We strongly doubt that the force level proposed by McChrystal will be enough to change their minds .
Moreover , U.S. forces are limited , with many still engaged in Iraq .
In any case , it is n't clear what force level would suffice to force the Taliban to negotiate or capitulate — and we strongly doubt that there is a level practical to contemplate .
In Iran , Ahmadinejad clearly perceives that challenging Obama is low - risk and high reward .
If he can finally demonstrate that the United States is unwilling to take military action regardless of provocations , his own domestic situation improves dramatically , his relationship with the Russians deepens , and most important , his regional influence — and menace — surges .
If Obama accepts Iranian nukes without serious sanctions or military actions , the American position in the Islamic world will decline dramatically .
The Arab states in the region rely on the United States to protect them from Iran , so U.S. acquiescence in the face of Iranian nuclear weapons would reshape U.S. relations in the region far more than a hundred Cairo speeches .
There are four permutations Obama might choose in response to the dual crisis .
He could attack Iran and increase forces in Afghanistan , but he might well wind up stuck in a long - term war in Afghanistan .
He could avoid that long - term war by withdrawing from Afghanistan and also ignore Iran 's program , but that would leave many regimes reliant on the United States for defense against Iran in the lurch .
He could increase forces in Afghanistan and ignore Iran — probably yielding the worst of all possible outcomes , namely , a long - term Afghan war and an Iran with a nuclear program if not nuclear weapons .
On pure logic , history or politics aside , the best course is to strike Iran and withdraw from Afghanistan .
That would demonstrate will in the face of a significant challenge while perhaps reshaping Iran and certainly avoiding a drawn - out war in Afghanistan .
Of course , it is easy for those who lack power and responsibility — and the need to govern — to provide logical choices .
But the forces closing in on Obama are substantial , and there are many competing considerations in play .
Presidents eventually arrive at the point where something must be done , and where doing nothing is very much doing something .
At this point , decisions can no longer be postponed , and each choice involves significant risk .
Obama has reached that point , and significantly , in his case , he faces a double choice .
And any decision he makes will reverberate .
High blood pressure ( BP ) is linked to an increased risk of heart attack and stroke .
High BP has been defined as any number larger than 140 to 160 /90 to 100 mmHg and as a result this range of BPs has become the standard blood pressure target for physicians and patients .
Over the last five years a trend toward lower targets has been recommended by hypertension experts who set treatment guidelines .
This trend is based on the assumption that the use of drugs to bring the BP lower than 140/90 mmHg will reduce heart attack and stroke similar to that seen in some population studies .
However , this approach is not proven .
This review was performed to find and assess all trials designed to answer whether lower blood pressure targets are better than standard blood pressure targets .
Data from 7 trials in over 22,000 people were analysed .
Using more drugs in the lower target groups did achieve modestly lower blood pressures .
However , this strategy did not prolong survival or reduce stroke , heart attack , heart failure or kidney failure .
More trials are needed , but at present there is no evidence to support aiming for a blood pressure target lower than 140/90 mmHg in any hypertensive patient .

Die Piratenpartei kämpft mit dem McCarthyismus des 21 .
Jahrhunderts
Andreas Popp und Jens Seipenbusch machten etwas , was dem Spiegel - Volontär Ole Reissmann in der letzten Woche die Schlagzeile " Junge Freiheit kapert Piratenpartei " wert war .
Sah man sich die Vorfälle genauer an , fand man allerdings nichts , was die Überschrift gerechtfertigt hätte .
Stattdessen war von einem Interview die Rede , das Popp der rechtskonservativen Zeitung gab , und von einem Fragenbogen , den Seipenbusch für sie ausgefüllt hatte .
Weder in dem Interview noch in den Antworten ( in denen der Piraten - Bundesvorsitzende nicht etwa Carl Schmitts Staatsgefüge , sondern Adornos Jargon der Eigentlichkeit als Lieblingsbuch nennt ) , finden sich in irgendeiner Weise Äußerungen , die auch nur annähernd etwas mit problematisierten Positionen der Zeitung zu tun hätten .
Weil das offenbar auch Reissmann auffiel , zitierte er wohlweislich nichts von den beiden Piraten , sondern zog für seine Erregung stattdessen die Fragen heran .
So wird kritisiert , dass Seipenbusch darüber Auskunft gab , " was für ihn Heimat bedeute , was ihm seine Eltern mitgegeben hätten und woran er glaube " .
Was an diesen Fragen so " seicht " sein soll ( wie Reissmann meint ) , dass Seipenbusch sie weglegen hätte sollen , anstatt sie zu beantworten , bleibt allerdings offen .
Diejenige nach der Bedeutung von Heimat war vor nicht allzu langer Zeit Abiturthema in einem großen deutschen Bundesland .
Woran Piratenparteimitglieder glauben , dazu wurden sie auch von Telepolis schon befragt .
Und ohne die Standardfrage nach den Eltern könnte beispielsweise die Karriere von Familienministerin von der Leyen nur ausgesprochen unzureichend erklärt werden .
Sehr bedingt seriös zitiert Reissmann auch Vorwürfe aus einem nordrhein - westfälischen Verfassungsschutzbericht von 2005 , der offenbar deshalb so alt sein musste , weil das Bundesverfassungsgericht diese Praxis kurz darauf in einem ausgesprochen lesenswerten Urteil als unzulässig pauschalisierenden Verstoß gegen die Pressefreiheit verbot .
Letztendlich begrenzt sich der Vorwurf des Volontärs gegen die beiden Piraten darauf , dass sie überhaupt mit der Zeitung sprachen - wie vor ihnen übrigens auch Ephraim Kishon , Joseph Stiglitz , Ernst Benda , Egon Bahr , Vera Lengsfeld und Rolf Hochhuth .
Alles Personen , die - wenn man der Logik Reissmanns folgen wollte - von der Jungen Freiheit " gekapert " wurden .
Dass dieses Bild vom " Kapern " aber mindestens genauso gut auch umgedreht anwendbar ist , das legte Jens Seipenbusch in seinem Blog dar :
[...] eine Zusammenarbeit mit rechten Parteien kommt nicht in Frage , auch für mich nicht , genau das hat Andreas Popp ja auch gesagt .
Ist es aber die richtige Antwort , einer Zeitung nicht die eigene politische Meinung darzulegen ? [...]
Ich denke bei der Bewertung dieses Interviews an die Leser der Jungen Freiheit , nicht an die Macher .
Wenn wir diese Menschen nicht für würdig befinden , mit ihnen über Politik zu reden , dann geben wir sie verloren .
Wenn wir sie zurückholen wollen ins demokratische Spektrum , dann müssen wir mit ihnen reden , ihnen klarmachen , warum die rechte Ideologie menschenfeindlich ist .
Sie zu verachten , sich von ihnen zu distanzieren , mag den Linken dabei helfen , ihre eigene Identität zu definieren - in der angesprochenen Sache ist es eher schädlich .
Reissmanns Polemik und ein ähnlicher
Text der Grünen - Politikerin Julia Seeliger in der Taz machten ungewollt darauf aufmerksam , dass es Zensurextremisten nicht nur in der Union gibt .
Gerade in der SPD schützten in der jüngsten Vergangenheit Politiker wie Sebastian Edathy und Brigitte Zypries immer öfter den Bequembegriff " rechts " vor , wenn es um die Rechtfertigung von Grundrechtseinschränkungen ging .
Das praktische an diesem Begriff ist , dass er in den letzten Jahren so inflationär verwendet wurde , dass sich mittlerweile politisch Unliebsames fast jeder Richtung mit ihm bedenken lässt .
Der neue McCarthyismus geht dabei ähnlich vor wie der alte in den 1950er Jahren : Über teilweise beeindruckend lange Beziehungsketten steht jeder Angegriffene irgendwann einmal mit dem in Verbindung , was grade als das absolute Böse gilt : Im Amerika der 1950er Jahre war das der Kommunismus .
Und damals war es der Begriff " pinko " , mit dem unter anderem Bürgerrechtlern eine Nähe zu Moskau unterstellt wurde .
Es dürfte auch den meisten Piraten klar sein , dass politische Macht in den Händen von Personen , die auf Politically Incorrect die Meldung bejubeln , dass ein Teilnehmer der Demonstration Freiheit statt Angst auf die Frage nach der Dienstnummer eines Polizisten blutig geprügelt und angezeigt wurde , sehr wahrscheinlich nicht zu einem besseren Schutz von Grundrechten führen würde .
Doch gerade angesichts von derart dreist zur Schau gestellter Dumm - und Grobheit ist beziehungsweise wäre es keineswegs verabscheuungswürdig , wenn Grundrechtsschützer so viel Abstraktionsvermögen aufbringen , dass sie auch den eigenen Feinden das Recht auf Meinungs - und Redefreiheit nicht absprechen , sondern es stattdessen verteidigen - in jedem Medium , das ihnen die Möglichkeit dazu bietet .
" Ich teile ihre Meinung nicht , aber ich bin bereit , mein Leben dafür einzusetzen , dass Sie sie äußern dürfen " schrieb Voltaire einst .
Und das ist nicht , wie mancher Möchtegernzensor meinte anmerken zu müssen , eine Ideologie der absoluten Freiheit , die sich selbst ad absurdum führt , sondern das absolute Minimum davon - nichts weiter als Kant cum Grundgesetz .

Jupiter 's largest moon , Ganymede , is also its only moon with a strong magnetic field .
Now , using thousands of images from the Hubble Space Telescope , scientists have discovered that the spectacular auroras seen at Jupiter 's poles are generated in part by the pull of Ganymede 's magnetosphere .
Both Ganymede and the volcanically active moon
Io interact with Jupiter 's plasma as they orbit around the planet , generating bright spots at the poles called " auroral footprints . "
Until now , however , no one knew how big Ganymede 's footprint was or why the moon caused these beautiful light shows .
By analyzing the Hubble images , researchers measured the exact size of Ganymede 's footprint and determined that it 's too big to be a projection of the planet itself , but corresponds almost perfectly with the diameter of the moon 's protective magnetic field .
Scientists also measured the size and shape of Io 's footprint , which is caused by charged particles ejected from its many active volcanoes .
" Each of these auroral structures is telling an ongoing story about vast transfers of energy taking place far away from the planet , " astrophysicist Denis Grodent of the University of Liege in Belgium said in a press release .
" By analyzing the exact locations of these features and how their shape and brightness changes as Io and Gaynmede move in their orbit around Jupiter , we have created the most detailed picture to date of how Jupiter and these moons are electromagnetically interconnected . "
Grodent presented his research Thursday at the European Planetary Science Congress in Germany .
In addition to linking Ganymede 's footprint with its magnetic field , Grodent and his team discovered unexpected periodic variations in the brightness of the moon 's aurora , happening on three different timescales .
The researchers think each variation reflects a specific interaction between Jupiter 's plasma and Ganymede 's magnetic field , but they do n't yet know what 's causing the interactions .

The reporting we saw on TV and on the Internet that day was the work not of journalists , but of political hit men .
The snippets about Sotomayor had been circulating on conservative Web sites and shown on some TV channels for weeks .
They were new only to the vast majority of us who have better things to do than vet the record of every person on Obama ’s list .
But this is precisely what activists and bloggers on both sides of the political spectrum do , and what a conservative organization like the Judicial Confirmation Network exists to promote .
The JCN had gathered an attack dossier on each of the prospective Supreme Court nominees , and had fed them all to the networks in advance .
( Emphasis mine )
Mark Bowden , author of , investigated the strange coincidence of all the TV networks having Sonya Sotomayor ’s “ wise Latina ” speech cued up the instant her nomination was announced , finding that
Bowden focuses on the rise of web - based partisan journalism and the MSM ’s new habit of stovepiping propaganda , but what I find interesting is his identification of the 24 - 7 news cycle as “ post journalistic .
It sees democracy , by definition , as perpetual political battle . ”
He ’s talking about the permanent campaign :
The Ruby community , according to some data I am making up , has the strongest test - driven development attitude .
Not all of us TATFT ; not all of us test most of the time ; and not all of us test ever — but those who do test make up a larger proportion than they do in , say , the Java world .
But why ?
What is it about Ruby that drives us to attain 100 % code coverage ?
We test .
Kent Beck tests .
Rails comes set up for you to write tests as part of your application .
Are you such a skilled programmer , such a badass rebel , such a unique person , and such a loner that you would n’t dare test your Ruby code ?
No , because your app would break and you know it .
More importantly , everyone in the community knows it .
If you publish it to Rubyforge and there are no tests , do n’t expect us to use it .
So you write tests , because we want you to .
( Thank you for doing that for us . )
Test - driven development is cheating .
You think upfront about the problem , the solutions , the problems with those solutions , and you document all this in code .
It fails , with a pretty error message , so you make it pass .
But you already know this one .
Any method , at any time , might produce nil .
You never know when it might happen .
Even instance variables might produce nil .
Your code will keep going until this becomes an issue …and it will become an issue .
The reason nil appears so often , even when unexpected , is in part because of the implicit return at the end of methods , and in part because if in Ruby is different from if in C ( it ’s an expression that produces a value instead of a statement that just runs ) .
This is different from what many people expect and this difference often goes ignored .
We ’ve worked around this in places where we expect nil .
Either we re-write the algorithm to #compact the nil s out early , or we use #validate_presence_of and stop expecting nil , or we use the #try hack , or some other specific solution .
But it lingers in the back of our mind that any method we ’re calling could produce an absolutely useless value .
We have to write complete tests that verify the runtime code because there is no tool to automate this .
In a world where even C can tell you when you are passing an integer where it expected a string — before even running your program — Ruby can not do anything of the sort .
Your program works until it stops working , and then you dig through Hoptoad for a minute , write a test for 30 minutes , fix the code ( five minutes ) , and re-deploy .
Live , while the client is waiting .
So we write the tests first so the client stays happy .
Instead of just hacking away at code until it compiles , we write tests then hack away at code until they pass .
Work has been done to try to statically analyze Ruby .
Our very own Jason Morrison did some work in 2006 for the Google Summer of Code to build a type inference engine , then tried to continue the project before abandoning the idea ; according to him , the main problem is eval .
Another problem he ’s mentioned is the way classes are implemented , with the singleton classes and mixins and whatnot .
Ping him for more information .
We write tests so we can refactor without care .
What if we change the methods called , or the order of the callbacks ; what will break ?
This matters because code can depend on ordering .
Variables can be mutated : set , unset , and changed from anywhere .
We might print to the logger in one callback then follow - up that printing in another .
We might depend on an instance variable not being nil in a method because of undocumented invariants .
If we re-write a seemingly innocent method in a way that changes the order in which things are mutated , anything could go wrong .
So we test because Ruby provides no better alternative , and because testing is awesome .
What if we tested only because we enjoyed it , not because we got anything technical out of it ?
What if our unit tests never failed except for when we first wrote them ?
What if regressions were caught by the language implementation instead of by custom code ?
What changes would you make to Ruby to achieve the goal of never unit testing again ?
Report : Obama told Petraeus and McChrystal to “ scrub ” assessments
As the Obama administration wrestles with how to deal with the worsening military and political situation in Afghanistan and the worsening level of public support for the war at home , new details are emerging about how the president is thinking about his decision on whether to send more U.S. troops to the region .
According to Howard " Buck " McKeon , R- CA , the new top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee , Obama told Central Command head Gen. David Petraeus and Afghanistan commander Gen. Stanley McChrystal to " scrub " their assessments because he " was n’t inclined to send troops over there . "
If McKeon ’s claim is true , Obama ’s instructions , relayed to McKeon through Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates , show how resistant the president is to doubling down on the war in Afghanistan and how Republicans are prepared to take their push for an increased commitment of resources to the public .
The second half of McChrystal ’s assessment , the part that will spell out his request for more troops , is expected to hit the Pentagon soon .
Roll Call ‘s Jennifer Bendery and John Stanton have the scoop :
House Armed Services ranking member Howard McKeon ( R - Calif . ) said Wednesday that Gates told him on a July trip to Afghanistan that Obama " was n’t inclined to send troops over there . "
McKeon said Gates also told him that , in light of Gen. David Petraeus and McChrystal being asked to submit assessments to the president on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , respectively , Obama had " given instructions " to them to " scrub everything , to make sure they did n’t ask for more than they needed . "
That conversation prompted McKeon to ask McChrystal if the directive sent " a chilling message " that the U.S. and NATO commander should ask for less troops than he needed .
" He said , ‘ No , I ’m honor - bound to ask for what I need , ’ " McKeon said . "
Pentagon Press Secretary Geoff Morrell pushed back against McKeon ’s claims :
" I usually do not comment on the secretary ’s discussions with members of Congress , but in this case I think I need to clear up some confusion , " Morrell told The Cable , " I do not believe that the secretary would make statements to anyone , including Congressman McKeon , indicating that President Obama was disinclined to send additional troops to Afghanistan .
That ’s just not plausible because the issue of whether to send more forces is what will be discussed and debated once the president ’s strategy review has been completed and both he and Secretary Gates have been very clear that they are still undecided on the way ahead in Afghanistan . "
Furthermore , Gates , not President Obama , told General McChrystal to " scrub " his forces to make sure that all of them were being used in the most efficient manner , Morrell added .

This is the true character of a nation that fights wars of " humanitariam intervention " for the sake of " peace " : U.S. Increases Its Share of Worldwide Arms Market ( NYT ) :
Despite a recession that knocked down global arms sales last year , the United States expanded its role as the world ’s leading weapons supplier , increasing its share to more than two - thirds of all foreign armaments deals , according to a new Congressional study .
The United States signed weapons agreements valued at $ 37.8 billion in 2008 , or 68.4 percent of all business in the global arms bazaar , up significantly from American sales of $ 25.4 billion the year before .
As the Times reports , most of these instruments of death and ruin went to the " developing world ; " that is , American war profiteers pocketed tens of billions of dollars by running guns to some of the most volatile and vulnerable places on earth , to regimes who laid out their meager resources on weapons rather than the welfare of their people .
( Of course , in this they were just following the example of the most " developed " nation of all , the United States . ) :
The United States was the leader not only in arms sales worldwide , but also to the subset of nations in the developing world , signing $ 29.6 billion in weapons agreements with these nations , or 70.1 percent of all such deals .
At the beginning of The Sun Also Rises , Hemingway 's first novel , he quotes Gertrude Stein as saying “ You are all a lost generation . ”
He and his peers were soon known as “ The Lost Generation , ” a nickname still used for these post World War I artists and writers and their modern style .
With the book 's publication in 1926 , the American expatriate community in Paris tried to identify the originals of the characters .
Jake Barnes seemed to bear a close resemblance in some ways to Robert McAlmon and in others to William Bird ; Lady Brett Ashley was considered a portrait of Lady Duff Twysden ; Robert Cohn a version of Harold Loeb ; Mike Campbell a version of Patrick Guthrie ; and Bill Gorton patterned after Hemingway 's pal Donald Ogden Stewart .
Lady Duff Twysden , an Englishwoman born Mary Smurthwaite , was an aristocrat by marriage to her second husband .
Known as a hard drinker , Twysden was popular with the mainly male ex-pat crowd .
She embodied the new liberated woman of the 1920s and photos of her at the time show a tall , thin boyish - looking woman with short hair .
She was also fond of referring to herself as a “ chap . "
Lady Brett dominates the novel , even when she 's not present .
Jake drinks a lot but Brett drinks more .
Brett goes from relationship to relationship .
And Brett makes a connection between the major male characters in the novel — Barnes , Cohn , and Romero .
Many people were angered by some of the portrayals .
However , the novel won rave reviews .
The New York Times said its “ hard athletic narrative prose puts more literary English to shame . "
LENOX - The tickets sold out faster than any others in recent Tanglewood history .

James Taylor , who has adopted the Berkshires as his home and musical headquarters , will be performing at the Boston Symphony Orchestra ’s summer campus .
What ’s more , the Grammy - winner , starting next Wednesday , will be the centerpiece of an unprecedented five - day festival .
Never before has the BSO devoted so much attention to a mainstream musician .
For the BSO , which has faced financial challenges in recent years , the Taylor event will do more than introduce new visitors to the lush grounds of the campus .
It will provide a financial boost .
Instead of being paid for the gig , Taylor will give the symphony $ 500,000 , his earnings after expenses .
For Taylor , who has literally married into the BSO - his wife , Kim , was a longtime staffer and has now been elected to serve as a trustee - the concerts , roundtables , and master classes represent his latest and most dramatic show of support for the institution .
Taylor , who played the cello as a boy , said that it is not by chance .
“ The support for classical music is diminishing , ’’ Taylor explained on a recent afternoon from his home in Lenox .
“ We have real concerns for what the future is for it .
We also know it takes a huge structure to maintain a symphony and a lot of money . ’’
The amount of Taylor ’s gifts - the couple gave $ 500,000 this year and more than $ 700,000 in total from 2005 to 2008 - is large but not unheard of .
The BSO has 60 other donors who have given $ 1 million or more over time .
What makes the giving special , though , is that it is coming from a pop superstar .
It comes as the relationship between the institution and the singer deepens .
Taylor has already committed to a pair of shows next July , and Mark Volpe , the BSO ’s managing director , said that the singer can return for as long as he wants .
Volpe imagines the musician holding a special place in the BSO ’s history .

- Chernoff - REALITY
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Psychopaths who kill and rape have faulty connections between the part of the brain dealing with emotions and that which handles impulses and decision - making , scientists have found .
In a study of psychopaths who had committed murder , manslaughter , multiple rape , strangulation and false imprisonment , the British scientists found that roads linking the two crucial brain areas had “ potholes , ” while those of non-psychopaths were in good shape .
The study opens up the possibility of developing treatments for dangerous psychopaths in the future , said Dr Michael Craig of the Institute of Psychiatry at King ’s College London , and may have profound implications for doctors , researchers and the criminal justice system .
“ These were particular serious offenders with psychopathy and without any other mental illnesses , ” he told Reuters in an interview .
“ Essentially what we found is that the connections in the psychopaths were not as good as the connections in the non-psychopaths .
I would describe them as roads between the two areas -- and we found that in the psychopaths , the roads had potholes and were n’t very well maintained . ”
TIMING IS KEY
The scientists cautioned against suggestions the study could lead to screening of potential psychopathic criminals before they are able to commit crimes , saying their findings had not established how , when or why the brain links were damaged .
“ The most exciting question now ... is when do the potholes come -- are people born with them , do they develop early in life , or are they a consequence of something else ? ”
Psychopathic extremes have been portrayed in Hollywood blockbusters by characters like the serial killer and cannibal Hannibal Lecter .
Psychopaths often violate social norms , are manipulative , impulsive and sensation - seeking , and appear to feel no empathy or remorse .
Craig , who conducted the study , published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry with colleagues Declan Murphy and Dr Marco Catani , stressed that the numbers in the brain scan study were small , with only nine psychopaths analyzed and compared with nine non-psychopaths .
“ Trying to get people of this particular type to take part in a study , and also then deal with all the security you need to get them into a brain scanner , is not an easy feat , ” he said .
The study used new brain imaging technology to further analyze psychopaths ’ brains after previous studies found that the amygdala part of the brain , which processes emotions , and orbitofrontal cortex , which handles impulses and decisions , are structurally and functionally different in psychopaths .
“ Up until recently the technology has n’t been available to look at the connections between those two brain areas in any meaningful way , ” Craig said .
But a new technique , called diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging ( DT - MRI ) , allowed the researchers to look at the white matter tract linking the two key brain areas .
As well as finding clear structural deficits in the tract in psychopathic brains , they also found the degree of abnormality was significantly linked to the degree of psychopathy .
“ As for the moral significance for society , and how society wants to deal with these things , that is a little premature , ” said Craig .
“ This is a small study and the important thing it raises is that more research needs to be done . ”
Although you may receive an asthma diagnosis at any age , most people will be diagnosed in childhood .
The classic signs of asthma — wheezing , chest tightness , shortness of breath , and cough — can make the diagnosis difficult because they are general and non-specific .﻿﻿
Your doctor will use a combination of a medical history review , physical exam , and testing to reach a diagnosis and rule out ( or in ) other conditions that may be mimicking asthma .
Self Checks / At - Home Testing
While you cannot diagnose yourself or your child with the condition , it is very helpful to be aware of the signs and symptoms of asthma and keep a record of those experienced .
Note any factors that you think could have been involved — for example , you feel short of breath every time you dust .
This diary may prove to be very valuable to your doctor .
As part of the diagnosis , or for ongoing checks , your doctor may have you perform at - home spirometry — pulmonary function testing that measures the amount of air you breathe in and out ( and the speed at which you do so ) .
Only use a home spirometer if your doctor recommends it .
Make sure you understand how to correctly use the unit you purchase and that you follow your doctor 's instructions for reporting results accurately .
Intake and Physical Examination
In addition to checking for signs of breathing distress and response to allergens , your doctor will ask you questions about the symptoms you 're experiencing and your medical history in an attempt to piece together pieces of the diagnostic puzzle .
Your doctor will carefully listen for wheezing that is typical of , but not specific to , asthma .
Characteristically , it will be a high - pitched , almost musical instrument - like sound when you exhale .
While this sign is not present all of the time in people with asthma , and it does n't indicate the severity of the condition if you have it , detecting its presence is helpful in the diagnostic process .
The doctor will also check for nasal inflammation , which is a pale swelling of the nasal cavities that suggests allergic rhinitis that can worsen asthma symptoms .
The details you can share about your symptoms are important here , as some of the indicators of asthma are not ones that may be observed at your appointment .
Your doctor will ask about :
Shortness of breath , which some may instead describe as chest tightness
, which some may instead describe as chest tightness Cough : Coughing that accompanies asthma is characteristically dry , non-productive , and often worse at night .
Coughing that accompanies asthma is characteristically dry , non-productive , and often worse at night .
Circumstances that bring on symptoms :
This is where you symptom diary comes into play .
Typically in asthma , your symptoms will wax and wane over time .
Your doctor will likely ask you to explain how quickly symptoms come on , if there 's any predictability to them doing so , and what leads to the relief .
They may also ask you to think about specific triggers of past symptoms , such as exposures to allergens like dust , pets , smoke , or changes in the weather , such as cold air .

They may also ask you to think about specific triggers of past symptoms , such as exposures to allergens like dust , pets , smoke , or changes in the weather , such as cold air .
Changes you 've made :
Are you having groceries delivered because you feel winded when carrying packages or even walking around a store ?
Has your child had to sit out in gym class more often than not because of breathing difficulties ?
Asthma is more common in people with a family history of asthma or atopic diseases , so your doctor will also want to know if any of your relatives have :
Hay fever
Allergic rhinitis
Atopic dermatitis
A history of any of these conditions in a patient with symptoms compatible with asthma makes asthma much more likely .
Labs and Tests
If it is clear that your symptoms are due to asthma , your doctor may run test to help confirm a diagnosis or to get a more detailed report outlining what the problems are and how they have been resolved .
Pulmonary Function Tests
These are quick , noninvasive tests that give your doctor a sense of just how well your lungs are functioning :
Peak expiratory flow rate ( PEFR ) : PEFR is a measurement of how hard you can exhale .
This is gauged with a simple hand - held device called a peak flow meter .
﻿ ﻿ A normal PEFR is generally 80 % of your predicted or greater .
You will develop a personal best PEFR that will tell you how well your asthma is controlled .
You and your physician will develop a plan for what to do if your PEFR is below 80 % of normal .
( You may or may not be asked to take these readings at home as well as in the doctor 's office . )

Spirometry :
While there are at - home spirometers , your doctor will also perform this test in the office with more advanced equipment .
This test allows your doctor to better determine how severe your airflow obstruction may be and if you may benefit from asthma treatment .
Bronchodilation and Bronchoprovocation Tests
These tests gauge the lungs ' response to either a quick - relief asthma medication or an intentional disturbance to normal airflow .
This is usually considered if you have symptoms that suggest asthma , but you have normal spirometry testing .
Bronchodilator response : A characteristic of asthma is an improvement after treatment with a bronchodilator , a fast - acting medication .
Generally , your doctor will repeat spirometry 10 to 15 minutes after treating you with a bronchodilator .
Increases in the airflow of 12 % are considered positive and assist in making a diagnosis of asthma .

Increases in the airflow of 12 % are considered positive and assist in making a diagnosis of asthma .
Bronchoprovocation challenge testing : Just the opposite of looking for an improvement in lung function with a bronchodilator , bronchoprovocation testing attempts to provoke airflow obstruction after having you inhale an irritative substance .
This testing is usually only done if you present with atypical symptoms .
Blood Tests
There are no diagnostic blood tests for asthma .
Your health care provider may order some blood tests to help rule out other causes of your symptoms .
Requirements for Asthma Diagnosis
An asthma diagnosis requires evidence of : Presence of symptoms compatible with asthma such as cough , wheezing , or shortness of breath .
Objective measurement of decreased airflow in your lungs that either partially or completely improves spontaneously or with treatment .
Imaging
Chest X - rays are usually normal in patients with asthma , but your physician may order one if you are presenting with wheezing for the first time .
If asthma has gone undiagnosed for a long time , the chest X - ray may demonstrate hyperexpansion ( overinflated lungs ) .
Differential Diagnoses
Asthma can sometimes be very tricky , as you may experience all of the possible symptoms or not at all .
Furthermore , wheezing can accompany a number of other diseases as well .
Your doctor will consider them as they work to make a diagnosis :
Gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) : GERD may lead to wheezing and cough ; it 's also commonly responsible for nighttime asthma symptoms .
﻿ ﻿ Patients commonly experience a painful burning sensation as well as a sour or bitter taste in the back of the mouth .

Congestive heart failure :

In addition to some similar symptoms to asthma , patients have swelling in both legs and difficulty breathing while lying down .

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) : COPD usually develops after age 40 and is primarily caused by damage from smoking .
It has similar initial symptoms to asthma , such as wheezing , cough , chest tightness , and shortness of breath .
One difference between COPD and asthma symptoms is that COPD often has a typical morning cough , while asthma symptoms can occur at any time of day and often do so only with exposure to triggers .
While breathing returns to normal with asthma treatment , COPD results in a continued decline in lung function .

However , this chronic illness is also associated with poor growth and a number of other problems in early childhood .
A Word From Verywell
Being worried that you or your child has an asthma diagnosis can be a scary time .
Knowing some of the questions your doctor may ask and some of the tests that may be ordered in diagnosing asthma will help you get the most out of your doctor 's visit and alleviate some of the anxiety of the " unknown " that going to the doctor can create .
As part of an expanding programme of battlefield automation , the US Air Force has said it is now training more drone operators than fighter and bomber pilots and signalled the end of the era of the fighter pilot is in sight .
In a controversial shift in military thinking – one encouraged by the now - confirmed death of Pakistani Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud in a drone - strike on 5 August – the US air force is looking to hugely expand its fleet of unmanned aircraft by 2047 .
Just three years ago , the service was able to fly just 12 drones at a time ; now it can fly more than 50 .
At a trade conference outside Washington last week , military contractors presented a future vision in which pilotless drones serve as fighters , bombers and transports , even automatic mini-drones programmed to attack in swarms .
Contractors made presentations for " nano - size " drones the size of moths that can flit into buildings to gather intelligence ; drone helicopters ; large aircraft that could be used as strategic bombers and new mid-sized drones could act as jet fighters .
This Terminator - like vision in which future generations of fighter aces become cubicle - bound drone operators thousands of miles from conflict is already here : the deployment that began during the Bush administration has accelerated during the first seven months of Obama 's term .
Some 5,000 robotic vehicles and drones are now deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan .
By 2015 , the Pentagon's $ 230bn arms procurement programme Future Combat Systems expects to robotise around 15 % of America 's armed forces .
In a recently published study , The Unmanned Aircraft System Flight Plan 2020 - 2047 , air force generals predicted a boom in drone funding to $ 55bn by 2020 with the most exotic changes coming in the 2040s .
Last month , US Defense Secretary Robert Gates underscored the change in strategic thinking when he capped production of the F - 22 Raptor , the US air force 's most advanced interceptor , at just 187 planes , arguing that it was designed to fight 20th century super - power conflicts or " near - peer " engagements – and was not crucial to any future conflicts foreseen at the Pentagon .
In June Army General Stanley McChrystal , the top US commander in Afghanistan , said he could n't envision a day when he had enough surveillance assets .
" The capability provided by the unmanned aircraft is game - changing , " offered General Norton Schwartz , the air force chief of staff .
" We can have eyes 24/7 on our adversaries . "
Some analysts view the Flight Plan study as a virtual death knell for the pilot profession and predict the F - 22s ' successor , the F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter , could be the last piloted fighter program that is funded .
According to Oxford Analytica , the US is likely to account for 77 % of global drone research and development and 64 % of procurement over the next decade .
US firms currently control more than 50 % of the market and could gain a further 10 % over the next decade .
As US domestic approval for the " Af - Pak " conflict slips ( a new Washington Post poll found less than a quarter of the US public support sending more troops to Afghanistan ) , the reliance of drones is likely to grow , analysts say .
But with mounting civilian casualties , even as an estimated 100 Taliban militants and perhaps one half of al - Qaida leadership have been killed in drones attacks since September , there is rising Pakistani opposition to US strikes on its soil .
Prime Minister Gilani repeated his requests this week for the transfer of drone technology to the Pakistani military .
US officials have yet to publicly respond .
The air force study suggests areas of warfare too critical for automation , including dogfighting and nuclear - bombing , could eventually be handled by drones .
For now the numbers are overwhelming – 550 drone operators compared with 3,700 fighter and 900 bomber pilots – but a future in which pilots merely direct planes remotely is unsettling to many in 61 - year - old service .
" Many aviators , in particular , believe that a ' man in the loop ' should remain an integral part of the nuclear mission because of the psychological perception that there is a higher degree of accountability and moral certainty with a manned bomber , " wrote Adam Lowther in Armed Forces Journal in June .
Colonel Eric Mathewson , who directs the air force task force on pilotless aerial systems , has sought to downplay the study 's most futuristic predictions .
" We do not envision replacing all air force aircraft with UAS ( unmanned aircraft systems ) , " he says .
The CIA runs its Pakistan - focused drone programme from its headquarters in Langley , Virginia , while the air force has designated Creech AFB , 35 miles north of Las Vegas , Nevada , as centre for operations for flights over Iraq and Afghanistan .
No after - burners ; no G - Force ; no opportunity for " Top Gun " flair .
Currently , airborne drones are directed by trained pilots who then return to their assigned aircraft .
This year , the service started training career drone operators with no airborne experience – they go to war in cubicles with a computer - game joystick and eight video screens .
" It is safe to say most pilots will always miss getting back in the air , " Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Turner , who leads Predator and Reaper training at Creech , told the LA Times .
" But we see where the air force is going . "
The rapid development of drone aircraft has given smaller defence industry players , including General Atomics , makers of the MQ - 1 Predator and the new , heavily armed MQ - 9 Reaper that carries 14 Hellfire missiles and guided bombs , the chance to challenge established military contractors .
A British developer , QinetiQ , is currently developing an ultra long duration Zephyr high - altitude drone ; another , Insitu , was recently acquired by Boeing after developing the Scan Eagle , a basic aerial platform originally designed for spotting ocean - going tuna .
Last April , BAE Systems announced it has won a contract to lead the development of crawling or flying robots designed to go into areas too dangerous for troops .
General Atomics , in San Diego , has announced plans for the MQ - X , a three - in - one surveillance , attack and cargo drone .
Wonder at the sci - fi inspired technology , including the 2.3 gigapixel , Predator - mounted camera Gorgon Stare and Northrop Grumman 's high - altitude Global Hawk , is not shared on the ground where it widely viewed as cowardice .
Plans for drones that could be directed autonomously present the military with a dilemma .
Autonomous swarms of drones preprogrammed to attack on their own is , at the least , unnerving and legally problematic .
In Wired for War , author Pete Singer speculates the machines are harbingers of a new era of " cost - free war " .
In the Washington Post poll showing a majority of US public view the war in Afghanistan as " not worthing fighting " , the detached appeal of drone combat is self - evident .
" It 's a historic change , " says Singer .
" Going to war has meant the same thing for 5,000 years .
Now going to war means sitting in front of a computer screen for 12 hours .
Then you go home and talk to your kids about their homework . "
TEL AVIV
IN his global tours and TV appearances , President Obama has spoken to Arabs , Muslims , Iranians , Western Europeans , Eastern Europeans , Russians and Africans .
His words have stirred emotions and been well received everywhere .
But he has n’t bothered to speak directly to Israelis .
And the effect ?
Six months into his presidency , Israelis find themselves increasingly suspicious of Mr. Obama .
All they see is American pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to freeze settlements , a request that ’s been interpreted here as political arm - twisting meant to please the Arab street at Israel ’s expense  or simply to express the president ’s dislike for Mr. Netanyahu .
This would seem counterproductive , given the importance the president has placed on resolving the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
If Israel is part of the problem , it ’s also part of the solution .
Yet so far , neither the president nor any senior administration official has given a speech or an interview aimed at an Israeli audience , beyond brief statements made at diplomatic photo ops .
The Arabs got the Cairo speech ; we got silence .
This policy of ignoring Israel carries a price .
Though Mr. Obama has succeeded in prodding Mr. Netanyahu to accept the idea of a Palestinian state alongside Israel , he has failed to induce Israel to impose a freeze on settlements .
In fact , he has failed even to stir debate about the merits of one : no Israeli political figure has stood up to Mr. Netanyahu and begged him to support Mr. Obama ; not even the Israeli left , desperate for a new agenda , has adopted Mr. Obama as its icon .
A woman was arrested after her 14 - year - son told authorities he escaped from a home where he had spent most of the past four years locked in a wardrobe .
A security guard at a National Guard building in Oklahoma City called police on Friday after the teenager turned up malnourished and with scars and other signs of abuse , police spokesman Gary Knight said .
" He was hungry .
He was dirty .
He had numerous scars on his body , " Mr Knight said .
" It was very sad . "

The boy was taken to a hospital to be examined and then turned over to the custody of the Department of Human Services .
After police interviews , officers arrested the boy 's mother , 37 - year - old LaRhonda McCall , and a friend , 38 - year - old Steve Hamilton , on 20 complaints each of child abuse and child neglect .
Formal charges have not been filed .
The teenager , wearing only a pair of oversized shorts held up by a belt , walked up to a security guard at the Guard facility on Friday afternoon and asked where a police station was located so he could report being abused , according to a police report .
He told police that scars on his stomach and torso were from where alcohol had been poured on him and set on fire .
Other scars were from being tied up , hit with an extension cord and choked , the boy told police .
" He had scars covering most of his body , " Mr Knight said .
" They were basically from head to foot . "
The teenager told police he moved to the Oklahoma City area from New Jersey about four - and - a - half years ago after his mother was released from jail .
Since arriving in Oklahoma , he said , he had never been to school and spent most of his time locked in a bedroom wardrobe .
He told police the wardrobe door was mostly blocked with a stepladder or a bed and that he managed to push the door open enough to escape and leave the house .
Mr Knight said six other children living at the home were taken into DHS custody , but none showed signs of abuse .

A DHS spokeswoman said she could not discuss specific cases but generally an investigation would be conducted before any of the children are returned to the home or placed with other family members .
" There may be family members , but we do a diligent search , and we 're very careful about placing kids in a safe environment , " DHS spokeswoman Beth Scott said .

PHILADELPHIA -- Donovan McNabb is still not able to practice and it appears unlikely he will play this week .
McNabb , who suffered a broken rib in a season - opening win over the Carolina Panthers , is expected to miss his second straight game as the Philadelphia Eagles ( 1 - 1 ) meet the Kansas City Chiefs ( 0 - 2 ) at Lincoln Financial Field .
With the Eagles on a bye next week , resting McNabb gives him more time to heal before the Eagles host the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Oct. 11 .
McNabb was at Thursday 's practice , but only watched .
Third - year QB Kevin Kolb started last week in a loss to the New Orleans Saints and is expected to start again .
Veterans Jeff Garcia and Michael Vick , back from his league suspension , will be the backups .
Eagles coach Andy Reid has said that Vick is not ready to be a starter .
Eagles offensive coordinator Marty Mornhinweg said Thursday that Vick definitely will see action in Sunday 's game .
" He 'll play .
How much we 'll see as the week goes on , " Mornhinweg told reporters , according to The Morning Call .
" I think he 's in top physical condition .
We 'll see how he handles a few things we have in for him . "
Vick , in an interview with CBS to air Sunday , said he thought he would be a starting quarterback upon his return to the NFL .
" This is not the exact scenario I thought would play out , " Vick told CBS .
" I thought I 'd be playing with a team and actually starting . "
Vick told CBS he plans on making his second chance in the NFL last .
" I know I can play this game , " Vick said .
" I know I can play it for a long time .
I still have the speed , the quickness and the mind to run an NFL offense . "

The region has not had a proper wet season for three years
It was not hard to find the dead elephant .
The stench of the rotting carcass made it easy to track down in the sparse bush .
A young male - barely four years old and still an infant by elephant standards - lay on its side in the sand by a river .
Around its feet , the sand had been cleared in small arcs - signs of the animal 's thrashing as it struggled to stand and survive .
But there was nothing to eat .
Nothing .
On the ground , not a blade of grass existed , every green shoot had been stripped from the trees .
For Iain Douglas Hamilton , from the conservation organisation Save The Elephants , it was a heartbreaking sight .
" In all my 12 years here , I 've never seen anything as bad as this , " he said .
" The last long rains [ in April ] failed completely , and we have n't had a proper wet season for at least three years .
If the rains fail in October and November , we 'll go into total crisis .
I can't even begin to imagine how awful that would be . "
Left rotting
In all , Mr Hamilton 's organisation has counted at least 24 elephants that have died over the past two months across Samburu alone .
If the rains fail , we are all in trouble .
It 's not just going to be the animals dying .
We 'll die too , and it's not going to take long
Local herder
And like most droughts , it is the old and the young that go first .
That is a worrying trend for the conservationists .
The losses on their own would not have much of an impact on the region 's elephant populations , but when the old matriarchs die it is potentially devastating .
" If you get a large - scale mortality , and you get a lot of old matriarchs going , you lose the memory banks .
That 's the lessons the matriarchs have learned from their own mothers about things like where to go for water , " Mr Hamilton said .
" If a matriarch dies before those lessons have been handed down , and the new head of the family makes a mistake in a drought like this , it 's potentially very serious for the entire group . "
This drought , of course , is not just about elephants .
But they are an indicator species .
What happens to them points to trouble right across the spectrum .
Elephants are now being poached for their meat as well as their tusks
Other less drought - resistant animals like buffalo , warthog , hippopotami and certain species of antelope have been hit hard .
Crocodiles have been forced to migrate sometimes many kilometres in search of water .
Only the predators and scavengers are doing well .
In good times , any dead animal would be surrounded by hungry lions , hyenas and vultures .
Now most are simply left to rot in the sun .
The scavengers simply cannot consume all the meat littering the bush .
Ominous warning A few kilometres from the first elephant carcass , David Daballen , a researcher with Save the Elephants , found another dead male .
This one was the victim of poaching .
The carcass lay on its chest , its legs spread like a spatchcocked chicken - clear evidence , according to Mr Daballen , that it had been shot .
Other less drought - resistant animals have been hit hard too " It was probably killed with a couple of bullets in its head .
It would have collapsed where it stood , " he said .
The ivory had been hacked out of the 10 - year - old male , but more disturbingly , each of its feet and its trunk had been removed - clear signs that it had been butchered for meat .
" Normally you only find poaching much further from where it is now , and it looks like people are desperate and going for anything , including the meat .
This is not quite normal for people to hunt for elephant meat , " Mr Daballen said .
The clash between elephants and humans also now extends more broadly than it might otherwise have done in better times .
The Ewasa Nyiro river runs along the Samburu National Park boundary .
The park rangers say it is only ever dry for a few weeks or perhaps a month out of every year .
Now , it is a sea of bleached sand , and it has been that way for most of the past six months .
Each day , the elephants listlessly amble their way to a series of waterholes on a bend in the river .
Local herders dug the wells - perhaps two metres deep - for themselves and their livestock .
But as long as the elephants are there , the herders have to wait their turn .
An old lady is philosophical : " We have to live with the elephants out here .
When they come , they destroy the wells and fill them with sand , but what can we do ?
We all share this place . "
But she also gave an ominous warning .
" If the rains fail , we are all in trouble .
It 's not just going to be the animals dying .
We 'll die too , and it 's not going to take long . "

Police allege that he lit kerosene - doused room after mother disposed of models
Not -So -Daily Link of the Day : Police in Kasai City near Kobe have arrested a 29 - year - old factory worker named Yoshifumi Takabe on suspicion of burning down his own home on Sunday .
The suspect reportedly doused his room with kerosene and lit it with a lighter around 2:10 p.m. on Sunday .
The resulting fire eventually burned down the two - story house , which was about 250 square meters ( about 2,700 square feet ) and made partially from wood .
The police investigators say that the suspect had doused himself with kerosene , but had escaped the fire without injuries .
His 55 - year - old mother was also in the house but escaped without injuries .
According to the police , the suspect said that his mother had gotten rid of his " valuable " Gundam plastic models , so he wanted to kill himself .

Facebook ' enhances intelligence ' but Twitter ' diminishes it ' , claims psychologist
Spending time on the Facebook networking site could enhance a key element of intelligence that is vital to success in life , a psychologist has claimed , but using Twitter may have the opposite effect .
Using your imagination is boring .
That ’s the lesson of Scribblenauts , a game where you can conjure almost any item just by typing its name ; the only practical limit is your own creativity .
The game ’s puzzles are open - ended , so when you need to help a lumberjack chop down a tree , you can give him an axe , or sic termites on the tree ’s trunk and let nature do the work .
There ’s a heady excitement about this anything - is - possible premise , which leads to a letdown once it becomes clear that the reality of Scribblenauts is far more modest .
Buzz for the game has centered around its enormous dictionary , rumored to contain more than 20,000 words .
Thanks to its vocabulary , Scribblenauts seems downright magical in a five - minute demo session —
“ It has ‘ sphygmomanometer ’ !
And ‘ intergalactic wormhole ’ ! ”
The frustration comes when you try to do something with all the treasures you ’ve found in the game ’s bottomless junk drawer .
Most of Scribblenaut ’s animals , vegetables , and minerals interact in one of two ways .
Either they attempt to destroy each other , or they loiter around doing nothing .
It ’s usually the latter , so your experience is filled with ovens that do n’t bake and roosters that do n’t crow at the sun .
If you place a plumber in front of a leaky pipe and give him a wrench , he stands there scratching his head .
Either the game carries a deep cynicism toward the working class , or something is missing here .

There are occasional epiphanies , particularly in the puzzle stages , where you complete cute objectives like hatching a dinosaur egg .
( The action stages , where the goal is to retrieve “ starite ” gems , are hampered by fumbly physics that make every moving part feel like a slack - stringed marionette . )
Even the moments of success are underwhelming , though , which is baffling , because Scribblenauts looks like it should be a joy .
The aesthetics are bright , the writing is spare and pithy , and the game is n’t afraid to be silly .
So why is it such tedium ?
The reason is that Scribblenauts is n’t really about exploring your imagination , it ’s about flailing for the sweet spot on the Venn diagram where your imagination happens to overlap with the developers ’ own .
The more creative you try to be , the more often your efforts lead to a dead end .
While it ’s reassuring to find that human ingenuity is too varied to be cataloged in a tiny DS cartridge , it does n’t make for a very fun game .

Advertisement Video game developers from Iran have been exhibiting at a Western game convention for the very first time .
Representatives from the trade body , the Iran National Foundation of Computer Games , were on hand at a dedicated stand at gamescom in Cologne .
They were there to showcase the latest games developed in Iran , establish contacts , and to see if Western retailers would stock their games .
But they acknowledged the political situation would make it a challenge .
" We need more investors , " said Amir Tarbyatjoui , head of Parsan Business Development Solutions who managed the Iranian stand .
" The [ US ] sanctions do affect our industry , but they cannot stop it . "
' More potential ' Mr Tarbyatjoui said that Iran was becoming a leading player in video game development in the Middle East and that the event in Cologne was to show people just what they were capable of .
" We are using this event to promote what is happening in the Iranian games industry , " he said .
" We believe we have more potential and we want to promote that potential . "
There were a number of different types of game on offer , including a tank shooter set at the start of the Iran - Iraq war , a platform adventure set in Persia , an adventure game where you play the role of a girl called Sara ; a young student caught up in events during the early stages of the Islamic Revolution in Iran , and a role - playing game called Age of Pahlevans based on Iranian mythology .
Bahram Borgheai , head of Ras Games who make Age of Pahlevans , told the BBC that Iran has a rich history that was custom made for video games .
" Persia has been around for a very long time , " he said .
Mr Borgheai said that while most Western developers used Greek , Norse , or Roman mythology to base their games on , Iran had its own unique mythology that has rarely been used in video games .
" What we have is something quite unique and we are using the event in Cologne to show that to the world . "
Political difficulties Video - game development in Iran attracted global media attention in 2007 with the release of Special Operation 85 : Hostage Rescue .
The game saw two Iranian nuclear scientists kidnapped by Israel with players in the role of Iranian special forces sent to rescue them , while battling Israeli and American forces .
However Mr Borgheai said he doubted if it was a real game in its own right .
" We never heard about it in Iran , " he said .
" It certainly was n't released there and the first I heard about it was through the international media , " he said .
" If it was made then I would guess they just took an existing game and stuck a few textures and the like onto it ; it certainly was n't a new game . "
The group said the event in Cologne had been a success and they would be back next year , but ruled out exhibiting at the E3 Expo in Los Angeles .
" It is difficult given the relations between Iran and the USA , " said Mr Tarbyatjoui , .
" Certainly all of us here today will be at E3 next year , but there will not be a dedicated Iran stand such as you see in Cologne today . "

Nearly everyone has heard the old saying that cameras — particularly TV cameras — " add ten pounds " to their subjects .
Some people use it as a convenient excuse for those ( real ) ten extra pounds , but others believe that this claim has actual technical merit .
There 's a lot of confusion over how to explain this phenomenon , and whether it even exists in the first place , so I set out to investigate .
Do modern cameras still make us look fatter ?
Pixel myths
I went into this story based on something I was taught as an undergraduate — that video is what adds 10 pounds , not still photos , because of the type of pixels involved .
Photographs are shot in square pixels and usually displayed on square pixel screens ( your computer monitor , or occasionally printed out in square pixels ) , so they 're not susceptible to this mysterious fattening phenomenon .
Video meant for the TV screen , however , is n't shot in the same way .
Both NTSC and PAL pixels are rectangular ( or non-square ) , and I was told that this is the reason why people look wider on TV .
After all , if their images are being stretched horizontally , why would n't they ?
After digging around a bit , I learned that I was n't the only one taught this at some point in my life .
It turns out that there are a number of reasons why this is wrong , at least on the NTSC side ( NTSC is what we use here in the US ) .
Yes , NTSC pixels are non-square , but they 're not oriented horizontally — they 're taller than they are wide .
Additionally , the video is typically shot and displayed in NTSC , meaning that most of the time , there 's opportunity to " stretch " the image in either direction — what you see is pretty much what you get .
PAL pixels , on the other hand , display at an aspect ratio of 1.066:1 , meaning that they are wider than they are tall .
Still though , if a video is shot in PAL and displayed in PAL , there should be no stretching .
If it 's shot in square pixels for whatever reason , though , and then converted into PAL , there could be some potential for those ten TV pounds to show up .
Optical illusions
More realistically , the explanation for the 10 extra pounds lies behind our eyes .
For one , cameras have varying focal lengths , and most consumer cameras will slightly distort people in an image depending on where they are standing and how the photographer is holding the camera .
As pointed out by Slate in 2007 , wide - angle lenses have a short focal length that make the person in the center look both taller and wider , while those on the edges get the short end of the stick and just look wider .
Cameras can also easily flatten a three - dimensional object into an unflattering two - dimensional space , tricking your eyes into thinking that a subject is spreading out by reducing depth while maintaining width .
When it comes to video , though , even professionally produced videos can play tricks on the eyes from time to time .
Video professional and Ars reader Mike Watson entertained my barrage of questions on this topic , telling me that much of the video shot in a 4:3 aspect ratio does n't show you the world the way you 're used to seeing it .
" Your eyes are placed on your face horizontally , so you get a ' widescreen ' view of the world , " he said .
" TV — specifically , NTSC — is nearly square ( 4:3 ) , so you are significantly modifying your view of the world , not just by ' zooming in ' and isolating the TV in your view , but also by changing your entire perspective . "
Watson said that it's not hard to see how your brain might try to compensate for this by stretching things out a little , therefore making people look wider .
( Of course , this explanation does n't really take into account the proliferation of widescreen TVs and , subsequently , widescreen - formatted HD video . )
In the end , though , most video pros ascribe the visual 10 pounds to bad lighting and bad angles .
Light projected straight onto the subject ( like , say , with a camera flash or some other amateurish lighting set up ) will only help the camera flatten — and fatten — someone 's image .
Touching up photos to emphasize shadows can help , but better lighting from the get - go will do much more to flatter subjects .
Or , they could just lose 10 pounds and come out even .
Drive like a sheep , and you get stuck .
Break some rules here and there for the good of traffic flow , and everyone benefits .
A new traffic study by physicists at Sweden 's Umea University found that while we 're all taught to obey the traffic rules no matter what , doing so just makes for bottlenecks .
Mix in some maverick drivers , however , and suddenly , logjams begin to ease as the percentage of drivers willing to pass on the right or zip past a pack of trundling cars on a two - lane actually help to keep the traffic flowing smoothly .
While you might take the findings as an endorsement of behind - the - wheel jerkdom , chill out there for a second , Rat Fink .
Tailgating , a behavior many impatient motorists exhibit , creates rolling platoons of cars without enough following distance to effectively brake if need be .
In other words , while it 's occasionally beneficial to sidestep the letter of the law , following too closely creates potential pile - ups .
The ideal ratio seems to be 60 - percent lemmings , 40 - percent speed - addled free thinkers .
That sounds like research we can put into practice pretty much immediately , though it 's going to be a flimsy argument in traffic court .

This is the one irrefutable lesson of the entire post - war period , contradicting the notion that rigid government controls are essential to economic development .
The societies that have achieved the most spectacular , broad - based progress are neither the most tightly controlled , nor the biggest in size , nor the wealthiest in natural resources .
No , what unites them all is their willingness to believe in the magic of the marketplace .

About
Journalists from The New York Times and The International Herald Tribune ( along with a few dedicated fans ) are following the Grand Slam tournaments , on and off the court .
They will provide updates , insights , links and analysis while setting the scene from the stands as well as the press room .
Although evangelicals have always been a minority in the US , evangelical Christianity is now widely regarded as the paradigmatic American religion .
In the late 20th century , evangelical Christianity expanded beyond its traditional base in the South and among marginal groups to fill the ecological once occupied by dying mainline denominations .
As evangelical Christianity went upmarket it changed to suit the tastes of its new middle - class adherents , who had no stomach for the rhetoric or style of the hardline religious right .
And so new generation evangelical mega-churches , like Rick Warren 's Saddleback Church , in affluent , suburban Orange County , California , arose to offer these new customers the middle - brow banality and shopping mall glitz they preferred .
Progressives , keen for support from religious believers – designated by the Obama administration as " people of faith " and presumed to be evangelicals – reached out to them but never quite trusted them .
The liberal elite , many a generation or more removed from religious practice themselves , regarded people of faith as irremediably other : an alien tribe on good behaviour which could , at any time go back to its racist , gay - bashing , anti-environmentalist ways .
When anti-government protesters disrupted town hall meetings and took to the streets , progressives reflexively fingered people of faith .
There was , however , little evidence of religious themes at the tea parties , anti-government demonstrations or town hall meetings disrupted by protesters packing heat .
Retirees on medicare protested against the proposed " government takeover " of healthcare .
Children carried signs demanding school vouchers .
Protesters attacked Obama as a socialist and as a fascist , but did not seem to care that he was – since his break with the impossible Rev Wright during the fall campaign – unchurched and showed no signs of joining any church .
If there was any one theme behind protesters ' free - floating hostility it was visceral hatred of government as such .
This was political conservatism American style , encapsulated by Reagan 's motto that government was the problem , not the solution .
Republicans never promised voters good government because according to the fundamental assumption of American political conservatism , no government was good government .
Indeed , they assured Americans that their aim was , as conservative activist Grover Norquist put it , to shrink government " down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub . "
The religious right will , no doubt , look for ways to turn this popular sentiment to their advantage .
Evangelical churches operate as businesses and make their living by satisfying consumer demand .
When the US government enforced school integration mandates , the religious right established a system of segregated " Christian academies " throughout the South in response to the demand by white parents for segregated schools .
When , within a generation , racism became an embarrassment to Americans , conservative evangelicals shifted their attention to sexual politics .
Religion in America is at once pervasive and powerless .
For Americans , half of whom have changed their religious affiliation at least once during their lifetimes , religion is a consumer choice .
We shop for churches that suit our lifestyles , appeal to our tastes and support our agendas .
When they do not suit us we take our business elsewhere – or start new churches .
In the US religion does not drive politics : politics determine Americans religious consumption choices .
Evangelical Christians did not push American politics to the right .
The religious right emerged in response to consumer demand , and so long as the demand for conservative politics and policies exists , evangelical churches , Republican demagogues and others who exploit the conservative working class – another American peculiarity – will turn a profit .
So please do n't blame us people of faith for 30 years of conservative misrule and the collapse of the world economy .
We did n't do it .

The World Bank yesterday issued its clearest warning to date that development efforts in poorer nations will be derailed without a huge increase in funding for climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts .
The Bank 's annual World Development Report warns that even if the G8 group of industrialised nations achieves its target of limiting global warming to two degrees above pre-industrial levels , the increase in global average temperatures will still result in shrinking levels of GDP for many African and Asian countries .
In a move that is likely to bolster the negotiating position of emerging economies , such as China and India , World Bank president Robert Zoellick echoed their view that the onus was on rich nations to deliver an " equitable deal " at the upcoming UN climate change conference in Copenhagen that acknowledges their historic responsibility for global warming .
" Developing countries are disproportionately affected by climate change - a crisis that is not of their making and for which they are the least prepared , " he said .
The report recommends that by 2030 rich nations will need to invest $ 400 bn a year to help developing nations cut emissions through the adoption of new low carbon technologies and $ 75 bn a year to help them adapt to the impact of climate change , in addition to the hundreds of billions of dollars of R&D investment that will be required to develop cost - effective clean technologies .
The scale of the sums involved are an order of magnitude higher than those currently being considered by many rich nations .
For example , to date the only offer of climate change investment made as part of the Copenhagen process is UK prime minister Gordon Brown 's proposal that rich nations invest $ 100 billion a year to help poorer nations cut emissions .
Justin Lin , World Bank chief economist , warned that without increased investment from developed economies poorer nations would find themselves unable to cope with the impacts of climate change .
" Developing countries , which have historically contributed little to global warming , are now , ironically , faced with 75 to 80 per cent of the potential damage from it , " he said .
" They need help to cope with climate change , as they are preoccupied with existing challenges such as reducing poverty and hunger and providing access to energy and water . "
The report also claims that such investments will make economic sense for industrialised economies , arguing that the cost of addressing climate change will only rise as " more and more investments are made in the wrong kinds of infrastructure and energy " .
The report is likely to be welcomed by green groups , many of whom have long complained that the World Bank has been guilty of undermining investment in low carbon technologies in the developing world by favouring carbon intensive projects .
For example , the bank has faced consistent criticism for funding coal projects and it recently suspended investment in the palm oil sector after an investigation found that it had provided financing to a company allegedly linked to rainforest deforestation .
The Bank said that it has improved its record of investment in clean technologies , increasing financing for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects in developing countries by 24 per cent in the fiscal year 2009 to over $ 3.3 bn , a record high .
It added that renewable energy and energy - efficiency projects last year made up over 40 per cent of the $ 8.2bn of energy financing provided by the bank , although critics will point out that 60 per cent of fina ncing is still funnelled into conventional energy projects .
New Charles Darwin film is ' too controversial ' for religious American audiences
A new British film about Charles Darwin has failed to land a distribution deal in the States because his theories on human evolution are too controversial for religious American audiences , according to the film 's producer .
Creation follows the British naturalist 's ' struggle between faith and reason ' as he wrote his 1859 book , On The Origin Of The Species .
The film , directed by Jon Amielm was chosen to open the Toronto Film Festival and has now been sold to almost every territory in the world .
Dynasty : Martha West , daughter of The Wire star Dominic , will star alongside Paul Bettany as Charles Darwin in Creation Well received :
But new film Creation is deemed too controversial for American audiences and has failed to land a distribution deal in the States
But US distributors have turned down the film that could cause uproar in a country that , on the whole , dismisses scientific theories of the way we evolved .
Christian film review website Movieguide.org described Darwin as ' a racist , a bigot and a 1800s naturalist whose legacy is mass murder . '
The site also stated that his ' half - baked theory ' influenced Adolf Hitler and led to ' atrocities , crimes against humanity , cloning and generic engineering . '
Jeremy Thomas , the Oscar - winning producer of Creation , said he was astonished that such attitudes exist 150 years after On The Origin of Species was published .
' That 's what we 're up against .
In 2009 .
It 's amazing , ' he said .
Naturalist : Charles Darwin
' The film has no distributor in America .
It has got a deal everywhere else in the world but in the US , and it 's because of what the film is about .
People have been saying this is the best film they 've seen all year , yet nobody in the US has picked it up .
' It is unbelievable to us that this is still a really hot potato in America .
There 's still a great belief that He made the world in six days .
' It 's quite difficult for we in the UK to imagine religion in America .
We live in a country which is no longer so religious .
But in the US , outside of New York and LA , religion rules .
' Charles Darwin is , I suppose , the hero of the film .
But we tried to make the film in a very even - handed way .
Darwin was n't saying " kill all religion " , he never said such a thing , but he is a totem for people . '
Earlier this week it was revealed how the daughter of The Wire star Dominic
West will have her own taste of stardom thanks to the film .
Martha West , 10 , will join co-stars Paul Bettany and his wife Jennifer Connelly at the British premiere of Creation , a film about Charles Darwin .
Making her film debut , Martha plays Darwin 's daughter Annie , whose death pushed him towards writing about natural selection in The Origin Of Species .
She won the role after attending open auditions at the suggestion of her father 's agent - despite the British actor 's initial misgivings .
West , who plays Detective Jimmy McNulty in the cult American crime series , said : ' It 's not something I 'd instantly want my children to do , but she 's always wanted to act .
' I took her to the audition so she could see what a nightmare it is and she blew the doors off . '
The film 's director , Jon Amiel , said : ' I only found out after I cast her that she was Dominic West 's daughter .
' It tends to indicate that talent for acting could possibly be genetic - something I 'm sure Mr Darwin would have something to say about . '
Martha is West 's child with his former partner , Polly Astor .
They split when she was a toddler but will both accompany her to the West End premiere at the Curzon Mayfair .
New LSI Controllers Plus 16 X25 - E Flash SSDs Equal 3.4 GB/s !
In late July , we published the article Breaking Records With SSDs : 16 Intel X25 - Es Do 2.2 GB/s , which we created after being encouraged by this YouTube video .
It is a fun bit of documentation on the initial project that was tackled by Paul Curry , who , like us , went through the efforts for the purpose of promoting decent SSDs .
The goal was to illustrate unprecedented storage throughput .
Although we were lucky enough to deliver even better performance numbers on our SSD RAID array ( 16 Intel X25 - E SSDs versus 24 Samsung PB22 - J drives ) , we were n’t really satisfied , and decided to do some more testing using other HBAs and RAID controllers .
Intel and LSI came to the rescue , supplying the latest MegaRAID 9210 - 8i ( Intel RS2BL080 ) and 9260 - 8i cards .
Man the battle stations !
More Bandwidth , Please
The 2.2 GB/s result we achieved already sounds pretty impressive , but some simple math reveals that this number could even be higher , since each of the 16 Intel X25 - E flash SSDs is realistically able to provide more than 220 MB/s of throughput .
The theoretical maximum for our array should be somewhere around 3.5 GB/s , which is 60 % more than what we ’ve reached so far .
Clearly , we were looking at some sort of bottleneck .
Platform ?
Check .
Our platform , a Supermicro X8SAX X58 motherboard and an Intel Core i7-920 2.66 GHz quad - core processor with 3 GB DDR3 - 1333 memory , is definitely fast enough to support higher bandwidth numbers .
After all , we used two x16 PCI Express 2.0 slots for the controllers .
Each of the 16 lanes is able to serve up 250 MB/s bi-directionally , providing up to 4 GB/s each way on the first generation of PCI Express .
On the X58 platform with PCIe 2.0 , this is doubled to 8 GB / s.
Clearly , the platform was n’t the issue .
Controllers ?
Replaced !
We initially used Adaptec ’s 5808 cards , which are high - performance RAID HBAs offering balanced performance and a plethora of software - oriented features , used to manage the RAID array .
One of our very first checks was the potential bandwidth of these cards , since they employ eight PCI Express 1.1 lanes to interface with the system .
But two cards running eight times 250 MB/s still results in 2 GB /s each , or 4 GB /s total .
Between two cards , we should have had enough available bandwidth .
But it turns out that we did n't .
We replaced Adaptec ’s popular 5 - series RAID 5805 cards with two LSI controllers .
We decided to use LSI ’s latest HBA and RAID products instead .
LSI sent us its latest MegaRAID 9260 - 8i cards , which are SAS 6 Gb/s boards .
In addition , Intel became intrigued by the possible performance gains and provided two other cards , namely LSI ’s 9210 - 8i , which it also sells under the Intel brand , named RS2BL080 .
These are n’t yet available , and they do n’t come with a powerful XOR engine , cache , or kick - butt enterprise features .
But both cards are among the first HBAs to utilize PCI Express 2.0 , which effectively doubles the interface bandwidth using eight PCIe lanes .
With this hardware , we were pretty darned confident that we’d be able to break our earlier performance numbers — and we did !
President Obama presented the Presidential Medal of Freedom to 16 people at the White House on Wednesday , among them the first African American to win a Best Actor Oscar , Sidney Poitier .
Calling Poitier — who won a Best Actor Oscar for 1963 ’s " Lillies of the Field " and a nomination for 1959 ’s " The Defiant Ones " — an " ambassador and actor , " the president in a statement said he " has left an indelible mark on American culture .
" Rising from the tomato farms of the Bahamas , his talent led him to Broadway , Hollywood , and global acclaim .
In front of black and white audiences struggling to right the nation ’s moral compass , Sidney Poitier brought us the common tragedy of racism , the inspiring possibility of reconciliation , and the simple joys of everyday life .
Ultimately , the man would mirror the character , and both would advance the nation ’s dialogue on race and respect , " said the president .
Among others recognized by Obama were physicist Stephen Hawking , Sen . Ted Kennedy , Billie Jean King , former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor , the late Harvey Milk , Bishop Desmond Tutu and actress / singer / dancer Chita Rivera .
" These outstanding men and women represent an incredible diversity of backgrounds , " Obama said .
" Each saw an imperfect world and set about improving it , often overcoming great obstacles along the way . "
Obama described Rivera as having " captured America ’s imagination with her magnetic presence and radiant voice . "
Over a career that has spanned a half - century , Rivera — who gained fame as Anita in the Broadway version of " West Side Story " — has received two Tony Awards , six additional Tony nominations and the Kennedy Center Honors Award .

A personal phone call and the absence of a supervisor during last week 's collision over New York 's Hudson River has led to two air traffic controllers being removed from duty , although officials said the actions probably had no impact on the tragedy .
The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement Thursday that a controller at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey and his supervisor have been placed on administrative leave after the controller was found to be involved in " apparently inappropriate conversations " at the time of the crash between a small plane and a tour helicopter that killed nine people .
The agency said while there was no reason to believe thus far that the employees ' actions contributed to the accident , such " conduct is unacceptable . "
The controller had handed off the monitoring of the small plane involved in the collision to another airport shortly before the plane collided with a tour helicopter .
The two employees , who were not identified , were placed on administrative leave with pay .
The FAA said it has begun disciplinary proceedings against the pair .
Three members of a Pennsylvania family on the plane and five Italian tourists and a pilot on the helicopter were killed when the two stricken aircraft plunged into the river .
The FAA said the supervisor was not in the building at the time , as required .
The controller had cleared the small plane , a single - engine Piper , for takeoff and then made a personal call to a woman , said sources familiar with the investigation , who asked not to be named because they were n't authorized to speak publicly .
While still on the phone , the controller handed off the Piper to the control tower at Newark Liberty International Airport , which monitors low - flying air traffic over the Hudson but does n't actively try to keep aircraft separated , they said .
The controller was still on the phone when the accident occurred .
This sequence of events lasted only a few minutes .
National Transportation Safety Board and FAA investigators learned of the telephone conversation earlier this week while examining recordings of telephone calls on a landline phone in the tower that controllers use to communicate with other parts of the Teterboro Airport .
The controller and supervisor were removed from duty immediately .
Air traffic controllers are expected to be alert at all times while on duty and typically are given about a 15 - minute break roughly every two hours for that reason .
The National Air Traffic Controllers Association , the labor union representing controllers , said in a statement that it supports a full investigation of the allegations " before there is a rush to judgment . "
The FAA 's action came as an amateur video surfaced that captured the moment of impact between the two aircraft .
The images , taken by an Italian man practicing with a new camera while on a boat tour , show the helicopter flying overhead when suddenly a single - engine plane appears behind it , apparently climbing and turning .
The plane clips the helicopter 's rotor blades , and a wing shears off .
Debris rains down , and the plane flips .
Both aircraft fall toward the water .
On the video , aired Thursday on " NBC Nightly News , " one or more onlookers can be heard in the background saying , " Oh , my God ! " Teterboro Airport , located directly across the Hudson River from New York City near the George Washington Bridge , handles corporate and private aircraft .
It is operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and handles nearly 200,000 flights a year .
Earlier this week , I posted links to several old margarine commercials , including a Blue Bonnet ad in which French chefs declared “ no difference ” when comparing the taste of industrial vegetable goo to real butter .
This demonstration made such an impression on the French , they immediately continued their habit of putting real butter in pretty much everything .
Compared to Americans , the French consume four times as much butter , three times as much pork and 60 % more cheese .
Their overall consumption of saturated animal fat is double ours .
Since the experts have told us over and over that saturated fat will clog your arteries , the heart - attack rate in France must be higher than the Eiffel Tower , right ?
Wrong .
The heart - disease rate in France is about one - third the rate in the United States and United Kingdom , in spite of the fact that the rate of smoking in France is also 10 % higher .
Since everyone knows saturated fat causes heart disease , the experts refer to this as the French Paradox — and for years , they ’ve been falling all over themselves to explain it away .
First they blamed the paradox on all that red wine .
Yes , that must be it … animal fat will kill you , but red wine protects you !
Just one little problem : people consume even more red wine in countries like Hungary and the Czech Republic , where the heart - attack rate is three or four times higher .
So the experts tried blaming the French Paradox on vegetables .
Animal fats will kill you , but not if you eat eggplants and peppers !
But again , there ’s a problem : it does n’t hold true around the world .
The heart - attack rate in the vegetarian region of India , for example , is nearly twice as high as in the region where most people eat meat .
No meat , lots of vegetables , but lots of heart attacks too … how embarrassing .
With wine and vegetables unable to excuse the paradox , the experts next assigned magical powers to garlic .
Perhaps cholesterol was originally spread to humans by vampires and is therefore repelled by garlic .
That theory looked promising until clinical trials concluded that garlic merely tastes good … assuming it ’s properly roasted or sautéed .
Clearly , there must be some untested but uniquely French trait or behavior that protects arteries from the well - known clogging effects of saturated fat .
So in the interest of both science and personal health ( I do , after all , eat a lot of saturated fat ) , I ’ve decided to try making myself a bit more French … or at least more French - like .
Here are some ideas I ’m considering testing to see if they protect my heart :
Adopting more cultured table manners .
Through a bit of online research , I discovered that table manners in France are similar to the American version , but with a few significant differences .
To be more French - like , I will :
Keep my hands on the table instead of in my lap .
I have no idea where this tradition started .
Perhaps after the Norman conquest , French lords sitting down to dinner in their newly - acquired English estates learned the hard way that a hand under the table could be holding a dagger .
If you are reasonably sure your dinner guests have no intention of stabbing you , your stress level will be lower — and we all know stress can cause heart disease .
Place the bread on the tablecloth , not on my plate .
I do n’t eat bread , so I ’m more than happy to leave more room on my plate for the meat and vegetables .
Place my napkin on my lap only after the lady of the house does .
That ’s fine by me too , even if my wife forgets to place a napkin on her lap .
For the past five years , pretty much every spill that ’s landed on my lap had to travel all the way across the table from the general direction of wherever my daughters were sitting .
If I ’m paying attention , I can usually get out of the way .
Peeing in public .
Travel sites warn Americans not to be shocked by the sight of French men relieving themselves on the street .
As someone who often made the mistake of drinking an Iced Venti Americano shortly before driving off and getting stuck in L.A. traffic , I think the French have the right idea here .
Trying to create a vise grip with your thighs as traffic inches along and joggers pass by is extremely stressful .
And there ’s no telling what all those unreleased toxins are doing to your body .
Sunbathing topless at the beach .
I would n’t do this for years .
Yes , I know French women are comfortable doing it , but for much of my life , I had bigger boobs than they did .
That ’s not the case anymore , and I believe soaking up some extra vitamin D may protect against heart disease .
Stretching the lunch hour to three hours .
I ’ve never actually done this , because I ’ve always avoided government jobs .
But since I ’m self - employed and work at home , there ’s nothing to prevent me from closing my office door from noon until 3:00 and taking a nice nap after lunch .
If my blogging becomes less frequent , please be patient ; I ’m only trying to protect my heart .
Watching Jerry Lewis movies .
This may be the hidden key that has eluded serious - minded researchers .
Laughter is a great stress - reducer and releases feel - good hormones .
The only trouble is , I ca n’t find any Jerry Lewis movies at the video store .
I suspect , however , that the heart - healthy benefits do n’t derive from watching Jerry Lewis specifically … just someone goofy , spastic , clueless , and inept .
So I ’m going to substitute watching the House of Representatives on C - SPAN .
Speaking in a breathy , sexy , accented voice .
Many years ago , I worked as a computer geek in an office where one of the employees had transferred in from Paris .
She was always impeccably dressed , tastefully perfumed , and perfectly coiffed .
We had occasional conversations that went something like this :
( In a breathy , accented voice ) “ Hellohhh , Tohhhm .
How was your luhhhnnnch ? ”
“ Yes , I ’d be honored to marry you and bear your children ! ”
( In a breathy , accented , slightly alarmed voice ) “ Par - done moi ? ”
“ Oh , sorry … old Yankee expression .
It means lunch was quite good , thank you . ”
Perhaps breathing deeply to load the lungs for speaking oxygenates the blood and lowers blood pressure .
I tested this theory last night by speaking to my wife using a breathy French accent .
She responded by looking over my shoulder with obvious concern .
When I asked what was wrong , she explained that she was waiting for some Chinese guy to leap from the closet and karate - chop me .
Kissing business associates on the cheek .
I spent ten years in Hollywood , so I ’m used to people kissing each other ’s cheeks to get ahead .
The French version is , if anything , more pleasant and easier on the back .
Either way , physical affection is known to have healing properties .
I plan to test this theory the next time I sign a contract for a programming gig .
Keeping a mistress .
This one makes perfect medical sense .
With a wife and a mistress , you ’d get double the exercise .
And there ’s another advantage : in a very French , open - mistress situation , you can tell your wife you ’re spending the evening with your mistress , tell your mistress you ’re spending the evening with your wife , then go to a sports bar and watch Monday Night Football .
However , I wo n’t be testing this theory .
I explained it to my wife , and she assured me that several recent studies concluded that keeping a mistress is actually associated with a significantly shorter lifespan , especially in my case .
There is one other theory about the French Paradox that I might eventually get around to testing :
While the French consume a lot more animal fat than we do , they also consume about 5 % as much sugar — and almost no vegetable oils , apart from olive oil .
Vive la France .
May she always be a poke in the eye to the nutrition experts .
QUITO : The US and Venezuela have accused each other of triggering a possible arms race in South America through military deals seen as destabilising the region .
The US Secretary of State , Hillary Clinton , said in Washington : '' We have expressed concern about the number of Venezuelan arms purchases … Certainly [ they ] raise the question as to whether there is going to be an arms race in the region . ''
But the Venezuelan Foreign Minister , Nicolas Maduro , said during a meeting in Ecuador that an imminent US deal to use seven Colombian bases was the real cause for concern .
'' How can the Secretary of State say Venezuela is involved in an arms race when it is her country installing seven military bases ? ''
Mr Maduro asked .
The two issues dominated the meeting in Ecuador of the foreign and defence ministers of the 12 countries that make up the fledgling Union of South American Nations ( UNASUR ) .
Pro/Cons about Werkzeug , WebOb and Django
Yesterday I had a discussion with Ben Bangert from the Pylons team , Philip Jenvey and zepolen from the pylons IRC channel .
The topic of the discussion was why we have Request and Response objects in Werkzeug , WebOb and Django and what we could to to improve the situation a bit .
We decided on writing down what we like or dislike on these three systems in order to find out in which direction to go , so this is my attempt .
Please keep in mind that this are my opinions only !
WebOb Let 's start with WebOb which is the smallest of the three libraries in question .
WebOb really just sticks to the basics and provides request and response objects and some data structures required .
The philosophy of WebOb is to stay as compatible to paste as possible and that modifications on the request object appear in the WSGI environment .
That basically means that when you do anything on the request object and you create another one later from the same environment you will see your modifications again .
This is without doubt something that neither Werkzeug or Django do .
Both Werkzeug and Django consider the incoming request something you should not modify , after all it came from the client .
If you need to create a request or WSGI environment in Werkzeug you get a separate utility for , that is designed for exactly that purpose .
While I have to admit that the idea of a reflecting request object is tempting , I do n't think it 's a good idea .
Using the WSGI environment as a communication channel seems wrong to me .
The main problem with it is that WebOb cannot achieve what it 's doing with standard environment keys .
There are currently five WebOb keys in the environment for “ caching ” purposes and for compatibility with paste it also understands a couple of paste environment keys .
The idea is that other applications can get a request again at a completely different point , but I 'm not sure if WSGI is the correct solution for that particular problem .
Reusable applications based on the complex WSGI middleware system seems to be the wrong layer to me .
Some other parts where I do n't agree with the WebOb concepts :
The parsing of the data is implemented either in private functions or directly in the request object .
I strongly prefer giving the user the choice to access the parser separately .
Sometimes you really just need a cookie parsed , why create a full request object then ?
WebOb uses request .
GET and request .
POST for URL parameters and form data .
Because you can have URL parameters in non-GET requests as well this is misleading , for POST data it 's wrong as well because form data is available in more than just POST requests .
Accessing request .
POST to get form data in a PUT request seems wrong .
and for URL parameters and form data .
Because you can have URL parameters in non-GET requests as well this is misleading , for POST data it 's wrong as well because form data is available in more than just POST requests .
Accessing to get form data in a PUT request seems wrong .
WebOb still uses cgi .
FieldStorage and not only internally but also it puts those objects into the POST dict .
This is not the best idea for multiple reasons .
First of all users are encouraged to trust their submitted data and blindly expect a field storage object if they have a upload field in their form .
One could easily cause trouble by sending forged requests to the application .
If logging is set up the administrator is sent tons of error mails instantly .
I strongly prefer storing uploaded files in a separate dictionary like Django and Werkzeug do .
The other problem with using FieldStorage as parser is that it's not WSGI compliant by requiring a size argument on the readline function and that it has a weird API .
You can't easily tell it to not accept more than n bytes in memory and to switch between in memory uploading and a temporary file based on the length of the transmitted data .
Also cgi .
FieldStorage supports nested files which no browser supports and which could cause internal server errors as well because very few developers know that a ) nested uploads exist and b ) that the field storage object behaves differently if a nested uploaded file is transmitted .
and not only internally but also it puts those objects into the dict .

Also WebOb barks on invalid cookies and throws away all of them if one is broken .
This is especially annoying if you 're dealing with cookies outside of your control that use invalid characters ( stuff such as advertisement cookies )
Now to the parts where WebOb wins over Django and Werkzeug : Unlike Django and Werkzeug WebOb provides not only a unicode API but also a bytestring based API .
This could help existing applications that are not unicode ready yet .
Downside is that with the current plans of Graham for WSGI on Python 3 there do not seem to be ways to support it on Python 3 .
WebOb supports the HTTP range feature .
The charset can be switched on the fly in WebOb , in Werkzeug you set the charset for your request / response object and from that point nowards it 's used no matter what .
In Django the charset is application wide .
An interesting thing is that WebOb uses datetime objects with timezone informations .
The tzinfo attribute is set to a tzinfo object with an UTC offset of zero .
That 's different to Werkzeug and Django which use offset - naive datetime objects .
Because Python treats them differently and does not support operations that mix those .
Unfortunately the datetime module makes it hard to decide what to do .
Personally I decided to use datetime objects that have no tzinfo set and only dates in UTC .
Werkzeug
In terms of code base size Werkzeug 's next .
The problem with Werkzeug certainly is that it does not really know what belongs into it and what not .
That situation will slightly improve with the next version of it when some deprecated interfaces go away and when the debugger is moved into a new library together with all sorts of debugging tools such as profilers , leak finders and more ( enter flickzeug ) .
Werkzeug is based on the principle that things should have a nice API but at the same time allow you to use the underlying functions .
For example you can easily access request .
form to get a dict of uploaded form data , but at the same time you can call werkzeug .
parse_form_data to parse the stuff into a multidict .
You can even go a layer down and tell Werkzeug to not use the multidict and provide a custom container or a standard dict , list , whatever .
Also Werkzeug has a slightly different goal than WebOb .
WebOb focuses on the request and response object only , Werkzeug provides all kind of useful helpers for web applications .
The idea is that if there is a function you can use , you are more likely to use it than that you reimplement it .
For example many applications take the uploaded file name and just create a file with the same name .
This however turns out to be a security problem so Werkzeug gives you a function ( werkzeug.secure_filename ) you can use to get a secure version of the filename that also is limited to ASCII characters .
So obviously there is a lot of stuff in Werkzeug you probably would not expect there .
So here some of the things I like especially about Werkzeug : The request / response objects .
They are designed to be lightweight and can be extended using mixins .
Werkzeug also provides full - featured request objects that implement all shipped mixins .
Also the request / response objects are not doing any parsing or dumping , that is all available through separate functions as well which makes the code readable and easy to extend .
It fixes many problems with the standard library or reimplements broken features .
It does not depend on the cgi .
FieldStorage since 0.5 , allows you to limit the uploaded data before it 's consumed .
That way an attacker cannot exhaust server resources .
since 0.5 , allows you to limit the uploaded data before it 's consumed .
That way an attacker cannot exhaust server resources .
The data structures provide handy helpers such as raising key errors that are also bad request exceptions so that if you 're not catching them , you are at least not generating internal server errors as long as the base HTTPException is catched .
is catched .
Werkzeug uses a non-data descriptor for the properties on the request and response objects .
The first time you access the property code is executed and that is stuffed into the dict .
After that there is no runtime penalty when accessing the attributes .
And of course here the list of things that are not that nice :
It 's too large for a library that only wants to implement request and response objects .
There is no support for if - range and friends .
The response stream is useless because each write ( ) ends up as a separate “ item ” in the application iterator .
Because each item is followed by a flush it makes the response stream essentially useless .
ends up as a separate “ item ” in the application iterator .
Because each item is followed by a flush it makes the response stream essentially useless .
The MultiDict is unordered which means that some information is lost .
is unordered which means that some information is lost .
The response object modifies itself on __call__ .
This allows some neat things like automatically fixing the location header , but in general that should happen temporarily when called as WSGI application instead of modifying the object .
Django Now Django is n't exactly a reusable library for WSGI applications but it does have a request and response object with an API , so here my thoughts on it : URL arguments are called request .
GET like in WebOb , but files and form data was split up into request .
POST and request .
FILES .
like in WebOb , but files and form data was split up into and .
The request object is unicode only and the encoding can be set dynamically .
Problem is , they do n't work with non-Django WSGI applications .
I have given a lot of time to those Americans answering the call of the conservative movement … and spent equal time on those sounding the “ call to arms . ”
I have talked about American conservatism …some of its history , its roots … and the direction it appears to be headed .
But it was n’t until last night that I was finally able to find an answer to a question that had been eluding for the last year .
Let ’s see if you know the answer :
If today ’s Republicans and conservatives realize that they do not have the public support to win an election … and many acknowledge that the party / movement needs to be more inclusive to women , minorities , and moderate or independent voters … then why do they CONTINUE to perform actions which will CLEARLY and OBVIOUSLY alienate all but the most conservative members of our society ?
I mean … I know that some of the Republicans and Conservative figures that I see on television are neither ignorant , nor unintelligent .
I may disagree them on particular issues , but I can plainly see that some conservative voices are reasonably intelligent and educated people …so I am all the more perplexed when I see them continue to take their movement , and their political party , down the cultural equivalent of a dead - end street .
… when an Hispanic Supreme Court Justice is nominated … they chose to attack her ethnicity , and some even went so far as to call her a racist .
They use “ illegal immigrants ” as the punchlines of jokes and as their rationale for inexcusably xenophobic positions .
So much for bringing Latinos into the fold … and a few women were n’t too happy about the way Sotomayor was treated either …
… first African - American President ?
Some make race - based attacked ( many posing as something else , but a child could see through the innuendos ) … and send emails with racist pictures / cartoons in them .
Many choose to defend wingnuts claiming the President is n’t an American citizen , and therefore not the President … and yes , he too , they call a “ racist . “
Do n’t see a lot of African - Americans lining up to be “ card - carrying Republicans . ”
… both politicians and pundits make comparisons between the administration and “ national socialism ” ( aka Nazism ) , and direct comparisons to Hitler , the holocaust , and the “ Final Solution . ”
This …disgusts nearly every Jewish person in the country with any knowledge of history and the events of WWII - era Germany , as these insane references to the worst part of the Jewish peoples ’ history are an INSULT to people whose ancestors lived through ( or died during ) those events .
… some Republicans open advocate people “ using their Second Amendment rights ” to protect their liberties against a non-existent government effort to thwart them .
Others defend the racists and fanatics , disrupting what should be peaceful town hall gatherings .
Some make jokes , or tongue - in - cheek suggestions that people need to “ rise up ” and “ take back ” their country “ by any means necessary “ … others refuse to condemn the latest inexcusably false , slanderous , or simply un-American statement to issue forth from Rush Limbaugh , Glenn Beck , Ann Coulter , or Michelle Malkin .
And moderates and independents … shake their heads and walk away .
… they frequently denounce anybody who is pro-choice , in favor of gay rights , is non-Christian , or who supports any positions of the Democrats and the President , calling these people “ amoral , ” or “ confused , ” or “ part of the problem with this country . ”
And more people walk away …
… they shoot down any program designed to help the lower or middle class …calling it handouts , or moaning about “ entitled Americans . ”
Simultaneously , the oppose any program that would take one more dollar from the wealthiest one percent , or from any of America ’s richest corporations .
There goes the middle class …wave good - bye .
And watching them …it almost looks like a compulsion .
It ’s as if they CAN ’T HELP but drive these people away .
That ’s when I realized .
They ca n’t help themselves .
I wo n’t belabor the point , as I have discussed it at length before , but the conservative movement used to be led by FISCAL CONSERVATIVES .
They espoused lower taxes , less government , less government interference in your private life , less government interference in private companies , and more global diplomacy / involvement towards the expansion of the American economic empire .
These conservatives … allowed all other kinds of conservatives to sit at the table .
For example , the fiscal conservatives did n’t agree with the social conservatives that government should control social “ values “ … they did n’t even agree on what all of the “ values ” should be …but they welcomed the social conservatives ’ support .
All the other varieties were also welcomed , along with moderates and independents : “ crunchy ” conservatives , constitutionalists , libertarians , cultural conservatives , traditionalists .
It was not a requirement that members of this “ coalition ” agree on all points … just that a person ’s leanings were to the right .
This group , with its own norms and hierarchies …was very successful .
Then …the social conservatives took the seat at the head of the table .
This was through a rather Faustian bargain … some realized that there was a massive , previously - untapped voting bloc , and that by catering to the social conservatives who had built - in mobilization apparatus ( ie. churches ) , a wealth of the country ’s devoutly religious citizens , many seniors , and others could be brought into the voting booths … many could be swayed by a natural evangelical style of charismatic speaking and the cultivated passions and emotions of their adherents .
Many could be inspired by appeals to faith , and God , and “ family values . ”
So , the fiscal conservatives , whose principles attracted voters but who could n’t inspire the same zealousness and energy , ALLOWED the social conservatives to take the lead …
At first … this strategy worked brilliantly , and the numbers of the conservative movement swelled .
But it could n’t last , and for one simple reason : while fiscal conservatives could tolerate different kinds of conservatism , different priorities , and those with different levels of commitment to conservative issues … social conservatives CAN NOT .
In the words of one such conservative , they believe “ you are either with us , or against us . “
Now in control of the movement , the social conservatives would start to purge all members who would not fall into lock - step with their tenets .
In fact , while the fiscal conservatives were quite adept at foreign policy ( which they approached from a business perspective ) , the social conservatives like to claim the same … but they actually completely inept at it ( they , of course approach it from a social perspective ) , since they despise any country that disagrees with us , and think that people who differ from Americans in any way ( culturally , politically , religiously , are even in the way they dress ) are “ wrong , ” and “ strange , ” and “ enemies . ”
So in theory … today ’s Republicans would love to have what they call a “ big tent ” with lots of diversity .
But there is a pretty strong caveat : if you do n’t agree with them that abortion should be illegal , capital punishment should stay legal , all illegal immigrants should be kicked out of the country , all Americans should be Christians ( and all American leaders , too ) , gays … should choose not to be gay , and that we should use military power to bring Christianity and Democracy to every country in the world … well , then YOU ARE NOT WELCOME .
These are not the only things you must agree with them on …the litmus test is LONG and UNFORGIVING , and those who do not pass it are not counted among their ever - dwindling circle of friends .
It reminds me of when I attended a fundamentalist church for an extended period of time .
I was shocked that they routinely condemned Methodists , Baptists , Catholics , Episcopalians … they would tell crude jokes and make wildly negative ( and usually false ) assertions about almost EVERY other Christian denomination .
I thought this was so odd .
I had been raised Presbyterian , and did n’t remember anybody ever saying an unkind word about any other Christian church .
But to the fundamentalists … everyone else was “ wrong , ” “ part of what is ruining America , ” “ evil , ” and they should be “ taught the truth so that they can be saved . ”
I tried mentioning to them that these other denominations had much more in common with them , and that the only differences were mostly matters of “ ritual procedure ” and nuances of scriptural interpretation … but my words fell on deaf ears , because they could only accept people who COMPLETELY agreed with them , and unquestioningly did so .
And like today ’s Republicans … these fundamentalists just could n’t understand why their numbers kept shrinking .
So the reason for their predicament is clear … but the solution is not easy .
The social conservatives … must be “ dethroned ” and another group of conservatives who will allow people who differ on points of religion , social values , and individual issues will have to take center stage .
The moderates and independents will only come back … when they are PERMITTED to come back , and to hold onto their own set of values and priorities .
And until that day …we will be forced to continue to watch conservatives and Republicans shrink until all that ’s left are its most unreasonable and fanatical members .
A pair of unusual stars known as DI Herculis has confounded astronomers for three decades , but new observations by MIT researchers and their colleagues have provided data that they say solve the mystery once and for all .
It has long been clear that there was something odd going on in this double - star system , but it was n't clear just what that was .
The precession of the orbits of the two stars around each other — that is , the way the plane of those orbits change their tilt over time , like the wobbling of a top as it winds down — seems to take place four times more slowly than established theory says it should .
The anomaly is so unexpected that at one point it was seen as possible evidence against Einstein 's long - accepted theory of relativity .
But the true explanation seems to be much less radical , though still unique among observed stars .
Both of them , it turns out , are rotating tipped over on their sides , relative to the plane of their orbits around each other , instead of straight upright like most binary stars .
Because stars rotate fast enough to have significant equatorial bulges ( just like on Earth , which is wider at the equator than pole - to - pole ) , these tipped - over bulges produce an unusual tidal interaction between them that counteracts the forces that would normally cause the expected rate of precession , and that accounts for the observed slowing of this effect .
And so , relativity has dodged another bullet .
" It 's been a riddle for 30 years , " says MIT postdoctoral researcher Simon Albrecht , co-author of a new paper appearing in the Sept. 17 issue of Nature that describes the solution .
New observations of the stars , which are about 2,000 light years from Earth but orbit each other with a separation of only about one - fifth the distance from the Earth to the sun , were carried out by Albrecht , assistant professor of physics Joshua Winn , and others .
Using a high - resolution spectrograph called Sophie on a 1.93 - meter telescope at the Observatoire de Haute - Provence in France , they found an answer to the mystery .
The new observations , after detailed analysis , reveal that one of the two stars is tipped over by at least 70 degrees from the vertical , and the other is tipped the opposite way by more than 80 degrees .
One lesson of this finding , says Winn , is to " check your assumptions . "
The more astronomers learn about the details of stars and planetary systems , the more odd variations keep turning up .
" Everyone always assumed that planets orbit in the same plane as their star 's rotation , " until some recent discoveries of exceptions to that rule , " and that binary stars are aligned .
These assumptions are just not true . "
The assumption has been that binary stars should always have their spin axes aligned , because they are believed to have formed from a single swirling cloud of dust and gas , whose direction of rotation should be inherited by the resulting stars .
Now that this drastically misaligned pair of stars has been found , theorists might be forced to rethink how such binary systems form .
" Maybe most binary stars are formed misaligned , " but then most of them become aligned as a result of their gravitational interaction , Winn says .
Or maybe it 's the opposite : most form aligned and some become tidally disturbed and lose their alignment .
Other star and planet systems are " certainly more dynamic than we would have guessed , based on our solar system orbits , " Albrecht says .
It 's also possible that these two stars formed separately and one was captured by the gravitational attraction of the other after a close encounter , but Albrecht says that is unlikely , because the stars are near - twins .
" These are so similar in mass and lifetime that we would n't expect that , " he says .
The work was carried out in collaboration with Sabine Reffert of the Zentrum fur Astronomie in Heidelberg , Germany , and Ignas Snellen of the Leiden Observatory in the Netherlands ( where Albrecht earned his PhD ) .
It was partly supported by grants from NASA 's Origins program , the Optical Infrared Coordination network , and a Rubicon fellowship from the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research .
The Top 10 Craziest Things Ever Said During a U.N. Speech
From the impassioned to the provocative to the truly bizarre , here are the 10 most unforgettable remarks to come out of General Assembly speeches in the past seventy years .
An Indian Diplomat Filibusters Himself to ( Near ) Death
Year : 1957
Quote : “ The Security Council regards this as a dispute .
It is not a dispute for territory .
There is only one problem before you … that problem is the problem of aggression . ”
Impact : With this epic filibuster during a debate on Kashmir , Indian U.N. envoy Krishna Menon holds the record for the longest speech in the history of the U.N. Security Council .
In total , it lasted over eight hours .
Menon actually collapsed from exhaustion partway through and had to be hospitalized .
He returned later and continued for another hour while a doctor monitored his blood pressure .
Castro Goes Long
Year : 1960
Quote : ” Were Kennedy not a millionaire , illiterate , and ignorant , then he would obviously understand that you cannot revolt against the peasants . ”
Impact :
He ’s not quite in Menon ’s league , but Cuban President Fidel Castro ’s debut speech at the U.N. clocked in at four and a half hours , the longest ever in the General Assembly .
Castro ’s first visit to the United States in 1959 had been a bit friendlier , but by 1960 he was firmly in the Soviet camp and used his speech to blast U.S. imperialism and insult John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon , the U.S. presidential candidates at the time .
Castro provided another bizarre memory from that year ’s assembly by keeping live chickens in his hotel room .
Krushchev Puts His Foot Down
Year : 1960
Quote : “ Mr. President , call that toady of American imperialism to order . ”
Impact : Soviet Premier Nikita Krushchev provided one of the Cold War ’s most iconic moments when , in an attempt to silence a Filipino delegate who was railing against Soviet imperialism , he issued the above epithet , removed his shoe , and began banging it on the table .
The gesture has become a classic example of overheated rhetoric , but it should n’t have been all that surprising coming from the man who famously warned , “ We will bury you . ”
Lodge Spies a Bug
Year : 1960
Quote : “ It so happens that I have here today a concrete example of Soviet espionage so that you can see for yourself . ”
Impact : Colin Powell famously used a vial of “ anthrax ” while trying in vain to win Security Council support for military action in Iraq , but there are times when props have been used a bit more effectively .
During a debate over the shooting down of an American U - 2 spy plane over Soviet territory , U.S. Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge decided to go on the offensive .
He took out a wooden seal that had been presented to the U.S. embassy in Moscow by the Soviet - American Friendship Society and then proceeded to extract a tiny microphone out of the eagle ’s beak with a pair of tweezers .
The Soviet resolution condemning the U.S. spy flights was defeated .
Arafat Preps for Battle
Year : 1974
Quote : “ An old world order is crumbling before our eyes , as imperialism , colonialism , neocolonialism , and racism , whose chief form is Zionism , ineluctably perish . ”
Impact : The Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman was invited to address the General Assembly for the first time at the request of the non-aligned movement , a coalition of developing countries that has been historically critical of Israel in the U.N. , Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat took the stage wearing fatigues and delivered a blistering attack on Zionism .
One year later , the notorious “ Zionism equals racism ” was passed and Israel ’s relations with the U.N. have been , at best , uneasy ever since .
Ortega Goes Rambo on Reagan
Year : 1987
Quote : “ Before consulting the hotheads who present various military options such as a military invasion : remember , President Reagan , Rambo only exists in the movies . ”
Impact : Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega used the platform of the U.N. to assail U.S policy in Central America , particularly the financing of the Contra rebels and supporting the Somoza dictatorship , which Ortega said “ bled the Nicaraguan people dry . ”
The angry speech prompted a walkout from the U.S. delegation .
“ The people of Nicaragua may have to sit and listen to him , but I do n’t , ” said then U.S. Ambassador Vernon Walters .
Chavez Sniffs out a Sinner
Year : 2006
Quote : “ The devil came here yesterday , and it smells of sulfur still . ”
Impact : Venezuela ’s theatrical president , Hugo Chavez , has always loved the spotlight that the General Assembly provides and it was never more in evidence than when , with a flourish , he compared U.S. president , George W. Bush , to Satan .
Chavez also began his regular habit of using his speeches to plug books by prominent leftists authors , when he held up a book by U.S. professor Noam Chomsky .
Chavez referred to this famous moment in his speech this year , saying that it “ no longer smells like sulfur ” now that Barack Obama is president .
Bashir Denies a Genocide
Year : 2006
Quote : “ The picture that volunteer organizations try to give in order to solicit more assistance and more aid , have given a negative result . ”
Impact :
At the 2006 speech , Sudanese President Omar al - Bashir claimed that the ongoing slaughter in Darfur , which then President George W. Bush had recently referred to as “ genocide , ” was in fact a scheme cooked up by Western aid organizations to solicit funding .
On the sidelines of the meeting , Bashir went further , blaming Israel and Zionist organizations for spreading lies in order to weaken the Sudanese government .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has made this claim as well .
Ahmadinejad Hates on Zionists
Year : 2008
Quote : “ The dignity , integrity and rights of the American and European people are being played with by a small but deceitful number of people called Zionists .
Although they are a minuscule minority , they have been dominating an important portion of the financial and monetary centers as well as the political decision - making centers of some European countries and the U.S. in a deceitful , complex and furtive manner . ”
Impact : Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has regularly used the UN as a platform to rail against Western powers , particularly his arch - enemy Israel .
In his 2008 speech he accused “ the Zionist entity ” of an array of crimes including causing the South Ossetia war .
Another notable feature of Ahmadinejad ’s speech is the heavy use of religious rhetoric and his use of Shiite religious teachings .
What is Qaddafi Doing ?
Year : 2009
Quote : “ It should not be called a security council , it should be called a terror council . ”
Impact : After 40 years in power , Libyan Leader Muammar al - Qaddafi spoke to the United Nations for the first time at this year ’s general assembly and certainly made up for lost time .
In his 100 minute speech , Qaddafi listed half a century ’s worth of grievances and conspiracy theories including accusing the Untied States of developing swine flu and questioning the official record of the Kennedy assassination .
Most of Qaddafi ’s wrath was reserved for the U.N. Security Council , which he likened to al Qaeda .
Qaddafi ’s accommodations provided another sideshow at this year ’s assembly , as the Libyan leader was rebuffed in his attempts to set up a Bedouin tent in several New York - area locations before finally making up camp in Donald Trump ’s backyard .

Businesses that are " going green " are becoming more and more commonplace .
Regardless of your political beliefs or opinions regarding the " global warming " concept , few can argue that being environmentally aware will leave the world a better place .
Whether a company is simply jumping on the green bandwagon , or are honestly sensitive about environmental issues is really irrelevant .
Consumers like green businesses , and shaping your business to promote being " eco-friendly " makes sense from a public relations standpoint .
Not surprisingly , many businesses that have taken the steps to " go green " are also discovering that going green often saves them another kind of green ( as in the " money " kind of green ) .
For example , consider hotels that are allowed by long - term guests to only launder sheets and towels every other day rather than every single day .
The hotel is presenting an environmentally - friendly face , while at the same time saving money on their bottom line .
They save in both staff time and cleaning materials by laundering less frequently , and all while presenting an environmentally - concerned image for their company .
There are a number of steps that almost any business can take to become more environmentally - friendly .
Here are just a few ...
Power Management & Conservation Encourage energy conservation throughout the company .
Be sure that offices are equipped with energy - efficient light bulbs , and purchase equipment and supplies that conserve power .
Encourage staff to turn off lights and equipment in offices and conference rooms when they are not in use .
Telecommuting
Cut travel costs by using virtual conferencing tools .
When feasible , allow employees to telecommute ( work from home ) on certain days or a number of days per week .
Statistics show that employees who telecommute are actually more productive , and work longer hours than those who commute to an office each day .
Telecommuting can also reduce a company 's " carbon footprint " .
A carbon footprint refers to the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses your choices create .
Printing & Recycling Encourage your staff to recycle .
Provide recycling bins for soda and drink containers .
Encourage staff to use the back side of old printed materials for notes and scratch paper .
Use double - sided printing for reports , and use a digital infrastructure that allows documents to be transferred digitally to reduce printing costs .
Corporate motives can be questioned , but it really does n't matter whether a company truly cares about the planet , or if they are " going green " simply for a cost savings .... because no matter what the motives , at the end of the day green businesses will help leave the planet a healthier place for future generations .
When you go camping , the rule is to always leave the campsite in better shape than you found it .
The same could be said for the environment , and what a legacy for a generation to leave .
Rarely does a business go green as a result of social consciousness , but that does not diminish the fact that being green can also generate green ( money ) .
Take tangible steps to make your company more environmentally - friendly .

Maria Alejendra , a factory worker in the suburbs of Buenos Aires , Argentina , spends her days cutting pieces of rawhide at the Huesitos de Wilde Cooperative .
Along with the 33 other original workers at the dog treat factory , Alejandra now makes twice as much money — 2,000 pesos a month — as she did under her former boss .
Alejandra , 41 , who has worked at the factory for 14 years , is now able to listen to music and drink maté , a South American herbal tea , while she works .
The Huesitos de Wilde Cooperative is just one of more than 250 worker - recovered businesses in Argentina , which employ a total of 13,000 workers .
Part of a broader effort to recover factories , which started after the country ’s economic collapse in 2001 , the workers at Huesitos de Wilde first occupied the factory and took over production in January 2007 .
Though Argentina ’s economy has improved since the crash , the current economic downturn has caused a recent increase in factory take overs , with a significant uptick since February .
Nearly 20 factories have been occupied since 2008 , and 33 new cooperatives have been officially registered with the government in the past few months .
While the government readily grants businesses cooperative status — there are currently some 10,000 cooperatives in Argentina — gaining this recognition is the first step for the few hundred recovered enterprises that wish to be worker - run .
However , the government has yet to recognize the legal right of any of these recently recovered businesses to exist .
While cooperative enterprises do allow workers a greater role in company decisions , workerrecovered businesses allow employees to reclaim lost jobs , as well as receive the same wages and equally participate in management decisions , as is the case with Huesitos de Wilde .
Workers who seek to recover a business from their owners are faced with numerous challenges .
In addition to often lacking management experience , the struggle to find start - up money and maintain a profitable business can often sideline reclaimed enterprises .
The workers at Huesitos de Wilde were offered guidance by an array of groups , including the Argentine Workers Center , a trade - union federation .
“ Once we were taught , we came back to take over the factory , ” Alejandra said .
Reclaiming factories that have been abandoned by owners provides workers with a way to counter the self - interest of some employers , according to Marie Trigona , a journalist and filmmaker who has worked with Free Speech Radio News and Z Magazine .
Businessmen often exploit crises by declaring bankruptcy so they can set up shop elsewhere and hire cheaper labor or invest their money in more lucrative projects , Trigona said .
While Argentina has provided business owners with the option to run cooperatives since the late 19th century , the country ’s road to an option such as worker - run enterprises has not been an easy one .
Argentina ’s history has been plagued by neoliberal policies , such as widespread privatization , deregulation and cutbacks in social services .
Prior to the military coup of 1976 , Argentina was one of the wealthiest nations in Latin America .
It was the envy of the developing world , with strong labor laws and an unemployment rate of 4.2 percent .
But after seven years of brutal military dictatorship — which were marked by widespread torture and the “ disappearance ” of 30,000 political opponents — followed by a string of pro-free market governments , these progressive policies were eroded .
By the 1990s , Argentina was viewed by the West as a poster - child for embracing neoliberal policies championed by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund .
But when the speculation - driven economic bubble of the 1990s burst in December 2001 , the country ’s banking system collapsed .
Business owners declared bankruptcy , fired scores of workers and moved their money offshore , resulting in a capital flight of $ 18.7 billion in 2001 .
Argentine civil society responded through popular revolt against the government and economic elite .
Tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets and toppled four governments in a matter of weeks .
Factory takeovers were commonplace , and violent clashes with police led to dozens of civilian deaths over the next several years .
In 2002 , the unemployment rate was 25 percent , with another 20 percent of workers underemployed and 60 percent of the country living in poverty .
Workers began taking over factories in an attempt to reclaim their livelihoods .
Argentina ’s economy began recovering from the collapse in 2003 .
From 2003 to 2008 , for “ most recovered factories , the priority was growing economically , finding capital , or raising capital through work .
Most of them have done pretty well , while others have just survived , ” said Esteban Magnani , who has worked extensively with the recovered - business movement in Argentina and is the author of The Silent Change : Recovered Businesses in Argentina .
By early 2007 , more than 170 businesses were worker - run , though the vast majority were not recognized by the government as legal businesses .
Members of the Huesitos de Wilde Cooperative credit La Base , the Argentine - based counterpart of the U.S. micro-finance organization The Working World , as well as the broader community of groups that support worker - run cooperatives , with the factory ’s continued success .
This support network proved to be invaluable when the workers returned to the factory to reclaim it and discovered that most of the plant ’s machinery had been removed .
With help from the Employees and Supervisors Union and a $ 15,000 loan from La Base , the workers were able to buy back the equipment before it was sold at the auction block as well as purchase raw materials .
But the process was far from easy .
For many months , workers went without paychecks , and only 33 of the original 200 workers chose to remain in the cooperative .
Of the workers that left , some have found work while many are still unemployed .
The Working World , founded by Brendan Martin in 2004 , offers collateral - free loans with no enforcement mechanism for repayment .
While the interest rates on the loans given to Huesitos de Wilde range from 10 to 18 percent , the repayment rate for all Working World loans is 98 percent .
Though the Huesitos de Wilde Cooperative has managed to keep its factory doors open , the workers still do not own the property .
They could be evicted at anytime .
While Huesitos de Wilde only received preliminary approval last February under the law of expropriations , they must continue producing so they can pay off the debt owed by the former owner , thus keeping them in a state of legal limbo until they receive final approval and can be granted ownership of the factory .
According to Magnani , while the state has indicated that expropriation laws , which would provide cooperatives with legal permission to use owner assets , might be enacted , the legal support provided by this legislation would be weak .
“ The future of the recovered factories , both the new and the old , is still uncertain , ” Magnani said .
“ Of the older ones , just a few have managed to get the property of assets . ”
Despite the challenges facing the workers at Huesitos de Wilde , the state of worker - run cooperatives in the United States is still far behind Argentina .
Late last year , more than 250 fired workers at the Republic Windows and Doors factory in Chicago held a successful six - day sit - in demanding vacation and severance pay .
While the factory remains open after recently being purchased by California - based Serious Materials , a company that manufactures green building supplies , only 15 of the workers have been able to return to work since May , as production has been slow .
Serious Materials hopes that an infusion of federal stimulus funds for weatherization will increase demand for the company ’s products and allow them to re-hire all 250 workers .
Though the workers did consider the possibility of taking over the factory themselves , Mark Meinster , a representative of United Electrical Workers , the union to which the Republic workers belong , told The Indypendent earlier this year that the lack of a recovered - factory movement in the United States made this an unlikely possibility .
“ The fact that no real movement of worker - run enterprises exists in the U.S. makes this option much more difficult at this point , ” Meinster said .
Despite the current global recession , the Huesitos de Wilde Cooperative is thriving , and has recently hired eight more employees .
The workers remain optimistic , regardless of their lack of legal ownership of the factory .
“ The truth is that you can work without a boss .
We have learned that you can continue … and you can succeed , ” Alejandra said .

A shocking scene that would n’t look out of place in the darkest days of Nazi Germany – welcome to Amerika in 2009
Paul Joseph Watson

Friday , September 25 , 2009
It ’s a shocking scene that would n’t have looked out of place on the streets of Nazi Germany or Maoist China in humanity ’s darkest historical period – a protester is shoved into an unmarked car by military thugs and driven away to whatever Godforsaken fate awaits him .
And yet this is America in 2009 , where the First Amendment is now officially a criminal offense and people who dare exercise it are attacked and abducted by military police in broad daylight .
The video shows an unmarked gold Sedan drive up to a side street near Baum Ave & S Millvale Ave. in Pittsburgh .
Men in military fatigues wrestle with the protester as other men in cammo exit the vehicle .
The protester is shoved forcefully into the car as the military thugs follow him in and the car speeds away .
Watch the clip below .
Protesters scream “ what the fuck is wrong with you ” as the Sedan disappears into a cloud of tear gas .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
In another You Tube clip , the man with the red bandana seen protesting as the other man is abducted is subsequently arrested by riot cops , presumably merely for voicing his displeasure at the disgraceful scenes he witnessed .
“ Some guy just got chased down and thrown in a car for no reason , ” states the camerawoman before the shot focuses in on the man with the red bandana , who is being manhandled and arrested by three riot cops .
“ Why are you doing that , what did he do ? ” asks the woman .
Other protesters chant “ let him go ” as media photographers attempt to find out his name .
The clip finishes with a another burst of the sound cannon being used against demonstrators .
Another You Tube clip features the image that is re-posted at the top of this story and asks people to try and identify the military police and riot cops who kidnapped the demonstrator .
These videos require no more explanation , they speak for themselves .
Riot cops and military personnel driving around in unmarked cars kidnapping American citizens off the streets for the crime of exercising their First Amendment .
There can be no more debate , America as we knew it is officially dead and buried .
The U.S. is more of a police state than Communist China .
The only free speech that still exists is on the Internet , in the form of You Tube videos that remind us of what we already knew – the whole country has been hijacked and looted by a criminal gang of globalists who are using their cadre of enforcer thugs to crush any form of opposition to their agenda .
Our only hope is that when the world witnesses scenes like this , it will act as a wake - up call and prevent the planet from sliding once again into tyranny .
Only the most deluded and brainwashed individual can now deny the threat that faces us all when police and military show such contempt for the Constitution that they swore an oath to protect and defend .

Howard .
Featuring original cover art by Penguin Art Director Paul Buckley , these stunningly creepy deluxe hardcovers will be perfect additions to the shelves of horror , sci-fi , fantasy , and paranormal aficionados everywhere .
The Thing on the Doorstep and Other Weird Stories Howard Phillips Lovecraft 's unique contribution to American literature was a melding of traditional supernaturalism ( derived chiefly from Edgar Allan Poe ) with the genre of science fiction that emerged in the early 1920s .
The Thing on the Doorstep and Other Weird Stories brings together a dozen of the master 's tales -- from his early short stories " Under the Pyramids " ( originally ghostwritten for Harry Houdini ) and " The Music of Erich Zann " ( which Lovecraft ranked second among his own favorites ) through his more fully developed works , " The Dunwich Horror , " " The Case of Charles Dexter Ward , " and " At the Mountains of Madness . "
The book presents the definitive corrected texts of these works , along with Lovecraft critic and biographer S. T. Joshi 's illuminating introduction and notes to each story .

Research into cannabinoids shows promise
[ DROP_CAP_00 ]
Sue was dying of cancer .
She was thin , her skin was gray , and she had n?t eaten much in several days .
Offered a medication to relieve some of her symptoms , she reluctantly accepted .
Within five minutes of taking this medication , she again had color in her cheeks , was laughing with friends and asking for a fruit smoothie .
It was the first of several she would request that day and her grateful husband was only too glad to oblige .
What was this miracle drug ?
What many call marijuana , pot , or weed , the medical community calls cannabis .
Cannabis contains approximately 70 different active ingredients called cannabinoids , only a few of which are psychoactive .
THC ( tetrahydrocannabinol ) is the most well - known psychoactive cannabinoid , and due to years of breeding , THC currently accounts for up to 25 percent of the total weight of the prepared herb .
Another well - known cannabinoid is CBD ( cannabidiol ) , which is not psychoactive but currently represents only about 0.5 % of the herbal weight .
In many well - designed scientific studies , these and other cannabinoids appear to be therapeutic .
The 1999 Institute of Medicine Report clearly stated that ?
accumulated data indicate a potential therapeutic value for cannabinoid drugs , particularly in the areas of pain relief , control of nausea and vomiting and appetite stimulation .?
Research in the past 10 years has revealed much more .
The International Cannabinoid Research Society held its 19th annual symposium in St. Charles , Ill. , in July , sponsored by the NIH , the National Institute on Drug Abuse and several pharmaceutical companies , among others .
This symposium brought together reputable scientists from 25 nations and over 100 research labs to share new findings .
These researchers have long recognized the use of cannabinoids for a wide array of symptoms that include nausea and vomiting , pain management , muscle spasticity , anxiety , depression , post - traumatic stress syndrome , inflammatory bowel disease and insomnia .
< NO1 >< NO >< NO1 >< NO > Cannabinoids are naturally recognized in the bodies of animal species all the way down to invertebrates .
In humans , CB1 receptors are found in the brain , and CB2 receptors are found throughout the immune system .
These receptors couple with the body ?s own internally produced cannabinoids , in addition to coupling with inhaled or ingested cannabis .
Startling news about cancer and cannabinoids was recently published by Donald Abrams , MD , Chief of Hematology - Oncology at San Francisco General Hospital and Manuel Guzman , PhD , Professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Complutense University in Madrid , Spain .
These experts found that cannabinoids inhibit tumor growth and also appear to specifically kill tumor cells without affecting cells that are still healthy .
Tumor cells that have been shown to be sensitive to cannabinoid - induced growth inhibition include leukemia / lymphoma , skin , uterus , and breast , gastric , colorectal , pancreatic and prostate carcinomas .
The safety profile of cannabinoids is impressive : unlike opiates , cannabinoids do not affect areas in the brain that control breathing .
The lethal ( LD50 ) dose of inhaled cannabis has been estimated to be 1,500 pounds smoked in 15 minutes .
The psychoactive qualities of THC limit effective medicinal use in many patients , so development of strains that contain less THC and more CBD is being encouraged .
It does appear that whole - plant use is more effective than isolating and using any single cannabinoid .
Even used medicinally , cannabis comes with some cautionary advice .
The psychoactive effects are not necessarily welcomed , and the patient must consider local laws when traveling outside tolerant states such as California .
Inhaling the herb smoke can cause irritation of the airways , although there has been no evidence to date that cannabis increases the incidence of respiratory cancer .

Your reaction to the retraction of a job offer may determine whether the offer is ever returned .
Marleen Graham has been offered two different jobs in the past few months -- but both offers were retracted .
The first time , she worked for a small consulting firm and the contract for the account she worked was cut short .
A couple of days later , the account requested to bring her back on board .
After filling out some paperwork , she waited -- and waited , and waited -- to start work again .
Two months later , she figured out that the account imposed a hiring freeze .
The second time , she was told verbally that a bank wanted to hire her and that it was a " done deal . "
She waited two weeks for an offer letter .
Finally , Graham received an e-mail stating that the job was placed on hold indefinitely .
" The first time I was very disappointed because I really wanted to return to my contract assignment .
The second time I was in disbelief because the vice president told me it was a done deal , " Graham says .
" I wish that I continued searching for a job while I was waiting for my offer in writing and for the paperwork to be approved .
I should have kept my search going so that I could have a fallback plan . "
Fired before you 're hired
Graham , like many other job seekers , fell victim to a trend that 's becoming more common as the economy continues to stagnate .
While companies downsize and institute hiring freezes , job seekers are finding start dates pushed back and job offers withdrawn completely .
" Job offers are rescinded for a variety of reasons .
Some [ are ] external , such as the overall economy , some [ are ] internal such as a department 's funding is cut , " says Laura George , author of " Excuse Me , Your Job is Waiting . "
" There are also times when it 's determined that a person is needed but it would be more cost - effective to hire one person to work in two or more departments and spread the costs . "
No matter the reason your job offer is repealed , experts agree that you should respond to the situation in a professional manner and get to the bottom of what happened .
" If your offer has been rescinded , you must find out what the exact reasons behind the decision were .
Were they economically based or due to a background , drug or reference check ? " says Jonathan Mazzocchi , partner and general manager of the New York accounting and finance division of Winter , Wyman .
" As hard as it is , gather the facts .
Try to separate the people you interviewed with from the organization 's decision , and keep all of your interactions professional . "
In Graham 's case , for example , when the first offer was revoked , the company never explained what was going on ; they just said the paperwork was in and they were waiting .
In the meantime , she lived off her savings and put her job search on hold .
The second company , which told her the job was placed on hold " indefinitely , " said they would keep her mind for the future , but she has n't heard anything yet .
" Once I found out that my offer was no longer viable , I quickly started to search for another position , but it was more difficult to find something by that time , " she says .
Now what ?
Unfortunately , you do n't have many legal rights in this situation .
Most states have employment - at - will policies , which means employees can be terminated at any time , for any reason .
You should think long and hard before pursuing legal action if a job offer is revoked -- litigation costs will be extensive and you will undoubtedly burn bridges with your would - be employer .
Consult an HR expert or lawyer in your area about your options .
It 's important to handle the situation professionally if you find yourself with a rescinded job offer .
Here are six steps you can take to protect yourself :
1 . Find out why
Find out the exact reason behind the withdrawn offer .
Ask the potential employer if it was something revealed in a reference check or if it had something to do with the economy .
" Let the hiring manager know you are interested in working at the company if there are a change of circumstances , " George says .
" If you really are the best candidate , the hiring manager will contact you when the circumstances change . "
2 . Be open and honest
" Once you 've got a company that wants to hire you , you 've cleared the tallest hurdle .
How you react [ to a rescinded job offer ] can determine if that offer might return , " says Jim Luzar , president of Sales Consultants of Brookfield , a recruiting firm .
" Be open and honest with [ the employer ] about your situation .
If you are still interested in the job , let them know your finances .
Can you wait six months to start ? "
Or , if you can find a way to earn some money in the interim , let the employer know you will wait for the full - time position .
" If you simply can't wait for the position to re-open , do n't be shy about it , " Luzar says .
" You came looking for a job because you needed one .
Respectively tell them so that if you are looking for a job again in the future , they will still have a high opinion of you . "
3. Prepare yourself
" In this economy , expect anything , " says Carolyn Dougherty , executive search consultant .
Do not stop looking for work until your first day at a new job .
Graham says the biggest lesson she learned was that nothing is a done deal until you are sitting in your new office or cubicle .
4 . Do your homework
Before accepting a job offer , it 's important to evaluate what 's been offered .
Ask about the employer 's financial health and find out if the position is approved , Dougherty suggests .
Ask if the company has ever withdrawn an offer and if so , what the company has done in the past .
If the withdrawal of a vacant position is a real threat , ask if your offer letter can state what the company will do if the job offer is withdrawn .
5. Negotiate
If you left an old job to work for a new company and your offer was retracted due to the economy , you can try to negotiate unemployment benefits or a severance package from the employer , Mazzocchi says .
Or , if you really want this job , you can try negotiating for a lower salary or position .
" Some companies may opt to help you out as the right thing to do , " he says .
6. Move on
If nothing comes from negotiating with your would - be employer , it 's time to move on .
Contact companies who have expressed interest in the past and let them know you are still available , suggests Roberta Chinsky Matuson , president of Human Resource Solutions .
Whatever you do , resist the temptation to badmouth the organization that pulled back your offer .
In the meantime , Graham keeps busy by continuing her job search , going to school to maintain and enhance her skills , volunteering with nonprofit organizations and growing her own business .
" It is important to maintain your positivity in spite of the circumstances .
Know that something viable will eventually come your way if you do n't give up . "

After years of storing radioactive waste on the the moon massive nuclear explosions tore the moon out of Earth ’s orbit on September 13th , 1999 — on this very day ten years ago .
Earlier in 1994 previous concerns resulted in the closing Nuclear Disposal Area
One on the moon , however with the boom economy that followed after the global war of 1987 all the now obvious warning signs were overlooked .
As of today 3,648 days have passed since this event , and numerous attempts have been made to contact the 311 crew members of Moonbase Alpha — whose fate is still unknown at this time .
Of course as you may have figured out by now the above paragraph is pure science fiction taken directly from the plot of the TV show Space : 1999 .
In my youth Space : 1999 was one of my favorite shows , and I currently find myself saddened living in a 21st Century that looks quite primitive to the world that I watched on my black - and - white TV set back in 1975 .
Back then I was too young to catch the original Star Trek series growing up , but in the early 70s I found myself discovering Trek re-runs as if they were new .
But after having watched every old episode of Star Trek coming across Space : 1999 which was a new series was like a breath of fresh air .
Space :1999 only lasted two years , but over 30 years later it still holds up as a special memory of my childhood .
Sadly for the producers of the show the second and final series of Space : 1999 wrapped up about a year before Star Wars came out in 1977 .
And after that point making a science fiction TV series seemed like a very good idea , but in those short two years from 1975 until 1976 Space : 1999 was the coolest thing out there in a world that lacked any science fiction shows in prime time .
The show looked great because it took so many visual cues from 2001 : A Space Odyssey which almost resulted in a lawsuit — but of course if you ’re going to steal why not steal from the very best ?
And what Kubrick did on that film was the best , and still holds up today in this fanboy ’s opinion .
Also to be fair that superficial similarity overlooks what Gerry and Sylvia Anderson brought to the series with all of their years of experience from having created shows like UFO and Thunderbirds .
I ’ll also say this about Gerry and Sylvia Anderson : Unlike a high budget film it takes a great deal of creativity to sustain a TV series week after week , and Space : 1999 had a wonderful variety of plots not seen since the original Star Trek series years earlier .
Although unlike Star Trek the most interesting episodes of Space : 1999 could get quite dark and abstract at points .
In fact some of the episodes were almost mini - horror films as much as they were science fiction .
In one of my favorite episodes ( Dragon ’s Domain ) the Alphans comes across a spaceship graveyard which features a monster that sucks crew members in , chews them up and then spits them out as a smoked corpse in just a few seconds !
And mind you this was several years before the film Alien came out in 1979 .
Looking back at the series I ’d say that it was one of the most underrated science fiction shows of all time .
In fact when the series came out the critics hated it with a passion ; I recall an Isaac Asimov review of the series which damned it for poor science .
And while Asimov was right about that he had missed something bigger — the fact that while this was n’t gourmet science fiction the writing , directing and acting was so strong that the series kept you hooked .
Yes it may have been bad science fiction , but it was damned good sci fi .
Part of what helped this was the show did a great job at creating their own universe .
Every inch of Moonbase Alpha was very well thought through and wonderful to look at from the travel tubes to the comlinks which did everything from opening doors to acting as a video mobile phone .
And on the flip side the alien technology that was shown came in a wide range of flavors .
What makes this all the more amazing is that they did all of this work on TV budget , yet what you see looks as good as any science fiction film made during that era .
But special effects and art direction without a good story are just eye candy that does n’t go far .
And every single episode the writers of the show took the series to a different place .
Granted that not all of the episodes are equal in quality :
For example one show ( The Rules of Luton ) featured a planet of plant creatures that taunted the visiting crew members of Moonbase Alpha .
However it was because they took chances like that , that every so often they ’d come up with a great episode that you ’d find yourself thinking about years later .
And not for nothing the actors on the show were great .
At the time they were criticized for being too stiff like the wooden marionettes found in previous Anderson shows like Thunderbirds .
But in fact what ’s going on is that the actors are underacting , which is very much the opposite of Star Trek which could get a bit too campy .
To me the proof of this is that fact that years later Martin Landau would walk away with an Oscar for his performance in Ed Wood .
And it was n’t just Landau , there was quite a bit of other talent on the screen .
I also like the fact that the cast of the show was very international , yes Star Trek did this first but Space : 1999 kept the torch going .
The only major flaw in Space : 1999 is that the world that I live in today is n’t half as cool as that television show that I watched back in 1975 .
It seemed to me to be very reasonable back then that not only could there be a moonbase by 1999 but certainly by 2009 I would have seen us as already having done a successful Mars mission ( or two or three ) .
The other interesting thing about Space : 1999 is that their vision of the future is a world that runs without petroleum as a major energy source .
Yes you see a solar panel here and there as decoration on a space station , but in their world it seems that nuclear power is safe , portable and to be found everywhere .
Well pretty much safe , unless you count an occasional moon being torn from orbit .
Why are some people scared of the internet ?
Why Are Some People Scared of The Internet ?
We all know at least one person who fits this profile : owns a computer , has internet access , and uses it for one specific thing with the unyielding viewpoint that if he goes anywhere else online he will catch a virus or have his personal information discovered by a hacker and sold to the highest bidding Nigerian .
It could be email , Facebook , or a game that draws the subject online … regardless of why they are here , that is why they are here god dammit and they will NOT under any circumstances stray from the safe place they know to venture into the rest of the dark , seedy , cold , riff - raff - infested World Wide Web .
We know there are people out there like this .
Some of them are lurking this very sentence as we speak .
They will not contribute to the comment section nor even vote on the social website they happened here from .
Some will even go so far as to swear they caught a virus from the picture of the half naked chick in the bottom right corner .
It is hard to believe there are people who surf the web without wantonly grabbing porn whenever they can , downloading movies like a madman swings an axe , or telling off every son - of - a- bitch whose two cents are the wrong shade of grey each time they read a news story .
The internet is a social community of people who communicate and share , but moreover , it is a community of silent participants often exiled to one site or specific task without a care in the world what goes on anywhere else no matter how many free pieces of bacon are involved .
Have you ever been to a friends house and tried to show him something awesome or funny on the web and the first thing he says is “ Do n’t give me a virus , man… ” ?
A number of these people are gamers .
World of Warcraft is the main culprit .
Yes , I ’m calling you out , WoWcrack addicts !
That game is made for you to forsake the rest of your flesh breathing life , let alone the entirety of the rest of the internet .
Not every WoWcracker is guilty of it , but if you are one you must ask yourself … am I ?
Facebook and Twitter are two other loathsome trends , in the footsteps of Myspace , to lure otherwise non-social people into the cavities of internet ignorance .
A year ago , everyone had a Myspace .
People I could n’t even fathom using a computer were telling me “ Add me on Myspace ! ”
This year the same is true with Facebook and Twitter .
Mark my words : sites like this are going to ruin the goddamn web .
Then you have the dreary people who only get online to check their emails .
Every now and then they will get an email that makes them laugh , that originated in 2003 , and they will chuckle and go about their lives watching TV .
They are harmless .
Some of them are also Nigerian .
Regardless , you do n’t want either to get a hold of your email address .
They will either want to forward you a joke that ceased to be funny in the eighties or their father the prince just died and they need money .
On the other hand , there are forum goers and social news site users … and imageboards .
People who absolutely have no aversion to clicking on anything at all .
It could be a homeless man fucking a dead cat … or a dead cat fucking a homeless man .
It could go either way these days .
Whatever does it for you .
We are the very same people who make the internet scary for the others .
Some people have never seen goatse , and even though I believe seeing what cannot be unseen makes you a bit of a better person , not everyone gets the subtle humor .
Some see stuff like this and leave the internet never to return .
Others … well , post that sort of stuff .
The internet is web based multi-player notepad .
Of course , like anything else , some would have a phobia towards it .
As the many other things in this world people fear , there is even a name for it .
And symptoms .
Bad ones .
Really .
This website here say ’s you can get hyperactive bowels , shaking , and a desire to flee .
The only treatment ?
Contact the Indian dude who built the site on instant messenger and he will talk you through it .

We 've been asked not to reveal the URLs , but we can assure you we 've seen this official support screen pictured above with our own two eyes , which means that the HTC Hero is all but confirmed in a juicy CDMA blend for Sprint .
How ( or if ) that 'll affect the availability of the US 3G version unlocked or on any carrier is unclear , but given Hesse 's huffy language regarding
Pre exclusivity , we would n't be surprised if they 've got this one locked down for a while as well .
We 've seen a similar support page for an Alltel - branded Snap , so if you 're still tied up in one of the carrier 's legacy divested markets and you 've been pining after the Snap ( and Ozone ) on Sprint and Verizon , fear not -- your own version is on the way .
We 'll admit , if you had asked us a few months back what American carrier would get HTC 's highest - end Android phone to date , Sprint would n't have been our first guess -- but hey , good for them .
If you can't win the coverage battle against the Big Red juggernaut , may as well try to win the exclusive hardware battle , right ?

REUTERS / File
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A middle - income family can expect to spend $ 291,570 including inflation to raise a child born in 2008 to adulthood , the government estimated on Tuesday , up slightly from the estimate made a year ago .
The estimate covers food , shelter and other necessities for a child to age 18 , said the annual report by the Agriculture Department .
The figure does not include the cost of childbirth or college .
Housing accounts for one - third of expenditures on children .
Food accounts for 16 percent , the same as child care and education , said the Expenditures on Children by Families report .
Last year , the USDA estimated it would cost $ 269,040 to raise a child born in 2007 to age 18 , including inflation .
The USDA has made the estimates since 1960 , when the estimated cost was $ 25,300 .
The department said it planned to have an updated “ Cost of Raising a Child Calculator ” on the Internet soon .
Annual spending for child - rearing ranges from $ 11,610 to $ 13,480 for a middle - income , two - parent family , the USDA said .
Families with lower incomes will spend less and families with higher incomes spend more .
Expenses are highest in cities in the U.S. Northeast , followed by urban areas of the West and Midwest .
They are lowest in rural America and cities in the South .
Premiere week continues as a few more shows debuted .
ABC came stronger than I expected on comedy Wednesday with Modern Family getting 4.3 and Cougar Town also with 4.3 .
They actually gained on Dancing with the Stars which got 3.2 .
I do n't know what happened but it's no longer the ratings powerhouse it once was .
Eastwick got 3.0 , down quite a bit from Cougar Town .
Just from the first week , all look like they will be renewed , but it 's too early to tell .
CBS did well with Criminal Minds getting 4.2 and CSI : New York getting 4.0 .
The New Adventures of Old Christine did poorly with 2.3 .
NBC 's Mercy started bad with 2.3 , and I doubt it will gain viewers from there .
NBC has low standards , but I doubt even Mercy will make it .
The Jay Leno
Show got 2.0 which indicates huge fluctuations based on whats on other shows at the time .
I 'd guess he has a 1.0 base which is increased depending on how many people do n't want to watch the other shows in the timeslot .
The Lost Orphan Mine below the Grand Canyon has n't produced uranium since the 1960s , but radioactive residue still contaminates the area .
Cleaning the region takes an expensive process that is only done in extreme cases , but Judy Wall , a biochemistry professor at the University of Missouri College of Agriculture , Food and Natural Resources , is researching the use of sulfate - reducing bacteria to convert toxic radioactive metal to inert substances , a much more economical solution .
The bacteria Wall is studying are bio-corrosives and can change the solubility of heavy metals .
They can take uranium and convert it to uraninite , a nearly insoluble substance that will sink to the bottom of a lake or stream .
Wall is looking into the bacteria 's water cleansing ability and how long the changed material would remain inert .
Wall 's research could also be beneficial to heavy metal pollution from storage tanks and industrial waste .
The bacteria are already present in more than 7,000 heavy metal contaminated sites , but they live in a specific range of oxygen and temperature , making them difficult to control .
" Our research must be done in the absence of air , " Wall said .
" Obviously , none but the most committed – and stubborn – will work with them . "
Even if an oxygen - tolerant strain were developed , there are still multiple factors that would make applying the bacteria challenging , and these microbes can contribute to massive iron corrosion .
" Knowledge of the way bacteria live in the environment , in microbial communities , is still in its infancy , " Wall said .
" We just do n't know a lot about the communication systems among microbes . "
Wall and researchers from the Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory in California are investigating the bacterium 's basic genetics and hope to determine its growth limits and activity in natural settings , including how to make its interactions with metals sustainable .
They have already identified a few genes that are critical to converting uranium .
Wall 's research has been published in Applied and Environmental Microbiology , Nucleic Acids Research and Environmental Microbiology .
New malware being used by cybercrooks does more than let hackers loot a bank account ; it hides evidence of a victim 's dwindling balance by rewriting online bank statements on the fly , according to a new report .
The sophisticated hack uses a Trojan horse program installed on the victim 's machine that alters html coding before it 's displayed in the user 's browser , to either erase evidence of a money transfer transaction entirely from a bank statement , or alter the amount of money transfers and balances .
The ruse buys the crooks time before a victim discovers the fraud , though wo n't work if a victim uses an uninfected machine to check his or her bank balance .
The novel technique was employed in August by a gang who targeted customers of leading German banks and stole Euro 300,000 in three weeks , according to Yuval Ben-Itzhak , chief technology officer of computer security firm Finjan .
" The Trojan is hooked into your browser and dynamically modifies the text in the html , " Ben - Itzhak says .
" It 's a very sophisticated technique . "
The information appears in a cybercrime intelligence report ( .pdf ) written by Finjan 's Malicious Code Research Center .
The victims ' computers are infected with the Trojan , known as URLZone , after visiting compromised legitimate web sites or rogue sites set up by the hackers .
Once a victim is infected , the malware grabs the consumer 's log in credentials to their bank account , then contacts a control center hosted on a machine in Ukraine for further instructions .
The control center tells the Trojan how much money to wire transfer , and where to send it .
To avoid tripping a bank 's automated anti-fraud detectors , the malware will withdraw random amounts , and check to make sure the withdrawal does n't exceed the victim 's balance .
The money gets transferred to the legitimate accounts of unsuspecting money mules who 've been recruited online for work - at - home gigs , never suspecting that the money they 're allowing to flow through their account is being laundered .
The mule transfers the money to the crook 's chosen account .
The cyber gang Finjan tracked used each mule only twice , to avoid fraud pattern detection .
" They instruct the Trojan that the next time you log into your online banking account , they actually modify and change the statement you see there , " says Ben -Itzhak .
" If you do n't know it , you wo n't report it to the bank so they have more time to cash out . "
The researchers were able to capture screen shots showing the rogue bank statements in action , disguising , for example , a transfer of Euro 8,576.31 as Euro 53,94 .
The researchers also found statistics in the command tool showing that out of 90,000 visitors to the gang 's rogue and compromised websites , 6,400 were infected with the URLZone trojan .
Most of the attacks Finjan observed affected people using Internet Explorer browsers , but Ben - Itzhak says other browsers are vulnerable too .
Finjan provided law enforcement officials with details about the gang 's activities and says the hosting company for the Ukraine server has since suspended the domain for the command and control center .
But Finjan estimates that a gang using the scheme unimpeded could rake in about $ 7.3 million annually .
" The example we found relates to German banks , " Ben - Itzhak says .
" But we believe this will increase to other countries . "
Investigation in Afghanistan New Allegations against German Officer who Ordered Kunduz Air Strike
The allegations are mounting against German Colonel Georg Klein , who ordered a recent air strike in Afghanistan in which civilians are believed to have died .
Klein apparently gave incorrect information to the US pilots who carried out the attack and neglected to warn people on the ground , in violation of NATO procedures .

Following up on last week 's stories about Blue Dog opposition to the public option fading , the popularity of the public option in Blue Dog districts and the CBO scoring that showed the progressive public option bill would save $ 85 billion over the Blue Dog preferred bill , Jane has the reminder that 25 Blue Dogs have already said they 'll support a public option .
The list was primarily culled from the 20 Blue Dogs who signed on to the HCAN statement of principles , which endorses " a public insurance plan without a private insurer middleman that guarantees affordable coverage . "
It also advocated " using the public ’s purchasing power to instill greater reliance on evidence - based protocols and lower drug and device prices " -- the very opposite of co-ops .
I also included those who signed the July 22 letter to Steny Hoyer stressing the importance of having a strong public option , one that is tied to " an established provider network , like Medicare " ( PDF ) .
I added those who voted for H.R. 3200 already as a member of one of the three committees that drafted it , and those who have made statements of support in the media for a public option .
There are lots of modern versions of the Last Supper out there .
Shown above is my favorite , in part because of a personal connection I have with it .
Photographed by Raoef Mamedov , this sequence of 5 images portrays Jesus and his 12 disciples as “ sufferers ” from Down syndrome .
“ The Last Supper ” is an occasionally notorious Rorschach test for artists and critics alike .
One author invented an entire plot around his interpretation of a single , albeit extraordinarily famous , depiction of the event .
Mamedov ’s “ Last Supper ” patterns the poses of his men after da Vinici , which makes his work disarmingly familiar even as it is strikingly different .
What I see in the images probably says more about me than about his photos , but here ’s my take :
In the center as always is Jesus , alone , in a moment of calm reflection .
Or perhaps he is drifting into a nap , a possibility that seems borderline offensive .
Each cluster of 3 disciples occupies its own large photo , so you can view it as a stand - alone image .
Seen all at once ( something I had the unexpected opportunity to do once in a church in Utrecht ) , the effect is nearly overwhelming — startling at first and then magnetically captivating .
I see a series of photos that are funny and brilliant , which seem to border on the exploitative and unfair ( Did the actors understand what they were doing ?
Did they know how their genetic differences were being used by the artist ? ) .
As always when confronted by images of human anomalies , I also feel the dual pull of revulsion and captivation .
The figures strike me as awkward , but the blessing of Down syndrome is that the people who have it seem blissfully unaware of this awkwardness .
It ’s those of us with normal chromosomes , with longer lifespans and square shoulders , who are prone to obsess about our physical peculiarities or the ways in which we are social misfits .
Perhaps it ’s hard to look at people who by our calculations should be suffering , then realize we are the ones suffering .
This leads me to consider the possibility that Mamedov is the true outlier , the weirdo who just wants to pass for normal , to live his life without being gawked at .
So why not ?
Why should it seem so strange to see the apostles portrayed like this ?
Clearly it does seem odd at first , and that is troubling .
I have no real answer for why this matters or why it ’s troubling or why the photos are so hard to look at or so compelling .
And that , perhaps , is even more troubling .
I keep wanting to see these photos as a cheap shot or black humor or a mistake .
But dignity requires that we see the actors as they are : fully human , yet decidedly different .
So why ca n’t we just do that ?
The UK has imposed direct rule on the Turks and Caicos Islands after an inquiry found evidence of government corruption and incompetence .
The administration of the UK territory in the Caribbean has been suspended for up to two years and power transferred to the UK - appointed governor .
Politicians are accused of selling crown land for personal gain .
Former premier Galmo Williams said he believed he could have worked with the UK government to resolve the problems .
The UK government has been threatening action for several months after an inquiry commissioned by the Foreign Office returned a damning verdict .
It examined the actions of the Turks ' Cabinet and Assembly and found " information in abundance pointing to a high probability of systematic corruption or serious dishonesty " .
It also concluded there were " clear signs of political amorality and immaturity and of a general administrative incompetence " .
' Essential step '
The former premier , Michael Misick , is alleged to have built up a multi-million dollar fortune since coming to power in 2003 .
We will never be able as a nation to move forward [ if ] every time we reach a crossroads our rights get taken away
Former premier Galmo Williams
He resigned in March , but has denied the allegations and says he attracted valuable foreign investment to the islands .
The imposition of rule went ahead after a legal challenge by Mr Misick failed at the UK Court of Appeal earlier this week .
Foreign Office Minister Chris Bryant said the decision to impose direct rule had not been taken lightly , but he described the measures as " essential " to restore " good governance and sound financial management " .
" It remains our intentions that elections should be held by July 2011 , if not sooner , " he said .
" The governor and his advisers have much to do , but I know that many people in Turks and Caicos Islands will welcome this move and have high expectations for the end outcome .
" I encourage them to work with the governor to rebuild stability and confidence in their territory . "
' Freedom taken away '
But Mr Williams , premier of the territory until direct rule was imposed , has described the UK government 's actions as a " coup " .
" A coup is anything that has been done without the will of the people and being a colony anything the British government wants to do to us they can do to us , " he told the BBC .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
He said he accepted the territory faced challenges , but argued that by imposing UK rule , the will of the islands ' people had been ignored .
" We will never be able as a nation to move forward [ if ] every time we reach a crossroads our rights get taken away , our freedom gets taken away . "
He had told UK officials he and his administration were willing to work with the British government as a partner , he said .
" We have done that over the last five months - we have demonstrated that and we have made progress together .
" I believe if the opportunity presented itself we could have continued making progress . "
Financial centre However , Gordon Wetherell , who took over as governor last year , said the UK 's move did not amount to a " takeover " .
" Public services will continue to be run by people of the Turks and Caicos Islands , as indeed they should be , but I hope we can now begin to run them better , " he said .
Michael Misick resigned as premier in March but denies the allegations " Our goal is to make a clean break from the mistakes of the past by establishing a durable path towards good governance , sound financial management and sustainable development .
" Our guiding principles will be those of transparency , accountability and responsibility .
I believe that most people in the Turks and Caicos will join with me in welcoming these changes . "
Turks and Caicos is a UK overseas territory and residents there have British citizenship .
It is a leading offshore financial centre where thousands of foreign companies are registered .
The territory is also a popular tourist destination and has a population of about 30,000 .
Once a dependency of Jamaica , the islands become a crown colony when Jamaica gained its independence in 1962 .

This was culled from Ray Coleman 's biography on John Lennon .
It originally appeared as a letter to Melody Maker magazine ( date unknown to me ) .
The original 11/1973 interview with TR that provoked John Lennon 's response also appeared in Melody Maker .
[ thanks to Bill Piekarski for corrective information and to John Heslin for a transcription of the original interview ]
John Lennon 's reply to an interview conducted by Melody Maker with American singer - writer Todd Rundgren in which he criticized John and the Beatles .
Rundgren : all or nothing
by Ailan Jones
Melody Maker 11/73
" John Lennon ai n't no revolutionary .
He 's a f------- idiot , man .
Shouting about revolution and acting like an a__ .
It just makes people feel uncomfortable .
" All he really wants to do is get attention for himself , and if revolution gets him that attention , he 'll get attention through revolution .
Hitting a waitress in the Troubador .
What kind of revolution is that ?
" He 's an important figure , sure .
But so was Richard Nixon .
Nixon was just like another generation 's John Lennon .
Someone who represented all sorts of ideals , but was out for himself underneath it all . "
No doubt about it , this kid is really heavy .
Todd Rundgren is fast becoming an anachronistic satellite burning through the stagnancy currently afflicting so much of rock .
Dreams
In the face of the post - Woodstock Nation collapse of dreams and ideals , most rock ' n ' rollers have backed themselves into creative cul - de- sacs .
Not Todd .
He seems to have committed himself to a one - man campaign against all that inertia schmaltz and seems intent on blasting his way out of the hole that rock seems to be determined on burying itself in , with both barrels blazing .
No half measures : it 's all or nothing with Todd .
And if he goes down , he 'll sure as hell go down fighting .
With his last couple of albums , " A Wizard , A True Star " and " Todd , " both classics , he 's taken it upon himself to attempt , in no uncertain way , to change the whole consciousness of the survivors of the Woodstock Nation .
" I guess a lot of people thought ' Something / Anything ' was an overtly self - conscious effort to make the ultimate solo album , because they figured it must have taken a long time to make .
But I breezed through it , man .
Mind
" It 's really surprising , when you go into a session with musicians and you have something specific in mind , it can take you all day to get them to play it .
And when the specificity of the material is that acute then obviously the arrangement of the material becomes more important ... "
And you end up playing two thirds of it yourself .
Utilizing the sounds of the instruments and not wasting your own time and the times of other musicians .
But what kind of reaction did that album receive in the States ?
" ' Something / Anything ' was like my artistic validation in the States .
Everybody liked the songs so much that it really established my artistic identity .
But in certain terms , it misled a lot of people .
" Because if anyone picks up one of my albums and says that 's their favourite album , that might as well be the only album of mine they ever hear .
" Because I do n't make records according to a style .
I make records according to a need . "
Would you therefore care to elucidate on the mental evolution - the need - behind " A Wizard , A True Star " ?
" I had a good analogy for that album yesterday .
The ' Wizard ' album was a picture of the average brain at work .
Now there 's a distinction between the brain and the mind .
Because the mind tells the brain what to think .
" And the average person 's brain resembles the clutter of the ' Wizard ' album .
In fact , that was my brain , until I cleared it all out .
That was my first stream of consciousness album .
" It 's not supposed to have a concept other than a picture of the average brain at work .
The subsequent albums were more like organizing the brain , so that you can bring some inspired thought through it .
" People do n't usually think inspired thoughts because they 're usually too preoccupied with the immediate things that clutter up their brain .
Smash
" The thing was , I was really trying to smash away the preconceptions about my records . "
As a personal statement , it was quite a provocation , was n't it ?
Not what you might call Easy Listening .
More like some sort of psychic collage of erupting brain patterns .
" That was it , man .
A deliberate provocation .
It came out of a certain sense of being cornered stylistically .
A lot of people were just presuming that I only wrote ' Hullo , It's Me ' - ' I Saw The Light ' type songs .
" whereas , I had originally been into a hard rock / heavy metal style .
The reason I did both was that when I started the Nazz , I had this thing about being eclectic .
" Like the Beatles had no style other than being the Beatles .
So the Nazz used to do , like heavy rock , and also these light , pretty ballads with complex ballads .
" And at the time that was something that people just did n't do .
You were supposed to have an easily associable style .
" And that 's always been part of my problem .
I 've always had this incongruity of style and influence .
" A lot of people still find it remarkable that I have a penchant for the conventional and pretty and the weird and abstract .
That 's because I do n't make divisions in terms of music .
I never have .
" If I hear something I like , that 's it .
It 's mine .
The thing about music is that if you 're a good listener you can go window - shopping and own everything you see . "
Follow
There were a few tracks on " Something " which indicated the direction that Todd would follow on " Wizard " but it seems unlikely that anyone was wholly prepared for the stance that he took on that album .
His dissatisfaction with the attitudes adopted by other contemporary figures - Lennon , for example - became obvious with " Rock and Roll Pussy " written for Lennon , and a searing indictment of rock 's so - called revolutionaries .
Todd 's World View , became apparent on that album .
The " Todd " double album epic carried that vision even further , and here was Todd cutting himself to the bone to communicate the urgency of that vision .
He emphasized , with the last side of that album , the need to reorganize the shattered dreams of the sixties and start out all over again .
" I do n't think that my attitude is unique , man .
Everybody is dissatisfied with it all .
But so many people are so cynical , thinking that there 's nothing that can be done about it .
I do n't believe that .
" I do n't see any point in accepting the fact that the world might blow up tomorrow , and not doing something about it .
That 's a selfish attitude .
" It might blow up , but there 's no point sitting around worrying and waiting for it .
Are you gonna stop it happening by WORRYING about it ?
Exist
" I believe in a pleasant reality .
There are things that exist in this world that are desirable , but they are separated by a lot of undesirable things .
Like , there are islands of truth in a sea of falsehood ...
" The truth is there .
I believe that it's my responsibility to stand by it , and not be a pussy .
Not punk out when it looks unfashionable to stand by those ideals . "
That is , surely , an isolated position to maintain ?
" At this point , I may think that .
But I know for a fact that there are a lot of people that feel the same way as I do , but they 're so afraid of looking like asses .
" All it takes is for one person to risk making a fool of himself and everyone 'll do it .
I 'm having a great time .
I 'm more commercially successful than I 've ever been .
" My personal life is at a new high .
My outlook on existence is at a new high ... "
If The Revolution comes , can rock ' n ' roll , as a form , contribute to , or even precipitate a confrontation ?
" It can , sure .
But a lot of people want to see it happening in a very obvious way .
That 's because they do n't think well enough .
I think there is a revolution happening , but the people who are so frustrated that they go out and act violently are the people who do n't believe that it 's gonna happen .
" There the ones who 're afraid that it wo n't happen .
Force it to happen , you know , and that is because their belief is n't basically strong enough , and because they 're basically weak people .
Face
" They can't stand by their convictions in the face of adversity .
The leaders who people remember and revere - anybody who made an effect on the human mine - was someone whose instrument was the human mind .
People who have made an effect on the body - once the body died , the effect was gone .
I can't name you one American general or soldier who is a household word .
" But Christ is a household word .
So is Ghandi , Buddha , and Confucius ....
" You have to understand violence to make adequate use of it .
There is that degree of frustration in everybody , which can be manifested in violence .
Something happens , and the people suddenly feel like being violent .
" That 's because they do n't understand violence .
They do n't understand its use , disuse or misuse .
In the long run there 's no such thing as good or bad .
" But there are in human terms things that are desirable and undesirable .
All things have their function and violence has it 's place .
John Lennon 's letter to Todd
AN OPENED LETTUCE TO SODD RUNTLESTUNTLE . ( from dr. winston o' boogie )
Could n't resist adding a few " islands of truth " of my own , in answer to Turd Runtgreen 's howl of hate ( pain . )
Dear Todd ,
I like you , and some of your work , including " I Saw The Light " , which is not unlike " There 's A Place " ( Beatles ) , melody wise .
1 ) I have never claimed to be a revolutionary .
But I am allowed to sing about anything I want !
Right ?
2 ) I never hit a waitress in the Troubador , I did act like an ass , I was too drunk .
So shoot me !
3 ) I guess we 're all looking for attention Rodd , do you really think I do n't know how to get it , without " revolution ? "
I could dye my hair green and pink for a start !
4 ) I do n't represent anyone but my SELF .
It sounds like I represented something to you , or you would n't be so violent towards me .
( Your dad perhaps ? )
5 ) Yes Dodd , violence comes in mysterious ways it 's wonders to perform , including verbal .
But you 'd know that kind of mind game , would n't you ?
Of course you would .
6 ) So the Nazz use to do " like heavy rock " then SUDDENLY a " light pretty ballad " .
How original !
7 ) Which gets me to the Beatles , " who had no other style than being the Beatles " !!
That covers a lot of style man , including your own , TO DATE .....
Yes Godd , the one thing those Beatles did was to affect PEOPLES ' MINDS .
Maybe you need another fix ?
Somebody played me your rock and roll pussy song , but I never noticed anything .
i think that the real reason you 're mad at me is cause I did n't know who you were at the Rainbow ( L.A. )
Remember that time you came in with Wolfman Jack ?
When I found out later , I was cursing cause I wanted to tell you how good you were .
( I 'd heard you on the radio . )
Anyway , However much you hurt me darling ; I 'll always love you ,
press release Pat Robertson Recovering from Successful Heart Surgery
CBN.com  VIRGINIA BEACH , VA ( AUGUST 31 , 2009 ) – The Christian Broadcasting Network ( CBN ) announced today that its founder and Chairman , Pat Robertson , has returned home after extensive heart surgery at FirstHealth Moore Regional Hospital in Pinehurst , NC .
Mr. Robertson has suffered a condition known as atrial fibrillation , an often - debilitating heart disorder involving shortness of breath and weakness affecting an estimated five million Americans .
In the recent procedure , which required ten hours of surgery , cardiothoracic surgeon Dr. Andy C. Kiser and electrophysiologist Dr. Mark Landers performed a state of the art technique they pioneered called Convergent Procedure .
The groundbreaking procedure , which Drs. Kiser and Landers performed for the first time in the United States earlier this year , uses a device to cauterize the continually beating heart ’s muscle with heat generated by radio frequency .
The resulting scar tissue controls the heart ’s electrical impulses more effectively .
The procedure uses four small openings rather than full chest incisions , allowing for much faster recovery time , minimal scarring , and short hospital stay .
“ The Convergent Procedure integrates the expertise of the cardiac surgeon and the electrophysiologist into a single procedure , ” said Dr. Kiser , chief of cardiovascular and thoracic surgery at FirstHealth Moore Regional Hospital .
“ The co-disciplinary approach provides a successful treatment for patients , like Mr. Robertson , who have difficult - to - treat , chronic atrial fibrillation . ”
During the surgery , the doctors also discovered an abnormally enlarged left appendage on Robertson ’s heart , which is now believed to have been the cause of his atrial fibrillation .
The 6 cm appendage was successfully removed during the surgery .
Robertson said , “ Only the prayers of thousands of believing people kept me on this earth .
As it is , I anticipate many more years of creative service in the ministry I founded ( CBN ) , as well as Regent University and other endeavors devoted to the service of mankind .
I cannot praise enough the dedication and professionalism of Dr. Andy Kiser and his staff who removed this growth from my continuously beating heart . ”
Pat Robertson celebrated his 79th birthday on March 22nd of this year .
At that time , the Board of Directors of CBN appointed his son , Gordon Robertson , a former Norfolk attorney , to lead The Christian Broadcasting Network as its Chief Executive Officer .
Robertson expects to return to a full schedule , including hosting The 700 Club , in several weeks .

Kernel Modules in Haskell September 13 , 2009
If you love Haskell and Linux then today is your day – today we reconcile the two and allow you to write Linux Kernel modules in Haskell .
By making GHC and the Linux build system meet in the middle we can have modules that are type safe and garbage collected .
Using the copy of GHC modified for the House operating system as a base , it turns out to be relatively simple to make the modifications necessary to generate object files for the Kernel environment .
Additionally , a new calling convention ( regparm3 ) was added to make it easier to import ( and export ) functions from the Kernel .
EDIT : I ’m getting tired of updating this page with extremely minor changes and having it jump to the top of planet .
haskell.org , so for the latest take a look at the haskell wiki entry .
It includes discussion of the starting environment – a pretty large omission from the original post .
Starting Environment
You need a Linux x86 ( not AMD64 ) based distribution with GCC 4.4 or higher and recent versions of gnu make and patch along with many other common developer tools usually found in a binutils package ( e.g. ar , ld ) .
You also should have the necessary tools to build GHC 6.8.2 – this includes a copy of ghc - 6.8.x , alex , and happy .
Building GHC to Make Object files for Linux Modules
Start by downloading the House 0.8.93 [ 1 ] .
Use the build system to acquire ghc - 6.8.2 and apply the House patches .
The House patches allow GHC to compile Haskell binaries that will run on bare metal ( x86 ) without an underlying operating system , so this makes a good starting point .
> wget http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~kennyg/house/House-0.8.93.tar.bz2 > tar xjf House - 0.8.93.tar.bz2 > cd House - 0.8.93 > make boot > make stamp - patch
Now acquire the extra patch which changes the RTS to use the proper Kernel calls , instead of allocating its own memory , and to respect the current interrupt level .
This patch also changes the build options to avoid common area blocks for uninitilized data ( - fno - common ) and use frame pointers ( - fno-omit - frame - pointers ) .
> wget https://projects.cecs.pdx.edu/~dubuisst/hghc.patch > patch -d ghc - 6.8.2 - p1 < hghc.patch > make stamp - configure > make stamp - ghc # makes ghc stage 1
Next , build a custom libgmp with the - fno - common flag set .
This library is needed for the Integer support in Haskell .
> wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gmp/gmp-4.3.1.tar.bz2 > tar xjf gmp-4.3.1.tar.bz2 > cd gmp -4.3.1 > ./ configure # edit ' Makefile ' and add ' - fno - common ' to the end of the ' CFLAGS = ' line .
> make > cp .libs/libgmp.a $ HOUSE_DIR / support
Apply ‘ support.patch ’ to alter the build systems of the libtiny_{c , gcc , gmp}. a and build the libraries .
> wget https://projects.cecs.pdx.edu/~dubuisst/support.patch > patch - p0 -d $ HOUSE_DIR < support.patch > make -C $ HOUSE_DIR / support
Build the cbits object files :
> make -C $ HOUSE_DIR / kernel cobjs
In preparation for the final linking , which is done manually , pick a working directory ( $ WDIR ) that will serve to hold the needed libraries .
Make some last minute modifications to the archives and copy libHSrts.a , libcbits.a , libtiny_gmp.a , libtiny_c.a , and libtiny_gcc. a
> mkdir $ WDIR > ar d support / libtiny_c. a dlmalloc .
o # dlmalloc assumes it manages all memory > ar q $ WDIR / libcbits . a kernel / cbits /*.o > cp ghc - 6.8.2/rts/libHSrts.a support/libtiny_{c,gcc,gmp}.a $ WDIR
Build a Kernel Module
First , write the C shim that will be read by the Linux build system .
While it might be possible to avoid C entirely its easier to use the build system , and its plethora of macros , than fight it .
The basic components of the shim are a license declaration , function prototypes for the imported ( Haskell ) functions , initialization , and exit functions .
All these can be seen in the example hello.c [ 2 ] .
Notice that many of the standard C functions in the GHC RTS were not changed by our patches .
To allow the RTS to perform key actions , such as malloc and free , the hello . c file includes shim functions such as ‘ malloc ’ which simply calls ‘ kmalloc ’ .
Any derivative module you make should include these functions either in the main C file or a supporting one .
Second , write a Haskell module and export the initialization and exit function so the C module may call them .
Feel free to import kernel functions , just be sure to use the ‘ regparm3 ’ key word in place of ‘ ccall ’ or ‘ stdcall ’ .
For example :
foreign import regparm3 unsafe foo :: CString -> IO CInt foreign export regparm3 hello :: IO CInt
Continuing the example started by hello.c , ‘ hs Hello.hs ’ is online [ 3 ] .
Now start building the object files .
Starting with building hsHello.o , you must execute :
> $ HOUSE_DIR / ghc-6.8.2/compiler/stage1/ghc-inplace -B$ HOUSE_DIR/ghc-6.8.2 hsHello.hs -c
* note that this step will generate or overwrite any hsHello_stub .c file .
When GHC generates C code for exported functions there is an implicit assumption that the program will be compiled by GHC .
As a result the nursery and most the RTS systems are not initialized so the proper function calls must be added to hsHello_stub.c .
Add the funcion call “ startupHaskell ( 0 , NULL , NULL ) ; ” before rts_lock ( ) in the initializing Haskell function .
Similarly , add a call to “ hs_exit_nowait ( ) ” after rts_unlock ( ) .
The stub may now be compiled , producing hsHello_stub .o.
This is done below via hghc , which is an alias for our version of ghc with many flags [ 4 ] .
> hghc hsHello_stub.c -c
The remaining object files , hello. o and module_name.mod.o , can be created by the Linux build system .
The necessary make file should contain the following :
obj -m := module .o # Obviously you should name the module as you see fit module - objs := hello.o
And the make command ( assuming the kernel source is in /usr / src/ kernels / ) :
> make -C /usr / src/ kernels /2.6.29.6-217.2.16.fc11.i586 M=`pwd` modules
This should make “ hello.o ” and “ module.mod.o ” .
Everything can now be linked together with a single ld command .
> ld -r -m elf_i386 - o module.ko hsHello_stub.o hsHello.o module.mod.o hello.o *. a libcbits .a
A successful build should not have any common block variables and the only undefined symbols should be provided by the kernel , meaning you should recognize said functions .
As a result , the first command below should not result in output while the second should be minimal .
> nm module . ko | egrep “ ^ +C ” > nm module .
ko | egrep “ ^ +U ” U __kmalloc U kfree U krealloc U mcount U printk
Known Issue
The House - GHC 6.8.2 run-time system ( RTS ) does not clean up the allocated memory on shutdown , so adding and removing kernel modules results in large memory leaks which can eventually crash the system .
This should be relatively easy to fix , but little investigation was done .
A good estimate of the memory leak is the number of megabytes in the heap ( probably 1MB , unless your module needs lots of memory ) plus 14 bytes of randomly leaked memory from two unidentified ( 6 and 8 byte ) allocations .

Astronauts on board the International Space Station are conducting a series of experiments based on suggestions from the public .
The tests are meant to examine the effects of microgravity - but they also gave Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata the chance to try flying on a " magic carpet " .
He also attempted to shoot water out of a straw and a syringe to see how it flows in space .
When writing a muse file it always annoyed me when I have written ( for example ) a - really - long - variable somewhere else in the file and then when I type =a-rea and press M-/ it fails to expand .
The way to fix this behaviour is by setting dabbrev- abbrev - skip - leading - regexp
( setq dabbrev-abbrev-skip - leading - regexp " [ = * ] " )
( Edit : fixed the first regex per Billy ’s comment below .
Thanks )
Okay , you think , this does n’t affect me – I do n’t use muse ( why not ? )
How about if you ’re writing some html / xml .
( setq dabbrev-abbrev-skip-leading - regexp " [ ^ ] *[ <>=* ] " )
Now < strong > long - word - completes as you would expect .
There is also dabbrev - abbrev - char - regexp if you want even more control over what should be considered a match .
Also , I ’m no longer using autocomplete as I find vanilla dabbrev nicer to use .
What is it about stupidity that America seems to love so much ?
This glorification of stupidity has been consistently promulgated by films like Dumb and Dumber , Legally Blonde , Dude , Where 's My Car , Idiocracy , Borat and - god help me - Forrest Gump .
We Americans love stoopid peepul .
As much as I enjoy the series Eureka , it 's telling that in a town full of geniuses , the schtick is that it ’s the not - genius sheriff ( at least he is n't portrayed as a slapstick idiot ) who usually solves the problem by either shooting it , whacking it with a stick or driving his Jeep into it .
The geniuses are stereotyped as bumbling , socially inadequate , skinny , malformed , could n't get laid if their Nobel Prize depended on it geeks .
( Not helped that Bill Gates fits the physical profile ) .
Real life geniuses , like John Forbes Nash , are presented as more cautionary tales - See ?
See ?
That 's what happens if you get too smart , you become paranoid and go insane .
Told ya so .
Pass the popcorn , Ma ...
Stupidity in politics did n't start with Dubya , however exemplary he is as the ultimate manifestation of incompetence and malevolent stupidity .
Nor did it start with the tea - baggers holding up misspelt signs as they march to proudly display their ignorance and pointlessness .
It ’s endless , just endless …
It 's ingrained in the American popular and political culture to exult stupidity and tear down intelligence .
Adlai Stevenson 's 1956 bid for the presidency was scuppered because he was denigrated by Republicans for being ' too smart ' , called an ' egghead ' as a scathing pejorative , the distrust for intelligence is deep rooted in our history .
Stupid people are n't leaders , they 're not even followers .
They 're the Marching Morons .
They 're the Eloi to the Morlocks of Coulters , Rushes , Limbaughs , Savages , Hannitys , et. al. , who cultivate and nurture their hordes of the slavishly stupid , then feed off them mercilessly .
It ’s the bread and butter for the Malkins who can claim millions – millions I tells ya !
– turned up for the 9/12 marches , then used photos from the inauguration to fraudulently bolster the lie , fully aware her multitude of mindless minions will never bother to check – or ever realize it was all a lie , that a mere few thousand at most showed up , all that empty lawn speaking volumes .
( * crickets chirping * )
It does n’t matter to the Malkinoids and the Coulterites if they ’re caught out , time and time again , their dishonesty exposed , their self - serving agendas flapping in the breeze like dirty underwear on a clothesline – they depend on the dedication of their supporters to stupidity .
They trust in that entrenched compulsion to not - want - to - know , they know they can always rely on those antithetical sycophants of hear - no - evil , see - no - evil , but sure as hell spout off a load of uninformed , boorish , and – so sadly – ultimately self - defeating crap .
I come from a generation where women were struggling to break out of the Stepford Wife , I Dream of Jeannie , Father knows
Best stereotypes that held us back - I once had a date kick me out of his car late at night on a deserted country road and had to walk 15 miles home , because I was going to college and had used a word he did n't understand ; he felt so threatened by his own ignorance that he took out his inferiority complex on me .
I refuse to dumb - down my vocabulary , for anyone , for any reason .
I was warned by my family and friends that I would never find a husband if I were openly ' too smart ' - men do n't like ' too smart ' women , they said .
They were perplexed that I did n't care ; why the hell would I marry anyone stupid enough to want someone more stupid than themselves ?
And yet … it still goes on .
And on …
And on ...
I loathe stupid people .
I loathe them because , unlike those genuinely afflicted with mental illness or disorders , stupid people willfully choose their stupidity .
They revel in it , they venerate it , they wrap themselves in it tighter than an American flag and subject their children to the same brainwash - rinse - repeat that incited parents to prevent their children from listening to the first truly educated and articulate president this country has had since perhaps Lincoln tell them to get an education .
Horrors , that might cause them to actually learn how to think for themselves , and become Atheists and Communists and Liberal Undesirables .
Catchy , that , innit ?
So it is hard for me to reconcile this mass approbation of blatant stupidity with the achievements we Americans have given to the world .
We as a nation and as a culture have had so many shining , glorious moments where stupidity was forced to STFU .
We put a man on the moon - several , in fact - and it was the Failure Is Not An Option inventiveness that got Lovell , Swigert and Haise back to earth alive .
We split the atom .
We invented the light bulb , the telephone , the airplane , peanut butter and chocolate chip cookies .
We invented the circular saw , the electric hot water heater , the elevated railway system , the engine muffler , the fire escape , Kevlar , the life raft , the medical syringe , the railway crossing gate , the rotary engine , the submarine telescope , the windscreen wiper – all inventions by American women , by the way .
We Americans invented airbags and autopilots , bubblegum and bulldozers , the credit card , dental floss , the flashlight , the Hubble telescope , laser printers , microwave ovens , the particle accelerator , the QWERTY keyboard , radar guns and radio carbon dating , the sextant , the supermarket , the space shuttle , and the sewing machine , volleyball and videotape and the zipper .
We invented the Taser , the teddy bear , the traffic cone and – yes – even the tea bag .
We invented the Internet .
We invented the blog .
Educated , creative , intelligent Americans can , have done , and are still capable of doing amazing things .
If only we could find a way to invent a cure for stoopid peepul .

PITTSBURGH ( Reuters ) - Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said on Friday that if Iran does not cooperate at an October 1 meeting with world powers , then other methods should be used to deal with Tehran ’s nuclear program .
Medvedev made the comment in answering a question about whether a new round of U.N. sanctions might be in order after U.S. President Barack Obama ’s announcement that Iran has a second nuclear facility it had been keeping secret .
“ I have said we should create a system of incentives for Iran , ” Medvedev said .
“ If they do not work , cooperation does not work , other mechanisms of which I spoke should be used . ”
Medvedev said the new revelations were a “ cause of concern ” to all participants at a Group of 20 summit in Pittsburgh , including Russia .
Negotiators from six major powers plus Iran will meet on October 1 in Geneva to discuss their differences .
Russia , like China , has been reluctant in the past to toughen sanctions against Iran .
Medvedev ’s comments at the end of the G20 summit showed signs of Russian impatience that Iran violated several demands by the U.N. Security Council for it to halt all uranium enrichment activities .
The International Atomic Energy Agency , the U.N. nuclear watchdog , should launch an immediate investigation , he said in a statement .
Western countries fear Iran is working to make nuclear weapons , while Tehran insists its program is designed solely to generate electricity .
DEADLINE FOR IRAN
Medvedev said the October 1 meeting “ gives Iran a chance to demonstrate that it is also committed to talks to solve this issue . ”
“ We hope that ... Iran will provide convincing proof of its commitment to develop a nuclear energy sector exclusively for peaceful purposes , ” he said .
The statement -- in particular the focus on the October 1 deadline -- was firmer than previous remarks by Moscow , which have largely stressed the need for dialogue with Iran .
Medvedev repeated that Russia was committed to talks on ending the standoff but made no mention of sanctions .
Obama and Medvedev agreed on Wednesday that serious additional sanctions had to be considered if Iran did not respond to proposals to end the nuclear standoff .
Moscow has so far supported U.N. Security Council statements condemning Iran ’s nuclear ambitions while rejecting the idea of tougher sanctions , for example those targeted against the country ’s energy sector .
A U.S. official said Washington had been monitoring the construction of the plant for several years .
A source in the Russian delegation said it appeared that “ one of the Western secret services discovered the new plant and Iran came out with ( the ) disclosure to ease tough Western reaction . ”
Where does one learn to become a parent ?
Besides trial - and - error , the assumption is that people parent similar to how they were raised by their parents .
A new study shows that is true for women :
They tend to mimic what their own mothers did .
Fathers , however , do n't seem to use their moms as parenting role models .
Researchers at Ohio State University studied how often parents in the 1990s spanked their children , read to them and showed affection .
Their practices were compared to mothers ' .
" We were surprised that mothers seem to learn a lot about the parenting role from their own mothers , but fathers do n't follow their mothers as much , " Jonathan Vespa , a co-author of the study , said in a news release .
" Although more women were entering the workforce then , they still did the lion 's share of parenting and childcare ....
There was good reason to expect that fathers would have learned parenting from their mothers . "
The study did not measure whether men learned parenting from their fathers .
So that is certainly possible .
" We really need to learn a lot more about how fathers learn to parent , " Vespa said .
The study also reflected some big changes in parenting practices between the generations .
The most recent generation of parents reads more to their kids , shows more affection and spanks less .
Fathers who were spanked as children appeared especially reluctant to spank their own children .
" If parents really just learned from their own parents , we would n't witness such dramatic generational shifts as were seen in this study , " Vespa said .
The data were collected from the National Longitudenal Survey of Youth and included 1,133 young adult parents of the mothers from the original survey in 1979 .
The study was presented today at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Assn .

Jephthah Kills His Virgin Daughter Judges 11:34
Jephthah returned home to Mizpah , and there was his daughter coming out to meet him , dancing to the sound of tambourines .
The line - up of Mr. Hatoyama 's first cabinet , announced yesterday , leaves little doubt that Japan is about to take a giant economic step backward in both economic and financial policy .
Shizuka Kamei , a former Liberal Democratic Party leader , has been appointed to run the all - important Financial Services Agency .
Mr. Kamei is best - known for opposing former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi 's deregulation and privatization drive earlier this decade .
Prime Minister Hatoyama has also assigned Mr. Kamei to re-reform Japan Post .
In that position , he will likely stop the postal privatization process and probably begin to reverse it .
This would be a significant mistake .
Japanese savings in the nationally backed postal bank dropped to 18 % last year from almost 30 % in the late 1990s , creating significant profit opportunities for the private sector .
If Mr. Kamei reverses course and resurrects financial socialism by not only keeping but expanding the role of the postal bank , it will be possible for inefficient companies to be kept alive through below market - rate loans .
This is bad news not just for private banks and other financial institutions , but also for all other entrepreneurs .
The more companies have access to cheap , publicly backed funding , the fewer real entrepreneurs will be able to compete .
Against this , Mr. Kamei's record on fiscal prudence is impressive at first sight .
He drastically cut wasteful public spending when he was construction minister for the LDP in the late 1990s .
More than 20 wasteful dam - building projects were terminated under his leadership .
As head of the LDP 's policy research council , he killed more than 200 public works projects , savings almost 3 trillion yen ( $ 33 billion at today 's exchange rate ) for taxpayers at that time , more than 0.5 % of that year 's GDP .
However , he now seeks to reverse this and advocates the resumption of large - scale deficit spending .
To cure Japan 's ills he has been advocating 40 - trillion - yen - worth of new public spending , which equals about 8 % of this year 's GDP .

Leena Rao at TechCrunch points out a case where semantic search turned into anti-semitic search .
This morning I wrote about NetBase Solutions ’ healthBase , a semantic search engine that aggregates medical content from millions of authoritative health sites including WebMD , Wikipedia , and PubMed .
But is it a semantic engine or an anti-semitic search engine ?
Several of our readers tested out the site and found that healthBase ’s semantic search engine has some major glitches ( see the comments ) .
One of the most unfortunate examples is when you type in a search for “ AIDS , ” one of the listed causes of the disease is “ Jew . ” Really .
The ridiculousness continues .
When you click on Jew , you can see proper “ Treatments ” for Jews , “ Drugs And Medications ” for Jews and “ Complications ” for Jews .
Apparently , “ alcohol ” and “ coarse salt ” are treatments to get rid of Jews , as is Dr. Pepper !
Who knew ?
Apparently this was not the result of amalgamating medical advice from Hamas , but rather a consequence of some artificial stupidity applied to Wikipedia , as a company representative explained :
This is an unfortunate example of homonymy , i.e. words that have different meanings .
The showcase was not configured to distinguish between the disease “ AIDS ” and the verb “ aids ” ( as in aiding someone ) .
If you click on the result “ Jew ” you see a sentence from a Wikipedia page about 7th Century history : “ Hispano - Visigothic king Egica accuses the Jews of aiding the Muslims , and sentences all Jews to slavery .
” Although Wikipedia contains a lot of great health information it also contains non-health related information ( like this one ) that is hard to filter out .
And that 's not the end of the fun and games :
If you look at the pros of AIDS ( yes , it thinks here are pros to having AIDS ) , it comically lists the “ Spanish Civil War . ”
One of the causes of hemorrhoids is “ Bronco ” ( I do n’t even want to know ) .
It only took a few clicks for me to get here :

For a while , it appeared that Simon Taub ’s money would never stop flowing .
When the Taubs decided their large home was n’t large enough , they rented their next - door neighbor ’s first - floor apartment and opened a door in the wall , integrating into their house two more bedrooms , a bathroom and a second kitchen to deal with the overflow demands of the Shabbos meal .
But in 1997 , as competition from Chinese manufacturers intensified , Simon ’s company filed for bankruptcy .
By 2003 , it closed its doors — none of which he told Chana , fearing , he now says , that she would divorce him if the money dried up .
So unbeknown to her , they lived mostly on income from their commercial and residential properties — some of which he owned before their marriage and some of which he , like many businessmen , had put in his wife ’s name to keep from potential creditors .
Only in 2005 , after he ’d had a heart attack , he said in divorce papers , did he tell Chana of the stress he ’d been under .
Chana and their children would later testify that Simon had become increasingly testy during those last few years .
When Chana was home , they said , he was angry she was n’t out doing his errands .
When she was out , he was angry she was n’t home .
When the Shabbos stew was too watery for his taste , they said , he shoved his bowl to the floor .
He threw pots of food off the stove and Chana ’s plants out the window .
He heaved Chana ’s books , vases and mail into the trash and covered them with dirt so she could n’t salvage them .
The children testified that their father , a heavy - set man , treated their mother like a slave , ordering her to put his shoes and socks on every morning .
None of the children ever saw him hit her , but they testified that he threw a Rolodex and a dollhouse toward her , though they missed .
Simon has more favorable interpretations of these events ; for example , he says he threw away only mail that was many years old and only with Chana ’s permission .
Nonsense , Chana says : ‘‘ It was n’t a marriage .
It was a terror . ’’
In 2005 , Chana won an order of protection that included banning Simon from the house .
But Simon pressed the court to let him move back , saying that living at his sister ’s house taxed his health .
At the time , he expressed shock at Chana ’s claims , saying that he had always treated her ‘‘ like a queen , ’’ taking her to high - class restaurants and providing her with a full - time staff of three .
‘‘ My wife was therefore never a slave but instead had people tending to her every need . ’’
It was Simon who proposed dividing the house with a makeshift wall , each side with its own first - floor entrance , a proposal that he hoped would allow him to move back in without breaching the order of protection .
Chana and three of their children would get the whole third floor — five bedrooms and two bathrooms .
They would get the huge kitchen , bathroom and enclosed porch on the second floor , and the library and indoor garage on the first .
Simon and their youngest son , then 14 and preferring to live with his father , would keep the dining room on the second floor and the living room , bathroom and second garage on the ground level .
The judge agreed to Simon ’s Solomonic plan .
Chana hated it , but her appeals failed .
And so , in December 2006 , Simon waved in workers to erect the patchwork divider , as neighbors gathered outside to watch .
Chana installed a $ 2,000 alarm system on her side of the partition .
And in the corner where the wall met her front door , she taped an excerpt from Genesis in which angels blind the wicked Sodomites trying to break into a house to harm the innocent family inside .

Behind every great program , is a great story .
Well ...
I 'm not sure if this is a great story or not , but here it is .
My name is Jonathan Thomas .
I live in Arlington , TX , USA .
I am a professional software / web developer ( 12 + years experience ) .
In early 2008 , I first installed Ubuntu .
I was very impressed , but like many people , I realized immediately the lack of a video editor .
For weeks I researched , downloaded , configured , compiled , and installed any Linux video editor I could find .
It turns out there are many , but none that met my simple criteria :
Criteria :
Easy to use
Powerful
Stable
So , after much consideration , I decided to start my own video editor project in August of 2008 .
Sounds easy right ?
However , as I learned , I had many challenges awaiting me .
Challenges :
I barely knew Linux
I barely knew anything about programming on Linux ( all of my experience is with Microsoft C# and the .
NET Framework )
I had no idea how to mix video & audio via code
Open
Shot
I decided it would be an interesting challenge , and it was worth attempting .
I quickly decided on the Python programming language , for it 's speed , beauty , and it 's rich bindings for many libraries .
One of my friends suggested that I should track my progress with a blog .
Although I had no experience blogging , it turned out to be one of the best decisions I 've made .
It has allowed me to document my key decisions , meet many interesting people , and most importantly , it gives me a direct feedback loop with the Linux video editing community .
The last piece missing from the puzzle was a good multimedia framework ( i.e. the library that does all the video and audio mixing ) .
MLT .
Enough said .
Once it all started to fit together , I got real excited .
Was I actually going to be able to pull this off ?
Was I actually going to create a video editor ?
Maybe .
But first , it needed a name .
A meaningful name .
An awesome name .
Fast forward 1 month ... I still could not think of a name .
One day while playing basketball ( PIG to be exact ) , I missed an open shot .
My friends started laughing at me , and then it clicked .
" OpenShot " ...
It 's perfect .
Sounds cheesy , but that 's the true story of how I came up with the name " OpenShot " .
Officially though , the name stands for a lot more than a missed basketball attempt : stands for open - source , andstands for a single cinematic take .
Add them together , and you get " OpenShot " .
How does this story end ?
Does OpenShot become the single greatest video editor of all time ?
Who knows ... the rest of this story is still being written .
If you would like to start from the beginning , here are my first 4 blogs ... back from May 2008 :

The boss says , " We won a huge government contract . "
The boss says , " Now we need to follow all of our company policies plus every government procurement rule . "
Dilbert says , " I feel like I 'm being smothered by a damp mattress ! "
The boss says , " That 's what victory feels like ! "
We ’re not sure what ’s happening here .
But a Coast Guard vessel has apparently just opened fire ( though perhaps just as warning shots ) on a vessel in a restricted zone on the Potomac River .
Late Update : Conflicting and more very odd details .
The Coast Guard is now reportedly denying that shots were fired and there is some questions — unconfirmed reports — that the whole thing may have been a training exercise of some sort .
We ’ll keep you posted on the latest we hear .
( CNN ) --
Two Florida school administrators were due to appear in federal court Thursday to face contempt charges for saying a prayer at a school luncheon .
Rep . Mike McIntyre is one of three members of the Congressional Prayer Caucus backing the school officials .
Frank Lay , principal of Pace High School in Pace , Florida , and school athletic director Robert Freeman are accused of violating a consent decree banning employees of Santa Rosa County schools from endorsing religion .
They face a nonjury trial before U.S. District Judge M.C. Rodgers .
If convicted , they could be sentenced to up to six months in prison and fined , subject to sentencing guidelines .
Defense attorneys have said it is it outrageous Lay and Freeman are facing prosecution for " a simple prayer . "
But the American Civil Liberties Union , whose lawsuit led to the consent decree , maintains students have a right to be free from administrators who foist their personal religious beliefs on them .
However , an ACLU representative said the organization " never suggested " people should go to jail for violating the decree , and the organization is not involved in the criminal proceedings .
The ACLU filed suit last year against the school district in northwest Florida on behalf of two Pace students who alleged that " officials regularly promoted religion and led prayers at school events , " according to an ACLU statement .
Both parties approved the consent decree put in place January 9 under which district and school officials are " permanently prohibited from promoting , advancing , endorsing , participating in or causing prayers during or in conjunction with school events , " the ACLU said .
Lay was a party in the initial lawsuit , and his attorney was among those approving the consent decree , according to the organization .
In addition , the court required that all district employees receive a copy .
But on January 28 , " Lay asked Freeman to offer a prayer of blessing during a school - day luncheon for the dedication of a new field house at Pace High School , " according to court documents .
" Freeman complied with the request and offered the prayer at the event .
It appears this was a school - sponsored event attended by students , faculty and community members . "
Attorneys from Liberty Counsel , a conservative legal group helping defend Lay and Freeman , have said that attendees included booster club members and other adults who helped the field house project -- all " consenting adults . "
Three U.S. lawmakers who are members of the Congressional Prayer Caucus have written a letter in support of the two school administrators , saying that " many of America 's Founding Fathers were resolute in their faiths , and the impact of such is evident in the Constitution , the Declaration of Independence and many of their writings . "
The letter from Reps. J. Randy Forbes , R- Virginia ; Mike McIntyre , D - North Carolina ; and Jeff Miller , R- Florida , said the congressmen were writing as members of the Congressional Prayer Caucus .
" The tradition of offering prayer in America has become so interwoven into our nation 's spiritual heritage that to charge someone criminally for engaging in such a practice would astonish the men who founded this country on religious liberty , " the lawmakers wrote .

White House Spokesman Uses Phrase " War On Terror "
White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs used the term " war on terror " at today 's press conference .
The White House previously said that the " war on terrorism " was over .

In the war between console manufacturers to see who can come up with the most inane and bizarre control system for a console , Sony may have just won a decisive victory - though a laughter detector .
Revealed in a series of newly file patents spotted by Silicon Era , the new control system Sony is thinking about is likely an extension of the PlayStation Eye camera and microphone system which is already in use on the console .
The patent is n't just limited to detecting laughter either and Sony 's patent outlines a number of different emotional states that may be useful for games - including sadness , distress , fear , curiosity and even boredom .
Like Microsoft's Natal system for the Xbox 360 , it looks like Sony 's emotion - controller will function on the basis of body gestures , facial expressions and amount of player movement , all of which will be detected through the camera and microphone .
One of the most interesting things about the patent though is the fact that the detection software may be designed to connect a whole host of Sony devices , with the patent image showing a PS3 connected up to a Sony Bravia TV which is being used to watch TV .
Might the emotion detection system be useful for more than just games and end up playing a role in channel flipping too ?
Let us know your thoughts on the emotion detector in the forums

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Seven former heads of the CIA on Friday urged President Barack Obama to end the probe into allegations of abuse of prisoners held by the agency , arguing that it would hamper intelligence operations .
President Barack Obama is introduced by CIA Director Leon Panetta ( R ) during Obama 's visit to the CIA headquarters in Langley , Virginia , April 20 , 2009 .

U.S. Attorney General Eric
Holder last month named a prosecutor to examine whether criminal charges should be filed against Central Intelligence Agency interrogators or contractors for going beyond approved interrogation methods , including using a power drill and death threats to scare detainees .
The former CIA chiefs countered that the cases had already been investigated during the Bush administration and lawyers had declined to prosecute all but one contractor .
“ This approach will seriously damage the willingness of intelligence officers to take risks to protect the country , ” they said in the letter .
“ In our judgment , such risk - taking is vital to success in the long and difficult fight against terrorists who continue to threaten us . ”
The letter to Obama was signed by three CIA directors under President George W. Bush -- Michael Hayden , Porter Goss and George Tenet -- as well as by John Deutch , James Woolsey , William Webster and James Schlesinger , who dates to the Nixon administration .
Obama has said he wants to look forward beyond the Bush administration , which civil liberties groups have accused of using torture to coerce information from suspected militants in violation of U.S. and international law .
But Obama has also said the matter was up to Holder , who decided in late August to reopen the cases because “ it is clear to me that this review is the only responsible course of action for me to take . ”
The White House declined to comment .
‘ CONTINUOUS JEOPARDY ’
Bush administration officials , including former Vice President Dick Cheney , have repeatedly defended their actions and said the interrogations yielded valuable information .
The former CIA directors warned that Holder ’s decision “ creates an atmosphere of continuous jeopardy ” for those involved and that there was no reason to believe the investigation would be narrowly focused .
They also warned that releasing more details about interrogation methods could help al Qaeda operatives elude U.S. intelligence efforts and plan operations .
“ Disclosures about CIA collection operations have and will continue to make it harder for intelligence officers to maintain the momentum of operations that have saved lives and helped protect America from further attacks , ” they said .
Cheney , who has called the investigation “ political , ” has made similar points about the interrogation tactics having saved lives and protected the country , although his critics say there is no proof of that .
A CIA ’s inspector general ’s report detailing the harsh interrogation techniques noted that they did not succeed .
A spokesman for Holder said , with the recommendation of the Justice Department ’s ethics office and other information , the attorney general decided to name a prosecutor to investigate .
“ The attorney general ’s decision to order a preliminary review into this matter was made in line with his duty to examine the facts and to follow the law , ” said spokesman Matt Miller .
“ As he has made clear , the Department of Justice will not prosecute anyone who acted in good faith and within the scope of the legal guidance given by the Office of Legal Counsel regarding the interrogation of detainees . ”

At first I was n't sure if this item would ( or could ) arrive via mail , but I was glad to see it showed up with no problems .
Well , almost no problems .

Navy creates a virtual world to test submarine design
When visualizing data , sometimes a map or graph is n’t enough .
Setting up an entire virtual world occasionally is the best way to understand new information .
The Naval Undersea Warfare Center is doing that with an experimental approach to submarine design .
It has created a Second Life - like virtual replica of a proposed design of a submarine 's control hub using architectural renderings of the new design .
By being immersed in a new environment , submarine commanders will have a better idea of the proposed changes to the hub and can offer more constructive feedback .
" We would like to support rapid prototyping , " said Douglas Maxwell , technical lead for the project .
" Basically , we would like to create an environment where the fleet , shipbuilders and scientists can collaborate on platform design .
We could create many iterations of advanced design and let the users tell us which ones work and which ones do n't . "
Moreover , by using a virtual replica , the center could save the expense and time of sending Navy personnel to its Newport , R.I. , location to try a mock - up .
The Naval Undersea Warfare Center is using a submarine 's combat systems center as a test case .
In modeling the hub of the submarine where commanders and sonar operators do their jobs , the center used virtual workplace software Qwaq Forums , from Qwaq .
The software works like other online immersive environments .
All clients get a dedicated application , which offers them a menu of active forums .
After a user logs on to the combat center forum , he or she can walk an avatar into an accurately depicted and fully operational combat center .
The avatar can operate sonar console software , for instance , just as the user would do with the real thing .
" When you are looking at a Qwaq console , the screen being displayed to you is a live , running operational system on your network , " Maxwell said .
Testers are put through a scripted concept - of - operation exercise , where they undertake the normal functions of a mission .
They can offer their insights with the design engineers through chat software that is part of the application .
The submarine environment is based on the computer - aided design files developed by engineers .
One of the chief features of Qwaq — one missing in Second Life , for instance — is that it can ingest and rerender CAD drawings .
" We can create an entire environment based on that CAD file , " Maxwell said .
Qwaq translates the CAD models into the Croquet format .
The software offers a number of other operational advantages , Maxwell said .
For one , it has the ability to tap outside applications , such as software for the sonar operator 's console , and run them in the virtual environment .
Also , the software can run entirely behind a firewall , though Qwaq offers a hosted version , too .
The client software uses a minimal number of ports to communicate with the main servers , which makes it easier to manage in terms of security .
The server software is a virtual appliance , a Linux - based environment running within a VMware container .

The meeting has been called by the United Socialist Party of Venezuela ( PSUV ) , a mass revolutionary party headed by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez .
The gathering was agreed upon at the recent Sao Paulo Forum ( FSP ) held in Mexico City over August 20 - 22 .
There , the PSUV delegation presented the proposal to organise an international meeting of left parties .
September 5 , 2009 -- Caracas will play host to one of the most important international gatherings of left parties in years , when delegates from across the world meet for the First International Meeting of Left Parties over October 7 - 9 , 2009 .
The FSP was first established in 1990 at the initiative of the Workers ’ Party ( PT ) of Brazil .
At the time , the PT had a good reputation on the international left .
It was forged out of the workers ’ struggles against the Brazilian dictatorship and had developed into a mass workers ’ party that spoke of the need to break with capitalism .
Since then , the FSP has evolved in a reformist direction , although several important revolutionary parties such as the Cuban Communist Party continue to be involved .
Some of the member parties — like the PT — are now in government in Latin America and are carrying out policies they once strongly denounced .
The new call by the PSUV for an international gathering of left parties comes in a different context .
In August 2007 , Chavez said it was necessary to convene ``a meeting of left parties of Latin America and organise a type of international , an organisation of parties and movements of the left in Latin American and the Caribbean ” .
He added that “ there is a resurgence of the consciousness of the peoples ; the movements , leaders and leaderships of this new left , of this new project , this need to continue to grow ” .
There is a revival of socialist ideas that , at least in Venezuela , has become embodied in the actions of millions who are fighting to create “ socialism of the 21st century ” .
Millions more people worldwide look to Venezuela as proof that revolutionary change is possible .
The challenge is to see how this force can be organised , in each country and internationally , into a powerful force capable of defeating capitalism .
Perhaps we should n’t be too surprised by the content of this list , after all , there are ten people that absolutely did not deserve the prize they got .
This list looks at ten people who should absolutely have won a nobel prize for their contribution to writing .
Be sure to check out the other list after you read this one .
10 Jorge Luis Borges 1899 - 1986
Borges had a good twenty years to be considered for a Nobel , and was hot in the running for one for many of those years , but the Nobel Committee refused to award it to him because of his support for right - wing dictators like Pinochet .
Sounds like someone he should n’t have supported , but the Committee routinely awarded the prize to writers who supported left - wing dictators like Joseph Stalin .
Pinochet was worse than Stalin ?
Borges wrote the finest surreal literature to date , and won the first International Pulitzer Prize .
Politics seems a bad subject on which to argue .
9 Vladimir Nabokov 1899 - 1977
One of the greatest non-native writers of English , Nabokov ’s most famous novel , and his finest , is Lolita .
He wrote many more excellent works of fiction and criticism as well as translations of poetry .
He was nominated in 1974 , along with Graham Greene ( not the actor ) , and lost to Eyvind Johnson and Harry Martinson , joint winners .
The former was Swedish , and both were members of the Nobel Committee at the time .
8 W. H. Auden 1907 - 1973
One of the greatest 20th Century poets in history , he won the Pulitzer , the National Book Award and profoundly influenced all poets , especially English - speaking poets , who have come after him .
It is believed that the Committee turned him down because he made errors in a translation of a book by Nobel Peace Prize winner Dag Hammarskjold , and because he suggested that Hammarskjold was homosexual , like Auden .
7 Robert Frost 1874 -1963
The greatest 20th Century American Poet , by far .
The Bard of the Northeast .
He won 4 ( FOUR ! )
Pulitzer Prizes for his poetry , was awarded over 40 honorary doctorates from Oxford , Cambridge , Princeton and Harvard , among others .
The only other winner of four Pulitzers for literature is Eugene O’Neill , who did win a Nobel .
Frost ’s fourth Pulitzer was awarded 20 years before he died .
The Nobel Committee managed to ignore him for those 20 years .
6 Emile Zola 1840 - 1902
The greatest exemplar of the French school of literary naturalism .
He wrote over 30 novels , and any one of them could have gotten a Pulitzer today , without competition .
His 2 chances to win were spoiled for the same reason as the next entry .
5 Henrik Ibsen 1826 -1906
Norway ’s greatest author , and one of the finest modern dramatic writers in history .
He had 6 chances to win , since the award was begun in 1901 , but he lost due to arguments over Alfred Nobel ’s eligibility requirements , as laid out in his will .
He intended the winners to exhibit “ lofty and sound idealism . ”
But from 1901 to 1912 , the Committee believed that he meant “ ideal direction . ”
Apparently Ibsen , the father of modern drama , was not leading the literary world in the ideal direction .
4 Marcel Proust 1871 - 1922
The author of the most monumental work of 20th - Century fiction , A la Recherche du Temps Perdu , In Search of Lost Time .
It ’s a 7 - volume novel which exhibits one of the first , if not the first , example of stream of consciousness writing .
And yet , the Committee awarded the 1920 prize to Knut Hamsun ( Norwegian , which is closer to Swedish than French ) , for his monumental work , Growth of the Soil .
Which one do more people read today ?
Yep , In Search of Lost Time .
3 James Joyce 1882 -1941
The greatest Irish writer , besides W. B. Yeats who did win the prize .
Joyce is also the greatest writer of stream of consciousness fiction in history .
He practically invented the modern idea of speculative fiction , with his final work , Finnegans Wake , which is almost unreadable .
He considered it his finest work , but is more famous for Ulysses , the Dubliners and A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man .
2 Leo Tolstoy 1828-1910
The greatest exemplar of literary realism in history , and possibly the greatest novelist in history .
His two most titanic works , War and Peace and Anna Karenina , would have been more than sufficient to secure Knut Hamsun an award .
If only Tolstoy had been born a little closer to Sweden , the Committee might have overlooked their arguable translation of Nobel ’s will .
Apparently , the Committee did not consider Tolstoy to be leading the modern literary world in “ the ideal direction . ”
1 Mark Twain 1835 - 1910
The inventor of the American Novel , with Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn , and one of the all - time greatest novelists , humorists , essayists , critics and all - around authors .
Like Tolstoy , he had 10 chances to win , and ten times was passed over , in favor of the following eleven authors :
Sully Prudhomme , Theodor Mommsen , Bjornstjern Bjornson , Frederic Mistral and Jose Echeragay ( both in 1904 ) , Henryk Sienkiewicz , Giosue Carducci , Rudyard Kipling , Rudolf Christoph Eucken , Selma Lagerlof , Paul Heyse .
I ’m willing to bet you ’ve only heard of one of those .
I have three English degrees , and I ’ve only heard of one of them .
I have , however , heard of Mark Twain .
Hardly less startling than finding herself with breast cancer was Barbara Ehrenreich 's discovery of the " pink ribbon culture , " of , that is , the enforced cheerfulness and positive thinking that accompanied it ( and the teddy bears and " cornucopia of pink - ribbon - themed breast cancer products " which went with that ) .
Back in 2001 , she wrote a fierce , wonderful piece for Harper 's Magazine , " Welcome to Cancerland , " about her experience , and what to do with anger when it 's equated with " negativity , " and so ill health .
( A fine accompaniment for Ehrenreich on this subject would be Ordinary Life , Kathlyn Conway 's memoir of surviving cancer with plenty of anger and not the slightest belief in that disease 's transformative possibilities . )
Ehrenreich 's work is invariably bracing , to say the least -- in part because she 's a superb writer , in part because , as in her bestselling book Nickeled and Dimed and other works like Fear of Falling , she has a way of nailing the essential insecurity of life in a corporate / work world that has no pity to offer ( but oodles of " positive thinking " ) .
She 's always had a wicked tendency to enter worlds , turn them upside down , and report back , as she did recently for the New York Times in a four - part series on poverty in post - meltdown America .
The rites of positive - thinking and the extravagant promises of better health and well - being which are inseparable from them , she soon discovered , were hardly confined to the world of cancer patients .
In the ensuing years , she stumbled upon a multitude of worlds central to our lives -- from megachurches to mega- corporations -- in which an ideology of positive thinking ruled the roost .
Of course , until the fall of 2008 , we were also living through a gusher of positive thinking about an economy that -- so it was firmly believed -- could never go south .
As this piece is posted , Ehrenreich 's newest book , Bright - Sided : How the Relentless Promotion of Positive Thinking Has Undermined America , is just being published .
A full - scale report on the cult of positive thinking in America , its anti-Calvinist roots and present " successes , " it represents Ehrenreich at her best .
It 's hard to read without wondering whether this country is n't , in many ways , just a giant con game run by spielmeisters , touters , and flim - flam artists .

Feminism made women miserable .
This , anyway , seems to be the most popular takeaway from " The Paradox of Declining Female Happiness , " a recent study by Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers which purports to show that women have become steadily unhappier since 1972 .
Maureen Dowd and Arianna Huffington greeted the news with somber perplexity , but the more common response has been a triumphant : I told you so .
On Slate 's DoubleX website , a columnist concluded from the study that " the feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s gave us a steady stream of women 's complaints disguised as manifestos … and a brand of female sexual power so promiscuous that it celebrates everything from prostitution to nipple piercing as a feminist act -- in other words , whine , womyn , and thongs . "
Or as Phyllis Schlafly put it , more soberly : " [ T ] he feminist movement taught women to see themselves as victims of an oppressive patriarchy in which their true worth will never be recognized and any success is beyond their reach ...
[ S ] elf - imposed victimhood is not a recipe for happiness . "
But it 's a little too soon to blame Gloria Steinem for our dependence on SSRIs .
For all the high - level head - scratching induced by the Stevenson and Wolfers study , hardly anyone has pointed out ( 1 ) that there are some issues with happiness studies in general , ( 2 ) that there are some reasons to doubt this study in particular , or ( 3 ) that , even if you take this study at face value , it has nothing at all to say about the impact of feminism on anyone 's mood .
For starters , happiness is an inherently slippery thing to measure or define .
Philosophers have debated what it is for centuries , and even if we were to define it simply as a greater frequency of positive feelings than negative ones , when we ask people if they are happy , we are asking them to arrive at some sort of average over many moods and moments .
Maybe I was upset earlier in the day after I opened the bills , but then was cheered up by a call from a friend , so what am I really ?
In one well - known psychological experiment , subjects were asked to answer a questionnaire on life satisfaction , but only after they had performed the apparently irrelevant task of photocopying a sheet of paper for the experimenter .
For a randomly chosen half of the subjects , a dime had been left for them to find on the copy machine .
As two economists summarize the results : " Reported satisfaction with life was raised substantially by the discovery of the coin on the copy machine -- clearly not an income effect . "
As for the particular happiness study under discussion , the red flags start popping up as soon as you look at the data .
Not to be anti-intellectual about it , but the raw data on how men and women respond to the survey reveal no discernible trend to the naked eyeball .
Only by performing an occult statistical manipulation called " ordered probit estimates , " do the authors manage to tease out any trend at all , and it is a tiny one : " Women were one percentage point less likely than men to say they were not too happy at the beginning of the sample [ 1972 ] ; by 2006 women were one percentage more likely to report being in this category . "
Differences of that magnitude would be stunning if you were measuring , for example , the speed of light under different physical circumstances , but when the subject is as elusive as happiness -- well , we are not talking about paradigm - shifting results .
Furthermore , the idea that women have been sliding toward despair is contradicted by the one objective measure of unhappiness the authors offer : suicide rates .
Happiness is , of course , a subjective state , but suicide is a cold , hard fact , and the suicide rate has been the gold standard of misery since sociologist Emile Durkheim wrote the book on it in 1897 .
As Stevenson and Wolfers report -- somewhat sheepishly , we must imagine -- " contrary to the subjective well - being trends we document , female suicide rates have been falling , even as male suicide rates have remained roughly constant through most of our sample [ 1972-2006 ] . "
Women may get the blues ; men are more likely to get a bullet through the temple .
Another distracting little data point that no one , including the authors , seems to have much to say about is that , while " women " have been getting marginally sadder , black women have been getting happier and happier .
To quote the authors : " … happiness has trended quite strongly upward for both female and male African Americans …
Indeed , the point estimates suggest that well - being may have risen more strongly for black women than for black men . "
The study should more accurately be titled " The Paradox of Declining White Female Happiness , " only that might have suggested that the problem could be cured with melanin and Restylane .
But let 's assume the study is sound and that ( white ) women have become less happy relative to men since 1972 .
Does that mean that feminism ruined their lives ?
Not according to Stevenson and Wolfers , who find that " the relative decline in women 's well - being ... holds for both working and stay - at - home mothers , for those married and divorced , for the old and the young , and across the education distribution " -- as well as for both mothers and the childless .
If feminism were the problem , you might expect divorced women to be less happy than married ones and employed women to be less happy than stay - at - homes .
As for having children , the presumed premier source of female fulfillment :
They actually make women less happy .
And if the women 's movement was such a big downer , you 'd expect the saddest women to be those who had some direct exposure to the noxious effects of second wave feminism .
As the authors report , however , " there is no evidence that women who experienced the protests and enthusiasm in the 1970s have seen their happiness gap widen by more than for those women were just being born during that period . "
What this study shows , if anything , is that neither marriage nor children make women happy .
( The results are not in yet on nipple piercing . )
Nor , for that matter , does there seem to be any problem with " too many choices , " " work - life balance , " or the " second shift . "
If you believe Stevenson and Wolfers , women 's happiness is supremely indifferent to the actual conditions of their lives , including poverty and racial discrimination .
Whatever " happiness " is ...
So why all the sudden fuss about the Wharton study , which first leaked out two years ago anyway ?
Mostly because it 's become a launching pad for a new book by the prolific management consultant Marcus Buckingham , best known for First , Break All the Rules and Now , Find Your Strengths .
His new book , Find Your Strongest Life : What the Happiest and Most Successful Women Do Differently , is a cookie - cutter classic of the positive - thinking self - help genre : First , the heart - wrenching quotes from unhappy women identified only by their email names ( Countess1 , Luveyduvy , etc. ) , then the stories of " successful " women , followed by the obligatory self - administered test to discover " the role you were bound to play " ( Creator , Caretaker , Influencer , etc. ) , all bookended with an ad for the many related products you can buy , including a " video introduction " from Buckingham , a " participant 's guide " containing " exercises " to get you to happiness , and a handsome set of " Eight Strong Life Plans " to pick from .
The Huffington Post has given Buckingham a column in which to continue his marketing campaign .
It 's an old story :
If you want to sell something , first find the terrible affliction that it cures .
In the 1980s , as silicone implants were taking off , the doctors discovered " micromastia " -- the " disease " of small - breastedness .
More recently , as big pharma searches furiously for a female Viagra , an amazingly high 43 % of women have been found to suffer from " Female Sexual Dysfunction , " or FSD .
Now , it 's unhappiness , and the range of potential " cures " is dazzling : Seagrams , Godiva , and Harlequin , take note .

Ensign 's attorney acknowledged that the Nevada Republican 's parents paid nearly $ 100,000 to the family of his mistress after she and her husband left his staff in April 2008 .
Ensign 's parents paid mistress $ 96 K
Sen .
John Ensign 's parents shelled out big bucks to pay off their son's mistress , the latest twist in an unfolding scandal that has upended the political career of the one - time rising GOP star .
The scandal has also touched Sen. Tom Coburn ( R - Okla . ) , another prominent conservative , who revealed that he had confronted Ensign about the affair and urged him to end it , but says he will refuse to divulge any conversations with Ensign — even under inquiry from ethics investigators .

On Thursday , Ensign 's attorney said that the senator 's parents gave Doug Hampton , Cynthia Hampton and their two children gifts worth $ 96,000 in the form of a check .
The attorney , Paul Coggins , said that each gift was limited to $ 12,000 and " complied with tax rules governing gifts . "
The disclosure of the April 2008 payment seemed intended to head off growing questions about whether Ensign violated federal law by failing to report what Doug Hampton called a severance package worth more than $ 25,000 to his wife Cynthia , who left Ensign 's campaign staff on April 30 , 2008 .
Ensign was not required to report the giving of such gifts , and on Thursday , his attorney went to lengths to point out that the payments were made and " accepted " as gifts from personal accounts rather than as a severance package for their dismissal from his staff .
It 's unclear whether the Hamptons view the payments as a gift or as severance , and an attorney for the couple was n't reachable for comment .
The revelations of the payoff came as the scandal - quiet for several weeks - blossomed anew as Doug Hampton , the husband of Ensign 's mistress Cynthia , told a Nevada television show this week that Ensign left his family in shambles by relentlessly pursuing his wife , even after writing a February 2008 letter purporting to break off the affair .
The nine - month affair ended in August 2008 - some three months after the time both Hamptons left Ensign 's staff .
The sex scandal has already cost Ensign his position as the No. 4 Republican in Senate leadership and ended any hope he had of pursuing the 2012 GOP presidential nomination .
Hampton said that Coburn and other peers were involved in talks to urge Ensign to pay Hampton for the damage he caused his family - including potentially giving him " millions " of dollars .
Coburn has denied the charge .
" This was at the request of Tom Coburn and some people to try and help them manage John , " Hampton said Wednesday of the talk about payments , which he said were necessary because Ensign continued to " pursue " his wife and left his family in financial shambles .
" I did n't talk to John Ensign personally at all .
Our attorneys did talk .
Our attorneys absolutely talked , because Senator Tom Coburn asked and was involved in these negotiations out of good will and good faith , " Hampton said earlier in the broadcast .
Jon Ralston , a Las Vegas Sun columnist who interviewed Hampton , asked : " Tom Coburn , a U.S. Senator , told John Ensign , ' Listen , you 've got to deal with this .
Make these folks whole .
Let them get out of your life .
And , let 's move on .
Is n't that exactly what happened ? "
Hampton responded : " Absolutely . "
The second - part of the interview airs Thursday night .
Thursday morning , Coburn responded fiercely to Hampton , saying the former aide had misled the press and the public - and he said that any advice that he gave Ensign at the time of the affair was privileged because of his occupation as a physician and an ordained deacon .
" I 'm not going to go into that - that 's privileged communications .
I 'm never going to talk about that with anybody .
. .
I never will , not to a court of law , not to an Ethics Committee , not to anybody - because that is privileged communication that I will never reveal to anybody . "
" He is in error , and he 's manipulating the situation and you are all buying it , " Coburn said .
Whether Coburn 's claim of patient or clerical privacy would hold up in a legal or ethics case is murky , according to several legal experts .
Coburn acknowledged being present during a February 2008 confrontation when Hampton urged Ensign to break off the affair with his wife .
But he said he did not take part in pressing Ensign to write the letter to Hampton 's wife , as Hampton suggested in his interview , and " categorically denied " being involved in talks about payments to Hampton .
" Dr. Coburn did everything he could to encourage Sen. Ensign to end his affair and to persuade Sen .
Ensign to repair the damage he had caused to his own marriage and the Hampton 's marriage , " Coburn 's office said in a statement Wednesday .
" Had Sen. Ensign followed Dr. Coburn 's advice , this episode would have ended , and been made public , long ago . "
But Coburn 's office did not respond to an inquiry on why he supported Ensign for chairman of the Republican Policy Committee - the No. 4 position in GOP leadership - right after the 2008 elections even though he knew of the affair .
Ten years ago , Coburn criticized Bob Livingston for seeking the position of House speaker without first telling his colleagues that he had an extramarital affair .
But in the immediate cross-hairs is Ensign , who is facing calls from the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington for a Senate Ethics Committee investigation and a Justice Department criminal investigation .
Leaders of the Senate Ethics Committee said it was their policy not to discuss possible investigations .
Asked if his fellow Nevadan should face an ethics inquiry , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) said Thursday : " I am not answering questions about John Ensign . "
Melanie Sloan , head of CREW , said that even if Ensign 's camp claims the cash payments were gifts , it does not mean that all parties associated with the transaction agreed that they were gifts .
And even if Ensign 's parents made the payments , they still must be disclosed on his financial disclosure if they were associated with the Hamptons ' work on his staff , according to Sloan .
" Coming up with a new explanation today ... does not deal with your problem from yesterday , " Sloan said .
Sloan said that her group is considering filing an ethics complaint against Coburn too if he declines to meet with investigators about his knowledge of the affair .
Ensign 's father is a casino mogul , and the senator 's lawyer said that his parents " decided to make the gifts out of concern for the well - being of long - time family friends during a difficult time . "
Ensign 's attorney said that none of the gifts came from campaign or official funds and were not related to his official duties , saying that he complied with all ethics laws .
" The gifts are consistent with a pattern of generosity by the Ensign family to the Hamptons and others , " the lawyer said .
Video of police assault on Ian Tomlinson , who died at G20 protest guardian .co.uk
The Metropolitan police learned today that one of its officers could face prosecution for the manslaughter of Ian Tomlinson at the G20 demonstrations .
The officer , a member of the Met 's Territorial Support Group ( TSG ) , struck Tomlinson with a baton and shoved him to the ground moments before he died .
Announcing that it had completed its criminal inquiry into the newspaper vendor 's death , the Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) said it had handed a file to the Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) .
Senior lawyers from the Special Crime Division of the CPS will now consider the evidence provided by the IPCC to decide whether to prosecute the officer , and if so , on what charges .
The IPCC questioned the officer under caution for manslaughter in April .
The officer came forward after the Guardian broadcast footage of him striking Tomlinson with a baton and shoving him to the ground at the 1 April protests .
In determining whether he should face trial , CPS lawyers will consider the footage , along with other documents and witness statements .
The nature of the case means the director of public prosecutions , Keir Starmer QC , will be involved in deciding whether charges should be brought .
His lawyers are bound by a two - test rule requiring a " realistic prospect of conviction " in a prosecution that is deemed to be in the public interest .
In the event that the CPS successfully prosecutes the officer for Tomlinson 's killing , he would become the first British police officer ever to be convicted for manslaughter for actions while on duty .
The maximum penalty is life imprisonment .
In a statement , the IPCC said the investigation had been one of the largest it had ever undertaken and had been " the subject of huge public scrutiny " .
More than 40 IPCC investigators and other members of staff from all five regional offices were involved in the case , it said .
" We have had a remarkable response from the public and I would like to thank those people who have contacted us for all their help , " said Deborah Glass , the IPCC commissioner for London .
Tomlinson 's widow , Julia , said : " It has been a very difficult four months since Ian died and it is a relief to see some progress .
The last information that the coroner put out was Dr Cary 's view that Ian died from internal bleeding .
" Video footage made it clear to us , and everyone else , that Ian was the victim of an unprovoked assault by a police officer .
If there is going to be any justice then it must be left for a jury to decide if the police officer is guilty of killing Ian .
I hope the CPS will get the case in front of a jury as soon as possible .
We would like to thank everyone who came forward as witnesses . "
Glass said most of the video evidence passed to the CPS was collected by members of the public on cameras or mobile phones .
" Over 190 premises were visited during a CCTV trawl .
This resulted in footage being obtained from more than 220 cameras .
In addition , police footage has been reviewed , including that taken from police evidence gatherers and the police helicopter , as well as footage from people 's mobile phones and cameras .
This amounted to over 1,200 hours of footage , which has been reviewed by a dedicated team of IPCC investigators . "
Statements were taken from 193 members of the public , as well as police officers and staff , and medical experts .
The 47 - year - old Tomlinson had been trying to walk home from work past police cordons around the Bank of England when he was attacked on Royal Exchange Buildings , a pedestrianised passage , at about 7.20 pm on 1 April .
The officer 's badge numbers were covered and his face concealed beneath a balaclava .
Tomlinson had his hands in his pockets and his back to the officer when he was attacked .
No police officer went to his aid , and it was left to a bystander to lift him to his feet .
He stumbled around 100 metres down Cornhill , clutching his side , before collapsing a second time .
The officer is understood to have faced allegations of aggression earlier in his career , after becoming involved in a road rage incident while off duty .
The Met 's vetting procedures are said to have failed to notice that the officer had an unresolved disciplinary matter .
Tomlinson 's death led to widespread criticism of police brutality at the G20 demonstrations .
Two parliamentary inquiries and a national review of policing by the official policing inspectorate have criticised the Met for tactics used against what were largely peaceful protesters in the City of London .
The IPCC has received an additional 277 complaints about policing of the demonstration .
Police initially led Tomlinson 's wife and nine children to believe he died of a heart attack after being caught up in the demonstration .
In statements to the press , police claimed attempts by police to save his life by resuscitation were impeded by protesters .
The IPCC did not launch its criminal inquiry until six days after Tomlinson 's death , when the Guardian gave the watchdog a dossier of evidence , including video footage and witness statements , that contradicted the police version of events .
Before then , City of London police were allowed to run the inquiry with some supervision from IPCC investigators .
After watching the video of the attack , a senior City of London investigator told the family Tomlinson 's assailant could be a member of the public " dressed in police uniform " .
The IPCC is still conducting a second inquiry into whether the Met and City of London police misled the public over his death .
An early postmortem examination concluded that Tomlinson died of a heart attack .
Police released a statement that he " died of natural causes " on the way home from work , but failed to mention the numerous injuries the pathologist found on his body , including bruises , lacerations and large amounts of blood in his stomach .
A second examination concluded that Tomlinson did of internal bleeding in the stomach , discrediting the first , which was conducted by a forensic pathologist who has since been suspended from an accredited government register of experts pending two investigations into his conduct .
The IPCC said it had asked the CPS to consider charges against a suspended TSG sergeant who is accused of assaulting two women in the space of 24 hours .
The sergeant was caught on film striking one of the women , Nicola Fisher , at a memorial vigil for Tomlinson .
Having formed in 1961 , Peter , Paul and Mary 's achievement was to bring folk music out of the socks - and - sandals division into the commercial mainstream .
The two guitarists in the band , Peter Yarrow and Noel " Paul " Stookey , may have appeared unremarkable in their beatnik - style beards ; the blonde and willowy Mary Travers , on the other hand , invested the group with a kind of Nordic glamour .
Their manager , Albert B Grossman ( who was also to handle Bob Dylan ) , was adamant that she should retain an aura of mystery about her , and insisted that she never spoke on stage .

PS3's new 3D Mode Captured on Video , Coming in 2010 to All Existing Games
You know what 's absolutely useless ?
A video of Wipeout HD being played in 3D , with some schmuck wearing 3D glasses and babbling on about how much fun he 's having .
Well , that schmuck is this Engadget editor , the video can be found after the break , and we 've gotta say : we loved it .
Especially for something like Wipeout HD , whose neon - infused tracks make for an almost too convenient example of rapidly approaching vanishing points , we 'd say 3D could really be a quasi - " killer app " for consoles going forward -- especially if those fancy new motion controllers do n't catch on for Microsoft and Sony .
In many ways , 3D just seems to make more sense in a video game than for a movie , and the whole problem of finding content to deliver in the format has already been solved : a software update for the PS3 sometime in 2010 will enable it to provide a 3D viewing experience to " all " existing games on the system .
We 're sure there will be some exceptions , but it sounds very promising .
The console itself pumps out a quite regular signal over HDMI , which the TV syncs up with your 3D glasses .
A 200Hz TV , for instance , alternates 1080 p frames , with 100 Hz for each eye .
Of course , you 'll need a brand new TV , but at least it wo n't be restricted to just Sony televisions .
Start saving those pennies !
Irreconcilable Differences and Runaway Projects
A runaway project is like a married couple on the brink of divorce .
There are two opposing points of view , both sides are usually angry , each side blames the other , legal action is imminent , and a lot of time and money is being wasted .
So why do projects go into a runaway mode ?
It ’s usually because requirements are changing faster than the project team can keep up with them .
It ’s like swimming upstream in a tidal wave — no matter how hard you swim you still get swept back by the overwhelming water .
But that just raises a different question , does n’t it ?
Why is it that requirements are changing so much ?
Should n’t requirements change the most at the beginning of the project while they ’re still being defined , and then settle down once the requirements are written down and agreed to ?
Yes , of course , but that “ normal ” way to define requirements is usually based on some erroneous assumptions .
The Usual Erroneous Project Assumptions
Most runaway projects start by making one or more of these assumptions :
It makes sense to freeze requirements at a moment in time and then stick to them , no matter what happens .
The requirements process is perfect and what ’s written down is exactly what the customer wants .
The requirements as written are totally unambiguous , consistent , and doable .
The customer fully understands what ’s been written down and agrees that it ’s correct .
The project team members fully understand what ’s been written down and plan to do exactly what the requirements say .
The project estimates are in fact based on the requirements — not on a similar project done elsewhere for a different set of requirements .
The project will be completed quickly enough that no requirements will change during the project work .
None of these assumptions are valid .
In most cases we base a project on incomplete requirements that are likely to change during the project — requirements that are n’t totally understood by either the customers or the project team .
In fact , when you think about it , it ’s a miracle that any IT projects are ever completed on time and within budget .
The latest statistics from the Standish Group show that only 32 % of IT projects are completed on time and within budget , so in fact it does seem to take a minor miracle to make a project succeed .
The Path to a Runaway
Let ’s look at a typical runaway project .
Some of them start on time and even look pretty good for a while .
But pretty soon minor things start to get on people ’s nerves .
A requirement changes , and the impact of the change on the project is underestimated .
A new technology turns out to be more difficult to use than anyone thought .
A higher - up agrees to a change without understanding the huge effect it will have .
A late delivery of a key subproject causes everyone to reevaluate what ’s going on .
Changes begin to accelerate , making the project later .
The later the project gets , the more changes there are .
The change rate exceeds the capacity of the project team , and someone naively suggests that more project resource ought to be added .
Of course the additional resource just makes everything even later due to coordination issues and getting everyone up to speed , and the late project builds up momentum .
The “ burn rate ” of the project increases to the point where it gets more executive attention , and this leads to extra executive reviews , which tie up critical project resource and make the project even later .
Runaway projects are n’t called “ runaway ” for nothing .
They burn money like crazy , they get later with every passing day , and they often ca n’t be stopped except by killing the project outright .
Go back to the married couple on the brink of divorce .
What could be done to try to save the marriage ?
Many people try counseling — bringing in a third party to help with communication [ more on that subject next week ] .
I ’m told that most marital problems have their root in communication , and if two people can really talk to each other and if they really want the marriage to be saved , then they can usually work things out .
Why do n’t we attack runaway projects the same way ?
It ’s the same issue — communication .
The customers want something , and the project team is having trouble delivering it .
There are really only two choices : revise the requirements to deliver what ’s possible , or figure out a way to deliver what the customers want .
Usually the solution is a little of each .
What ’s different about the runaway project is its scale .
Big projects involve big egos , politics , and all of the baggage of previous projects gone wrong .
Working things out between customers and the project team is n’t just working out a disagreement between two people .
It ’s working out many disagreements among huge groups of people .
It ’s owning up to mistakes that were made .
It ’s accepting the fact that you may not get everything you want .
It ’s making compromises .
Conclusion
Marriages tend to collapse when the husband and wife lose respect for each other ’s goals .
Many marriage ceremonies recognize three interests in a marriage : the husband ’s , the wife ’s , and the interest of the married couple together .
All three interests have to be recognized , discussed , and prioritized .
It ’s the same thing with projects .
There are three interests in a project : the customer ’s , the project team ’s , and the interest of overall project success .
Runaway projects happen when the focus shifts off of overall project success and instead onto the individual interests of the customers or the project team .
Irreconcilable differences and runaway projects go hand in hand .
And after a divorce or a cancelled project , it ’s only the lawyers who end up ahead of the game .
Next week : IT Marriage Counseling — how to do it , and what to look for in a counselor
Yet another sci - fi milestone is upon us : microchips implanted under your skin and used to identify you .
The VeriChip is the first radio - frequency identification ( RFID ) microchip that ’s been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in humans .
The chip is the size of a long grain of rice , and can be implanted pretty much anywhere in the body ( most commonly along the tricep ) .
Depending on how it ’s used , the chip could do anything from telling doctors your medical background to buying you a round at the club .
Outside of human bodies , RFID is already used for a wide range of purposes .
If you pay highway tolls electronically , that little box in your car has an RFID tag in it .
Lots of folks implant their pets with RFID chips in case they get lost , as animal shelters increasingly scan pets for them .
Wal - Mart tracks their shipments with RFID , which has apparently revolutionized supply chain management .
Hell , there ’s even one in your passport .
But why put one inside your body ?
As interesting as it might be to have your ID show up on an x-ray , most people would rather suffer a line at the DMV than a rice - injection .
Sure , it might make for good conversation at a party .
But is that worth the needle ?
What would it take to get one under your skin ?
Emergency Situations
VeriChip Corp. markets their product to address what they call “ a serious need for personal identification and information in emergency situations . ”
Over the past two years , the company has piloted their product with 200 Alzheimer ’s patients in a Florida facility .
Because of their condition , many patients are unable to effectively communicate if they are admitted to the hospital without caregivers present .
The VeriChip contains a 16 - digit ID number which links the recipient to a secure computer database where their medical information is stored .
The chips are used to replace MedicAlert wristbands , which can be removed or damaged .
Most other proposed applications for in - body RFID are medical in nature : providing doctors immediately with a patient ’s medical records , or identification if they are unconscious or unable to communicate .
Still , these applications require that each hospital contain a computer database to connect an individual ’s tag with their information .
That ’s probably a long way off .
Luckily , the hospital is n’t the only testing ground for RFID chips under the skin .
A nightclub in Barcelona called Baja Beach has started offering chip implants to its customers , giving them access to VIP lounges and letting clubbers buy drinks by acting as a debit account .
Who wants to carry a wallet or purse when the dress - code is board shorts and bikinis ?
Baja Beach contracted none other than VeriChip Corp. to fashion their subcutaneous membership cards .
I guess last call counts as an “ emergency situation . ”
In the past , VeriChip Corp claimed their chips could not be counterfeited : if your ID is under the skin , it ca n’t be so easily stolen .
Wrong .
At a hacker conference in 2006 , Annalee Newitz and Jonathan Westhues showed that they had successfully cloned an RFID chip implanted in Newitz .
A home - built antenna let the hackers steal the unique ID contained on the chip , which apparently lacks any sort of security device .
If RFID chips are n’t exactly secure , most people wo n’t want their social security number contained on one .
After all , if a doctor ’s office can pull your medical records from the chip ( and a hacker can , too ) what ’s stopping your insurance agency ?
Or identity theives ?
That limits the chips to using random numbers , corresponding to useful information on a separate and secure database .
And until those databases are standardized and prevalent , having a chip in your body wo n’t speed up your doctor ’s visit very much .
Counter -ID
As you might already imagine , in - body RFID chips have spawned a considerable backlash of protest .
The group AntiChips calls the VeriChip “ human branding , ” especially in the case of the “ volunteers ” for the program with Alzheimer ’s disease .
They also claim the chips cause cancer ( citing a number of animal studies ) , and that the FDA approval should be revoked ( more info here ) .
There are also a number of additional risks which the FDA already recognizes : tissue reactions , migration of the chip , even the chance that the chip could carry a current from MRI magnets and burn the patient .
And that ’s just the beginning .
The chips have been called the precursor to a perfect authoritarian state , letting Uncle Sam ( or Illuminati , or whoever ) track your each and every move .
On the other end of the spectrum , some religious groups ( well , okay , this one ) have implicated the VeriChip in a plot involving the mark of the beast ( 666 ) , part of a conspiracy theory to rival the most imaginative of left - wingers .
Wait , this one too .
But if I can interject my own opinion , I ’d say the whole business is a bit overhyped .
Honestly , there are n’t really any good applications for in - body RFID .
Sure , it could hypothetically improve health - care ( if and when the patient is unconscious ) , but for that system to be effective , every hospital would need to have integrated the chips into their standard procedures .
It wo n’t replace a photo ID in your wallet anytime soon .
And unless you ’re grinding some PYT * in Barcelona , you ’ll probably pay for that Pabst with good old fashioned cash .
Take ( a ) the lack of practical applications , plus ( b ) legitimate concerns over ID hacking and health risks , and poof !
There goes the revolution .
If any readers have ideas for scenarios in which an in - body RFID would be practical & useful , please do share ( comments below ) .

It ’s that time of year again !
Football season is upon us , and this year ’s college football game , NCAA Football 10 from EA Sports , brings some major improvements to the series , including the addition of trophies .
While this may not seem like a big deal to a lot of gamers , it has never been implemented in an EA Sports football title before , and is a big selling factor .
And the list of upgrades only starts there .
To elaborate on some of the upgrades from the ’09 version , NCAA Football 10 looks better , controls better , and is a lot more realistic .
The defense not only reads the player more accurately , it also adapts to the choices a player makes within the game .
If there are only a select few plays that the player runs , the A.I. will quickly catch on and shut them down on the field with the necessary adjustments .
To succeed , the player must know their play book particularly well .
The days of successful “ one trick wonders ” are more or less a thing of the past .
And it ’s because of this that the game shrugs off the arcade - like feel of prior installments in the series .
The Dynasty fanatics should be happy to know that they can finally run a full online dynasty with their friends on PlayStation Network .
And if the player grows tired of the online aspects of the dynasty , they can even convert it to an offline version within the menu options .
Based upon the actions of the player throughout their completed games , the system evaluates them not only their performance , but their sportsmanship .
For example , if it ’s 4th and long and the player decides to ‘ go for it ’ rather than punt the ball , this action will have a negative impact on their sportsmanship rating .
This seems to be an attempt by EA to balance everything out and make the game seem a lot more realistic overall .
Judging from the way it plays out in Season Showdown and the online aspects , EA did a good job by putting this in .
And though it can definitely be improved upon in future iterations , it ’s nice to see them taking steps in the right direction .
Doing so makes the game more fair for players by shutting down unrealistic exploitations .
When it comes to the other Dynasty aspects of the game it is fantastic .
All of the modes you ’ve come to love are still available , but with tweaks made to fully optimize them .
New EnergyStar Standards Released for Televisions
September 11th , 2009 by Beth Graddon - Hodgson
Attaining an EnergyStar rating is crucial for companies creating home electronics and appliances if they want to appeal to the eco-minded or cost - conscious consumer , which these days can be found in virtually every North American and many European households .
New standards have just been released ( on September 3rd ) that encourage television manufacturers to reduce their carbon footprint and the size of their screens .
The Version4 EnergyStar sticker which will be released in May 2010 will require that all TVs be 40 % more efficient than their counterparts that meet the qualifications from the EnergyStar rating today .
The Version5 sticker will have even stricter requirements with a 65 % increase in energy efficiency over the current EnergyStar certified entertainment technologies that are in homes today .
EnergyStar ratings will be based on TVs that are in “ on ” mode , although they will also evaluate those that are in stand by or downloading programming without viewing .
TVs over 50 inches are not likely to meet EnergyStar rating standards since they have the same efficiency requirements as those 50 inches and under at 108 KW .
Without the EnergyStar rating on larger televisions , home owners looking to reduce their consumption by purchasing home entertainment systems with the efficiency rating will need look on the smaller end of the television spectrum .
Since television energy consumption can equate to 50,000 KW per year in the US alone , tightening the requirements for EnergyStar standards will help cut costs and reduce the carbon footprint we each make in our enjoyment of home entertainment .

CrossFit BS
What is CrossFit ( CF ) ??
In a nut shell it ? s performing movements and or exercises under time that are continuously varied from workout to workout .?
Started in the mid 1990?s , this training system does have value in improving ones fitness level ; that ?s where the benefits stop .
CF ?s upside according to its proponents is being a total - body conditioning workout that is purposefully varied , which inhibits boredom .?
I think it ?s a home run for fitness enthusiasts because the workouts are challenging and competitive .?
CF ?s inherent difficulty , notice I said difficulty not intensity , also benefits the average person because most people do not train hard enough to elicit any measurable result .
The seemingly illogical CF programming is an effort to challenge as many movement patterns and energy systems as possible .?
?CF is not a specialized fitness program but a deliberate attempt to optimize physical competence in each of the ten recognized fitness domains .?
They are cardiovascular and respiratory endurance , stamina , flexibility , power , speed , coordination , agility , balance and accuracy .?
Says founder Greg Glassman who is also known for his outrageous unsubstantiated claims about the benefits of CF .
Its the lack of specificity that gives CF it ?s upside and its downside .
Because the body is receiving multiple forms of stimulus the body never excels at any of them .?
Somebody who starts out as a crossfitter and was not strong or muscular through previous training , will not make appreciable gains in strength or muscularity .?
Sure , one can get very fit , but that ’s too one dimensional .
Intensity and duration exist in an inverse ratio .
In other words , as the intensity while performing an exercise increases , the amount of time one can perform the exercise decreases .?
CF proponents claim their program utilizes a high level of intensity .?
Well , there is no such thing as performing a movement or exercise for 5 , 10 , or 30 minutes and training with high intensity .?
This is a physiological fact , not a choice , and certainly not something you can ? build ? up to .
Is CF difficult ?
You bet your ass .?
Is CF Intense ?
No .?
This can best be explained by comparing a sprinter and a miler .?
Any type of endurance event is by its very nature of low intensity .?
Sprinters are always sucking wind at the end of a race .?
In contrast , long distance runners are usually breathing close to normal after several miles of running .?
It doesn ?t matter how long a world class sprinter trains , because he is going all out physiologically , he is breathing hard every race .?
Sprinters , as a result of their intense training are far more muscular than the thin distance runners .?
This is not to say distance runners don?t work hard , they do , but the body can only perform at a high level of intensity for so long .?
And intensity is a prerequisite to gaining strength and muscle .
You ?ll never get truly strong performing Cross Fit .
No matter what Glassman or other CF coaches claim , it ? s not going to happen .?
A CrossFitter will never be able to achieve strength gains anywhere near the level of a powerlifter or even a strength enthusiast .?
The vast majority of crossfitters have no appreciable strength what - so - ever .?
The CrossFitters who are fairly strong or muscular , are former bodybuilders , powerlifters and weight lifting enthusiasts .?
Training that targets endurance strength does n’t increase maximal strength .?
Training for maximal strength , however , does increase one ’s strength endurance . ?
If getting stronger , especially maximal strength , is your goal CF is n?t for you .
You will not attain any measure of lean mass .
CF?s founder Greg Glassman claims CF , for the natural athlete , is better at building muscle than traditional hypertrophy weight training .?
As with most of his claims there ?s no science or empirical data to back this assertion .?
While touting the muscle building capacity of CF he fails to explain , the lack of muscularity among most CF athletes .?
Crossfitters don?t come close to the muscular development of a natural bodybuilder .??
At best some Crossfitters look athletic , which is great , if that ? s your goal .?
But , if you want to be muscular , CF is not for you especially if you ?re a hard gainer .
It ?s been well documented that within the fitness industry for decades that brief high intensity muscular contraction is the most important stimulus for building muscle and strength .?
The duration of the exercise or movement is crucial , but can be counter - productive .?
Sets lasting 5 , 10 , 30 minutes are completely of target for building anything but endurance .
If overall conditioning is what you want ??
If improving your physique is what you want ??
If increasing your endurance is what you want ??
Learn how to train each energy system properly for optimum results .?
Cross
Fit needs to be taken for what it really is , a great fitness program .?
That ?s where it ends .
Aircraft Carriers Vs. the New Battleships
We have made specific and proven advances in our missile defense technology , particularly with regard to land - and sea - based interceptors and the sensors that support them .
Our new approach will , therefore , deploy technologies that are proven and cost - effective and that counter the current threat , and do so sooner than the previous program .
Because our approach will be phased and adaptive , we will retain the flexibility to adjust and enhance our defenses as the threat and technology continue to evolve .
President Barack Obama on replacing the land based BMD shield in Europe for now with a sea based deterrent .
Last week , President Obama — on my recommendation and with the advice of his national - security team and the unanimous support of our senior military leadership — decided to discard that plan in favor of a vastly more suitable approach .
In the first phase , to be completed by 2011 , we will deploy proven , sea - based SM - 3 interceptor missiles — weapons that are growing in capability — in the areas where we see the greatest threat to Europe .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates in a NY Times editorial .
With the blessings of the President and Defense Secretary , we can officially declare America ’s guided missile cruisers and destroyers as the modern battleships .
Their obvious ability to contend with an assortment of air and surface threats , as well as shoot down rogue ballistic missiles that threaten our nation and its allies , means the new battleships have gone beyond the role of mere carrier escorts , to a key strategic asset in their own right .
There is of course , the realization that this new found importance is shared with the attack submarine , a formidable asset to the nation ’s defense as well .
However it is also clear there are still numerous functions only the surface ship can perform , not the least of which is ballistic missile defense .
While the land forces have been grappling with the problem for decades of “ hitting a bullet with a bullet ” , the Navy has almost seamless adapted its proven Aegis phased array radar and the Standard missile to this end , seeing it successfully shoot down missiles in 14 out of 18 tests .
This amazing and potent capability in one surface combatant begs the question ”
Are the new battleships still bound under the protective wing of naval airpower ? ”
As we recorded earlier in the week the handwriting has been on the wall for airpower for some time .
With the ability to dominate the airspace for 200-300 nautical miles , this is yet another role taken from the $ 6 - $ 8 billion aircraft carrier plus its equally costly jets on a less costly ( though still expensive ) platform .
We envision a scenario where the Ticonderoga cruisers and the Arleigh Burke destroyers with their unmatched interceptor missiles operate in high threat areas without their giant motherships in support .
As it seems prohibitive for aircraft to fly in some areas dominated by SAM batteries , especially the fearsome Russian S-300 and S - 400 , how much more would the traditional fighter - bomber be at risk against Aegis , the best anti-air system of the age ?
We can in fact have such a scenario , in one of handful of sea fights in the Missile Age : Unable to afford an offensive attack aircraft carrier arm and still maintain a viable fleet , the British Royal Navy in 1982 was forced to seek alternatives .
Acknowledging that her small Harrier carriers could not promise complete air superiority over the Falkland Islands , she was forced to rely more on her guided missile destroyers and frigates .
The outcome is well known , with the invasion force not only surviving but prevailing over the numerous Argentine aerial armada , to safely see the troops ashore , the islands safely back under Crown protection .
All this occurred long before Britain built her own high tech missile warships , the Type 45 , with no Aegis - like warship to guard the South Atlantic Task Force .
Finally , Information Dissemination wonders
“ As the Navy is assuming a new role with Arleigh Burke destroyers , what platform has the endurance to make up for the presence requirements ? ”
But is it more battleships we need or just spartan hulls and lots of them ?
The rough economy is inflicting hardship on people even in death .
Coroners and funeral directors in several cities say the number of people seeking government - paid funerals , cremations and burials is spiking .
Most counties and states will use public money to cremate or bury people who are too poor to pay for private services .
" People just are n't in a position to pay $ 7,000 for a private funeral and burial , " says Lt. David Smith of the Los Angeles County Coroner 's Office , where the number of people seeking county burial has nearly doubled since last year .
The percentage of people in poverty in the USA is climbing , says Gregory Acs , a senior fellow at The Urban Institute .
When the recession started at the end of 2007 , about 12.5 % of the U.S. population was considered impoverished , up from 11.7 % in 2001 , he says .
Among the counties noting a surge in requests for indigent burials : • The Los Angeles County Coroner 's Office handled 205 indigent deaths in the last six months of 2007 .
This year , from Jan. 1 to June 30 , the office handled 404 indigent deaths — a 97 % increase .
" It has put a major financial strain on this department , " Smith says .
" I need to come up with $ 12,000 a month in a budget that 's locked up tight as a drum . "
Then in February , the county crematory notified the coroner it was overflowing with natural death cases and could n't handle cases from the coroner , who handles accidental deaths , homicides and unidentified people , Smith says .
" My body count in my crypt swelled to near capacity , " Smith says , as he sought a crematory to handle the excess corpses .
• Las Vegas has seen a 22 % increase in indigent cremations and burials since last year , says Dan Kulin , a spokesman for Clark County , Nev .
In the budget year that ended June 30 , 2008 , the county handled 741 indigent deaths .
In the same period ending June this year , the county handled 904 deaths , he says .
" It 's a sign of the times , " Kulin says .
• Kenton County , Ky. , is expecting a record year of indigent burials .
The 29 indigent burials as of Aug. 13 are more than double last year 's total of 12 , says Don Catchen , whose funeral home has the county contract for indigent burials .
Catchen offers a minimal private funeral and cremation for $ 1,400 .
" With the economy being what it is , some of the lesser - income families … are barely surviving and they do n't have any money to pay for even a minimum funeral service , " he says .
" I 've had the ( county ) contract 14 years , " he says , " and it 's never been like this before . "

The Perseids occur when the Earth passes through dusty cometary debris Skygazers are preparing for the high point of the annual Perseid meteor shower .
The shower , which reaches its peak on Wednesday , occurs when the Earth passes through a stream of dusty debris from the comet Swift - Tuttle .
As this cometary " grit " strikes our atmosphere , it burns up , often creating streaks of light across the sky .
The meteors appear to come from a point called a " radiant " in the constellation of Perseus - hence the name Perseid .
" Earth passes through the densest part of the debris stream sometime on 12 August .
Then , you could see dozens of meteors per hour , " said Bill Cooke of Nasa 's meteoroid environment office .
No special equipment is required to watch the sky show .
Astronomers say binoculars might help , but will also restrict the view to a small part of the sky .
The Perseids can appear in any part of the sky , but their tails all point back to the radiant in the constellation Perseus .
Stargazers are advised to lie on a blanket or a reclining chair to get the best view .
PERSEID METEOR SHOWER
The tails of the Perseids point back to a " radiant " in the constellation Perseus
They can appear anywhere in the sky Composed of dusty debris from Comet Swift - Tuttle
Budding astronomers are being urged to take part in the first " Twitter Meteorwatch " .
Astronomers from around the world will be live - tweeting images of the meteors , as well as pictures of the Moon , Jupiter and other celestial objects .
The " 48 - hour Twitter marathon " will form part of the International Year of Astronomy 2009 ( IYA2009 ) .

In the UK , the best times to see the Perseids are likely to be on the morning of 12 August before dawn and from late evening on the 12th through to the early hours of the 13 August .
This year , light from the last quarter Moon will interfere significantly with the view .
The UK's National Trust has published online guides to seven top Perseid viewing sites , including coastal spots , nature reserves and national parks .
Jo Burgon , head of access and recreation at the Trust , said : " Light pollution from our towns and cities has increased so much in recent years , but head out to the countryside for the perfect place to explore the beauty of the night sky , away from the intrusive glow . "
The rock and dust fragments which cause the shower were left behind by Comet Swift - Tuttle when it last came near the Sun .
The comet orbits the Sun once every 130 years and last swept through the inner Solar System in 1992 .

Nobody has ever read an Objective newspaper .
If I bother to say this to a journalist , he inevitably froths at the mouth before rebutting :
“ You ’re only saying that because you ’re a socialist . ”
Everyone says it , I reply .
Leftists , Centrists , Rightists .
“ Exactly !
Everyone criticizes us .
That shows that we ’re fair . ”
Actually , if everyone hates you , it ’s probably not because you ’re fair .
It ’s probably because you suck .
The propagation of the mythical notion of Journalistic Objectivity should be understood as an advertising ploy .
Remember that the News Media deals in information , which , before the Digital Revolution , was mostly scarce .
To gain their audiences , outlets needed to distinguish their information from their competitors ’ .
The New York Times cites its relevancy ( “ All the news that ’s fit to print ” ) .
Fox pretends it ’s fair and balanced .
Others play up their speed , the usefulness of their news , the reputations of their contributors and so on .
These are exactly the kind of claims you would expect from information peddlers seeking bigger audiences .
When a newspaper says it ’s Objective , it ’s saying that it contains the Truth .
Its reporters and editors are therefore trained professionals in the field of Truth .
And they should not be troubled with the irrelevant objections of its Truth - deficient audience .
The lay public , you see , will inevitably lapse into undisciplined , subjective thinking .
Fortunately , we get the last laugh .
Newspapers are dying .
The Internet has democratized Information , and now the public – armed with free publishing – does its own reporting , fact checking and analyzing .
It ’s foolish to believe the NYT has exclusive access to the Truth when we can read every day about its oversights and misjudgments .
Yes , the reporter and the editor produce articles in accord with professional principles , but those articles are also shaped by imprecise things like intuition , timing , and space restrictions .
News stories are n’t immaculate conceptions .
They are subjective interpretations .
Like yours .
Like mine .

Macedonia and Greece :
What is the basis for a reconciliation ?
A Greek blogger called Omadeon has written a critique of me , entitled ‘ Dr Hoare ’s Balkan excesses need … anti-nationalist critics ’ .
Well , I do n’t admit to any excesses , but I do welcome anti-nationalist critics .
Omadeon deserves credit for writing against Srebrenica - genocide denial and for his statement that ‘ I think Greece owes an apology to Bosnia , for the one - sided support of Serbia by most Greeks ’ .
He deserves credit too for his rejection of some of the excesses of Greek nationalism .
Unfortunately , Omadeon nevertheless shares the Greek - nationalist blind - spot with regard to Macedonia .
He refers to the Republic of Macedonia in a derogatory manner , as ‘ Slavo - Albanian Macedonia ’ , and puts the words ‘ Macedonia ’ and ‘ Macedonian ’ in inverted commas when referring to the Republic of Macedonia and the Macedonian nation .
He describes the Macedonian identity as a ‘ fiction ’ .
He wrote a letter to the New York Times in April 2008 in which he condemned the newspaper for its criticism of Greek policy with regard to Macedonia , asserted the alleged Greekness of Alexander the Great and the ancient Macedonians , and demanded that the contemporary Macedonians change their name to ‘ Slav Macedonians ’ .
Above all , he seems absolutely obsessed with telling the Macedonians that they should abandon the identity that they want to have and adopt the identity that he wants them to have , which is a ‘ Slavic ’ identity ’
( ‘A SANE attitude , on behalf of Slav - Macedonia , would be the simple RECOGNITION of their ESSENTIALLY SLAVIC national identity ; something they have EVERY RIGHT to be PROUD of ….’ ) .
But a given identity is something that people either feel for themselves , or they do n’t .
It is not up to Omadeon and the Greeks to decide what sort of identity Macedonians should have .
Consequently , I am afraid that Omadeon , although he appears to be an honest and decent individual in most respects , is very far from being an ‘ anti-nationalist ’ .
In fact , his writings on Macedonia highlight the erroneous way in which ethno- nationalists interpret modern national politics .
This includes :
1 ) A belief that modern nations can be traced back , in unbroken continuity , to ancient or medieval peoples : the modern Greeks to ancient Greeks ; the modern Macedonians to medieval Slavs ; etc .
2 ) A consequent belief that one has , on the basis of one ’s own ethno- nationalist interpretation of ancient and medieval history , the right to accuse other nations of being ‘ invented ’ or having ‘ fictional ’ identities .
3 ) An inability to understand the difference between language and nationality .
In this case , Greek nationalists – on the basis of their erroneous understanding of ancient and medieval history , and of the meaning of modern nationhood – believe that they have the right to decide what the ‘ true ’ identity of Greece ’s northern neighbour should be .
Since they erroneously believe that the majority population of the Republic of Macedonia is descended from Slavs who arrived in the area during the Middle Ages , and since they equally erroneously believe that modern Greeks are descended in unbroken continuity from ancient Greeks ( among whom they include the ancient Macedonians ) , they believe they have the right to pronounce that the Macedonians are ‘ not really ’
Macedonians , that the Macedonian identity is a ‘ fiction ’ , and that they – the Greek nationalists – on the basis of their ‘ objective ’ reading of ancient and medieval history have the right to pronounce what the Macedonians ’ true name and identity should be .
From this , it follows – according to the Greek nationalist logic – that since their own interpretations of history and of the meaning of modern nationhood are the correct ones , then Macedonians who dispute this are ‘ nationalists ’ , and those who support them in this rejection – such as myself – are supporting ‘ ultra - nationalism ’ , which is what Omadeon accuses me of .
In this way , the Greek nationalists turn reality on its head .
Macedonia is not threatening Greece or its national identity ; the Macedonians are not saying that the Greek language and nation do not exist ; or that Greece has to change its name .
They are not trying to impose their own version of Greek identity on the Greeks .
They are not even denying the right of the Greek inhabitants of Greek Macedonia to call themselves ‘ Macedonian ’ .
Yet for the crime of rejecting the Greek - nationalist interpretation of history , and of asserting their own identity , then it is they who become the bad guys in Greek - nationalist eyes .
And before you know it , the whole of NATO and the EU have to shape their policies around the Greek - nationalist misinterpretation of history .
Such is the world we live in .
Nationalists do not appreciate the fact that , in a democratic world , everyone has to be free to define their identity as they wish ; no nation or individual has the right to decide what the identity of another nation or individual should be .
Nationalists do not appreciate that there is no one , single , ‘ objective ’ interpretation of history ; historians , archaeologists and others must be free to put forward different interpretations about Antiquity , the Midde Ages and so forth .
No group or nation can impose its own version of history on the rest of the world .
Nationalists also do not appreciate the fact that all modern European nations – all of them – have very mixed ethnic origins .
The modern Macedonians – the majority population of the Republic of Macedonia – are descended from a mixture of ancient Macedonians , Slavs and others .
And modern Greeks are likewise descended from a mixture of ancient Macedonians , ancient Greeks , Slavs , Turkish - speaking Anatolians and others .
Something similar applies for all European nations : English , Scots , French , Germans , Italians , Serbs , Croats , Albanians , Turks , etc .
There is no such modern ethnic group as the ‘ Slavs ’ – ‘ Slavs ’ do not exist as an ethnic group in the modern world , any more than do Angles , Saxons , Franks , Gauls , Visigoths or Vikings .
‘ Slavic ’ is a linguistic , not an ethnic category .
The Macedonians speak a Slavic language , and in that sense they are ‘ Slavic ’ , just as the English and Dutch are ‘ Germanic ’ and the Italians and French are ‘ Latin ’ .
Greek nationalists demanding that the Macedonians call themselves ‘ Slavs ’ is like someone demanding that the English and Dutch call themselves ‘ Germanics ’ or that the Italians and French call themselves ‘ Latins ’ .
It is up to the Macedonians alone whether they feel their identity to be ‘ Slavic ’ or not – nobody else has the right to impose such an identity on them .
Ironically , in terms of their genetic origins , non-Slavic - speaking Greece and Albania are more Slavic in their origins than the modern Macedonians and Bulgarians ; spoken language is a very poor guide to ethnic origins .
But does this mean that the Greeks and Albanians are not really Greeks and Albanians ?
Of course not !
Modern nationhood does not derive from ancient or medieval ethnicity , but from a shared sense of identity in the present .
Omadeon ’s describing of the Republic of Macedonia as ‘ Slavo - Albanian Macedonia ’ is equivalent to describing Greece as ‘ Slavo - Albanian - Turkish - Greek Greece ’ , or England as ‘ Celtic - Anglo - Saxon - Viking - Norman England ’ .
If the people of Greece feel themselves to be Greek ; if the people of Macedonia feel themselves to be Macedonian – that is all that matters .
Trying to deny the existence of a modern nation by pointing out its ethnically diverse roots , or by reducing it to a number of ethnic components , is the action of a chauvinist .
We all have ethnically diverse roots .
We should be proud of them .
In an age of globalisation and mass immigration , nations will become more , rather than less ethnically diverse .
This , too , should be viewed positively .
There are English people today whose grandparents were all born in Pakistan , or in Jamaica .
They are no less ‘ English ’ than English people who claim ‘ pure ’ Anglo - Saxon descent .
Black or brown Englishmen and women have as much right as white Anglo - Saxon Englishmen to lay claim to the heritage of English or British historical figures : the Celtic Boadicea ; the Norman - French William the Conqueror ; the Dutch William of Orange ; the Irish Duke of Wellington ; the half - American Winston Churchill .
In the same way , Alexander the Great is part of the heritage of Greeks , Macedonians , Bulgarians and Albanians alike , and of all those nations which have arisen on the territory that he once ruled .
Alexander the Great belongs to Iranians , Afghans and Pakistanis , too .
Omadeon accuses me of opposing reconciliation between Macedonia and Greece , and of not being even - handed in my treatment of Macedonian and Greek nationalism .
I make no pretence at being even - handed : I am on the side of the victim ( Macedonia ) and against the aggressor ( Greece ) , and will always encourage the national resistance of a victim against an aggressor .
Siding with a victim against an aggressor is the only honourable position to take : it means siding with Cyprus against Turkey in 1974 ; with Croatia against Serbia in 1991 ; with Bosnia against both Serbia and Croatia in 1992 - 95 ; with Chechnya against Russia in 1994 and 1999 ; and with Georgia against Russia in 2008 .
There can be no ‘ even - handedness ’ in treating an aggressor and a victim , or in treating their respective nationalisms .
Greek nationalism is threatening Macedonia .
Macedonian nationalism is not threatening Greece .
The two are not equivalent .
As for the question of ‘ reconciliation ’ , this can only rightfully be based on justice , not on the capitulation of the weaker side to the stronger .
The only just compromise between Greece and Macedonia would be along the following lines :
1 ) The Macedonian nation and language , and the Greek nation and language , exist .
Anyone who says they do not is an anti-Macedonian or anti-Greek chauvinist .
2 ) Macedonia and Greece both have the right to call themselves what they want , and to define their national identities as they wish .
3 ) The people of the Republic of Macedonia , Greek Macedonia and Bulgarian Macedonia have an equal right to call themselves ‘ Macedonian ’ and to lay claim to the heritage of Ancient Macedonia and of Alexander the Great , if that is what they wish .
4 ) Greeks and Macedonians alike are descended from a mixture of ancient Macedonians , Slavs and others .
The common ethnic heritage of the two nations should be stressed , not denied , by those seeking reconciliation .
5 ) The symbol at the start of this post – the Star of Vergina – is dear to both Greeks and Macedonians and belongs to them both .
Two nations that love the same symbols and revere the same ancient historical figures should naturally be friends .
Anyone who calls themselves an ‘ anti- nationalist ’ , irrespective of whether they are Greek or Macedonian , should have no difficulty subscribing to these principles .
JERUSALEM -- Israeli forces killed hundreds of Palestinian civilians and destroyed thousands of Gaza Strip homes in attacks that amounted to war crimes , Amnesty International charged today , in the first in - depth human rights group report on the recent war in Gaza .
Amnesty called on Israel to publicly pledge not to use artillery , white phosphorus and other imprecise weapons in densely populated areas .
And it urged Gaza 's militant Hamas rulers to stop rocket fire against Israeli civilians -- attacks it also described as war crimes .
Amnesty -- which first accused Israel of war crimes shortly after the fighting ended on Jan. 18 -- said " disturbing questions " remain about why high - precision weapons like tank shells and air - delivered bombs and missiles " killed so many children and other civilians . "
The group deplored Israel 's use of less - precise artillery shells and highly incendiary white phosphorous in built - up areas .
It also accused Israeli forces of using Palestinians as " human shields " and frequently blocking civilians from receiving medical care and humanitarian aid .
The pattern of Israeli attacks and the high number of civilian casualties " showed elements of reckless conduct , disregard for civilian lives and property and a consistent failure to distinguish between military targets and civilians and civilian objects , " Amnesty International charged .
More than 1,400 Palestinians , including more than 900 civilians , were killed during the three - week offensive , according to Gaza health officials and human rights groups .
Israel , which launched the war to halt years of rocket and mortar attacks on its southern communities , puts the death toll closer to 1,100 .
It says the vast majority of the dead were militants , though it has refused requests to provide a list of the dead .
Amnesty says some 300 children and hundreds of other unarmed civilians were among the dead .
Thirteen Israelis also were killed , including three civilians who died by rocket fire .
The Israeli military rejected the report 's findings , saying it did not properly recognize " the unbearable reality of nine years of incessant and indiscriminate rocket fire on the citizens of Israel . "
The report , the military added , ignored the military 's efforts to minimize civilian casualties in a battlefield where Hamas used residential areas , medical facilities , schools and mosques as cover to stage attacks .
" It presents a distorted view of the laws of war that does not comply with the rules implemented by democratic states battling terror , " the military said in a statement .
Israel did not respond to Amnesty International 's repeated requests for information on specific cases detailed in the report and for meetings to discuss the organization 's findings , said Donatella Rovera , who headed Amnesty 's field research mission .
The 117 - page Amnesty report also denounced Hamas for firing rockets into Israel .
" Such unlawful attacks constitute war crimes and are unacceptable , " Rovera said .
Ismail Haniyeh , prime minister of Hamas ' Gaza government , did not address Amnesty 's criticism of the militants ' conduct , instead focusing only on Israel 's actions .
" We believe the leaders of the occupation state must be tried for these crimes , " Haniyeh said .
The report was based on physical evidence and testimony that a team of four researchers , including a military expert , gathered from dozens of attack sites in Gaza and southern Israel during and after the war .
It broke little new ground , concentrating on issues , cases and problems that have been dealt with in other frameworks .
Among the Gaza cases cited were the well - documented shelling of a house where a family took refuge on soldiers ' orders before 21 people were killed ; an Israeli artillery attack near a U.N. school that killed dozens ; and the shelling of a house that killed three daughters of a Gaza doctor who has worked in Israel for years and is a champion of coexistence .
The U.N. is examining the conduct of both sides to the conflict .
Hamas allowed veteran war crimes investigator Richard Goldstone and his team into Gaza last month , but Hamas security often accompanied them , raising questions about the ability of witnesses to freely describe the militant group 's actions .
Israel has refused to cooperate with the probe , claiming the U.N. council overseeing the investigation is biased .
Israel conducted its own internal investigation earlier this year and cleared the military of wrongdoing .
Human rights groups criticized the probe as a whitewash .
Hamas , the Amnesty report noted , continues to justify its attacks on Israel 's civilian population .
Well the time for bickering is over .
The time for games has passed .
Now is the season for action .
Now is when we must bring the best ideas of both parties together , and show the American people that we can still do what we were sent here to do .
Now is the time to deliver on health care .
The plan I 'm announcing tonight would meet three basic goals :
It will provide more security and stability to those who have health insurance .
It will provide insurance to those who do n't .
And it will slow the growth of health care costs for our families , our businesses , and our government .
It 's a plan that asks everyone to take responsibility for meeting this challenge – not just government and insurance companies , but employers and individuals .
And it 's a plan that incorporates ideas from Senators and Congressmen ; from Democrats and Republicans – and yes , from some of my opponents in both the primary and general election .
Here are the details that every American needs to know about this plan :
First , if you are among the hundreds of millions of Americans who already have health insurance through your job , Medicare , Medicaid , or the VA , nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor you have .
Let me repeat this : nothing in our plan requires you to change what you have .
What this plan will do is to make the insurance you have work better for you .
Under this plan , it will be against the law for insurance companies to deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition .
As soon as I sign this bill , it will be against the law for insurance companies to drop your coverage when you get sick or water it down when you need it most .
They will no longer be able to place some arbitrary cap on the amount of coverage you can receive in a given year or a lifetime .
We will place a limit on how much you can be charged for out - of - pocket expenses , because in the United States of America , no one should go broke because they get sick .
And insurance companies will be required to cover , with no extra charge , routine checkups and preventive care , like mammograms and colonoscopies – because there 's no reason we should n't be catching diseases like breast cancer and colon cancer before they get worse .
That makes sense , it saves money , and it saves lives .
That 's what Americans who have health insurance can expect from this plan – more security and stability .
Now , if you 're one of the tens of millions of Americans who do n't currently have health insurance , the second part of this plan will finally offer you quality , affordable choices .
If you lose your job or change your job , you will be able to get coverage .
If you strike out on your own and start a small business , you will be able to get coverage .
We will do this by creating a new insurance exchange – a marketplace where individuals and small businesses will be able to shop for health insurance at competitive prices .
Insurance companies will have an incentive to participate in this exchange because it lets them compete for millions of new customers .
As one big group , these customers will have greater leverage to bargain with the insurance companies for better prices and quality coverage .
This is how large companies and government employees get affordable insurance .
It 's how everyone in this Congress gets affordable insurance .
And it 's time to give every American the same opportunity that we 've given ourselves .
For those individuals and small businesses who still cannot afford the lower - priced insurance available in the exchange , we will provide tax credits , the size of which will be based on your need .
And all insurance companies that want access to this new marketplace will have to abide by the consumer protections I already mentioned .
This exchange will take effect in four years , which will give us time to do it right .
In the meantime , for those Americans who can't get insurance today because they have pre-existing medical conditions , we will immediately offer low - cost coverage that will protect you against financial ruin if you become seriously ill .
This was a good idea when Senator John McCain proposed it in the campaign , it 's a good idea now , and we should embrace it .
Consumer Confidence at 53.1 is below the estimate of 57 and down from 54.5 in Aug .
It is well off the low of 25.3 in Feb ’09 but the improvement seen is almost all in Expectations .
Present Situations ( how people feel today as opposed to their belief about the future ) fell almost 3 pts to 22.7 and is less than 1 pt from the low in March which was the lowest since ’ 83 .
Expectations fell .5 point to 73.3 and but is well off the low of 27.3 seen in Feb .
Those that said jobs were Plentiful fell to 3.4 from 4.3 and its the lowest since ’ 83 .
Those that said jobs were Hard to Get rose almost 3 pts to 47 , just shy of the highest since ’ 92 .
Thus , the jobs picture is still tough .
With the tax credit about to expire ( maybe ) , those that plan to buy a home within 6 mo ’s fell .7 to 2.3 , just shy of its lowest level since ’ 82 .
Post Clunker ’s , those than plan to buy a car within 6 mo ’s fell almost 1 pt to the lowest since Mar ’09 .
In a troubling sign for President Obama , his popularity is dipping — in New York of all places — as he tries to get a handle of the bad economy , the ongoing war in Afghanistan , while trying to push through a controversial health care bill .
Although 57 percent of registered voters across the state believe Obama is doing either an excellent or good job in office , the president ’s support has slipped over the summer , according to a Marist Poll released today .
Forty - three percent of state voters currently say Obama is falling short of expectations since taking office in January .
By comparison , Obama got high marks from 63 percent of voters polled by Marist in July .
Of course , Obama ’s current approval rating divides along party lines — with 79 percent of Democrats backing the commander - in - chief — down four percentage points compared to July ’s poll .
Only 29 percent of Republicans think Obama is doing an excellent or good job — down eight points compared to the July poll .
Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans five - to - one in New York State , which Obama carried in last year ’s presidential election .
Fifty - three percent of independent voters — those not affiliated with any party — gave Obama a favorable view — down seven points from July ’s poll .
In 1984 producer Walter Mirisch announced a remake of the film as part of his production deal with Universal .
Walter Hill was slated to direct and Hill hoped for Robert Duvall to play the role of Chris .
However , the poor performance of Hill 's Straßen in Flammen ( 1984 ) at the US box office led to the Universal brass cancelling the project .

The Lehman bankruptcy is widely considered to be the watershed event that changed the rules of the game for those Wall Street banks considered " too big to fail . "
The bankruptcy option was ruled out once and for all .
The taxpayers would have to keep throwing money at the banks , no matter how corrupt , ill - managed or undeserving .
As Dean Baker noted in April 2009 :
" Geithner has supposedly ruled out the bankruptcy option because when he , along with Henry Paulson and Ben Bernanke , tried letting Lehman Brothers go under last fall , it did n't turn out very well .
Of course , it is not necessary to go the route of an uncontrolled bankruptcy that Geithner and Co. pursued with Lehman .
. . . [ But ] the Geithner crew insists that there are no alternatives to his plan ; we have to just keep giving hundreds of billions of dollars to the banks . . . , further enriching the bankers who wrecked the economy . "
Although Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy on Monday , September 15 , 2008 , it was actually " bombed " on September 11 , when the biggest one - day drop in its stock and highest trading volume occurred before bankruptcy .
Lehman CEO
Richard Fuld maintained that the 158 year old bank was brought down by unsubstantiated rumors and illegal naked short selling .
Although short selling ( selling shares you do n't own ) is legal , the short seller is required to have shares lined up to borrow and replace to cover the sale .
Failure to buy the shares back in the next three trading days is called a " fail to deliver . "
Christopher Cox , who was chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2008 , said in a July 2009 article that naked short selling " can allow manipulators to force prices down far lower than would be possible in legitimate short - selling conditions . "
By September 11 , 2008 , according to the SEC , as many as 32.8 million Lehman shares had been sold and not delivered - a 57 - fold increase over the peak of the prior year .
For a very large company like Lehman , with plenty of " float " ( available shares for trading ) , this unprecedented number was highly suspicious and warranted serious investigation .
But the SEC , which was criticized for failing to follow up even on tips that Bernie Madoff 's business was a ponzi scheme , has yet to announce the results of any investigation .

What 's New in Fedora 12 ( Constantine ) Alpha
The following sections document major new features and changes in the Fedora 12 Alpha release .
Optimized performance
All software packages on 32 - bit ( x86_32 ) architecture have been compiled for i686 systems with special optimization for Intel Atom processors used in many netbooks but without losing compatibility for recent hardware .
Smaller Packages
All the software packages in Fedora have been switched from Gzip to the more efficient XZ ( LZMA ) compression method , to save space on mirrors and reduce download times .
Combined with the integrated yum presto ( Delta RPM ) support introduced in the previous release , users save time , bandwidth and money with smaller and faster updates .
Thusnelda - Next Generation Open Video Codec
In support of Free Culture , the open web and to reduce the hold of proprietary and patent encumbered codecs , Red Hat has been sponsoring improvements on the open Ogg Theora video codec implementation codenamed Thusnelda via Christopher Montgomery ( xiphmont ) , who created the format and work has resulted in drastic improvements to the codec .
This release features this next generation codec .
All applications using libtheora library including all the Gstreamer applications will automatically and transparently be taking advantage of the improvements .
GRUB with Ext4 Support
Fedora 9 originally included experimental support for Ext4 and Fedora 11 included Ext4 by default however GRUB in that version did not support Ext4 and hence required a separate boot partition formatted as Ext3 or Ext2 .
Fedora 12 now includes a updated version of GRUB with Ext4 support .
Anaconda , the Fedora installer will permit this as well .
Dynamically Rotating Wallpapers
Fedora developers originally introduced dynamically rotating wallpapers in Fedora 8 and pushed this ability to upstream GNOME so that it available for other distributions as well .
We are now taking advantage of this feature again this release by including several wallpaper designs proposed and they rotate automatically on regular intervals .
The Fedora Design team would like to hear from your feedback on these wallpapers and we will pick one of them to be the default for the general release of Fedora 12 .
NetworkManager with system wide connections and enhanced support for Mobile Broadband
NetworkManager can now create and edit system - wide network connections in /etc / sysconfig .
NetworkManager has been able to read information about system - wide network connections from / etc / sysconfig for a while .
Now we have enabled full read - write support for system connections .
The ability to create or modify new system connections will be controlled by Policy Kit policies .
Initially , only wired / wireless connections will be supported .
Later on , vpn connections will follow .
For connections that require secrets , those will be stored in . keys files in /etc / sysconfig .
By providing a database of preconfigured mobile broadband providers , supporting more hardware and permit to scan GSM networks , Network Manager makes the use of mobile broadband much easier .
Your broadband provider will be automatically recognized by NetworkManager and it will make it easy to just plug it your USB device and get you online within minutes .
Dracut - New Booting System
Up until Fedora 10 , the boot system ( initial ram disk or initrd ) used to boot Fedora was monolithic , very distribution specific and did n't provide much flexibility .
This will be replaced with Dracut , a initial ram disk with a event based framework designed to be distribution independent .
It has been also adopted by the Fedora derived OLPC project 's XO operating system .
OLPC modules for Dracut is available in the Fedora repository .
Early feedback and testing is welcome .
Bluetooth Service On Demand
In order to support bluetooth devices , bluetooth background service was started by default in previous versions of Fedora .
In this release , bluetooth service is started on demand when needed and automatically stops 30 seconds after last device use instead reducing initial startup time and resources .
Faster and Smoother Graphical Startup
Kernel Mode Setting ( KMS ) is now enabled by default on Nvidia systems as well through the Nouveau driver .
Fedora 10 originally included support for KMS but only for some ATI display cards .
In Fedora 11 , this was extended to Intel cards as well .
This release has extended it further to support Nvidia cards as well .
As as result of this improvement , you will get a faster and smoother graphical boot on ( nearly ) all systems via the Plymouth graphical boot system developed within Fedora .
Spanning Desktop
In the latest version of Xorg included in this release , if you have a dual monitor setup , your desktop display will span across them instead of using a cloned display by default .
This matches the behaviour of other operating systems .

PulseAudio Enhancements
Fedora developers have been made several improvements to the PulseAudio system .
More details here .
These include the following :
A New Mixer Logic
UPnP MediaServer Support
Hotplug Support Improved
Surround Sound Support for Event Sounds
PackageKit improvements
PackageKit now has plugins to install from a web browser and from the command line if a user tries a command from a package not yet installed .
New Virtualization Features
KVM and qemu have gained a number of new features in this release .
KVM guest memory usage and performance is improved by the addition of KSM and KVM Huge Page Backed Memory .
The performance of the qcow2 image format is greatly improved .
Support for both SR - IOV and NIC hotplug has been added .
Finally , gPXE is now used in place of etherboot for guest PXE booting .
On the libvirt side , APIs have been added for storage management and network interface management .
libvirt now also runs qemu processes unprivileged .
A new library ( libguestfs ) and an interactive tool ( guestfish ) is now available for accessing and modifying virtual machine disk images .
GNOME 2.28
The GNOME 2.28 development snapshot is part of this release , and is the default environment used in the Fedora Desktop Live image .
The Desktop Live image is a downloadable CD you can use to test the new GNOME environment with or without installing it .
The image can be written to CD , or to a USB flash disk using these instructions .
Icons in menus and buttons are not shown by default in GNOME 2.28 .
To get the old , icon-rich appearance back , you can go System -> Preferences ->
Appearance , Interface tab and enable , " Show icons in menus " .
There is however no menu interface to enable the icons for the buttons .
You can set the corresponding GConf keys instead for enabling both the menus and buttons to have icons :
gconftool - 2 -- type boolean -- set /desktop/gnome/interface/buttons_have_icons true gconftool - 2 -- type boolean -- set /desktop/gnome/interface/menus_have_icons true
Gnote is installed by default in GNOME for this release replacing Tomboy .
Gnote is a port of Tomboy from Mono to C++ and consumes fewer resources .
Gnote is both an applet that can sit in your GNOME panel as well as a individual application you can run within other desktop environments .
Fedora Desktop Live CD since the Fedora 10 release has excluded Mono and hence Mono based applications like Tomboy due to lack of space .
Gnote will be installed by default in the Live CD as well in this release .
Tomboy is still available as a optional alternative .
If you are upgrading from the previous release you will not be migrated to Gnote and will continue to have Tomboy .
Tomboy users can migrate easily to Gnote as it shares the file format and a plugin is available in Gnote that will automatically import Tomboy notes on first run .
Many of the Tomboy plugins have been ported to Gnote .
Following plugins are available as part of Gnote
Bugzilla Links
Tomboy Importer
Fixed Width
Insert Timestamp
Export to HTML
Printing Support
Sticky Notes Importer
Backlinks
If required , you can copy the notes from Tomboy to Gnote using the following command in your home directory
cp -r .tomboy .gnote
The sticky notes applet is not provided anymore since Gnote provides a better note taking utility and is available by default in this release .
The GNOME sound preferences now supports profile switching .
Empathy replaces Pidgin as the default instant messenger in GNOME .
Empathy is better integrated with GNOME and provides audio and video functionality for XMPP / Jabber users with more improvements planned .
Empathy supports importing accounts from Pidgin on first run so users can migrate more easily .
Users upgrading from a previous release will continue to have Pidgin by default .
Pidgin continues to be available in the repository and is actively maintained .
Empathy is still under evaluation for this release .
The major pros and cons are listed below :
Pros :
Better GNOME integration .
Passwords are stored in the keyring instead of plain text like in Pidgin
Voice chat with GoogleTalk .
Note that it requires extra gstreamer codecs and manual firewall reconfiguration and Pidgin is now using the same framework as well .
Account migration support from Pidgin has been added to Empathy .
Support for collaboration with Abiword and other programs
Geo Location ( very recent feature )
Cons :
Missing plugin system , so many of the add - on features available to Pidgin ( like encryption , etc ) are not available to Empathy
No proxy support
Totem only supports a gstreamer backend now .
The totem - xine backend has been removed completely .
Epiphany in this release is now using the WebKit engine instead of the Gecko engine from Firefox .
If you have issues , do report them via bugzilla .
GNOME Shell - Preview of GNOME 3
A very early version of GNOME Shell is now available in the repository .
GNOME
Shell is a key part of GNOME 3 and is in active development with the heavy involvement of Fedora developers and interaction designers .
A simple way to try out GNOME Shell is to install the desktop - effects package
yum install desktop - effects gnome - shell
Go to System => Preferences => Desktop Effects
If you would like to configure it manually , run
mkdir ~/.config/autostart ln -s /usr/share/applications/gnome-shell.desktop ~/.config/autostart
You can also run the following to invoke it directly .
gnome - shell -- replace &

Changes to System Defaults
For security and performance reasons , iptables rules are no longer applied by default to frames forwarded across linux kernel ethernet bridges .
See bug # 512206 for more details on the rationale behind this change .
Historically , uids and gids 0 - 100 are reserved for specific system accounts and allocated via the uidgid file in the setup package .
This space has now been exhausted and 0 -200 is now reserved .
This should not be an issue on most systems because dynamically allocated system accounts are usually allocated downwards from 499 .
See bug 515779 and bug # 511957 for more details .
Additional Information
How to Try Alpha
This release is accompanied by installable live CDs of both the GNOME and KDE desktops .
With a Live CD users can perform testing and demonstration without installing any software to the hard disk .
As this release is largely targeted at developers and contains many bleeding edge packages , this is the best method for less experienced users who want to get involved with testing .
The Live CDs also have an option to install Fedora to the hard disk for the more intrepid users .
The best way to download this release is through BitTorrent -- visit the Fedora torrent server for a listing of available images .
Release images can also be downloaded from any of our mirrors .
Remember that live images can be used on USB media via the livecd - iso - to - disk utility available in the livecd - tools package on existing Fedora systems .
Refer to the USB How - to for more instructions .
You can also use Jigdo to download the i386 , x86_64 , or ppc versions .
Verify Fedora
Fedora does not publish MD5 or SHA1 hashes to verify images since they are not secure enough .
Instead we have been using SHA256 since Fedora 11 .
In Linux , you can use sha256 sum command ( part of coreutils and installed by default ) to verify the Fedora image
sha256sum -c *- CHECKSUM
Windows can use free to download utility HashCalc .

Mac OS
X can use the free to download utility hashtab .
Fedora GPG signatures can be verified following the instructions here
Debugging Information And Performance
Fedora kernels have many extensive debugging options during the development cycle that has a negative impact on performance but provides developers with more information automatically or in the case of bug reports .
If you are running performance analysis on Rawhide or test releases such as Alpha or Beta , make sure you take this into account .
Fedora 12 Release Schedule And Feature Details
Development continues on Rawhide during and after this release , leading up to the beta and then the final release .
The links below provide the release schedule for both the pre-releases and the final release , as well as the wiki pages for tracking the various features planned for inclusion in Fedora 12 .
With rumors in the air of a U.S. - brokered , mid-September meeting between Israeli and Palestinian leaders , various regional actors are busy positioning themselves for the coming round of diplomacy .
Analysis of these dynamics provides some useful perspective on the road ahead , beyond the usual focus on the minutiae of settlement construction , prisoner exchanges , or other immediate concerns .
Especially noteworthy in this context are the latest maneuvers by members of the rejectionist or " resistance " axis : Iran , Syria , Hizballah , and Hamas .
Their positions have hardened even further as the United States , Israel , the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) , and Egypt keep talking about peace talks .
This drawing of lines at least has the virtue of clarifying the real possibilities -- and the real partners -- for any regional peacemaking efforts .
Iran : " Annihilation of the Zionist Regime Is within Reach "
Tehran , preoccupied as it may be with internal troubles , has not lost sight of its opposition to Israel 's existence and to what it derisively labels the U.S. " agent " Arab " conciliation camp , " supposedly led by Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak .
On August 25 , for instance , Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani , sometimes termed a relative moderate , or pragmatist , asserted that President Obama 's concept of peace " does not address even one of the Palestinians ' basic rights . "
Since late June , Tehran 's two main hardline dailies -- almost the only ones still allowed to publish there -- have amplified this theme on at least three separate occasions .
Kayhan editorialized that " the establishment of two states , Palestinian and Zionist , would be the same as totally crushing the rights of the Palestinian people . "
Rather , the paper declared , " a solution can only be achieved by completely eradicating the Zionist regime . "
Similarly , Jomhuri -ye Islami warned that the " Palestinians must not be satisfied with anything less than the annihilation of the Zionist regime -- a goal that is within reach . "
Iran also used the platform of Syrian president Bashar al - Asad 's August 19 official visit to reaffirm its support for the " resistance camp . "
Such rhetoric may indicate some anxiety in Iran about potential progress in Arab - Israeli peacemaking , but also clearly demonstrates that Iran itself has abandoned any hope of professing moderation on this issue -- either to evade sanctions or buy time for its nuclear program .
Instead , Iran has concentrated , with some success , on enlisting Third World diplomatic support for a new convention that bans attacks against any nuclear facilities .
On a more practical level , Tehran reportedly continues to ship medium - range missiles and other weapons to both Hamas and Hizballah .
For the time being , the main effect of these Iranian policies has not been to intimidate the Arab " conciliation camp , " but rather to reinforce the determination of Iran 's existing Arab friends -- Syria , Hamas , and Hizballah -- not to join that camp .
Syria : Questioning the Basis for any Peace Talks
President al - Asad 's August 30 meeting with European Union representative Javier Solana was notable , judging by official Syrian reports , for going beyond Syria 's previous refusal to countenance direct peace talks with Israel and for venturing further to undermine the idea of Palestinian - Israeli negotiations as well .
" We want to raise questions , " Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem told the Syrian Arab News Agency after the Solana meeting , " amid the mounting talk about meetings between Palestinians and Israelis :
What happened concerning the halt of settlements ... and stopping judaizing [ sic ]
Jerusalem and demolishing houses ?
And what happened concerning lifting the siege imposed on the people of Gaza ...? "
In other words , rather than encouraging Hamas to accept peace talks with Israel , as some American analysts had once hoped , Damascus is now trying to discourage even the PA from resuming these negotiations .
This stance fits well with other recent Syrian moves : reaffirming its fealty to Iran and to Hizballah , and refusing to accept responsibility for terrorists crossing its border with Iraq .
Such a posture may not spell the end of American attempts to engage Damascus , but it does suggest the impracticality of trying to entice Syria into an Arab - Israeli peace process any time soon .
Hizballah : Business as Usual
Since a brief flurry of missile - rattling rhetoric ( " We can reach Tel Aviv " ) earlier this summer , Hizballah spokesmen and media have not had much to say about Israel or the peace process .
Hizballah has also refrained from provocations on the Lebanese - Israeli border , even as occasional explosions , UN reports , and scuffles with local residents demonstrate that it continues to rearm and prepare for another round of warfare .
At the same time , Israeli press reports on August 31 strongly suggest that Hizballah is still seeking -- so far in vain -- to mount a dramatic , high - profile assassination to avenge the death of terrorist mastermind Imad Mughniyah in a car bombing in Syria early last year .
But right now , Hizballah 's main efforts seem to focus on maintaining its power inside Lebanon -- Prime Minister Saad Hariri is still struggling to form a new cabinet -- despite Hizballah 's own electoral losses in June .
In this connection , Hariri 's recent pronouncement that Hizballah will be part of his new government " whether Israel likes it or not " offers some sense of the influence this radical movement continues to exert on every aspect of Lebanese affairs .
Hamas : Taking Itself Out of the Equation
Most significant of all these recent reactions is that of Hamas .
After months of scattering verbal hints of possible concessions , Hamas has now clearly opted out of diplomacy .
Symptomatic was the August 30 speech by its political leader , Khaled Meshal , briefly allowed back into Jordan -- after ten years of enforced exile in Syria -- to attend the funeral of his father .
Meshal , once viewed in some quarters as comparatively pragmatic , placed primary emphasis on the " right of return , " a guaranteed diplomatic dead end .
He presented this as a kind of Palestinian gesture to the interests of Jordan , home to some four million citizens of Palestinian origin or ancestry -- but one that represents the antithesis of peace for Israel .
On the same day , as if to rub salt in the wound , the Hamas Popular Committee for Refugees wrote in opposition to a rumored plan to mention the Holocaust in a new UNRWA history curriculum : " We refuse to let our children study a lie invented by the Zionists . "
Moreover , Hamas officials have practically ceased talking about terms for Palestinian unity or reconciliation with their Fatah rivals .
Those few Fatah leaders still alive and not under arrest in Gaza were not even allowed out to attend the recent , long - awaited all - Fatah Congress in the West Bank .
This Hamas attitude is especially noteworthy because -- as Meshal and other leaders must be aware -- the movement 's condition is currently quite weak .
Ever since last January 's very damaging war with Israel , Hamas has dared to fire very few rockets or mortars across the border .
A few senior members of the movement , like Ghazi Hamad , have even admitted recently in public that Hamas should " not want emotions and pompous slogans to push aside and take the place of facts . "
Credible Palestinian public opinion polls show Hamas steadily losing ground , to the point that barely a quarter of the public supports it any longer -- and elections are scheduled just four months from now .
The paradox , however , is that Hamas , far from seeking a peaceful way out , seems to be hunkering down .
If it agrees to Palestinian unity , it could lose its hold on Gaza .
If it agrees to peace with Israel , it could lose its very identity .
And Hamas is determined to hold on to those possessions at any cost .
The Moderates on the Line : Implications for U.S. Policy
Can the Arab moderates simply reject this rejectionist challenge and proceed with the peace process ?
The answer , to paraphrase President Obama , is " Yes , they can " -- if Washington encourages rather than undercuts them .
Some observers have noted that in apparent response to U.S. policy shifts , Palestinian and Egyptian officials have taken to insisting on an Israeli settlement freeze as a new precondition for peace negotiations .
Few observers , however , have noted that previous prerequisites for such negotiations -- such as " Palestinian unity " or lifting the " siege " of Gaza -- have virtually vanished from the Egyptian or Palestinian lexicon .
The PA , Saudi Arabia , Egypt , and even Qatar have just about given up on the chimera of Palestinian unity on any terms that might be acceptable to Hamas , at least for a while .
President Mubarak , after his White House meeting in early August , softened his earlier position that new Arab overtures to Israel must await a comprehensive peace agreement , in favor of the view that that other Arabs would " support " peace talks as soon as they commenced .
In concrete terms , this could mean that most Arab states would increase their support for the PA and decrease their support for Hamas .
That alone would have more meaning than all the landing rights , quasi- diplomatic offices , or other symbolic gestures that any Arab government might offer Israel directly at this stage .
For U.S. policy in the Arab - Israeli arena , the implications are clear :
To bring these Arab moderates willingly to the peace table , find a reasonable resolution of the Israeli settlement dispute as soon as possible .
Give priority to the Palestinians over the Syrians or Lebanese in the peace process .
Keep containing , rather than trying to engage , Hamas or Hizballah , and concentrate on further improving conditions in the West Bank .
Today , for a change , it is the peacemakers who are on the rise and the warmongers who are actually on the defensive .
The key to keeping it that way is to recognize the rejectionists for what they are and to leave them by the wayside .
' Chinatown ' writer inspired by memories of L.A. 35TH ANNIVERSARY OF 'CHINATOWN '
Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close ' Chinatown ' writer inspired by memories of L.A. 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
A couple of powerful flashbacks to the Los Angeles of his childhood persuaded Robert Towne to write " Chinatown . "
One flashback came during a walk along the ocean in the early 1970s , when the quality of the light , the sea air and the smell of eucalyptus sent him into a reverie .
" I remember thinking , ' I 'm 11 years old again , ' " Towne says , on the phone from his Los Angeles home to talk about the 35th anniversary of " Chinatown . "
The other transporting moment was prompted by a newspaper article that focused on the 1930s and ' 40s Los Angeles of crime novelist Raymond Chandler and included photos of a period convertible at historic buildings .
" I 'm very susceptible to the sights and sounds of the city , " says Towne , who will turn 75 in November .
" I realized all those parts of the city that I have loved and missed so much were still there to be had on film .
I just needed the story . "
He found his Los Angeles story in Oregon , where he'd gone with his friend and former roommate , an up - and - coming actor named Jack Nicholson , to appear in Nicholson 's directorial debut , " Drive , He Said , " released in 1971 .
Looking for a way to pass the time , Towne read Carey McWilliams ' " Southern California : An Island on the Land , " published in 1946 .
Still in print - " There 's never been a better book about Southern California , " Towne says - it contains a chapter about Los Angeles ' infamous water scandal at the beginning of the last century , when shady if legal dealings allowed a core group of already wealthy men who controlled Los Angeles to become even richer by diverting water from the Owens Valley , 230 miles to the northeast .
Towne had his setting and his subject , and he and Nicholson wanted to make a classic murder mystery with contemporary sensibilities , a modern noir .
" Detective stories are always about something exotic , jewel - encrusted , " Towne says .
" I wanted to do something that was as common as what 's right in front of you when you turn on the spigot . "
He further tweaked conventions of the genre by making his main character , a former police officer turned private detective named J.J. Gittes ( a role written for and played by Nicholson ) , a brash , self - satisfied boor who dresses like a high - class pimp and specializes in divorce work .
Many critics and film - industry experts call " Chinatown " the finest detective movie ever made , and some say it is the best film of the 1970s - a decade that also included the first two " Godfather " pictures .
And Towne won an Oscar for his screenplay , the only Academy Award the film received despite 11 nominations .
Towne 's original version of the screenplay was twice as long as the one used to shoot the movie , the result of condensing , editing and other streamlining done by Towne and director Roman Polanski .
Polanski came up with the idea to end the film with a death in Chinatown .
Though Towne so strongly disagreed with Polanski about the ending that he left the project briefly , today he concedes the director knew what he was doing .
" It was the right call , " Towne says .
The remastered special edition of " Chinatown " will be released on Oct. 6 .
EVERY morning , I take a small white pill that makes me think deep philosophical thoughts about the American health care system , the value of life , and the relationship between man and state .
No , it is not some illegal psychedelic left over from the 1960s along with my tie - dyed T - shirts .
But if you bear with me , I bet this pill will have the same effect on you .
The pill is a statin  a type of pharmaceutical developed over the last few decades to lower a person ’s cholesterol .
My father died of cardiovascular disease , and unfortunately I inherited his genetic predisposition .
Yet I am hoping that modern medicine will help me avoid his fate .
So like millions of middle - age men , I take my little pill every morning .
Here is the question I ask as the pill passes through my lips :
Is it worth it ?
Now you might be tempted to say , “ Of course it is . ”
Most people would prefer to avoid an early death .
If the wonders of modern science might put off the inevitable for a while longer , why not give it a shot ?
And that is , indeed , how I thought about the decision when my doctor recommended the treatment .
One thing I did not consider was the price .
Like most consumers of health care , I was insulated from economic concerns .
I knew that the insurance company  and , indirectly , all its policyholders  would pick up most of the tab .
This arrangement , encouraged by the tax system , ensures that I get the benefit of the pills while paying little of the extra costs they generate .
Pakistan : eigenmächtige Upgrades von älteren amerikanischen " Defensivwaffen " ?
Thomas Pany
Die USA werfen Pakistan vor , Harpoon - Raketen , die man dem Land in den 1980er Jahren verkauft hat , in eine Offensivwaffe umfunktioniert zu haben .
Ein Waffentest , der klammheimlich im April dieses Jahres von Pakistan durchgeführt worden sein soll , wird von der New York Times heute als wichtiger Verdachtspunkt dafür genannt , dass Partner Pakistan " Harpoon " - Seezielflugkörper zu Landzielflugkörper umgebaut hat .
Der Vorwurf wird ziemlich hoch gehängt .
Nicht nur dass Pakistan mit den Modifikationen der Harpoon - Anti-Ship - Missiles gegen ( amerikanisches ) Gesetz verstoße - den Arms Control Export
Act - , schlimmer noch sei , dass das Land mit amerikanischer Hilfe den Rüstungswettlauf mit Indien anheize und dabei andere militärische Prioritäten vernachlässige .
Denn , so der zugrundeliegende Vorwurf der US - Vertreter , wie er von der Zeitung übermittelt wird , die " Anti-Ship - Rakete " sei zu einem Flugkörperwaffe umgebaut worden , die von Schiffen aus Ziele auf dem Land ansteuern soll .
Dies wird als signfikante Ausweitung des pakistanischen Arsenals interpretiert , das gegen Indien , dem anderen Partner der USA , gerichtet ist und Mittel vom Kampf gegen den gemeinsamen amerikanisch - pakistanischen Feind , die militanten Extremisten à la Taliban , abzieht .
Es geht um viel Geld .
Um 7,5 Milliarden Dollar , die als zivile Hilfe in den nächsten fünf Jahren aus den USA an Pakistan fließen sollen .
Dem Kongress werden im September entsprechende Vorschläge vorgelegt , denen er zustimmen soll .
In diesem Zusammenhang gelangen allerhand Manöver , Pläne und Schachzüge an die Öffentlichkeit - so berichtet die Washington Post heute davon , dass das Weiße Haus 50 Indizien entwickelt , um Erfolge im Afpak - Militäreinsatz genauer - " metrisch " - messen und beurteilen zu können .
Auch der Vorwurf an die pakistanische Führung , Verteidigungswaffen zu Angriffswaffen umzufunktionieren und damit das Wettrüsten zu forcieren , gehört wohl zu jenen politischen Manövern im Vorfeld der Kongressentscheidung , mit denen Druck ausgeübt wird .
Laut Experten steht der Vorwurf auf dünnem Boden .
Pakistan könnte die Raketen tatsächlich selbst konstruiert haben , so die Aussagen von Fachleuten , die in der New York Times zitiert werden .
Die Fachwelt geht offensichtlich davon aus , dass Pakistan längst auf einem technischen Stand ist , um selbst solche Raketen zu bauen , die von der See aus entfernte Landziele treffen können .
Etwas vage am Vorwurf aus dem Weißen Haus bleibt zudem , weshalb die Harpoon - Raketen , die während der Reagan - Ära , vor mehr als zwanzig Jahren , an Pakistan geliefert wurden , als eindeutig defensiv ausgewiesen werden können , ist das ein rein sprachlicher Vorgang , reicht der Vorsatz " Anti- Ship " , um aus der Rakete , die wahrscheinlich auch offensiv verwendet werden kann , eine Verteidigungswaffe zu machen ?
Much of the feminist movement has been wrapped in a maternal bow .
Suffrage was sold to naysayers as a way to give mothers a say in government , not to mention the view that women would clean up politics .
Organizations like Moms Rising and CODEPink appeal to women as caregivers and moms for ending wars and realizing universal healthcare .
But a funny thing happened on our way to a feminist society - we also impacted the way boys and men are viewed .
For the boys lucky enough to be raised by feminist moms , they were taught that they could also be anything they wanted : CEO or school teacher .
Boys might had been given dolls and made to do cooking & cleaning .
They were given the chance to learn important caregiving skills .
Some of them are today 's stay - at - home dads ( SAHD ) .
Jeremy Adam Smith does a good job at laying out the path society took to get here in " The Daddy Shift " .
A collision of feminist wins ( job discrimination protections , Title IX ) and a change in economics ( male - dominated jobs outsourced overseas ) has lead to a moment where it appears that working women are on the uptick and working men on a downward slide .
This has lead to the rise of bread - winning women and this had given men the economic ability to choose work or caregiving full - time .
The families Smith profiles are diverse by age , race / ethnicity , politics and class .
They answer the question of why with simplicity .
Why would a man give up his work to stay at home ?
Why would a woman choose work over her child ( ren ) ?
Oddly Smith somehow fails to profile a two - dad family until the conclusion and it comes off as an after thought .
Gay male households often have a higher family income and thus may be more prone to having a stay at home dad .
Two main ideas stuck out that may provide key to this revolution ( I disagree with Smith who thinks of the Daddy Shift as an evolution ) : 1 ) Redefining fatherhood as providing for children 's emotional well - being and / or breaking any aspect of financial support off of the definition ( A paid job does not define fatherhood - How you father does ) and 2 ) Redefining the providing aspect of motherhood to include paid work .
The diversity in class stories provide evidence that working moms are not working for the modern equivalent of pin money - tennis lessons or a bigger house .
Rather she loves her work , is often being paid more and bringing home better benefits for the family 's survival .
Makes you wonder what the family would look like if we had universal healthcare that was n't tied to employment .
Back to that revolution : Ironically Smith says that parenting is n't the same as activism .
I know a long list of moms who would say otherwise .
I believe that is because many women do stop and consider the things that come with motherhood that Smith admits he did n't - the cost of living , cost of child care , impact on our careers , etc .
Is motherhood more political or revolutionary than fatherhood ?
Or does our society simply put too high a price on women to become mothers ?
Could it change as we raise more boys to prepare for caregiving ?
Will motherhood become less radical as society becomes a partner in parenthood rather than an obstacle ?
I was put off by the gender stereotypes presented especially the mom is more cautious and the dad lets kids explore tenor .
Not just because they are stereotypes , but because it 's the exact opposite in my family .
I also got the sense that Smith presented SAHDs as having made an economic sacrifice ( as it is ) and contrasted it with SAHM 's view that a certain level of luxury is expected :
" My wife does n't want to work , but she wants a nanny two days a week and she wants to be able to buy clothes .
She 's depending on me to be the provider , and so are the kids . " -
A chemical engineer dad who spends two hours a day with his children .
There was a clear distinction of how different classes viewed child care .
It 's hard for me to wrap my head around it as we had a great experience with child care for our daughter .
She started at 4 months in full day child care and only two times ever cried as I left her .
But as Smith points out , those of us who can afford to pay for top of the line care get great care .
Lower class parents get to choose from lower - level care or staying at home .
So yes , it does make more sense that there are more stay - at - home parents who start out as working class / low - income .
As I did put my daughter in child care it was also hard to hear story after story of parents who say , " I could n't see myself letting someone else raise my child , " or " After all we went through with adoption , why would I hand her over to someone else ? "
I understand logically , but it 's still hard .
" The Daddy Shift " is a wonderful peek into an emerging new world of fatherhood where men of all sorts of backgrounds decide that they will be the one to stay home and raise the kids .
And as the subtitle says , it is also a peek into shared parenting .

CLEVELAND , Ohio --
Aiming to preserve Cleveland 's ethnic history and the future of its neighborhoods , U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich is calling on the city to take over closed Catholic churches by eminent domain .
City Hall , however , is not saying whether it would consider such a drastic move .
" We are at work on options for reuse of these valuable assets , " said Ken Silliman , chief of staff to Mayor Frank Jackson .
" We will advise the mayor and the congressman and work with his office .
But I 'm making no comment on eminent domain as a strategy . "
Silliman declined to say what options the city is considering for the closed structures .
The latest casualty in a downsizing by the Cleveland Catholic Diocese was St. Procop , a 137 - year - old Czech - founded parish on West 41st Street that was closed last month .
Besides mothballing the 110 - year - old church building , the closing uprooted a number of social - service programs , including free meals and groceries for the neighborhood poor .
A diocese spokesman said the diocese and Catholic Charities are working to fill the gap with similar services .
Kucinich wants the city to take ownership of St. Procop and other closed churches , leasing them back to groups that would operate social - service and cultural programs , which , he said , are " so important to the vitality of Cleveland 's neighborhoods . "
In a letter to Jackson this month , Kucinich wrote : " Churches now slated for closure and possible demolition have been gathering places for immigrants seeking both religious and political freedom .
" The deeds of title to the churches belong to the Diocese of Cleveland , but the rich cultural , ethnic and religious history belongs to the people of Cleveland .
In the final analysis , it is the history of our city that is threatened . "
The letter noted that Kucinich and Jackson met and discussed the matter on Labor Day .
" As I mentioned in our discussion , I believe that this is a perfect opportunity for the city to use eminent domain for the purpose of historic preservation of these churches , " Kucinich wrote .
The diocese had no immediate response to the congressman 's proposal .

THE above are extracted statements made on the US and world economy by Gerald Celente , the head of the Trends Research Institute , a top trend - forecasting agency in the world .
He had predicted accurately a number of previous events such as the 1987 stock market crash , the 1998 Russian economic collapse , the 2000 Dot -Com bubble burst , the 2001 recession , the US housing market collapse of 2008 , among others .
You may be wondering what this has got to do with the Nigerian banks and their MDS .
The answer is a lot .
In the current world economy , a bank will typically extend credit to borrowers in excess of the fund reserve it carries at any point in time in a practice known as fractional reserve banking .
By doing so , banks effectively increases the total money supply in the system above that of the total amount of fiat money in existence .
Fiat money is a term used to define money that is not backed by reserves of another commodity such as gold , silver , or other tangible mineral or asset .
The reality of this practice is that a bank will not have access to sufficient cash ( fiat money ) to meet all the obligations it has to depositors if they all decide to withdraw the balance of their accounts or deposits .
Fiat money is usually given value by the government .
The United States switched indefinitely to fiat money in 1971 , with many developed countriesâ€™ currencies fixed relative to the US dollar .
Our banking system is not home grown .
Our financial theories and economic systems are largely wholesale adoption of western systems .
The migration to fiat money system created limitless opportunities for all sorts of sophisticated financial instruments .
The elaborate banking schemes had one common framework : work with institutional investors to drive prices upwards .
This trend is quite noticeable in real estate , stock , oil and other trades that yield heavy returns over a short period .
It is inevitable that such practices must accompany a financial system that is not hedged against commodity or real production .
The manipulated upward price movementsÂ become replacements for traditional commodities or real production in a reliable Risk Management System .
Governments , central banks , institutional investors and banks become allies in the paper money , credit and debt systems supported by weak foundations .
The United States bail out money comes from printed money backed by nothing as the Trends Report indicates .
The N400 b bank rescue fund is also printed ( Fiat ) money .
The ultimate consequence is uncontrolled inflation .
One would ask some of these questions concerning the Nigerian scenario
Is the CBN interested in saving depositors funds or saving the face - value of the depositorâ€™s funds while over 80 per cent of the value ( purchasing power ) is lost ?
With widespread corruption of the financial system in many western countries , how do we develop a transparent home grown system given our long history of corruption ?
When current corrupt bank MDs and board members are removed , how do the replacements function in a predominantly lazy and corrupt environment ?
Can we rely on foreign risk management â€ ˜expertsâ€™ to rescue us when they have failed in their countries ?
True risk management will never violate time tested values .
As the bank executives Â Â Â are punished , how do we punish the many in the society who steal or embezzle in many forms ?
Politicians who steal the peopleâ€™s money , workers who award inflated contracts to cronies for bribes and settlements , lecturers who award marks for cash , mechanics who damage vehicles for quick gain , workers who cheat employers by habitual lateness or absence , customs officials who cheat the government , school proprietors who buy exam papers for students to give a false impression of excellence , lecturers who embark on a strike for wage increase in a downturn economy , the man or woman who exchanges his vote for cash during elections , the policeman who collects bribes to free guilty criminals , ..?
If the US is suffering the pangs of failure of the financial system with their level of production , how do we , in Nigeria survive when we consume everything , import everything and produce almost nothing ?
We better brace up for the hard reality .
Weâ€™ll be extremely lucky if it is just 5 banks .
Dominant societal values inform dominant behaviour of people at work , home , and social circles .
There are no short cuts .
We either work , work and work our way to growth or we all pay the price .
There is no cheating the natural laws of the universe .
Kindly Share This Story :
My best friend 's name was Johnny Capshire .
He was always a normal enough fella , until Dec 13 , 1986 .
That 's when he lost his mind .
Johnny went missing that day .
It took a day or two for all of us ( his friends and family ) to realize he was gone , and contact the authorities .
As the law seemed determined to take its own sweet time getting around to doing anything on the matter , me and others initiated our own search efforts .
Both we and the law came up empty .
Addled Almost exactly three weeks after he 'd disappeared , Johnny was back .
Or at least part of him was .
He no longer answered to his given name .
Acted like ' Johnny Capshire ' was a different person entirely .
Johnny now claimed he was God , visiting Earth after a long trip away .
Told us he 'd returned because he figured it was now time to check on how things were doing in this patch of his cosmic garden .
Well , let me clarify here : he did n't use the name " God " : or many of those other exact words ; but it all seemed to be implied from the nonsense he was spouting .
It took us a while , but we finally became convinced Johnny was n't joking .
We took Johnny to the hospital , but they could find nothing physically amiss with him .
They referred us to a mental health specialist .
Johnny ended up being institutionalized for a few weeks .
We only learned by accident that Johnny had talked his way out of the place after that -- for some reason the staff did n't notify any of us about it .
One of us ( Johnny 's sister ) found out when she went to see him for a visit .
So Johnny went missing for a second time , and we all went looking for him again .
This time the law did n't even make a pretense about helping .
Missing marbles I finally found Johnny myself , at our favorite fishing hole , a few days later .
He was just sitting on the bank , gazing out over the water .
I decided to sit down next to him .
I did n't immediately say anything to him , because I was afraid he'd still act like he was n't himself .
Johnny did n't acknowledge my presence at all for a few minutes .
Then he finally spoke .
" You should n't worry about me , you know , " Johnny told me .
" I can't help it Johnny .
You 're -- um -- you 're acting kind of strange .
You know ? "
" I know .
But you are too .
You know ? "
" No . What do you mean ? "
" You -- everyone -- are n't acting like I expected you to . "
" Well , we did what we thought best , after you went missing , and showed up again - -" Johnny interrupted me .
" No , I do n't mean that .
I mean in general .
With the planet .
With your neighbors .
You 're -- well -- backward , Charley . "
" Eh ?
I do n't think I 'm getting what you 're talking about , Johnny . "
" Well - - it 's like this .
There 's currently twenty - two other worlds similar to Earth in age and condition sharing more or less this same orbital range from the galactic core .
The peoples of all those worlds are already actively working their home systems : the other planets , their cometary clouds , their asteroids , and more .
But here , you 're not even close to that .
Apparently , you 're still a couple thousand years behind the others in such matters .
The question is , what 's wrong with you ? "
I was n't sure what to say to that : it made little sense to me .
So I ignored it .
" Johnny , why do n't we go to my house and get something to eat ?
I 'm sure you 're hungry . "
Johnny ignored me back .
And seemed to talk to himself .
Something about how our problem could n't be a lack of resources , or an unusually high number of cosmic or geological calamities .
He seemed to settle upon something called cultural dead ends as the culprit .
Me , I stood up and left at that , to get to somewhere I could call from to spread the word I 'd found Johnny , and where he was and what he was doing .
I figured we could either keep a collective eye on him for a while until he got better , or else manhandle him into a car and take him home and chain him up for a while -- for his own protection .
And get more help for him .
Luckily , Johnny did n't offer much resistance to our efforts , and come that Sunday we actually managed to take him to church with us .
Johnny acted confused : like he could n't remember what church was , or its purpose .
We patiently tried to explain it to him .
After a while he suddenly burst out laughing , making us angry : Johnny acted like he thought the whole idea of church and religion was some sort of grand joke or prank .
When Johnny recognized our anger and hurt , he changed his tune quick , and apologized .
It was around that time we arrived at the church and went in .
Johnny acted perfectly civilized at church , and seemed to pay gratifyingly close attention to the service .
A cracked pot Afterwards in the car Johnny asked more of his odd questions .
Like how many people did we think attended one sort of church or another worldwide .
Stuff like that .
He also asked our opinions about various things , like what we and the church thought about science and technology , and more .
We answered as best we could .
After dark that evening , I found Johnny again sitting by himself , this time in my backyard , in a folding chair .
Most everyone else was leaving , as it was getting late .
Johnny was to stay with me that night ( we were all now taking turns watching over him ) .
I pulled up another chair and sat down next to him .
Johnny was staring up at the night sky .
Without turning to look at me , Johnny said quietly " I know what the problem is now . "
" What problem ? " I asked , having forgotten our not - quite - a- conversation on the river bank .
" Why you 're not in space .
Why many of you still live in mud huts , and die of malnutrition and easy to cure illnesses . "
" Oh !
So now you have the cures for poverty and cancer , do you ? " I smiled .
" No : I have the cause .
Remove the cause , and the cures come virtually automatically . "
" Well - - I guess so , " I replied non-committedly .
" Now I know what the difference is between you and the others .
The only difference which matters : religion .
There 's nothing like it on the other worlds : sure , you can find traces in many of their history books -- but once a race 's scientific revolution takes off , that usually rids them of religion .
" Here though , for some reason , you 've purposely kept quality educations from the masses , which has allowed religion to flourish here like nowhere else .
That 's what 's holding you back ! "
I did n't take kindly to Johnny disparaging religion : but as they say , the good Lord looks after fools and drunks ; and Johnny had been a fool now ever since he lost his mind .
So I held my tongue , and wondered how long it'd be before Johnny got well again .
Johnny now turned towards me .
" You 've got a rampant mental plague here .
Something like a computer virus , only affecting your wetware rather than hardware .
It requires eradication before you can make any further progress . "
Now Johnny seemed to relax , and turned back to face the sky again , even as he continued to speak .
" It 's too deeply embedded in your history , culture , and records to get rid of in any fast or convenient fashion .
No : this calls for a major intervention : before it destroys you .
But how ? "
Johnny seemed to ponder the point for several minutes .
I said nothing , just allowing him to get all the crazy talk out of his head .
" Ah , yes !
The solution was staring me in the face all along !
A counter - virus !
A virulent biological agent which rewrites your DNA to disable any neural patterns overly susceptible to such nonsense .
" A suitable agent should free your planet 's majority from the affliction within only a few years , and improvements to public education will follow -- most rapidly in your news and entertainment media , and after that , in your schools ... "
With that , Johnny frowned .
" I did not come prepared for such a contingency . "
Johnny turned to look at me again .
" I shall return with the agent as soon as possible .
Please do your best to avoid any more genocide until then : all right ? "
As Johnny seemed to need a response , I gave him one , with a strained smile : " All right " , I said .
Then Johnny 's eyes rolled up in his head until only the whites could be seen , and he collapsed in his chair .
I thought he was kidding around for a minute , but soon became alarmed , and called for an ambulance .
My friend returns
The doctors proclaimed Johnny to be in a coma .
He was in the hospital for several days before he woke up again .
To everyone 's relief , he was Johnny again !
Not that weird - talking stranger .
Johnny seemed unable to remember anything about the time in - between his original disappearance , and the coma .
But that was fine with us : we did n't want to remember it either .
The hospital released Johnny a few days later .
And things pretty much got back to normal again , for quite a few years .
On occasion I 'd recall Johnny 's strange words , from when he was addled .
And wondered if that weird other personality of his would ever return again , like it had promised .
But it never did .
Abrupt departure Johnny died suddenly and without warning on August 26th , 2008 .
From a brain aneurysm .
I privately wondered if it was related to his earlier spell of mental confusion , or the coma .
Or maybe to that odd second personality trying to come back again .
Me and Johnny 's other friends and family began cutting back on going to church after that .
And so did our neighbors .
The coincidence did seem unusual -- but we did n't dwell on it .
We were too busy .
It 's been a year now , and I 've not been to church at all for four months .
I 've taken to reading more books instead .
Science and science fiction , mostly .
Sometimes some psychology and how - to manuals .
I guess we all of us develop some mighty strange new interests as we get older .
I also finally got me one of those fancy computers a few weeks back , and signed up for the internet .
The local library and used bookstore just do n't seem to cut it anymore .
I soon found myself on a page that reminded me of good old Johnny .
Mostly friendly and fun and curious about everything -- but with some weird other worldly aspects too , at times .
After I realized the page offered up a frequently updated list of news from lots of different sources ( especially regarding science , technology , and science fiction ) -- plus encouraged folks to add their own two cents to the stories in several ways -- I decided to make it my home page .
It took me a whole day to notice the little cartoon figure in the upper left hand corner .
And several days beyond that to see someone explain that the figure was supposed to be an alien .
An alien mascot .
And that made me think of Johnny again ( when he was addled ) .
Talking like he was an alien , here to set us back onto the proper path again .
Even in what little time I 've been online , I 've already seen cases of people seeming to believe real life aliens to be among us .
Aliens hiding , or in disguise , and secretly manipulating us to their own ends .
But I 'd seen that theme for years on TV and in Hollywood films too , before ever getting the internet .
I smiled and shook my head .
Amazed that anyone could take seriously the idea that aliens might visit the Earth , and subtly poke and prod us , to get us to change .
What would really be funny , I thought , was if aliens actually did do that , but did n't try to cover it up at all .
That is , they 'd show up and talk to us straight out about what they were doing , and even set up informative web sites like this one -- and plant obviously alien trademarks on their works , too .
Do all this out in the open , in front of everybody , making no pretenses whatsoever about it .
And we human beings never take serious notice .
That would be hilarious .

Dust storms swept over Sydney Wednesday morning , turning the city sky so red , some residents thought they 'd left the blue planet .
" It was like waking up on Mars , " Sydney resident Marcus Schappi wrote in an e-mail to Wired.com .
Residents of eastern Australia have had to battle these bizarre conditions , because strong winds from the dry interior swept up dust and brought it gusting into the city .
“ An intense north low pressure area formed and generated gale - force westerly winds during yesterday , and those winds picked up a lot of dust from the very dry interior of the continent , ” Barry Hanstrum , New South Wales regional director at the Bureau of Meteorology , told Bloomberg .
Even though they knew what was happening , the strangeness of the event understandably caught Sydneysiders off guard .
A Twitter hashtag to track the event , #sydneyduststorm , quickly appeared .
One @wiredscience follower on Twitter declared it " a leeetle apocalyptic , " and none of them had ever experienced dust storms of a comparable intensity in their lifetimes .
Perhaps the only similar event in recent Australian history was a massive dust storm in Melbourne in 1983 .
In other areas of southern Australia like Broken Hill — well inland in western New South Wales — the storms have been even more intense .
Dust storms have occasionally blacked out the sky , as you can see in this incredible video .
While the immediate cause of the craziness was the wind , it 's difficult to know if there were underlying changes in Australia 's climate that contributed to the storm .
It 's impossible to attribute the freak storm directly to climate change , said climatologist Kevin Hennessy , lead author of the chapter on Australia in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report .
" You can't really link any individual extreme weather event to climate change , " Hennessy said .
" It 's much more complicated than that . "
But the 13 - year drought that eastern Australia has been experiencing created the dusty conditions that made the storm possible .
And the drought appears linked to global warming .
The IPCC summary of impacts on Australia noted with high confidence that regional climate change had occurred in the country .
Since 1950 , there has been 0.4 to 0.7 Celsius degrees warming and " less rain in southern and eastern Australia . "
While many of the pictures streaming out of Sydney show the blood - red sky of the morning , as the day has worn on , the sky has lightened considerably .
By late morning , the sky was more sepia , @wiredscience followers , @wilko64 and @heathergracious informed us .
We 've collected photos from our Down Under readers down under .
We thank them all for their quick responses to our Tweets from @wiredscience .

What Is Physics ?
Physics is considered to be the most basic of the natural sciences .
It deals with the fundamental constituents of matter and their interactions as well as the nature of atoms and the build - up of molecules and condensed matter .
It tries to give unified descriptions of the behavior of matter as well as of radiation , covering as many types of phenomena as possible .
In some of its applications , it comes close to the classical areas of chemistry , and in others there is a clear connection to the phenomena traditionally studied by astronomers .
Present trends are even pointing toward a closer approach of some areas of physics and microbiology .
Although chemistry and astronomy are clearly independent scientific disciplines , both use physics as a basis in the treatment of their respective problem areas , concepts and tools .
To distinguish what is physics and chemistry in certain overlapping areas is often difficult .
This has been illustrated several times in the history of the Nobel Prizes .
Therefore , a few awards for chemistry will also be mentioned in the text that follows , particularly when they are closely connected to the works of the Physics Laureates themselves .
As for astronomy , the situation is different since it has no Nobel Prizes of its own ; it has therefore been natural from the start , to consider discoveries in astrophysics as possible candidates for Prizes in Physics .
From Classical to Quantum Physics
In 1901 , when the first Nobel Prizes were awarded , the classical areas of physics seemed to rest on a firm basis built by great 19th century physicists and chemists .
Hamilton had formulated a very general description of the dynamics of rigid bodies as early as the 1830s .
Carnot , Joule , Kelvin and Gibbs had developed thermodynamics to a high degree of perfection during the second half of the century .
Maxwell ’s famous equations had been accepted as a general description of electromagnetic phenomena and had been found to be also applicable to optical radiation and the radio waves recently discovered by Hertz .
Everything , including the wave phenomena , seemed to fit quite well into a picture built on mechanical motion of the constituents of matter manifesting itself in various macroscopic phenomena .
Some observers in the late 19th century actually expressed the view that , what remained for physicists to do was only to fill in minor gaps in this seemingly well - established body of knowledge .
However , it would very soon turn out that this satisfaction with the state of physics was built on false premises .
The turn of the century became a period of observations of phenomena that were completely unknown up to then , and radically new ideas on the theoretical basis of physics were formulated .
It must be regarded as a historical coincidence , probably never foreseen by Alfred Nobel himself , that the Nobel Prize institution happened to be created just in time to enable the prizes to cover many of the outstanding contributions that opened new areas of physics in this period .
One of the unexpected phenomena during the last few years of the 19th century , was the discovery of X - rays by Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen in 1895 , which was awarded the first Nobel Prize in Physics ( 1901 ) .
Another was the discovery of radioactivity by Antoine Henri Becquerel in 1896 , and the continued study of the nature of this radiation by Marie and Pierre Curie .
The origin of the X - rays was not immediately understood at the time , but it was realized that they indicated the existence of a hitherto concealed world of phenomena ( although their practical usefulness for medical diagnosis was evident enough from the beginning ) .
The work on radioactivity by Becquerel and the Curies was rewarded in 1903 ( with one half to Becqurel and the other half shared by the Curies ) , and in combination with the additional work by Ernest Rutherford ( who got the Chemistry Prize in 1908 ) it was understood that atoms , previously considered as more or less structureless objects , actually contained a very small but compact nucleus .
Some atomic nuclei were found to be unstable and could emit the or radiation observed .
This was a revolutionary insight at the time , and it led in the end , through parallel work in other areas of physics , to the creation of the first useful picture of the structure of atoms .
In 1897 , Joseph J. Thomson , who worked with rays emanating from the cathode in partly evacuated discharge tubes , identified the carriers of electric charge .
He showed that these rays consisted of discrete particles , later called “ electrons ” .
He measured a value for the ratio between their mass and ( negative ) charge , and found that it was only a very small fraction of that expected for singly charged atoms .
It was soon realized that these lightweight particles must be the building blocks that , together with the positively charged nuclei , make up all different kinds of atoms .
Thomson received his Prize in 1906 .
By then , Philipp E.A. von Lenard had already been acknowledged the year before ( 1905 ) for elucidating other interesting properties of the cathodic rays , such as their ability to penetrate thin metal foils and produce fluorescence .
Soon thereafter ( in 1912 ) Robert A. Millikan made the first precision measurement of the electron charge with the oil - drop method , which led to a Physics Prize for him in 1923 .
Millikan was also rewarded for his works on the photoelectric effect .
In the beginning of the century , Maxwell ’s equations had already existed for several decades , but many questions remained unanswered : what kind of medium propagated electromagnetic radiation ( including light ) and what carriers of electric charges were responsible for light emission ?
Albert A. Michelson had developed an interferometric method , by which distances between objects could be measured as a number of wavelengths of light ( or fractions thereof ) .
This made comparison of lengths much more exact than what had been possible before .
Many years later , the Bureau International de Poids et Mesures , Paris ( BINP ) defined the meter unit in terms of the number of wavelengths of a particular radiation instead of the meter prototype .
Using such an interferometer , Michelson had also performed a famous experiment , together with E. W. Morley , from which it could be concluded that the velocity of light is independent of the relative motion of the light source and the observer .
This fact refuted the earlier assumption of an ether as a medium for light propagation .
Michelson received the Physics Prize in 1907 .
The mechanisms for emission of light by carriers of electric charge was studied by Hendrik A. Lorentz , who was one of the first to apply Maxwell ’s equations to electric charges in matter .
His theory could also be applied to the radiation caused by vibrations in atoms and it was in this context that it could be put to its first crucial test .
As early as 1896 Pieter Zeeman , who was looking for possible effects of electric and magnetic fields on light , made an important discovery namely , that spectral lines from sodium in a flame were split up into several components when a strong magnetic field was applied .
This phenomenon could be given a quite detailed interpretation by Lorentz ’s theory , as applied to vibrations of the recently identified electrons , and Lorentz and Zeeman shared the Physics Prize in 1902 , i.e. even before Thomson ’s discovery was rewarded .
Later , Johannes Stark demonstrated the direct effect of electric fields on the emission of light , by exposing beams of atoms ( “ anodic rays ” , consisting of atoms or molecules ) to strong electric fields .
He observed a complicated splitting of spectral lines as well as a Doppler shift depending on the velocities of the emitters .
Stark received the 1919 Physics Prize .
With this background , it became possible to build detailed models for the atoms , objects that had existed as concepts ever since antiquity but were considered more or less structureless in classical physics .
There existed already , since the middle of the previous century , a rich empirical material in the form of characteristic spectral lines emitted in the visible domain by different kinds of atoms , and to this was added the characteristic X - ray radiation discovered by Charles G. Barkla ( Physics Prize in 1917 , awarded in 1918 ) , which after the clarification of the wave nature of this radiation and its diffraction by Max von Laue ( Physics Prize in 1914 ) , also became an important source of information on the internal structure of atoms .
Barkla ’s characteristic X - rays were secondary rays , specific for each element exposed to radiation from X - ray tubes ( but independent of the chemical form of the samples ) .
Karl Manne G. Siegbahn realized that measuring characteristic X - ray spectra of all the elements would show systematically how successive electron shells are added when going from the light elements to the heavier ones .
He designed highly accurate spectrometers for this purpose by which energy differences between different shells , as well as rules for radiative transitions between them , could be established .
He received the Physics Prize in 1924 ( awarded in 1925 ) .
However , it would turn out that a deeper understanding of the atomic structure required a much further departure from the habitual concepts of classical physics than anyone could have imagined .
Classical physics assumes continuity in motion as well as in the gain or loss of energy .
Why then , do atoms send out radiations with sharp wavelengths ?
Here , a parallel line of development , also with its roots in late 19th century physics , had given important clues for interpretation .
Wilhelm
Wien studied the “ black - body ” radiation from hot solid bodies ( which in contrast to radiation from atoms in gases , has a continuous distribution of frequencies ) .
Using classical electrodynamics , he derived an expression for the frequency distribution of this radiation and the shift of the maximum intensity wavelength , when the temperature of a black body is changed ( the Wien displacement law , useful for instance in determining the temperature of the sun ) .
He was awarded the Physics Prize in 1911 .
However , Wien could not derive a distribution formula that agreed with experiments for both short and long wavelengths .
The problem remained unexplained until Max K.E.L .
Planck put forward his radically new idea that the radiated energy could only be emitted in quanta , i.e. portions that had a certain definite value , larger for the short wavelengths than for the long ones ( equal to a constant times the frequency for each quantum ) .
This is considered to be the birth of quantum physics .
Wien received the Physics Prize in 1911 and Planck some years later , in 1918 ( awarded in 1919 ) .
Important verifications that light comes in the form of energy quanta came also through Albert Einstein ‘s interpretation of the photoelectric effect ( first observed in 1887 by Hertz ) which also involved extensions of Planck ’s theories .
Einstein received the Physics Prize for 1921 ( awarded in 1922 ) .
The prize motivation cited also his other “ services to theoretical physics , ” which will be referred to in another context .
Later experiments by James Franck and Gustav L. Hertz demonstrated the inverse of the photoelectric effect ( i.e. that an electron that strikes an atom , must have a specific minimum energy to produce light quanta of a particular energy from it ) and showed the general validity of Planck ’s expressions involving the constant .
Franck and Hertz shared the 1925 prize , awarded in 1926 .
At about the same time , Arthur H. Compton ( who received one - half of the Physics Prize for 1927 ) studied the energy loss in X - ray photon scattering on material particles , and showed that X - ray quanta , whose energies are more than 10,000 times larger than those of light , also obey the same quantum rules .
The other half was given to Charles T.R. Wilson ( see later ) , whose device for observing high energy scattering events could be used for verification of Compton ’s predictions .
With the concept of energy quantization as a background , the stage was set for further ventures into the unknown world of microphysics .
Like some other well - known physicists before him , Niels H. D. Bohr worked with a planetary picture of electrons circulating around the nucleus of an atom .
He found that the sharp spectral lines emitted by the atoms could only be explained if the electrons were circulating in stationary orbits characterized by a quantized angular momentum ( integer units of Planck ’s constant divided by ) and that the emitted frequencies corresponded to emission of radiation with energy equal to the difference between quantized energy states of the electrons .
His suggestion indicated a still more radical departure from classical physics than Planck ’s hypothesis .
Although it could only explain some of the simplest features of optical spectra in its original form , it was soon accepted that Bohr ’s approach must be a correct starting point , and he received the Physics Prize in 1922 .
It turned out that a deeper discussion of the properties of radiation and matter ( until then considered as forming two completely different categories ) , was necessary for further progress in the theoretical description of the microworld .
In 1923 Prince Louis - Victor P. R. de Broglie proposed that material particles may also show wave properties , now that electromagnetic radiation had been shown to display particle aspects in the form of photons .
He developed mathematical expressions for this dualistic behavior , including what has later been called the “ de Broglie wavelength ” of a moving particle .
Early experiments by Clinton J. Davisson had indicated that electrons could actually show reflection effects similar to that of waves hitting a crystal and these experiments were now repeated , verifying the associated wavelength predicted by de Broglie .
Somewhat later , George P. Thomson ( son of J. J. Thomson ) made much improved experiments on higher energy electrons penetrating thin metal foils which showed very clear diffraction effects .
de Broglie was rewarded for his theories in 1929 and Davisson and Thomson later shared the 1937 Physics Prize .
What remained was the formulation of a new , consistent theory that would replace classical mechanics , valid for atomic phenomena and their associated radiations .
The years 1924 - 1926 was a period of intense development in this area .
Erwin Schrödinger built further on the ideas of de Broglie and wrote a fundamental paper on “ Quantization as an eigenvalue problem ” early in 1926 .
He created what has been called “ wave mechanics ” .
But the year before that , Werner K. Heisenberg had already started on a mathematically different approach , called “ matrix mechanics ” , by which he arrived at equivalent results ( as was later shown by Schrödinger ) .
Schrödinger ’s and Heisenberg ’s new quantum mechanics meant a fundamental departure from the intuitive picture of classical orbits for atomic objects , and implied also that there are natural limitations on the accuracy by which certain quantities can be measured simultaneously ( Heisenberg ’s uncertainty relations ) .
Heisenberg was rewarded by the Physics Prize for 1932 ( awarded 1933 ) for the development of quantum mechanics , while Schrödinger shared the Prize one year later ( 1933 ) with Paul A.M. Dirac .
Schrödinger ’s and Heisenberg ’s quantum mechanics was valid for the relatively low velocities and energies associated with the “ orbital ” motion of valence electrons in atoms , but their equations did not satisfy the requirements set by Einstein ’s rules for fast moving particles ( to be mentioned later ) .
Dirac constructed a modified formalism which took into account effects of Einstein ’s special relativity , and showed that such a theory not only contained terms corresponding to the intrinsic spinning of electrons ( and therefore explaining their own intrinsic magnetic moment and the fine structure observed in atomic spectra ) , but also predicted the existence of a completely new kind of particles , the so - called antiparticles with identical masses but opposite charge .
The first antiparticle to be discovered , that of the electron , was observed in 1932 by Carl D. Anderson and was given the name “ positron ” ( one - half of the Physics Prize for 1936 ) .
Other important contributions to the development of quantum theory have been distinguished by Nobel Prizes in later years .
Max Born , Heisenberg ’s supervisor in the early twenties , made important contributions to its mathematical formulation and physical interpretation .
He received one - half of the Physics Prize for 1954 for his work on the statistical interpretation of the wave function .
Wolfgang Pauli formulated his exclusion principle ( which states that there can be only one electron in each quantum state ) already on the basis of Bohr ’s old quantum theory .
This principle was later found to be associated with the symmetry of wave functions for particles of half - integer spins in general , distinguishing what is now called fermions from the bosonic particles whose spins are integer multiples of .
The exclusion principle has deep consequences in many areas of physics and Pauli received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1945 .
The study of electron spins would continue to open up new horizons in physics .
Precision methods for determining the magnetic moments of spinning particles were developed during the thirties and forties for atoms as well as nuclei ( by Stern , Rabi , Bloch and Purcell , see later sections ) and in 1947 they had reached such a precision , that Polykarp Kusch could state that the magnetic moment of an electron did not have exactly the value predicted by Dirac , but differed from it by a small amount .
At about the same time , Willis E. Lamb worked on a similar problem of electron spins interacting with electromagnetic fields , by studying the fine structure of optical radiation from hydrogen with very high resolution radio frequency resonance methods .
He found that the fine structure splitting also did not have exactly the Dirac value , but differed from it by a significant amount .
These results stimulated a reconsideration of the basic concepts behind the application of quantum theory to electromagnetism , a field that had been started by Dirac , Heisenberg and Pauli but still suffered from several insufficiencies .
Kusch and Lamb were each awarded half the the Physics Prize in 1955 .
In quantum electrodynamics ( QED for short ) , charged particles interact through the interchange of virtual photons , as described by quantum perturbation theory .
The older versions involved only single photon exchange , but Sin-Itiro Tomonaga , Julian Schwinger and Richard P. Feynman realized that the situation is actually much more complicated , since electron - electron scattering may involve several photon exchanges .
A “ naked ” point charge does not exist in their picture ; it always produces a cloud of virtual particle - antiparticle pairs around itself , such that its effective magnetic moment is changed and the Coulomb potential is modified at short distances .
Calculations starting from this picture have reproduced the experimental data by Kusch and Lamb to an astonishing degree of accuracy and modern QED is now considered to be the most exact theory in existence .
Tomonaga , Schwinger and Feynman shared the Physics Prize in 1965 .
This progress in QED turned out to be of the greatest importance also for the description of phenomena at higher energies .
The notion of pair production from a “ vacuum ” state of a quantized field ( both as a virtual process and as a real materialization of particles ) , is also a central building block in the modern field theory of strong interactions , quantum chromodynamics ( QCD ) .
Another basic aspect of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory is the symmetries of wave functions and fields .
The symmetry properties under exchange of identical particles lie behind Pauli ’s exclusion principle mentioned above , but symmetries with respect to spatial transformations have turned out to play an equally important role .
In 1956 , Tsung - Dao Lee and Chen Ning Yang pointed out , that physical interactions may not always be symmetric with respect to reflection in a mirror ( that is , they may be different as seen in a left - handed and a right - handed coordinate system ) .
This means that the wave function property called “ parity ” , denoted by the symbol “ P ” , is not conserved when the system is exposed to such an interaction and the mirror reflection property may be changed .
Lee ’s and Yang ’s work was the starting point for an intense search for such effects and it was shown soon afterwards that the decay and the decay , which are both caused by the so - called “ weak interaction ” are not parity - conserving ( see more below ) .
Lee and Yang were jointly awarded the Physics Prize in 1957 .
Other symmetries in quantum mechanics are connected with the replacement of a particle with its antiparticle , called charge conjugation ( symbolized by “ C ” ) .
In the situations discussed by Lee and Yang it was found that although parity was not conserved in the radioactive transformations there was still a symmetry in the sense that particles and antiparticles broke parity in exactly opposite ways and that therefore the combined operation “ C ” x ” P ” still gave results which preserved symmetry .
But it did not last long before James W. Cronin and Val L. Fitch found a decay mode among the “ K mesons ” that violated even this principle , although only to a small extent .
Cronin and Fitch made their discovery in 1964 and were jointly awarded the Physics Prize in 1980 .
The consequences of their result ( which include questions about the symmetry of natural processes under reversal of time , called “ T ” ) are still discussed today and touch some of the deepest foundations of theoretical physics , because the “ P ” x ” C ” x ” T ” symmetry is expected always to hold .
The electromagnetic field is known to have another property , called “ gauge symmetry ” , which means that the field equations keep their form even if the electromagnetic potentials are multiplied with certain quantum mechanical phase factors , or “ gauges ” .
It was not self - evident that the “ weak ” interaction should have this property , but it was a guiding principle in the work by Sheldon L. Glashow , Abdus Salam , and Steven Weinberg in the late 1960s , when they formulated a theory that described the weak and the electromagnetic interaction on the same basis .
They were jointly awarded the Physics Prize in 1979 for this unified description and , in particular , for their prediction of a particular kind of weak interaction mediated by “ neutral currents ” , which had been found recently in experiments .
The last Physics Prize ( 1999 ) in the 20th century was jointly awarded to Gerhardus ‘t Hooft and Martinus J. G. Veltman .
They showed the way to renormalize the “ electro - weak ” theory , which was necessary to remove terms that tended to infinity in quantum mechanical calculations ( just as QED had earlier solved a similar problem for the Coulomb interaction ) .
Their work allowed detailed calculations of weak interaction contributions to particle interactions in general , proving the utility of theories based on gauge invariance for all kinds of basic physical interactions .
Quantum mechanics and its extensions to quantum field theories is one of the great achievements of the 20th century .
This sketch of the route from classical physics to modern quantum physics , has led us a long way toward a fundamental and unified description of the different particles and forces in nature , but much remains to be done and the goal is still far ahead .
It still remains , for instance , to “ unify ” the electro - weak force with the “ strong ” nuclear force and with gravity .
But here , it should also be pointed out that the quantum description of the microworld has another main application : the calculation of chemical properties of molecular systems ( sometimes extended to biomolecules ) and of the structure of condensed matter , branches that have been distinguished with several prizes , in physics as well as in chemistry .
Microcosmos and Macrocosmos
“ From Classical to Quantum Physics ” , took us on a trip from the phenomena of the macroscopic world as we meet it in our daily experience , to the quantum world of atoms , electrons and nuclei .
With the atoms as starting point , the further penetration into the subatomic microworld and its smallest known constituents will now be illustrated by the works of other Nobel Laureates .
It was realized , already in the first half of the 20th century , that such a further journey into the microcosmos of new particles and interactions would also be necessary for understanding the composition and evolution histories of the very large structures of our universe , the “ macrocosmos ” .
At the present stage elementary particle physics , astrophysics , and cosmology are strongly tied together , as several examples presented here will show .
Another link connecting the smallest and the largest objects in our universe is Albert Einstein ‘s theories of relativity .
Einstein first developed his special theory of relativity in 1905 , which expresses the mass - energy relationship .
Then , in the next decade , he continued with his theory of general relativity , which connects gravitational forces to the structure of space and time .
Calculations of effective masses for high energy particles , energy transformations in radioactive decay as well as Dirac ’s predictions that antiparticles may exist , are all based on his special theory of relativity .
The general theory is the basis for calculations of large scale motions in the universe , including discussions of the properties of black holes .
Einstein received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 ( awarded in 1922 ) , motivated by work on the photo - electric effect which demonstrated the particle aspects of light .
The works by Becquerel , the Curies , and Rutherford gave rise to new questions :
What was the source of energy in the radioactive nuclei that could sustain the emission of and radiation over very long time intervals , as observed for some of them , and what were the heavy particles and the nuclei themselves actually composed of ?
The first of these problems ( which seemed to violate the law of conservation of energy , one of the most important principles of physics ) found its solution in the transmutation theory , formulated by Rutherford and Frederick Soddy ( Chemistry Prize for 1921 , awarded in 1922 ) .
They followed in detail several different series of radioactive decay and compared the energy emitted with the mass differences between “ parent ” and “ daughter ” nuclei .
It was also found that nuclei belonging to the same chemical element could have different masses ; such different species were called “ isotopes ” .
A Chemistry Prize was given in 1922 to Francis W. Aston for his mass - spectroscopic separation of a large number of isotopes of non-radioactive elements .
Marie Curie had by then already received a second Nobel Prize ( this time in Chemistry in 1911 ) , for her discoveries of the chemical elements radium and polonium .
All isotopic masses were found to be nearly equal to multiples of the mass of the proton , a particle also first seen by Rutherford when he irradiated nitrogen nuclei with particles .
But the different isotopes could not possibly be made up entirely of protons since each particular chemical element must have one single value for the total nuclear charge .
Protons were actually found to make up less than half of the nuclear mass , which meant that some neutral constituents had to be present in the nuclei .
James Chadwick first found conclusive evidence for such particles , the neutrons , when he studied nuclear reactions in 1932 .
He received the Physics Prize in 1935 .
Soon after Chadwick ’s discovery , neutrons were put to work by Enrico Fermi and others as a means to induce nuclear reactions that could produce new “ artificial ” radioactivity .
Fermi found that the probability of neutron - induced reactions ( which do not involve element transformations ) , increased when the neutrons were slowed down and that this worked equally well for heavy elements as for light ones , in contrast to charge - particle induced reactions .
He received the Physics Prize in 1938 .
With neutrons and protons as the basic building blocks of atomic nuclei , the branch of “ nuclear physics ” could be established and several of its major achievements were distinguished by Nobel prizes .
Ernest O. Lawrence , who received the Physics Prize in 1939 , built the first cyclotron in which acceleration took place by successively adding small amounts of energy to particles circulating in a magnetic field .
With these machines , he was able to accelerate charged nuclear particles to such high energies that they could induce nuclear reactions and he obtained important new results .
Sir John D. Cockcroft and Ernest T.S. Walton instead , accelerated particles by direct application of very high electrostatic voltages and were rewarded for their studies of transmutation of elements in 1951 .
Otto Stern received the Physics Prize in 1943 ( awarded in 1944 ) , for his experimental methods of studying magnetic properties of nuclei , in particular for measuring the magnetic moment of the proton itself .
Isidor I. Rabi increased the accuracy of magnetic moment determinations for nuclei by more than two orders of magnitude , with his radio frequency resonance technique , for which he was awarded the Physics Prize for 1944 .
Magnetic properties of nuclei provide important information for understanding details in the build - up of the nuclei from protons and neutrons .
Later , in the second half of the century , several theoreticians were rewarded for their work on the theoretical modelling of this complex many - body system : Eugene P. Wigner ( one - half of the prize ) , Maria Goeppert - Mayer ( one - fourth ) and J. Hans D. Jensen ( one - fourth ) in 1963 and Aage N. Bohr , Ben R. Mottelson and L. James Rainwater in 1975 .
We will come back to these works under the heading “ From Simple to Complex Systems ” .
As early as 1912 , it was found by Victor F. Hess ( awarded half the Prize in 1936 and the other half to Carl D. Anderson ) that highly penetrating radiation is also reaching us continuously from outer space .
This “ cosmic radiation ” was first detected by ionization chambers and later by Wilson ’s cloud chamber referred to earlier .
Properties of particles in the cosmic radiation could be inferred from the curved particle tracks produced when a strong magnetic field was applied .
It was in this way that C. D. Anderson discovered the positron .
Anderson and Patrick M.S. Blackett showed that electron positron pairs could be produced by rays ( which needed a photon energy equal to at least ) and that electrons and positrons could annihilate , producing rays as they disappeared .
Blackett received the Physics Prize in 1948 for his further development of the cloud chamber and the discoveries made with it .
Although accelerators were further developed , cosmic radiation continued for a couple of decades to be the main source of very energetic particles ( and still surpasses the most powerful accelerators on earth in this aspect , although with extremely low intensities ) , and it provided the first glimpses of a completely unknown subnuclear world .
A new kind of particles , called mesons , was spotted in 1937 , having masses approximately 200 times that of electrons ( but 10 times lighter than protons ) .
In 1946 , Cecil F. Powell clarified the situation by showing that there were actually more than one kind of such particles present .
One of them , the “ meson ” , decays into the other one , the “ µ meson ” .
Powell was awarded the Physics Prize in 1950 .
By that time , theoreticians had already been speculating about the forces that keep protons and neutrons together in nuclei .
Hideki Yukawa suggested in 1935 , that this “ strong ” force should be carried by an exchange particle , just as the electromagnetic force was assumed to be carried by an exchange of virtual photons in the new quantum field theory .
Yukawa maintained that such a particle must have a mass of about 200 electron masses in order to explain the short range of the strong forces found in experiments .
Powell ’s meson was found to have the right properties to act as a “ Yukawa particle ” .
The µ particle , on the other hand , turned out to have a completely different character ( and its name was later changed from “ µ meson ” to “ muon ” ) .
Yukawa received the Physics Prize in 1949 .
Although later progress has shown that the strong force mechanism is more complex than what Yukawa pictured it to be , he must still be considered as the first one who led the thoughts on force carriers in this fruitful direction .
More new particles were discovered in the 1950s , in cosmic radiation as well as in collisions with accelerated particles .
By the end of the 50s , accelerators could reach energies of several GeV ( 109 electron volts ) which meant that pairs of particles , with masses equal to the proton mass , could be created by energy - to - mass conversion .
This was the method used by the team of Owen Chamberlain and Emilio Segrè when they first identified and studied the antiproton in 1955 ( they shared the Physics Prize for 1959 ) .
High energy accelerators also allowed more detailed studies of the structures of protons and neutrons than before , and Robert Hofstadter was able to distinguish details of the electromagnetic structure of the nucleons by observing how they scattered electrons of very high energy .
He was rewarded with half the Physics Prize for 1961 .
One after another , new mesons with their respective antiparticles appeared , as tracks on photographic plates or in electronic particle detectors .
The existence of the “ neutrino ” predicted on theoretical grounds by Pauli already as early as the 1930s , was established .
The first direct experimental evidence for the neutrino was provided by C. L. Cowan and Frederick Reines in 1957 , but it was not until 1995 that this discovery was awarded with one - half the Nobel Prize ( Cowan had died in 1984 ) .
The neutrino is a participant in processes involving the “ weak ” interaction ( such as decay and meson decay to muons ) and , as the intensity of particle beams increased , it became possible to produce secondary beams of neutrinos from accelerators .
Leon M. Lederman , Melvin Schwartz and Jack Steinberger developed this method in the 1960s and demonstrated that the neutrinos accompanying µ emission in decay were not identical to those associated with electrons in decay ; they were two different particles , and .
Physicists could now start to distinguish some order among the particles : the electron ( e ) , the muon ( µ ) , the electron neutrino ( ) , the muon neutrino ( ) and their antiparticles were found to belong to one class , called “ leptons ” .
They did not interact by the “ strong ” nuclear force , which on the other hand , characterized the protons , neutrons , mesons and hyperons ( a set of particles heavier than the protons ) .
The lepton class was extended later in the 1970s when Martin L. Perl and his team discovered the lepton , a heavier relative to the electron and the muon .
Perl shared the Physics Prize in 1995 with Reines .
All the leptons are still considered to be truly fundamental , i.e. point - like and without internal structure , but for the protons , etc , this is no longer true .
Murray Gell - Mann and others managed to classify the strongly interacting particles ( called “ hadrons ” ) into groups with common relationships and ways of interaction .
Gell - Mann received the Physics Prize in 1969 .
His systematics was based on the assumption that they were all built up from more elementary constituents , called “ quarks ” .
The real proof that nucleons were built up from quark - like objects came through the works of Jerome I. Friedman , Henry W. Kendall and Richard E. Taylor .
They “ saw ” hard grains inside these objects when they studied how electrons ( of still higher energy than Hofstadter could use earlier ) scattered inelastically on them .
They shared the Physics Prize in 1990 .
It was understood that all strongly interacting particles are built up by quarks .
In the middle of the 1970s a very short - lived particle , discovered independently by the teams of Burton Richter and Samuel C.C. Ting , was found to contain a so far , unknown type of quark which was given the name “ charm ” .
This quark was a missing link in the systematics of the elementary particles and Burton and Ting shared the Physics Prize in 1976 .
The present standard model of particle physics sorts the particles into three families , with two quarks ( and their antiparticles ) and two leptons in each : the “ up ” and “ down ” quarks , the electron and the electron - neutrino in the first ; the “ strange ” and the “ charm ” quark , the muon and the muon neutrino in the second ; the “ top ” and the “ bottom ” quark , the tauon and the tau neutrino in the third .
The force carriers for the combined electro - weak interaction are the photon , the Z - particle and the W - bosons , and for the strong interaction between quarks the so - called gluons .
In 1983 , the existence of the W - and Z - particles was proven by Carlo Rubbia ‘s team which used a new proton - antiproton collider with sufficient energy for production of these very heavy particles .
Rubbia shared the 1984 Physics Prize with Simon van der Meer , who had made decisive contributions to the construction of this collider by his invention of “ stochastic cooling ” of particles .
There are speculations that additional particles may be produced at energies higher than those attainable with the present accelerators , but no experimental evidence has been produced so far .
Cosmology is the science that deals with the structure and evolution of our universe and the large - scale objects in it .
Its models are based on the properties of the known fundamental particles and their interactions as well as the properties of space - time and gravitation .
The “ big- bang ” model describes a possible scenario for the early evolution of the universe .
One of its predictions was experimentally verified when Arno A. Penzias and Robert W. Wilson discovered the cosmic microwave radiation background in 1960 .
They shared one - half of the Physics Prize for 1978 .
This radiation is an afterglow of the violent processes assumed to have occurred in the early stages of the big bang .
Its equilibrium temperature is 3 kelvin at the present age of the universe .
It is almost uniform when observed in different directions ; the small deviations from isotropy are now being investigated and will tell us more about the earliest history of our universe .
Outer space has been likened to a large arena for particle interactions where extreme conditions , not attainable in a laboratory , are spontaneously created .
Particles may be accelerated to higher energies than in any accelerator on earth , nuclear fusion reactions proliferate in the interior of stars , and gravitation can compress particle systems to extremely high densities .
Hans A . Bethe first described the hydrogen and carbon cycles , in which energy is liberated in stars by the fusion of protons into helium nuclei .
For this achievement he received the Physics Prize in 1967 .
Subramanyan Chandrasekhar described theoretically the evolution of stars , in particular those ending up as “ white dwarfs ” .
Under certain conditions the end product may also be a “ neutron star ” , an extremely compact object , where all protons have been converted into neutrons .
In supernova explosions , the heavy elements created during stellar evolution are spread out into space .
The details of some of the most important nuclear reactions in stars and heavy element formation were elucidated by William A. Fowler both in theory and in experiments using accelerators .
Fowler and Chandrasekhar received one - half each of the 1983 Physics Prize .
Visible light and cosmic background radiation are not the only forms of electromagnetic waves that reach us from outer space .
At longer wavelengths , radio astronomy provides information on astronomical objects not obtainable by optical spectroscopy .
Sir Martin
Ryle developed the method where signals from several separated telescopes are combined in order to increase the resolution in the radio source maps of the sky .
Antony Hewish and his group made an unexpected discovery in 1964 using Ryle ’s telescopes : radio frequency pulses were emitted with very well - defined repetition rates by some unknown objects called pulsars .
These were soon identified as neutron stars , acting like fast rotating lighthouses emitting radiowaves because they are also strong magnets .
Ryle and Hewish shared the Physics Prize in 1974 .
By 1974 , pulsar search was already routine among radio astronomers , but a new surprise came in the summer of the same year when Russell A. Hulse and Joseph H. Taylor , Jr. noticed periodic modulations in the pulse frequencies of a newly discovered pulsar , called PSR 1913+16 .
It was the first double pulsar detected , so named because the emitting neutron star happened to be one of the components of a close double star system , with the other component of about equal size .
This system has provided , by observation over more than 20 years , the first concrete evidence for gravitational radiation .
The decrease of its rotational frequency is in close agreement with the predictions based on Einstein ’s theory , for losses caused by this kind of radiation .
Hulse and Taylor shared the Physics Prize in 1993 .
However , the direct detection of gravitational radiation on earth still has to be made .
From Simple to Complex Systems
If all the properties of the elementary particles as well as the forces that may act between them were known in every detail , would it then be possible to predict the behavior of all systems composed of such particles ?
The search for the ultimate building blocks of nature and of the proper theoretical description of their interactions ( on the macro as well as the micro scale ) , has partly been motivated by such a reductionistic program .
All scientists would not agree that such a synthesis is possible even in principle .
But even if it were true , the calculations of complex system behavior would very soon be impossible to handle when the number of particles and interactions in the system is increased .
Complex multi-particle systems are therefore described in terms of simplified models , where only the most essential features of their particle compositions and interactions are used as starting points .
Quite often , it is observed that complex systems develop features called “ emergent properties ” , not straightforwardly predictable from the basic interactions between their constituents .
Atomic Nuclei
The first complex systems from the reductionist ’s point of view are the nucleons , i.e. neutrons and protons composed of quarks and gluons .
The second is the atomic nuclei , which to a first approximation are composed of separate nucleons .
The first advanced model of nuclear structure was the nuclear shell model , put up by the end of the 1940s by Maria Goeppert - Mayer and Johannes D. Jensen who realized that at least for nuclei with nearly spherical shape , the outer nucleons fill up energy levels like electrons in atoms .
However , the order is different ; it is determined by another common potential and by the specific strong spin - orbit coupling of the nuclear forces .
Their model explains why nuclei with so - called “ magic numbers ” of protons or neutrons are particularly stable .
They shared the Physics Prize in 1963 together with Eugene Wigner , who had formulated fundamental symmetry principles important in both nuclear and particle physics .
Nuclei with nucleon numbers far from the magic ones are not spherical .
Niels Bohr had already worked with a liquid drop model for such deformed nuclei which may take ellipsoidal shapes , and in 1939 it was found that excitation of certain strongly deformed nuclei could lead to nuclear fission , i.e. the breakup of such nuclei into two heavy fragments .
Otto Hahn received the Chemistry Prize in 1944 ( awarded in 1945 ) for the discovery of this new process .
The non-spherical shape of deformed nuclei allows new collective , rotational degrees of freedom , as do also the collective vibrations of nucleons .
Models describing such excitations of the nuclei were developed by James Rainwater , Aage Bohr ( son of Niels Bohr ) and Ben Mottelson , who jointly received the Physics Prize in 1975 .
The nuclear models mentioned above , were based not only on general , guiding principles , but also on the steadily increasing information from nuclear spectroscopy .
Harold C. Urey discovered deuterium , a heavy isotope of hydrogen , for which he was awarded the Chemistry Prize in 1934 .
Fermi , Lawrence , Cockcroft , and Walton mentioned in the previous section developed methods for the production of unstable nuclear isotopes .
For their extension of the nuclear isotope chart to the heaviest elements , Edwin M. McMillan and Glenn T. Seaborg were awarded , again with a Chemistry Prize ( in 1951 ) .
In 1954 , Walther Bothe received one - half of the Physics Prize and the other half was awarded to Max Born , mentioned earlier .
Bothe developed the coincidence method , which allowed spectroscopists to select generically related sequences of nuclear radiation from the decay of nuclei .
This turned out to be important , particularly for the study of excited states of nuclei and their electromagnetic properties .
Atoms
The electronic shells of the atoms , when considered as many - body systems , are easier to handle than the nuclei ( which actually contain not only protons and neutrons but also more of other , short - lived “ virtual ” particles than the atoms ) .
This is due to the weakness and simplicity of the electromagnetic forces as compared to the “ strong ” forces holding the nuclei together .
With the quantum mechanics developed by Schrödinger , Heisenberg , and Pauli , and the relativistic extensions by Dirac , the main properties of the atomic electrons could be reasonably well described .
However , a long standing problem has remained , namely to solve the mathematical problems connected with the mutual interactions between the electrons after the dominating attraction by the positive nuclei has been taken into account .
One aspect of this was addressed in the work by one of the most recent Chemistry Laureates ( 1998 ) , Walter Kohn .
He developed the “ density functional ” method which is applicable to free atoms as well as to electrons in molecules and solids .
At the beginning of the 20th century , the periodic table of elements was not yet complete .
The early history of the Nobel Prizes includes the discoveries of some of the then missing elements .
Lord Raleigh ( John William Strutt ) noticed anomalies in the relative atomic masses when oxygen and nitrogen samples were taken directly from the air that surrounds us , instead of separating them from chemical compounds .
He concluded that the atmosphere must contain a so far unknown constituent , which was the element argon with atomic mass 20 .
He was awarded the Physics Prize in 1904 , the same year that Sir William Ramsay obtained the Chemistry Prize for isolating the element helium .
In the second half of the 20th century , there has been a spectacular development of atomic spectroscopy and the precision by which one can measure the transitions between atomic or molecular states that fall in the microwave and optical range .
Alfred Kastler ( who received the Physics Prize in 1966 ) and his co-workers showed in the 1950s that electrons in atoms can be put into selected excited substates by the use of polarized light .
After radiative decay , this can also lead to an orientation of the spins of ground - state atoms .
The subsequent induction of radio frequency transitions opened possibilities to measure properties of the quantized states of electrons in atoms in much greater detail than before .
A parallel line of development led to the invention of masers and lasers , which are based on the “ amplification of stimulated emission of radiation ” in strong microwave and optical ( light ) fields , respectively ( effects which in principle would have been predictable from Einstein ’s equations formulated in 1917 but were not discussed in practical terms until early in the 1950s ) .
Charles H. Townes developed the first maser in 1958 .
Theoretical work on the maser principle was made by Nikolay G. Basov and Aleksandr M. Prokhorov .
The first maser used a stimulated transition in the ammonia molecule .
It emitted an intense microwave radiation , which unlike that of natural emitters , was coherent ( i.e. with all photons in phase ) .
Its frequency sharpness soon made it an important tool in technology , for time - keeping and other purposes .
Townes received half the Physics Prize for 1964 and Basov and Prokhorov shared the other half .
For radiation in the optical range , lasers were later developed in several laboratories .
Nicolaas Bloembergen and Arthur L. Schawlow were distinguished in 1981 for their work on precision laser spectroscopies of atoms and molecules .
The other half of that year ’s prize was awarded to Kai M. Siegbahn ( son of Manne Siegbahn ) , who developed another high - precision method for atomic and molecular spectroscopy based on electrons emitted from inner electron shells when hit by X - rays with very well - defined energy .
His photo- and Auger - electron spectroscopy is used as an analytical tool in several other areas of physics and chemistry .
The controlled interplay between atomic electrons and electromagnetic fields has continued to provide ever more detailed information about the structure of electronic states in atoms .
Norman F. Ramsey developed precision methods based on the response to external radio frequency signals by free atoms in atomic beams and Wolfgang Paul invented atomic “ traps ” , built by combinations of electric and magnetic fields acting over the sample volumes .
Hans G. Dehmelt ‘s group was the first to isolate single particles ( positrons ) as well as single atoms in such traps .
For the first time , experimenters could “ communicate ” with individual atoms by microwave and laser signals .
This enabled the study of new aspects of quantum mechanical behavior as well as further increased precision in atomic properties and the setting of time standards .
Paul and Dehmelt received the 1989 Physics Prize and the other half was awarded to Ramsey .
The latest step in this development has involved the slowing down of the motion of atoms in traps to such an extent that it would correspond to micro- kelvin temperatures , had they been in thermal equilibrium in a gas .
This is done by exposing them to “ laser cooling ” through a set of ingenious schemes designed and carried out in practice by Steven Chu , Claude Cohen - Tannoudji and William D. Phillips , whose research groups manipulated atoms by collisions with laser photons .
Their work , which was recognized by the 1997 Physics Prize , promises important applications in general measurement technology in addition to a still more increased precision in the determination of atomic quantities .
Molecules and Plasmas
Molecules are composed of atoms .
They form the next level of complexity when considered as many - body systems .
But molecular phenomena have traditionally been viewed as a branch of chemistry ( as exemplified by the Chemistry Prize in 1936 to Petrus J.W. Debye ) , and have only rarely been in the focus for Nobel Prizes in Physics .
One exception is the recognition of the work by Johannes Diderik van der Waals , who formulated an equation of state for molecules in a gas taking into account the mutual interaction between the molecules as well as the reduction of the free volume due to their finite size .
van der Waals ’ equation has been an important starting point for the description of the condensation of gases into liquids .
He received the 1910 Physics Prize .
Jean B. Perrin studied the motion of small particles suspended in water and received the 1926 Physics Prize .
His studies allowed a confirmation of Einstein ’s statistical theory of Brownian motion as well as of the laws governing the equilibrium of suspended particles under the influence of gravity .
In 1930 , Sir C. Venkata Raman received the Physics Prize for his observations that light scattered from molecules contained components which were shifted in frequency with respect to the infalling monochromatic light .
These shifts are caused by the molecules ’ gain or loss of characteristic amounts of energy when they change their rotational or vibrational motion .
Raman spectroscopy soon became an important source of information on molecular structure and dynamics .
A plasma is a gaseous state of matter in which the atoms or molecules are strongly ionized .
Mutual electromagnetic forces , both between the positive ions themselves and between the ions and the free electrons , are then playing dominant roles , which adds to the complexity as compared to the situation in neutral atomic or molecular gases .
Hannes Alfvén demonstrated in the 1940s that a new type of collective motion , called “ magneto - hydrodynamical waves ” can arise in such systems .
These waves play a crucial role for the behavior of plasmas , in the laboratory as well as in the earth ’s atmosphere and in cosmos .
Alfvén received half of the 1970 Physics Prize .
Condensed Matter
Crystals are characterized by a regular arrangement of atoms .
Relatively soon after the discovery of the X - rays , it was realized by Max von Laue that such rays were diffracted when passing through crystalline solids , like light passing an optical grating .
This effect is related to the fact that the wavelength of common X - ray sources happens to coincide with typical distances between atoms in these materials .
It was first used systematically by Sir William Henry Bragg and William Lawrence Bragg ( father and son ) to measure interatomic distances and to analyse the geometrical arrangement of atoms in simple crystals .
For their pioneering work on X - ray crystallography ( which has later been developed to a high degree of sophistication ) , they received the Nobel Prize in Physics ; Laue in 1914 and the Braggs in 1915 .
The crystalline structure is the most stable of the different ways in which atoms can be organized to form a certain solid at the prevalent temperature and pressure conditions .
In the 1930s Percy W. Bridgman invented devices by which very high pressures could be applied to different solid materials and studied changes in their crystalline , electric , magnetic and thermal properties .
Many crystals undergo phase transitions under such extreme circumstances , with abrupt changes in the geometrical arrangements of their atoms at certain well - defined pressures .
Bridgman received the Physics Prize in 1946 for his discoveries in the field of high pressure physics .
Low - energy neutrons became available in large numbers to the experimenters through the development of fission reactors in the 1940s .
It was found that these neutrons , like X - rays , were useful for crystal structure determinations because their associated de Broglie wavelengths also fall in the range of typical interatomic distances in solids .
Clifford G. Shull contributed strongly to the development of the neutron diffraction technique for crystal structure determination , and showed also that the regular arrangement of magnetic moments on atoms in ordered magnetic materials can give rise to neutron diffraction patterns , providing a new powerful tool for magnetic structure determination .
Shull was rewarded with the Physics Prize in 1994 , together with Bertram N. Brockhouse , who specialized in another aspect of neutron scattering on condensed material : the small energy losses resulting when neutrons excite vibrational modes ( phonons ) in a crystalline lattice .
For this purpose , Brockhouse developed the 3 - axis neutron spectrometer , by which complete dispersion curves ( phonon energies as function of wave vectors ) could be obtained .
Similar curves could be recorded for vibrations in magnetic lattices ( the magnon modes ) .
John H. Van Vleck made significant contributions to the theory of magnetism in condensed matter in the years following the creation of quantum mechanics .
He calculated the effects of chemical binding on the paramagnetic atoms and explained the effects of temperature and applied magnetic fields on their magnetism .
In particular , he developed the theory of crystal field effects on the magnetism of transition metal compounds , which has been of great importance for understanding the function of active centers in compounds for laser physics as well as in biomolecules .
He shared the Physics Prize in 1977 with Philip W. Anderson and Sir Nevill F. Mott ( see below ) .
Magnetic atoms can have their moments all ordered in the same direction in each domain ( ferromagnetism ) , with alternating “ up ” and “ down ” moments of the same size ( simple antiferromagnets ) or with more complicated patterns including different magnetic sublattices ( ferrimagnets , etc ) .
Louis E.F.
Néel introduced basic models to describe antiferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic materials , which are important components in many solid state devices .
They have been extensively studied by the aforementioned neutron diffraction techniques .
Néel obtained one - half of the Physics Prize in 1970 .
The geometric ordering of atoms in crystalline solids as well as the different kinds of magnetic order , are examples of general ordering phenomena in nature when systems find an energetically favorable arrangement by choosing a certain state of symmetry .
The critical phenomena , which occur when transitions between states of different symmetry are approached ( for instance when temperature is changed ) , have a high degree of universality for different types of transitions , including the magnetic ones .
Kenneth G. Wilson , who received the Physics Prize in 1982 , developed the so - called renormalization theory for critical phenomena in connection with phase transitions , a theory which has also found application in certain field theories of particle physics .
Liquid crystals form a specific class of materials that show many interesting features , from the point of view of fundamental interactions in condensed matter as well as for technical applications .
Pierre - Gilles de Gennes developed the theory for the behavior of liquid crystals and their transitions between different ordered phases ( nematic , smectic , etc ) .
He used also statistical mechanics to describe the arrangements and dynamics of polymer chains , thereby showing that methods developed for ordering phenomena in simple systems can be generalized to the complex ones occurring in “ soft condensed matter ” .
For this , he received the Physics Prize in 1991 .
Another specific form of liquid that has received attention is liquid helium .
At normal pressures , this substance remains liquid down to the lowest temperatures attainable .
It also shows large isotope effects , since condenses to liquid at 4.2 K , while the more rare isotope remains in gaseous form down to 3.2 K. Helium was first liquefied by Heike Kamerlingh - Onnes in 1909 .
He received the Physics Prize in 1913 for the production of liquid helium and for his investigations of properties of matter at low temperatures .
Lev D. Landau formulated fundamental concepts ( e.g. the “ Landau liquid ” ) concerning many - body effects in condensed matter and applied them to the theory of liquid helium , explaining specific phenomena occuring in such as the superfluidity ( see below ) , the “ roton ” excitations , and certain acoustic phenomena .
He was awarded the Physics Prize in 1962 .
Several of the experimental techniques used for the production and study of low temperature phenomena were developed by Pyotr L. Kapitsa in the 1920s and 30s .
He studied many aspects of liquid and showed that it was superfluid ( i.e. flowing without friction ) below 2.2 K .
The superfluid state was later understood to be a manifestation of macroscopic quantum coherence in a Bose - Einstein type of condensate ( theoretically predicted in 1920 ) with many features in common with the superconducting state for electrons in certain conductors .
Kapitsa received one - half of the Physics Prize for 1978 .
In liquid , additional , unique phenomena show up because each nucleus has a non -zero spin in contrast to those of .
Thus , it is a fermion type of particle , and should not be able to participate in Bose - Einstein condensation , which works only for bosons .
However , like in superconductivity ( see below ) pairs of spin - half particles can form “ quasi - bosons ” that can condense into a superfluid phase .
Superfluidity in , whose transition temperature is reduced by a factor of a thousand compared to that of liquid , was discovered by David M. Lee , Douglas D. Osheroff and Robert C. Richardson , who received the Physics Prize in 1996 .
They observed three different superfluid phases , showing complex vortex structures and interesting quantum behavior .
Electrons in condensed matter can be localized to their respective atoms as in insulators , or they can be free to move between atomic sites , as in conductors and semiconductors .
In the beginning of the 20th century , it was known that metals emitted electrons when heated to high temperatures , but it was not clear whether this was due only to thermal excitation of the electrons or if chemical interactions with the surrounding gas were also involved .
Through experiments carried out in high vacuum , Owen W. Richardson could finally establish that electron emission is a purely thermionic effect and a law based on the velocity distribution of electrons in the metal could be formulated .
For this , Richardson received the Physics Prize in 1928 ( awarded in 1929 . )
The electronic structure determines the electric , magnetic , and optical properties of solids and is also of major importance for their mechanical and thermal behavior .
It has been one of the major tasks of physicists in the 20th century to measure the states and dynamics of electrons and model their behavior so as to understand how they organize themselves in various types of solids .
It is natural that the most unexpected and extreme manifestations of electron behavior have attracted the strongest interest in the community of solid state physicists .
This is also reflected in the Nobel Prize in Physics : several prizes have been awarded for discoveries connected with superconductivity and for some of the very specific effects displayed in certain semiconducting materials .
Superconductivity was discovered as early as 1911 by Kamerlingh - Onnes , who noticed that the electrical resistivity of mercury dropped to less than one billionth of its ordinary value when it was cooled well below a transition temperature of , which is about 4 K .
As mentioned earlier , he received the Physics Prize in 1913 .
However , it would take a very long period of time before it was understood why electrons could flow without resistance in certain conductors at low temperature .
But in the beginning of the 1960s Leon N. Cooper , John Bardeen and J. Robert Schrieffer formulated a theory based on the idea that pairs of electrons ( with opposite spins and directions of motion ) can lower their energy by an amount by sharing exactly the same deformation of the crystalline lattice as they move .
Such “ Cooper pairs ” act as bosonic particles .
This allows them to move as a coherent macroscopic fluid , undisturbed as long as the thermal excitations ( of energy ) are lower in energy than the energy gained by the pair formation .
The so - called BCS - theory was rewarded with the Physics Prize in 1972 .
This breakthrough in the understanding of the quantum mechanical basis led to further progress in superconducting circuits and components : Brian D. Josephson analysed the transfer of superconducting carriers between two superconducting metals , separated by a very thin layer of normal - conducting material .
He found that the quantum phase , which determines the transport properties , is an oscillating function of the voltage applied over this kind of junction .
The Josephson effect has important applications in precision measurements , since it establishes a relation between voltage and frequency scales .
Josephson received one - half of the Physics Prize for 1973 .
Ivar Giaever , who invented and studied the detailed properties of the “ tunnel junction ” , an electronic component based on superconductivity , shared the second half with Leo Esaki for work on tunneling phenomena in semiconductors ( see below ) .
Although a considerable number of new superconducting alloys and compounds were discovered over the first 75 years that followed Kamerlingh - Onnes ’ discovery , it seemed as if superconductivity would forever remain a typical low temperature phenomenon , with the limit for transition temperatures slightly above 20 K .
It therefore came as a total surprise when J. Georg Bednorz and K. Alexander Müller showed that a lanthanum - copper oxide could be made superconducting up to 35 K by doping it with small amounts of barium .
Soon thereafter , other laboratories reported that cuprates of similar structure were superconducting up to about 100 K .
This discovery of “ high temperature superconductors ” triggered one of the greatest efforts in modern physics : to understand the basic mechanism for superconductivity in these extraordinary materials .
Bednorz and Müller shared the Physics Prize in 1987 .
Electron motion in the normal conducting state of metals has been modeled theoretically with increasing degree of sophistication ever since the advent of quantum mechanics .
One of the early major steps was the introduction of the Bloch wave concept , named after Felix Bloch ( half of the Physic Prize for magnetic resonance in 1952 ) .
Another important concept , “ the electron fluid ” in conductors , was introduced by Lev Landau ( see liquid He ) .
Philip W. Anderson made several important contributions to the theory of electronic structures in metallic systems , in particular concerning the effects of inhomogeneities in alloys and magnetic impurity atoms in metals .
Nevill F. Mott worked on the general conditions for electron conductivity in solids and formulated rules for the point at which an insulator becomes a conductor ( the Mott transition ) when composition or external parameters are changed .
Anderson and Mott shared the 1977 Physics Prize with John H. Van Vleck for their theoretical investigations of the electronic structure of magnetic and disordered systems .
An early Physics Prize ( 1920 ) was given to Charles E. Guillaume for his discovery that the thermal expansion of certain nickel steels , so - called “ invar ” alloys , was practically zero .
This prize was mainly motivated by the importance of these alloys for precision measurements in physics and geodesy , in particular when referring to the standard meter in Paris .
The invar alloys have been extensively used in all kinds of high - precision mechanical devices , watches , etc .
The theoretical background for this temperature independence has been explained only recently .
Also very recently ( 1998 ) , Walter Kohn was recognized by a Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his methods of treating quantum exchange correlations , by which important limitations for the predictive power of electronic structure calculations , in solids as well as molecules , have been overcome .
In semiconductors , electron mobility is strongly reduced because there are forbidden regions for the energy of the electrons that take part in conduction , the “ energy gaps ” .
It was only after the basic roles of doping of ultra-pure silicon ( and later other semiconducting materials ) with chosen electron - donating or electron - accepting agents were understood , that semiconductors could be used as components in electronic engineering .
William B. Shockley , John Bardeen ( see also BCS - theory ) and Walter H. Brattain carried out fundamental investigations of semiconductors and developed the first transistor .
This was the beginning of the era of “ solid state electronics ” .
They shared the Physics Prize in 1956 .
Later , Leo Esaki developed the tunnel diode , an electronic component that has a negative differential resistance , a technically interesting property .
It is composed of two heavily and doped semiconductors , that have an excess of electrons on one side of the junction and a deficit on the other .
The tunneling effect occurs at bias voltages larger than the gap in the semi-conductors .
He shared the Physics Prize for 1973 with Brian D. Josephson .
With modern techniques it is possible to build up well - defined , thin - layered structures of different semiconducting materials , in direct contact with each other .
With such “ heterostructures ” one is not limited to the band - gaps provided by semi-conducting materials like silicon and germanium .
Herbert Kroemer analysed theoretically the mobility of electrons and holes in heterostructure junctions .
His propositions led to the build up of transistors with much improved characteristics , later called HEMTs ( high electron mobility transistors ) , which are very important in today ’s high - speed electronics .
Kroemer suggested also , at about the same time as Zhores I . Alferov , the use of double heterostructures to provide conditions for laser action .
Alferov later built the first working pulsed semiconductor laser in 1970 .
This marked the beginning of the era of modern optoelectronic devices now used in laser diodes , CD - players , bar code readers and fiber optics communication .
Alferov and Kroemer recently shared one - half of the Physics Prize for the year 2000 .
The other half went to Jack S. Kilby , co-inventor of the integrated circuit ( see the next section on Physics and Technology ) .
By applying proper electrode voltages to such systems one can form “ inversion layers ” , where charge carriers move essentially only in two dimensions .
Such layers have turned out to have some quite unexpected and interesting properties .
In 1982 , Klaus von Klitzing discovered the quantized Hall effect .
When a strong magnetic field is applied perpendicularly to the plane of a quasi two - dimensional layer , the quantum conditions are such that an increase of magnetic field does not give rise to a linear increase of voltage on the edges of the sample , but a step - wise one .
Between these steps , the Hall resistance is , where i’s are integers corresponding to the quantized electron orbits in the plane .
Since this provides a possibility to measure the ratio between two fundamental constants very exactly , it has important consequences for measurement technology .
von Klitzing received the Physics Prize in 1985 .
A further surprise came shortly afterwards when Daniel C. Tsui and Horst L. Störmer made refined studies of the quantum Hall effect using inversion layers in materials of ultra - high purity .
Plateaus appeared in the Hall effect not only for magnetic fields corresponding to the filling of orbits with one , two , three , etc , electron charges , but also for fields corresponding to fractional charges !
This could be understood only in terms of a new kind of quantum fluid , where the motion of independent electrons of charge e is replaced by excitations in a multi-particle system which behave ( in a strong magnetic field ) as if charges of , , etc were involved .
Robert B. Laughlin developed the theory that describes this new state of matter and shared the 1998 Physics Prize with Tsui and Störmer .
Sometimes , discoveries made in one field of physics turn out to have important applications in quite different areas .
One example , of relevance for solid state physics , is the observation by Rudolf L. Mössbauer in the late 50s , that nuclei in “ absorber ” atoms can be resonantly excited by rays from suitably chosen “ emitter ” atoms , if the atoms in both cases are bound in such a way that recoils are eliminated .
The quantized energies of the nuclei in the internal electric and magnetic fields of the solid can be measured since they correspond to different positions of the resonances , which are extremely sharp .
This turned out to be important for the determination of electronic and magnetic structure of many substances and Mössbauer received half the Physics Prize in 1961 and R. Hofstadter the other half .
Physics and Technology
Many of the discoveries and theories mentioned so far in this survey have had an impact on the development of technical devices ; by opening completely new fields of physics or by providing ideas upon which such devices can be built .
Conspicuous examples are the works of Shockley , Bardeen , and Brattain which led to the transistors and started a revolution in electronics , and the basic research by Townes , Basov , and Prokhorov which led to the development of masers and lasers .
It could also be mentioned that particle accelerators are now important tools in several areas of materials science and in medicine .
Other works honored by Nobel Prizes have had a more direct technical motivation , or have turned out to be of particular importance for the construction of devices for the development of communication and information .
An early Physics Prize ( 1912 ) was given to Nils Gustaf Dalén for his invention of an automatic “ sun-valve ” , extensively used for lighting beacons and light buoys .
It was based on the difference in radiation of heat from reflecting and black bodies : one out of three parallel bars in his device was blackened , which gave rise to a difference in heat absorption and length expansion of the bars during sunshine hours .
This effect was used to automatically switch off the gas supply in daytime , eliminating much of the need for maintenance at sea .
Optical instrumentation and techniques have been the topics for prizes at several occasions .
Around the turn of the century , Gabriel Lippmann developed a method for colour photograhy using interference of light .
A mirror was placed in contact with the emulsion of a photographic plate in such a way that when it was illuminated , reflection in the mirror gave rise to standing waves in the emulsion .
Developing resulted in a stratification of the grains of silver and when such a plate was looked at in a mirror , the picture was reproduced in its natural colours .
The Physics Prize in 1908 was awarded to Lippmann .
Unfortunately , Lippmann ’s method requires very long exposure times .
It has later been superseded by other techniques for photography but has found new applications in high - quality holograms .
In optical microscopy it was shown by Frits Zernike that even very weakly absorbing ( virtually transparent ) objects can be made visible if they consist of regions with different refractive indices .
In Zernike ’s “ phase - contrast microscope ” it is possible to distinguish patches of light that have undergone different phase changes caused by this kind of inhomogeneity .
This microscope has been of particular importance for observing details in biological samples .
Zernike received the Physics Prize in 1953 .
In the 1940s , Dennis Gabor laid down the principles of holography .
He predicted that if an incident beam of light is allowed to interfere with radiation reflected from a two - dimensional array of points in space , it would be possible to reproduce a three - dimensional picture of an object .
However , the realization of this idea had to await the invention of lasers , which could provide the coherent light necessary for such interference phenomena to be observed .
Gabor was awarded the Physics Prize in 1971 .
Electron microscopy has had an enormous impact on many fields of natural sciences .
Soon after the wave nature of electrons was clarified by C. J. Davisson and G. P. Thomson , it was realized that the short wavelengths of high energy electrons would make possible a much increased magnification and resolution as compared to optical microscopes .
Ernst Ruska made fundamental studies in electron optics and designed the first working electron microscope early in the 1930s .
However , it would take more than 50 years before this was recognized by a Nobel Prize .
Ruska obtained half of the Physics Prize for 1986 , while the other half was shared between Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer , who had developed a completely different way to obtain pictures with extremely high resolution .
Their method is applicable to surfaces of solids and is based on the tunneling of electrons from very thin metallic tips to atoms on the surface when the tip is moved at very close distance to it ( about 1 nm ) .
By keeping the tunneling current constant a moving tip can be made to follow the topography of the surface , and pictures are obtained by scanning over the area of interest .
By this method , single atoms on surfaces can be visualized .
Radio communication is one of the great technical achievements of the 20th century .
Guglielmo Marconi experimented in the 1890s with the newly discovered Hertzian waves .
He was the first one to connect one of the terminals of the oscillator to the ground and the other one to a high vertical wire , the “ antenna ” , with a similar arrangement at the receiving station .
While Hertz ’ original experiments were made within a laboratory , Marconi could extend signal transmission to distances of several kilometers .
Further improvement was made by Carl Ferdinand Braun ( also father of the “ Braunian tube ” , an early cathode ray oscilloscope ) , who introduced resonant circuits in the Hertzian oscillators .
The tunability and the possibility to produce relatively undamped outgoing oscillations greatly increased the transmission range , and in 1901 Marconi succeeded in establishing radio connection across the Atlantic .
Marconi and Braun shared the 1909 Nobel Prize in Physics .
At this stage , it was not understood how radio waves could reach distant places ( practically “ on the other side of the earth ” ) , keeping in mind that they were known to be of the same nature as light , which propagates in straight lines in free space .
Sir Edward V. Appleton finally proved experimentally that an earlier suggestion by Heaviside and Kennelly , that radio waves were reflected between different layers with different conductance in the atmosphere , was the correct explanation .
Appleton measured the interference of the direct and reflected waves at various wavelengths and could determine the height of Heaviside ’s layer ; in addition he found another one at a higher level which still bears his name .
Appleton received the Physics Prize in 1947 .
Progress in nuclear and particle physics has always been strongly dependent on advanced technology ( and sometimes a driving force behind it ) .
This was already illustrated in connection with the works of Cockcroft and Walton and of Lawrence , who developed linear electrostatic accelerators and cyclotrons , respectively .
Detection of high energy particles is also a technological challenge , the success of which has been recognized by several Nobel Prizes .
The Physics Prize in 1958 was jointly awarded to Pavel A. Cherenkov , Il’ja M. Frank and Igor Y. Tamm for their discovery and interpretation of the Cherenkov effect .
This is the emission of light , within a cone of specific opening angle around the path of a charged particle , when its velocity exceeds the velocity of light in the medium in which it moves .
Since this cone angle can be used to determine the velocity of the particle , the work by these three physicists soon became the basis for fruitful detector developments .
The visualization of the paths of particles taking part in reactions is necessary for the correct interpretation of events occurring at high energies .
Early experiments at relatively low energies used the tracks left in photographic emulsions .
Charles T.R. Wilson developed a chamber in which particles were made visible by the fact that they leave tracks of ionized gas behind them .
In the Wilson chamber the gas is made to expand suddenly , which lowers the temperature and leads to condensation of vapour around the ionized spots ; these drops are then photographed in strong light .
Wilson received half of the Physics Prize in 1927 , the other half was awarded to Arthur H. Compton .
A further step in the same direction came much later when Donald A. Glaser invented the “ bubble chamber ” .
In the 1950s accelerators had reached energies of 20 - 30 GeV and earlier methods were inadequate ; for the Wilson chamber the path lengths in the gas would have been excessive .
The atomic nuclei in a bubble chamber ( usually containing liquid hydrogen ) are used as targets , and the tracks of produced particles can be followed .
At the temperature of operation the liquid is superheated and any discontinuity , like an ionized region , immediately leads to the formation of small bubbles .
Essential improvements were made by Luis W. Alvarez , in particular concerning recording techniques and data analysis .
His work contributed to a fast extension of the number of known elementary particles then known , in particular the so - called “ resonances ” ( which were later understood as excited states of systems composed of quarks and gluons ) .
Glaser received the Physics Prize in 1960 and Alvarez in 1968 .
Bubble chambers were , up to the end of the 80s , the work horses of all high energy physics laboratories but have later been superseded by electronic detection systems .
The latest step in detector development recognized by a Nobel Prize ( in 1992 ) is the work of Georges Charpak .
He studied in detail the ionization processes in gases and invented the “ wire chamber ” , a gas - filled detector where densely spaced wires pick up electric signals near the points of ionization , by which the paths of particles can be followed .
The wire chamber and its followers , the time projection chamber and several large wire chamber / scintillator / Cherenkov detector arrangements , combined into complex systems , has made possible the selective search for extremely rare events ( like heavy quark production ) , which are hidden in strong backgrounds of other signals .
The first Nobel Prize ( year 2000 ) in the new millennium was awarded in half to Jack S. Kilby for achievements that laid the foundations for the present information technology .
In 1958 , he fabricated the first integrated circuit where all electronic components are built on one single block of semiconducting material , later called “ chip ” .
This opened the way for miniaturization and mass production of electronic circuits .
In combination with the development of components based on heterostructures described in an earlier section ( for which Alferov and Kroemer shared the other half of the Prize ) , this has led to the “ IT - revolution ” that has reshaped so much our present society .
Further Remarks
In reading the present survey , it should be kept in mind that the number of Nobel awards is limited ( according to the present rules , at most 3 persons can share a Nobel Prize each year ) .
So far , 163 laureates have received Nobel Prizes for achievements in physics .
Often , during the selection process , committees have had to leave out several other important , “ near Nobel - worthy ” contributions .
For obvious reasons , it has not been possible to mention any of these other names and contributions in this survey .
Still , the very fact that a relatively coherent account of the development of physics can be formulated , hinging as here on the ideas and experiments made by Nobel Laureates , can be taken as a testimony that most of the essential features in this fascinating journey towards an understanding of the world we inhabit have been covered by the Nobel Prizes in Physics .

Google is finally getting into the PC operating system market ... for real .
And not just with some Android port on steroids .
Chrome OS will be something new , a platform that stands apart from , and in some cases competes with , the company 's nascent mobile device OS .
My take ?
It has an ice cube 's chance in Hell of succeeding .
[ InfoWorld 's Neil McAllister sees Chrome OS as the beginning of the true cloud era , not as a traditional desktop OS rival .
| InfoWorld 's Robert X. Cringely wonders if Chrome OS will be a geeks - only thing . ]
Seriously , creating a brand - new PC operating system is no small task .
Even if Google bases Chrome OS on some existing technology -- like the ever - adaptable Linux kernel -- it still needs to address several very real hurdles before it can deliver anything even remotely competitive to Microsoft 's ubiquitous Windows .
For example , if the Chrome browser is truly the new OS ' only front end , then what about those applications and utilities that have no AJAX - based equivalents ?
I 'm talking about the myriad legacy programs that expect to run atop a traditional OS , with a real windowing environment , file system , and process management / IPC mechanisms .
Although the world has come a long way on the road to full " Webification , " there are still many miles to go before we get to a point where IT organizations can rip and replace their Windows - based fat client environments in favor of JavaScript , XML , and HTML 5 .
Then there is the issue of peripheral plumbing .
People want their PCs and devices to work together seamlessly .
And that requires a vast ecosystem of third - party device drivers , as well as their supporting development partners .
Getting the larger software and hardware developer communities to support your platform is a tall order -- just ask Microsoft , a company that has spent the better part of three decades laying precisely such a hardware foundation so that Windows " just runs " on virtually any combination of PC hardware .
Basing Chrome OS on the Linux kernel woul help to mitigate this last hurdle a bit .
However , as the netbook remix fiasco has shown , customers have little tolerance for half - baked device support , even in a task - oriented OS running on a single function device .
Linux is still years behind Windows in the seamless hardware compatibility department , so Google has some work ahead if it hopes to slap lipstick on the FOSS pig and call it user - friendly .
Of course , Google has likely thought through these issues already .
The folks from Mountain View probably have some superduper master plan to deal with the seemingly insurmountable hurdles that lay before them .
It 's just that , right now , I can't figure out what that plan is .
Barring a heavy dose of pixie dust , you simply can't get there from here .
So I say , " Good luck , Google !
You 'll need it ! "

Christian hotel owners hauled before court after defending their beliefs in discussion with Muslim guest
A Christian couple have been charged with a criminal offence after taking part in what they regarded as a reasonable discussion about religion with guests at their hotel .
Ben and Sharon Vogelenzang were arrested after a Muslim woman complained to police that she had been offended by their comments .
They have been charged under public order laws with using ‘ threatening , abusive or insulting words ’ that were ‘ religiously aggravated ’ .
Facing trial : Christian hoteliers Ben and Sharon Vogelenzang believed the religious discussion was reasonable and deny their comments were threatening
The couple , whose trial has been set for December , face a fine of up to £ 5,000 and a criminal record if they are convicted .
Although the facts are disputed , it is thought that during the conversation the couple were challenged over their Christian beliefs .
It is understood that they suggested that Mohammed , the founder of Islam , was a warlord and that traditional Muslim dress for women was a form of bondage .
They deny , however , that their comments were threatening and argue that they had every right to defend and explain their beliefs .
Scene of ' offence ' :
The Bounty House Hotel in Liverpool , where a Muslim guest was upset
Mrs Vogelenzang , 54 , who has run the Bounty House Hotel near Aintree racecourse in Liverpool with her husband Ben , 53 , for six years , said : ‘ Nothing like this has happened to us before .
We are completely shocked . ’
She added that the episode had damaged their business and they had been forced to lay off staff and run the nine - bedroom hotel by themselves , leaving them exhausted .
Sources said that a number of guests staying at the hotel , which charges £ 92 a night for a double room , were having breakfast in its restaurant on March 20 when comments were made about religion .
One of those involved was the Muslim woman , who was staying at the hotel while she received treatment at a hospital nearby .
The couple , who are members of the Bootle Christian Fellowship , and their solicitor , David Whiting , said they could not discuss the content of the conversation for legal reasons .
But the independent lobby group , the Christian Institute , which has seen both the prosecution and defence legal papers , is supporting their defence .
Mr Whiting , who last year successfully defended street preacher Anthony Rollins in Birmingham , said : ‘ There is a dispute as to the facts of the allegations , but Ben and Sharon do not accept they were threatening , abusive or insulting .
‘ They are committed Christians and it is the defence ’s contention that they have every right to defend their religious beliefs and explain those beliefs to others who do not hold similar views . ’
After the incident , the couple voluntarily attended St Anne ’s Street police station in Liverpool , where they were interviewed under caution .
In July they were arrested and charged under Section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986 and Section 31 ( 1 ) ( c ) and ( 5 ) of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 .
They appeared briefly at Liverpool Magistrates Court on Friday to hear the date of their trial before magistrates , and were granted bail on the condition that they did not approach any of the witnesses expected to appear .
The use by the police of the Public Order Act to arrest people over offensive comments has dismayed a number of lawyers , who say the legislation was passed to deal with law and order problems in the streets .
Neil Addison , a prominent criminal barrister and expert in religious law , said : ‘ The purpose of the Public Order Act is to prevent disorder , but I ’m very concerned that the police are using it merely because someone is offended .
‘ It should be used where there is violence , yobbish behaviour or gratuitous personal abuse .
It should never be used where there has been a personal conversation or debate with views firmly expressed .
‘ If someone is in a discussion and they do n’t like what they are hearing , they can walk away . ’
He added that the police had a legal duty under the Human Rights
Act to defend free speech ‘ and I think they are forgetting that ’ .
A number of Church leaders in Liverpool have written to Keir Starmer , the Director of Public Prosecutions , voicing their concerns and pressing for the case to be dropped .
Christian Institute spokesman Mike Judge said ‘ important ’ issues of religious liberty were at stake .
‘ In recent years , we have backed several cases where Christians have suffered unfair treatment because of their faith , ’ he said .
‘ We have detected a worrying tendency for public bodies to misapply the law in a way that seems to sideline Christianity more than other faiths . ’
A spokesman for Merseyside Police said : ‘ It would be inappropriate to comment as this is an ongoing case . ’
Hold on a second ; there ’s something fishy going on .
While the space - padded explanation certainly seems good , it may be ( at least partly ) specious .
VISA said that there were “ fewer than 13,000 ” customers affected by the snafu with the Visa Buxx pre-paid cards .
I ’ve found news on several so far .
Josh Muszynski in New Hampshire , Jason Bryan in Tennessee , Ron Seale in Texas , Karen Taylor ’s teenage son in Bethel , and a teenage girl , Elizabeth Lewis in Owatonna .
The thing is that all of them have the exact same charge : $ 23,148,855,308,184,500.00 .
If the problem was the space - padding , then how is it that all of them had the exact same $ 0x1250 ( $ 46.88 ) charge ?
Two of them had purchased cigarettes at gas stations , another two had paid at restaurants , Lewis bought eggs and milk , the last one at a drug store .
Do all these varied items happen to cost the same ?
$ 46.88 for a restaurant bill seems okay , but for a pack of cigarettes ?
for milk and eggs ‽
The space - padding error makes sense , except it does not account for the 0x1250 constant .
Why is it that all of them ended up with 0x2020 2020 2020 1250 instead of 0x2020 2020 2020 2020 or different numbers in the last WORD ?
Hmmm , if only 13,000 customers were affected , it may be that somehow that exact , specific charge triggered the error .
In that case , it is more than just a field error .
If it was just the text field being interpreted as a 64 - bit integer , then why did n’t other amounts cause it , thus affecting everyone , not just < 13,000 .
Still , how is it that 13,000 people could have just happened to charge the exact same amount in the same week ?
They say it ’s a “ temporary programming error ” , and it may well be , but could it be a hacking thing ?
In that case , it probably would be a magic - number .
In fact , it may be a combination of both : some hacker putting a 0x1250 automatic charge , that got combined with the space - padding error , causing one or both errors to be detected .
The Register thinks that the answer is indeed the padded - field error , but does not expand on why they are all the same , although one of the comments mentions the number possibly being rounded to the nearest $ 100 ( unlikely since banks and banking software explicitly go to lengths to ensure precision ) .
( There is also a report of a similar , earlier error . )

For instance : a synesthete might see colors when listening to music , or taste flavors when hearing a spoken word .
Synesthesia was once thought of as a disease or disorder , but many who experience this alternate form of perception think of their anomaly as an advantage — or , for them , simply what is normal .
In this piece , Dr. David Eagleman of the Baylor College of Medicine explains this condition , and four synesthetes explain how they perceive the world .

Snow Leopard has been out just a few days and folks are already trying to benchmark its OpenCL capabilities .
While the available tools are barely a few days old , the results so far show some interesting results for Snow Leopard 's OpenCL implementation .
OpenCL , as you may know , is a framework for writing general ( as opposed to graphics - specific ) code that can run on the fast , multicore GPUs in today 's computers .
As opposed to NVIDIA 's CUDA and ATI 's Stream APIs , which are designed to enable GPGPU programming for each company 's respective GPU hardware , OpenCL is designed in a hardware - agnostic way .
Code can run on whatever computing resources are available in a given system .
That includes integrated GPUs , discrete GPUs , the main CPU , and even other specialized processors .
Apple proposed the spec last year , noting that it planned to build it into Snow Leopard .
Apple then joined with the Khronos Group to create a working group to define the spec as an open standard .
That work wrapped up last fall , and the 1.0 version was finalized last December .
Apple released Snow Leopard last Friday with the first implementation of OpenCL .
In just a couple days time , there are already two benchmarking utilities designed to test OpenCL .
Developer Andreas Michalak has put together a command line utility called OpenCL Benchmark , while Japanese developer " kloku " is porting the AO Bench floating point benchmark to OpenCL with mixed results .
Some of the early testing with OpenCL Benchmark , though , show promise of some massive speed - ups in the kinds of calculations that OpenCL is designed for .
Here is one example run of OpenCL Benchmark V205 .
The example run shown on the download page for OpenCL Benchmark shows the benchmark runs 12 times slower on a 3.2GHz Core 2 Duo compared to an NVIDIA GeForce 9600M GT .
That 's fast .
However , more typical results show that OpenCL code can run about four to five times faster than on a Core 2 Duo in general .
One result with a Nehalem - based Mac Pro shows the code can run slightly faster on those systems '
CPUs , but given a large enough set of parallel tasks , the OS can spread around the computing tasks as needed , as some cores of the CPU would likely be involved in other tasks in real - world use .
Furthermore , an interesting tidbit about Snow Leopard 's implementation is revealed by early tests .
Though Snow Leopard does n't seem to enable dual GPUs or on - the - fly GPU switching for machines using the NVIDIA GeForce 9400 M chipset — a limitation carried over from Leopard — it does appear that the OS can use both as OpenCL resources simultaneously .
So even if you have the 9600M GT enabled on your MacBook Pro , if OpenCL code is encountered in an application , Snow Leopard can send that code to be processed by the 16 GPU cores sitting pretty much dormant in the 9400M .
The converse is not true , though — when running a MacBook Pro with just the 9400 M enabled , the 9600M GT is shut down entirely to save power , and can't be used as an OpenCL resource .
Of course , OpenCL is sill in its infancy , and developers will have to update their software to take advantages of the benefits that OpenCL can offer .
But the trend in computing seems to be throwing more and more processors at the increasingly complex computing problems , so OpenCL will be a handy tool for developers to have at their disposal to better take advantage of all this processing power .

A summary of Second Quarter 2009 Negative Equity Data from First American CoreLogic shows that Nearly One - Third Of All Mortgages Are Underwater .
• More than 15.2 million U.S. mortgages , or 32.2 percent of all mortgaged properties , were in negative equity position as of June 30 , 2009 according to newly released data from First American CoreLogic .
As of June 2009 , there were an additional 2.5 million mortgaged properties that were approaching negative equity .
Negative equity and near negative equity mortgages combined account for nearly 38 percent of all residential properties with a mortgage nationwide .
• The aggregate property value for loans in a negative equity position was $ 3.4 trillion , which represents the total property value at risk of default .
In California , the aggregate value of homes that are in negative equity was $ 969 billion , followed by Florida ( $ 432 billion ) , New Jersey ( $ 146 billion ) , Illinois ( $ 146 billion ) and Arizona ( $ 140 billion ) .
Los Angeles had over $ 310 billion in aggregate property value in a negative equity position , followed by New York ( $ 183 billion ) , Miami ( $ 152 billion ) , Washington , DC ( $ 149 billion ) and Chicago ( $ 134 billion ) .
• The distribution of negative equity is heavily skewed to a small number of states as three states account for roughly half of all mortgage borrowers in a negative equity position .
Nevada ( 66 percent ) had the highest percentage with nearly two‐thirds of mortgage borrowers in a negative equity position .
In Arizona ( 51 percent ) and Florida ( 49 percent ) , half of all mortgage borrowers were in a negative equity position .
Michigan ( 48 percent ) and California ( 42 percent ) round out the top five states .

Foreclosure Wave Is About To Hit
California Foreclosures
Nationwide Foreclosures
California Pent Up Foreclosure Demand
Foreclosure supply ( yellow ) has been artificially held back , which has allowed the low end of the real estate market to perform very well over the past several months .
But the reservoir of foreclosures ( blue + pink ) is getting full and at some point the dam will crack and break .
Six Reasons the Dam Will Break Sooner Rather Than Later
The number of people underwater in their mortgages is high and rising fast .
The reported nationwide unemployment figure is 9.4 % with the real unemployment above 16 % and rising .
Wages are falling .
The jobs market will suffer losses for another year .
Notices of Default and Trustee Sales are high and rising .
Social attitudes towards walking away and bankruptcy have changed .
I dread UN week .
I can barely face it anymore .
Endless hours of self - important , flatulent , self - congratulatory orations , all delivered in front of that ugly , green marble backdrop .
Hell for a TV reporter :
Ugly visuals , boring audio .
And so it was again this week , mostly .
But when Libyan Leader Moammar Gadhafi — self - styled " dean of the Arab rulers , king of kings of Africa and the imam of Muslims " — made his way to the the podium , I sat up straight .
I just can't help admiring the guy 's performances .
I know he 's been a vicious , dangerous SOB , whose agents have tortured , terrorized and slaughtered civilians .
Liyban Leader Moammar Gadhafi at the UN in September 2009 .
( Richard Drew / Associated Press ) ( ( Richard Drew / Associated Press ) )
But then , as Gadhafi would say — as he did again this week — so have the Americans .
Go ahead and argue with that .
Elvis is in the house
In all of his 40 years as Libya 's president , Gadhafi has never addressed the UN .
Most of the time , he 's a recluse , living in a tent somewhere , dreaming up projects such as a Libyan - designed rocket car and a staggeringly expensive effort to roll back the Sahara desert .
So , clearly , he was pent up by the time he started talking this week .
He went 90 minutes with a speech that was instantly declared a " diatribe " and " delusional rambling " by the herds of independent thinkers on U.S. cable networks .
Granted , some of it was pretty weird .
Ruminations about JFK 's assassin , about the swine flu as a military weapon and how the Taliban are a peaceful bunch .
And so on .
But there was much that was serious , aimed at the Third World , which Gadhafi regards as his constituency .
Those portions should inspire at least some serious debate , and likely would have , had they not been delivered by a guy who drags his tent around the world and sometimes shows up at meetings in gold Elvis - style sunglasses , smoking cigars .
Political feudalism
First , he went after the Security Council , or , as Gadhafi called it , the " political feudalism " of the UN .
He takes particular issue with the five permanent members , each of which has the power to veto the collective wishes of the rest of the world .
His point is not really arguable :
These are five countries — the U.S. , Britain , France , China and Russia — that effectively enjoy immunity from UN sanction or condemnation , simply because they can veto any such move .
They can accuse others of war crimes without ever having to worry about facing a similar charge themselves .
In his address , Gadhafi made the unrealistic , but to many people extremely appealing , suggestion that the Security Council should be a tool of the general membership , rather than the other way around .
Looking out at the General Assembly , Gadhafi mocked the sea of serious faces looking back at him .
" We are just décor , " he said .
" You are like Hyde Park .
I mean , without any real substance , like the speakers of the Hyde Park corner .
No more , no less .
You make a speech and disappear . "
Nervous laughter .
On a roll
He then turned his attention to the International Criminal Court , which is empowered by the UN to pursue and try national leaders for crimes against humanity ( at least those national leaders who do n't have Security Council vetoes or friends with vetoes ) .
" Yes , " said Gadhafi , " Make it easy for ( Sudanese President Omar ) Bashir to be tried or ( former Liberian president ) Charles Taylor to be tried .
Or ( former Panamanian leader Manuel ) Noriega .
That is an easy job to be done . "
( For the record , Noriega was grabbed by American forces in 1989 , brought to the U.S. and imprisoned .
Nothing to do with the ICC , and Noriega was never in the same fiendish bracket as Taylor or Bashir .
But Gadhafi was on a roll . )
" We want to take this file and we want to [ charge ] those who have committed the general mass murder against the Iraqi people . "
By this he meant the people in Washington who ordered an invasion and bombing campaign six years ago , one that killed untold thousands of innocents , based on what turned out to be a false pretence , the fictitious weapons of mass destruction .
You could hear crickets this time .
Not even any nervous laughter .
A nose for hypocrisy
Now , granted , this was all coming from the man whose agents were found responsible for bombing a disco in Berlin and an airliner over Lockerbie , Scotland .
I 'm not saying Gadhafi is n't a hypocrite .
What I 'm saying is that he is , in fact , such a hypocrite that he 's developed an exquisite talent for identifying and exposing it elsewhere .
On nuclear non-proliferation , which he now applauds : " Do you [ the UN inspectors ] inspect the nuclear supplies of all ?
Do you supervise the increase of this nuclear storage ? "
On the unwelcome flood of illegal African emigration to Europe : " Let [ Africans ] have the wealth that was looted and taken from us . "
Africa deserves trillions of dollars in compensation , he argued .
" If you do n't give us this amount , the Africans will go to where you have taken these trillions .
They have the right . "
And to those American conservatives who constantly rag and complain about the cost and trouble and ineffectiveness of the UN , Gadhafi proposed a solution :
Move it somewhere else .
It must be a terrorist target anyway , he declared , citing the extreme security of a UN week and the difficulties some foreign leaders have in obtaining the necessary U.S. visas for their support staff to travel with them to New York .
( He himself had a retinue of more than 130 . )
" I want to relieve America from the hardship .
We want to relieve America from this worry .
Now , after 50 years , it should be taken to another part of the hemisphere . "
Maybe Delhi , he suggested .
Or Beijing .
Not many Arab friends either
Gadhafi might look eccentric , but this he knows :
The one thing that would anger American conservatives even more than their usual complaints would be for the UN to pick another country as its headquarters .
But Americans should n't take his needling personally .
He drives other Arab leaders crazy , too , and that 's how I came to appreciate him , after covering Arab League meetings from which Gadhafi regularly stormed out , usually after voicing a few choice truths .
" We hate each other , we wish ill of each other and our intelligence services conspire against each other , " he told his Arab brothers last year .
" We are our own enemy . "
In 2005 , he called the Palestinians " stupid , " for failing to embrace the one - state - for - two - peoples solution that he promotes .
Other serious people have made the same suggestion , but Gadhafi wants to call it " Israstine , " which he has to know wo n't fly with anyone .
( He floated the notion again this week . )
He acknowledges the Holocaust , something almost every other Arab leader avoids or negates .
But he always observes that it was carried out by Christians , while at least some Muslim states offered Jews sanctuary .
He used that line this week , too .
This is an Arab leader whose speeches are often cut off by Arab networks , which know the sort of embarrassment he 's capable of inflicting .
As when he calls other Arab leaders " tools " for striking self - interested deals with the West .
I remember him at one Arab League meeting , I think in Jordan , several years ago .
He denounced the proceedings as ridiculous , as usual , and went out into the country to sit with the Bedouins .
It made him a bit of a hero on Jordanian streets , at least for the day .
Too bad he cancelled the Newfoundland trip .
I 'd have liked to see him try that sort of stunt there .

Do n't forget to look at the how to guide .
I got an arduino microcontroller a little while ago , and have played with it a little but found it ’s C/C++ development environment annoying .
I wanted to control it from lisp , and that meant serial IO .
Many other languages have special serial libraries you can use , where you instatiate a Serial object with configuration like baud , parity , etc. John Wiseman wrote arduino_serial .py that shows this pattern .
I searched around for lisp options , and came up with a few options :
open / dev/ttyUSB0 directly ( from a comp.lang.lisp thread ) use a FFI wrapper around libusb ( from a comp.lang.lisp thread ) use sb - ext : run - program to call out to python / C / whatever to deal with the serial port ( we do something similar at work to render trac wiki markup to HTML in lisp ) write a small C program and FFI to that ( was tempting for the experience )
After much trial and error and some advice from the helpful folks on #lisp , I got method # 1 working tonight .
I was able to read from arduino pretty easily , but I needed to issue this magic stty command before I could write :
stty -F /dev/ttyUSB0 9600 raw - parenb - parodd cs8 - hupcl - cstopb clocal
I had been curious how lisp ( or my underlying linux ) would know what baud , parity , etc to use , and it makes perfect sense that I need to set these first .
After that , the lisp side ends up pretty simple .
It took a little tweaking to find the right : direction , : if-exists , and : external - format arguments .
( with - open - file ( stream " / dev/ttyUSB0 " : direction : io :if- exists : overwrite : external - format : ascii ) ( format stream " hello " ) ( read - line stream ) )

I have a few servos laying around , maybe this weekend I ’ll have time to get lisp moving around the real world .
My dream goal is to have lisp controlling motors that are spinning mirrors to reflect a laser in very particular patterns .
I ’d use this on halloween decorations for starters , combining with fog machine / dry ice to create nifty patterns and make people wonder how the hell I did it .
Maybe , if I have the willpower to see that through , then I ’ll also hook up a USB camera ( using cl - v4l2 ) and get lisp to track and hightlight objects , augmented - reality style .
That ’d be great for table - top games , being able to overlay terrain or effects on a grid mat .
The word carries a sense of enforced separation — walls , as in pay walls .
Keep out those who do n’t belong — meaning those who do n’t , wo n’t , or ca n’t pay .
Managers of content - provision corporations — there ’s no point any more in calling them “ newspaper companies ” — are desperate for revenue after enduring print ad losses .
So , after 15 years of giving away the milk for free online , they ’ve finally mustered up the cojones to at least talk about charging for content on their websites .
They speak of this in a language the reporters they ’ve fired would never use — the content provision managers talk of monetizing their sites , of incorporating paid - content strategies , of generating additional digital revenue .
And if you believe pay - content impresario Steven Brill of Journalism Online , about 1,000 publishers — er , content - provision specialists — expect to make $ 900 million at $ 8.33 a month from the 10 percent of online website visitors Mr. Brill thinks would be willing to cough of up the cash .
But an American Press Institute study says only 51 percent of publishers ( who voluntarily completed a survey ) think they can charge successfully for online content .
But what does “ successfully ” mean ?
And who gets to define it ?
Easy : Cui bono ?
Those at the top of many content - provision corporations believe they would benefit .
Mr. Brill says he has 1,000 publications signed to non-binding agreements .
Others are n’t so optimistic .
Consultants for the American Press Institute , in an early study with admitted weaknesses , suggest only readers would only pay $ 4.64 — nearly halving Mr. Brill ’s nearly $ 1 billion estimate .
Content - provision corporations are eager , nay , slaked with thirst for advertising revenue to replace the dollars that have fled print newspapers .
Although a few large content - provision corporations have managed to hold share prices lately despite tumbling profits , managers need that pay - wall revenue to reinvigorate investors who lost a bundle on newspaper stocks over that past five years .
( And let ’s not forget some argue consortium - set , pay - wall prices are tantamount to collusion in pricing . )
Because sound data to predict pay - wall success , erecting that wall risks revenue flight as much as revenue restored .
Respected analyst Alan Mutter ( “ Reflections of Newsosaur “ ) has written extensively in the past few months about pay walls .
Mr. Mutter says :
But what , publishers rightfully wonder , will become of the other 90 % of website visitors – and the $ 3.1 billion in advertising revenues the U.S. newspaper industry generated on the web in 2008 ?. …
Here ’s why publishers are sweating : While Brill argues that newspapers can preserve some 90 % of their page views and online advertising after erecting a pay wall , publishers consistently have told me that they fear they could lose 75 % or more of their traffic and banner revenue if they started to charge for content .
Readers — at least those who pay the toll to cross the pay - wall moat — get to define success .
( Here ’s a look at what some smaller , rural newspapers in non-competitive situations have done in terms of content behind the pay wall . )
Remember that “ Members Only ” clothing line of the ’ 80s ?
That ’s what a pay wall promises : Uniqueness .
Frankly , that ’s always been a good local newspaper ’s strength — unique content .
Local news about local people and local issues .
Erect a pay wall .
Promise quality , unique , premium content .
That ’s the formula the content - provision corporations promise .
Will they deliver in terms of what the readers accept as a fair exchange for fee paid ?
It ’d be easy to snark here .
For example , in May more than half of the 45 million visits to the online Palm Beach Post linked to the police mug shots the Post runs online .
( It ’s not the only online paper that does this , too .
And a host of ethical issues are involved . )
Is this the quality , unique , premium content that lies behind the pay wall ?
No , not really .
Most of that unique content will be locally generated news , features and “ service ” information — school lunches , entertainment listings .
But will that local behind - the - wall content have quality in quantity ?
If the pay walls had been erected 15 years ago — even five years ago — then the answer would be more yes than no .
In this still - dawning century , thousands of the skilled , experienced professional practitioners who produced the quality , unique , premium content no longer work for the content - provision corporations .
That ’s because the corporations fired the producers .
To maintain profit levels to satisfy the investors to whom content - provision management sold its collective soul , it cut expenses — firing the professionals it desparately needs now to make good on the pay - wall promise .
A successful business model ?
Or crap shoot ?
Even if content - provision companies have that $ 900 million fall into their laps as Mr. Brill suggests , which is more likely to happen ?
Stock buybacks and dividend increases ?
Or investment of at least tens of millions of dollars into hiring professional newsmen and newswomen to make good on the promise of quality , unique , premium content ?
Yeah , right .
It wo n’t be the latter .

WHAT do you get when you combine the worst economic downturn since the Depression with the first black president ?
A surge of white racial resentment , loosely disguised as a populist revolt .
An article on the Fox News Web site has put forth the theory that health reform is a stealth version of reparations for slavery : whites will foot the bill and , by some undisclosed mechanism , blacks will get all the care .
President Obama , in such fantasies , is a dictator and , in one image circulated among the anti-tax , anti-health reform “ tea parties , ” he is depicted as a befeathered African witch doctor with little tusks coming out of his nostrils .
When you ’re going down , as the white middle class has been doing for several years now , it ’s all too easy to imagine that it ’s because someone else is climbing up over your back .
Despite the sense of white grievance , though , blacks are the ones who are taking the brunt of the recession , with disproportionately high levels of foreclosures and unemployment .
And they were n’t doing so well to begin with .
At the start of the recession , 33 percent of the black middle class was already in danger of falling to a lower economic level , according to a study by the Institute on Assets and Social Policy at Brandeis University and Demos , a nonpartisan public policy research organization .
In fact , you could say that for African - Americans the recession is over .
It occurred from 2000 to 2007 , as black employment decreased by 2.4 percent and incomes declined by 2.9 percent .
During those seven years , one - third of black children lived in poverty , and black unemployment  even among college graduates  consistently ran at about twice the level of white unemployment .
That was the black recession .
What ’s happening now is more like a depression .
Nauvata and James , a middle - aged African American couple living in Prince Georges County , Md. , who asked that their last name not be published , had never recovered from the first recession of the ’00s when the second one came along .
In 2003 Nauvata was laid off from a $ 25 - an - hour administrative job at Aetna , and in 2007 she wound up in $ 10.50 - an - hour job at a car rental company .
James has had a steady union job as a building equipment operator , but the two could n’t earn enough to save themselves from predatory lending schemes .

Flashback : Democrats Boo Bush At 2005 State Of The Union
President George W. Bush is booed and heckled by Democrats at his 2005 State of the Union address .
The world ’s largest beverage company has won approval from officials in Colorado to extract and bottle spring water from the mountains of south central Colorado .
Nestle Waters North America may draw 65 million gallons of water a year from a spring in Chaffee County to sell under its Arrowhead brand , county commissioners decided Wednesday .
The proposal elicited fierce opposition from many residents , who feared the company would deplete the local aquifer and that its trucks hauling the water to Denver would snarl traffic on mountain roads .
Others supported the project , saying it could spur economic development in the rural area .
In a concession , Nestle agreed to draw water from one , not two , springs and to place conservation easements on its land and allow access on its property to anglers , county development director Don Reimer said .
Commissioners also required that the company restrict its truck traffic during the busy summer months .
The conflict is the latest skirmish in an ongoing battle against the bottled water industry , which has enjoyed strong growth over the last decade because of popularity among consumers who eschew tap water and soft drinks .
As companies such as Nestle , which operates 50 spring sites across the country , seek to acquire new water sources , communities have increasingly resisted .

David Barash and Judith Lipton ( Image : Yoav Altman )
New Scientist caught up with husband - and - wife writing team David Barash and Judith Eve Lipton to discuss their latest book , Strange Bedfellows :
The surprising connection between sex , evolution and monogamy .
We ask them what we can learn about monogamy from other species , and how writing a book about monogamy affected their own marriage .
Your last book , The Myth of Monogamy ( W. H. Freeman , 2001 ) talked about the rarity of monogamy in nature .
What made you decide to write another book on the subject ?
David : Intellectual honesty or a scientific balancing of the scales if you will .
Myth of Monogamy was looking at the glass half empty , at the problems that biology poses for monogamy , but we were aware that monogamy , for all its difficulties , does happen .
It happens in animals , it happens in humans .
We did n’t want to give the impression that it ’s impossible .

Judith :
There were both scientific and personal reasons .
We thought it was important to point out that the promiscuous behaviour we were describing in ducks , for example , does n’t necessarily hold for people .
David and I have been married and monogamous since 1977 .
There are different kinds of monogamy – for instance , there ’s a tapeworm that has only one partner until it dies .
That ’s extremely unusual , but there are other forms of monogamy that are more common , like us !
We were each married before and have had other sexual partners , but have been monogamous in our own marriage .
Strange Bedfellows is dedicated to David ’s parents who were married for 64 years .
They were joined at the hip ; they had only spent a total of 3 nights apart until his father developed colon cancer and was in the hospital .
David :
It is not an advice book as such , but the issue of advice looms not too far in the background .
There are people who want to be monogamous but worry that it may be impossible .
To some extent the book is written for those people .
So is monogamy “ unnatural ” ?
Judith : Monogamy is rather like playing the violin .
Doing it well is difficult and takes a lot of work , but it ’s not impossible .
And some people would argue it has real social value .
David :
We ca n’t ever totally transcend our biology .
If playing the violin was totally beyond our biological capabilities , it just could n’t happen .
The same goes for monogamy .
In order to be monogamous one has to be willing to swim upstream against certain biological impulses , but there is also a biological push in favour of monogamy , especially when it comes to parenting .
Judith : Also when it comes to ageing .
People are living longer than ever now , and as you grow past the age of courtship and mating , into the age of disability , picking up prescriptions and dealing with Medicare , sexual diversity is less important and having a good buddy is more important .
The way we look at mating changes when we think about people who are becoming more infirm and less motivated by fresh partners .
The miracle of monogamy is the potential for long - term cooperative friendships that transcend mating desires .
David :
We have horses here – you can hear them neighing in the background .
This morning Judy fed them and tonight I will , and our collaboration is what it allows us to keep horses .
That ’s true in the animal world as well .
In many cases of natural monogamy , part of the payoff has to do , not just with old age or parenting , but with maintaining stuff .
Judith :
That ’s why beavers are interesting .
They are mostly monogamous because they share a lot of work , between making their dams and doing collaborative housekeeping .
David :
There are other beavers who would love to take advantage of the work they put in .
So , by having cooperative long - lasting relationships between adults , they can do value - added estate planning to maintain and defend their stuff against others .
Is that kind of monogamous setup more or less effective than the strategies of species like ants or bees , who work as a whole colony to protect their resources ?
David :
It works differently for different species .
In ant colonies , the queen is the only one who reproduces and an individual worker is not disadvantaged when someone else does the reproducing .
For humans and other mammals , it ’s not in our interest to let someone else do the reproducing .
So one way to do it is to be monogamous .
And if you ’re monogamous , you ’re paying a price by sacrificing other reproductive opportunities .
Judith :
In the 1960s scientists began to ask , why do bees cooperate ?
And it came down to a matter of sharing genes at a level that ’s very different than mammals and other insects .
The study of the social insect triggered the gene ’s - eye view of evolution .
You ca n’t really say the bees are not monogamous , because only the queen flies up and mates , and all her sisters do n’t mate because it ’s not in their advantage genetically .
David :
In the book we have lots of examples of other monogamous animals , like the beavers and the Malagasy jumping rat , who have good reasons for being monogamous that are not altruistic .
It ’s just that , given their biology , they do best by being part of a committed pair .
We ’re trying to make a case that , although there is much in biology that works against monogamy , there ’s also much that works in favour of it .
We as humans are not doomed or destined to one extreme or the other ; there ’s a lot of room for human choice .
Judith : Sexual choices really are sexual choices .
There is no biological determinism .
Monogamy is hard : it ’s easier to be sloppy in relationships , to not read the fine print or to follow your heart and fall in bed with people that turn out to be less high - quality than you thought the night before .
But they are choices , and that ’s where intellect and understanding come in .
Sex education should really include a discussion about adultery , monogamy and mating strategies .
David :
As an evolutionary biologist , I know there ’s an increasing acceptance in the public of the role of evolution in human behaviour .
There are some holdouts , particularly in the social sciences , but it ’s more accepted in the public .
And it ’s about time .
But at the same time there ’s a tendency for people to grab a small part of the answer and take it as a whole answer .
We want to counter the tendency to think that biology is destiny with regard to monogamy – instead of “ the devil made me do it ” , now it ’s “ evolution made me do it ” .
Evolution does incline us to look at other attractive potential sexual partners – that means you ’re a healthy mammal .
But we are arguing against the notion that one is totally at the mercy of biology .
People tend to think of females as more inclined to monogamy than males .
Is that true ?
David :
In most species females are not as strictly monogamous as biologists used to think .
Judith :
It ’s not that females are inclined to monogamy , but that they are inclined to be more choosy ; to go for quality rather than quantity .
If you take a male to a red light district in Bangkok or Amsterdam and give a day pass , saying “ have as much sex as you want ” they would think “ great ! ”
Females would n’t – they do n’t go to red light districts , they do n’t pay for sex , there ’s nothing equivalent in the prostitution industry .
There ’s not one society where females pay for sex on a regular basis .
David :
And there ’s not a society on earth where males do n’t !
Judith : Females go to bed with males because they want resources .
Men bring them flowers , provide big incomes , provide big territories .
Women look for handsome , genetically healthy males who provide good resources .
Men look for young fertile women with a waist - to - hip ratio of .72 .
Males are lookers ; females are calculators .
What species are the most monogamous ?
David :
There ’s an invertebrate called Diplozoon paradoxum , which is a worm that lives in the gills of fish .
The male and female worms meet in adolescence and their bodies literally fuse together .
They remain monogamous their whole lives – but they do n’t have a choice !
The California mouse is pretty monogamous , as are the Malagasy jumping rat and the fat - tailed lemur .
And beavers .
Judith : Newlyweds should n’t be given images of swans because swans are n’t monogamous .
They should get images of Malagasy rats or fat - tailed lemurs !
What about penguins ?
After March of the Penguins , the Christian right was holding penguins up as the supreme model for monogamous relationships .
David : Emperor penguins remain monogamous during a given mating season but then they move on .
Judith :
They are serial monogamists , not lifetime monogamists .
David : I do n’t think the religious right would be enthusiastic about people dissolving their relationships after every offspring .
Judith : I think the Emperor penguins deserve to mix and match after all that swimming – they work so hard !
Did researching and writing a book about monogamy together teach you anything about your own marriage ?
Did it affect your relationship ?
Judith : I think it was a good thing for our relationship , and it might be my favourite book that we ’ve written together .
We were working on the book while I was 3,000 miles away in Costa Rica .
We ’re not used to being apart , so it was interesting to be writing about monogamy when we were actually experiencing being apart for the first time in so many years .
For me the experience was interesting because it showed some of the downsides of monogamy , in that there ’s a co-dependency – you get used to your partner so much .
For me , being away heightened both the benefits and the difficulties of monogamy because it was lonely .
David :
The main reason Judy was in Costa Rica was she really hates the cold weather we get up here in Seattle , and I ’m not that crazy about the weather they ’ve got in the tropics – plus I have to be here to teach .
So we have inclinations to be different .
How do you manage those differences in a monogamous relationship ?
One way of doing it is by letting each other have some flexibility .
Judith : I ’ve met a lot of people who are exploring being sexually monogamous but living apart for extended periods of time , so that the relationship does n’t get in the way of other kinds of non-sexual adventures .
Now that we have Skype and webcams and things , maybe monogamous relationships will become much more flexible , allowing the partners to be individuals and not suffocating one another .
For instance , David climbed Mount Kilimanjaro .
That ’s the last thing I ’d want to do !
We allow each other exploratory room but it does n’t violate the constraints .
Maybe flexible monogamy is the key to helping people maintain monogamous relationships .
Humans have a flexibility in our social systems that no other animals have .
I think there are ways for people to have happier , more honest , more stable relationships , by understanding biology and then developing strategies for growth and support .
JOHNSTOWN , Pennsylvania ( CNN ) --
Located outside a small Pennsylvania city , John Murtha airport may not see many passengers .
But it 's seen plenty of arrivals of tax dollars from Washington , most recently economic stimulus funds .
Democratic Rep. John Murtha says it's his job to direct federal funds to his district in Pennsylvania .
The airport offers three commercial flights .
In between the arrivals and departures , airport officials admit there are few faces around the facility .
" When the flights are coming in , there are people .
Other than that , it 's empty , " said Scott Voelker , manager of the John Murtha Johnstown - Cambria County Airport .
But one face is everywhere .
Rep. John Murtha , the airport 's namesake , is hard to miss .
Considered one of " the kings of pork " on Capitol Hill by taxpayer watchdog groups , the 19th - term Pennsylvania Democrat has piloted almost $ 200 million from Washington to Murtha airport .
Much of the funding has come in the form of legislative earmarks that are attached to bills before Congress .
Taxpayer watchdogs have said earmarks -- often derided as " pork - barrel " spending -- are designed to fund congressional pet projects .
" [ Murtha 's ] dumped in nearly $ 200 million into this project that has virtually no passengers .
It 's practically a museum piece , " said Steve Ellis with the Taxpayers for Common Sense .
Watch why critics say the airport is wasteful »

Murtha declined CNN 's request for an interview .
His staff issued a statement saying Murtha airport is vital infrastructure designed to " attract additional business " to the Johnstown area .
On his House Web site , Murtha strongly defends earmarks , saying it's his " job " to direct federal funds to his district .
amFIX : Your thoughts on how congress spends your money
Earlier this year , the airport found a new revenue stream , receiving $ 800,000 from the stimulus to repave a crosswind runway that 's used as a backup to the facility 's main landing runway .
Even though Voelker said the runway is perfectly safe , he said he believes the stimulus project " makes a lot of sense . "
He noted the runway has n't been repaved since the 1980s .
" Asphalt and concrete need to be replaced , " Voelker added .
In December , Murtha made a direct appeal to the Federal Aviation Administration to fund the runway project .
The request was rejected .
At the time , the airport did not meet FAA criteria for funding because the facility had fewer than 10,000 passengers .
But earlier this year , the FAA notified Murtha airport officials the facility had been approved for stimulus funding .
The FAA said Murtha did not request the stimulus money .
FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown said Murtha airport received stimulus money because it was " shovel - ready . "
It " met all of the requirements for the use of the stimulus money , " Brown said .
Murtha airport is not the only remote airport landing stimulus funds .
According to the FAA 's
Web site , hundreds of big and small airports across the country are slated to receive $ 1 billion in stimulus upgrades .
Many of the airports are in such far - flung places as U.S. territories Guam and American Samoa .
Even King Salmon , Alaska , ( population 447 ) is expecting $ 9.7 million , according to FAA records .
See the records
Taxpayer watchdogs said they wonder if some of that 's pork .
" The problem is you 're not getting the multiple bang for your stimulus buck that you 're looking for , " Ellis said .
He added , " when you see deadbeat airports getting cash so they can do their second runway , it really feeds cynicism around the country about the stimulus and about the projects . "
Brown defends the use of stimulus money for other remote airports such as Guam .
" Guam is a U.S. territory and is part of the U.S. economy as far as I know , " she said .
Murtha airport 's manager said taxpayer money is going to waste at his facility , but not on the runway project .
He points to an unstaffed $ 8 million air traffic radar system installed in 2004 .
" It 's been sitting over there , and that radar has been spinning for all those years with no purpose .
Just sitting there , " Voelker said .
Voelker said he has brought the matter up with both the FAA and Pennsylvania Air National Guard , which uses the air traffic control facility .
But he said nobody can explain why the radar system has n't been staffed .
All About John Murtha • Economic Stimulus
A greater ability to monitor performance and engage cognitive - control mechanisms when needed thus appears associated with improved real - world performance .
... religious conviction is marked by reduced reactivity in the anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) , a cortical system that is involved in the experience of anxiety and is important for self - regulation .
...
These results suggest that religious conviction provides a framework for understanding and acting within one 's environment , thereby acting as a buffer against anxiety and minimizing the experience of error .
where
The ERN is evident as a large negative polarity peak in the event - related brain potential waveform that occurs when people make errors in reaction time tasks .
It begins at the moment of the error and reaches a maximum about 100 milliseconds later ( see Gehring et al. , 1993 , PDF ) .
It is largest at fronto - central scalp locations and appears to come from an area of the brain called the anterior cingulate cortex ...

The relation between academic success and the ERN .
( A ) Event - related potentials at Fz on error trials for individuals with high and low Grade Point Averages , as derived from a tertiary split of the sample .
( B ) Spatial distribution of the ERN , quantified as the peak minimum voltage deflection occurring between 50 and 150 ms after an error .
( C ) Headmap of correlations between GPA and ERN magnitude .
( D ) Source localization indicates an anterior cingulate generator for the ERN .
As predicted by models of self - regulation and cognitive control , academic performance was correlated with ERN magnitude , with better grades being associated with stronger ( more negative ) ERN responses , r= -.40 .
Academic performance is a gateway to many important life outcomes , influencing the career options that are available to a student .
At the broader societal level , achievement in academic domains plays a vital role in sustaining cultural and scientific innovation .
The current study suggests that individuals who are better able to monitor their performance and engage cognitive control mechanisms when needed enjoy greater success in undergraduate programs .
How is it that religion can bring about both peace of mind and zealous conviction ?
We suggest that religious conviction buffers against anxiety by providing relief from the experience of uncertainty and error , and in so doing , strengthening convictions and narrowing attention away from inconsistencies .
We hypothesize that this muted response to uncertainty and error is evident neurophysiologically such that religious conviction is associated with reduced activity in the anterior cingulate cortex , 1 a cortical system involved in a form of attention that serves to regulate both cognitive and emotional processing .
Footnote
References
From the authors who brought you " Religion is the Xanax of the people " ( aka Neural Markers of Religious Conviction ) comes the finding that college students with lower grades are similar to religious zealots on a specific neural response to making an error .
Meanwhile , students with high GPAs resemble atheists on the same neural marker .
However , the new paper by Hirsh and Inzlicht ( 2009 ) did not draw a parallel to their previous study ( Inzlicht et al. , 2009 ) .
In fact , the two findings were interpreted in very different terms .
In the new article : Meanwhile , in the prior paper : So the religious people were not utter failures at engaging cognitive control mechanisms , instead they were less anxious .
And the smart students were not neurotic , they were better able to monitor their task performance .
Hmm .
Before going any further , let 's look at the experimental design and the neural measures .
Both experiments used EEG recordings , specifically event - related potentials .
The ERP brain waves reflect electrophysiological activity recorded remotely from the scalp .
While it 's great for determining the temporal parameters of neural activity , it 's not so great at determining the activity is located in the brain .
The brain wave of interest is the error - related negativity ( ERN ) , recorded at the time that people make mistakes in a task :
The task used in both studies was the ever - popular Stroop task , in which color words are presented in font colors that either match or conflict with the printed word .
Subjects are told to name the color and ignore the word .
The Stroop interference effect ( slower forthan for ) arises because reading is a more automatic process than color naming .
Thus , subjects are prone to make errors on this task , and that 's what the authors were interested in studying .
The participants were 31 undergraduates who consented to having their transcripts released .
Their EEG was measured while they performed the Stroop task , and the ERN was calculated from the response - locked averages on all error trials .
The results are illustrated below .
Simply put , students with high GPA had a larger ERN response than those with low GPA .
What might this mean ?
There is some disagreement about what the ERN wave represents : a direct response to the mismatch between the intended action and the actual one , a more generic response to conflict in general , or an emotional response to f*** ing up .
The authors opted to impose two different interpretations , so it 's not surprising that the ERN can mean different things to different researchers .
Or to the same researchers in different contexts .
In the present context , Cognitive control " ( a sometimes murky concept ) was evaluated by looking at post - error slowing , i.e. how much a person slows down on the trial immediately after making a mistake .
If a subject has slowed down a lot , that means he 's reined in the overly fast reaction time that led to the error in the first place ( by responding more cautiously on the next trial ) .
In the present study , a greater degree of post - error slowing was associated with larger ERN amplitudes and higher grades -- and viewed as an exemplar of greater cognitive control .
This was taken to have sweeping implications for the rest of their lives :
How does this relate to smaller ERNs in highly religious persons ?
Do religious zealots have poor cognitive control ?
Or does it mean that lower grades are the Xanax of the people ( Inzlicht et al. , 2009 ) ?
Read more in Atheists Are Neurotic and Religious Zealots Are Antisocial However , one cannot say for certain that the anterior cingulate is the sole origin of the ERN , because EEG is recorded from the scalp and not inside the brain .

A Teaching Moment For Lily Allen [ Update : And * Poof * Goes Her Blog ]
from the missing - the - point dept
i made those mixtapes 5 years ago , i did n't have a knowledge of the workings of the music industry back then ...
As your article clearly states , lilyallenmusic.co.uk is an EMI run website , which is exactly why i do n't acknowledge it ( i think theres a link to it on my myspace ( which i do run ) , thats purely because , my record contract states i cant sell my merchandise online anywhere else on the net .
i do n't post on there , i dont even look at it .
the record company run it .
Anyway the snippets of songs you hear on those mixtapes are about 30 seconds to 1 minute in length , in traditional mixtape style , it is infringement , correct , but it 's not my site , it 's EMI 's .
i am not a hypocrite , i do n't illegally download music , and i still think unauthorised file sharing is wrong .

In my last post about Lily Allen 's hypocrisy in uploading tons of songs without authorization , while saying it 's good to cut off internet access for regular uploaders , one of the commenters made a good point : we should use this as a teaching moment , to try to show Ms. Allen why her position is wrong , rather than focusing on calling her a hypocrite .
And , indeed , that would be great , but it seems like a difficult lesson for some -- including Ms. Allen -- to grasp .
Her response to my post seems to come up with a variety of excuses , none of which actually touch on the actual point :
The point is that , thanks to today 's technology , it 's quite easy for people to infringe while doing what they think is a good and reasonable thing .
Lily , you created these mixtapes to promote both your own music and the music of others you liked .
That 's a perfectly reasonable thing to do .
But it 's infringing .
Think of all the other people who are just like you 5 years ago .
They do n't have knowledge of the workings of the music industry , and they 're trying to promote themselves or share music they like .
But , based on the laws that you yourself now support , the Lily of 5 years ago might not have an internet connection .
Even though the " infringement " you did was for entirely innocent reasons .
How is that fair or just ?
The point ( and this was the same point we tried to make with our original post about copying a Techdirt post ) is that incidental infringement is almost impossible to avoid .
Everyone infringes in some way or another in the course of a day .
One paper found that people infringe many times over in the course of a single day .
Everyone does .
And while your infringements are a bit more ... um ... blatant than most , it highlights the problem of having such a draconian action against file sharers .
Cutting them off from the internet for something that everyone is doing all the time seems quite problematic , does n't it ?
So , a quick question for you , Lily : Is " well I uploaded those songs before I knew how the music industry worked " a reasonable defense to prevent Lord Mandelson from taking away your internet access or the internet access of anyone else ?
Fair enough , but really the fact that it's a major label owned site was a separate issue ( having to do with EMI 's claims in its lawsuit against MP3Tunes ) .
It still does n't change the fact that you created these mixtapes , and used them to advance your career .
And now you are claiming that the very same tactics should not be allowed for others ?
In your original post pushing back on the Featured Artists Coalition , you complained about how they were all big stars , and how their plan would hurt the up - and - coming artist .
And yet , when you yourself were an up - and - coming artist , you used free music distribution to your own advantage .
Now you 're not only looking to take that option away from up - and - coming artists , you 're looking to kick them entirely offline for a period of time .
It seems like that 's a much bigger " harm " to up - and - coming artists than people sharing their music and promoting them for free .
But just like you mocked the FAC artists for having an unfair advantage for being big , you seem to be in the same position .
You want to take away tools from up - and - coming artists that you yourself used .
But you were the one who created the mixtapes , correct ?
You were the one who infringed and uploaded them and offered them to the world .
That they 're now on a site controlled by EMI is quite besides the point .
If you truly believe that regular uploaders should have their internet access taken away , why not make an example of yourself ?
Why not take away your own internet access for a year to prove the point ?
Or do you not think the laws you want to apply to everyone else should apply to you ?
Again , the whole point here is that what you did was entirely natural and made plenty of sense .
Lots of people do it today .
They do it because they love music .
There 's nothing wrong with that , and you know it ( or , apparently , knew it at one point in the past ) .
And , there are many ways to take advantage of that fact .
Just as 50 Cent does .
Just as you did .
Going to war with the fans who made you who you are today , in part because of your own infringing behavior , just does n't make any sense .
You keep saying that file sharing harms artists , but it existed five years ago as well , and did n't harm you .
It helped you .
So why would you want to take that away from everyone else ? :
Wow .
In the half an hour or so that I took to write this post , Lily erased the blog post where she responded ( I 've got a screenshot if anyone wants to see it ) , and just added a note to Twitter , saying that she 's shut down the entire blog due to too much abuse .
Lily , it 's not abuse if we 're just asking you to rethink your positions that appear to not be particularly well thought out .

Lets face it , traditional interviewing techniques absolutely suck when it comes to hiring developers .
You read resumes , you do phone interviews , technical interviews , culture - fit interviews , tests and in the end you basically ‘ go with your gut ’ and hire people who might be good and still get it wrong half the time .
Not an ideal situation .
This is because developers are craftsmen and no amount of talk will tell you how good a craftsman is at what he ( or she : ) ) does .
Why Traditional Interviews Fail
How much preparation time do you give your people when you ask then to help with the interview process ?
Chances are it is probably not much ( if it ’s anything greater than 5 minutes you ’re already ahead of the game : ) ) , so your interviewers end up reading the resume literally as they are walking to the interview and I am not even going to talk about actually preparing some questions in advance .
With this level of forethought , how likely are you to uncover anything you did n’t already know from the resume ?
Even when people have some preparation time , how much training have they got in interviewing techniques ?
Interviewing is a skill just like any other , having great social skills does not a good interviewer make :) .
People do n’t know the right kinds of questions to ask and even when they accidentally ask the right question , do n’t know what to look for in the answer they are given .
So , lack of training and preparation can be an issue , but you can address that , does that improve the situation ?
It does slightly , still , what do you do during an interview to test :
learning ability
interpersonal / teamwork skills ( outside the interview process )
ability to compromise and still achieve objectives
working to deadlines
depth of experience in the skills that you need
breadth of experience in a multitude of other skills
etc .
All you can do is ask and take what you ’re told as the truth .
Not to mention the fact that many good people do n’t do well when they are put on the spot during an interview process .
Do you just discard those ?
You ’re actually extremely fortunate if you ’re interviewing someone based on a recommendation that you trust , but what if you ’re not ?
Luckily , there is a much easier way to find out – let the craftsman show you what they are made of , get them to write some code .
No , Not On The Whiteboard
No , coding on the whiteboard or on paper , or even the 5 minute exercise on the laptop is not really coding .
You need to put a craftsman into their element and then you need to step back and observe .
Observe how they work , how they interact , how others interact with them .
Seth Godin proposes that we need to work with our prospective hires for months , while that would be nice it may not be practical , but we do n’t really need to go that far .
I say one day can give you enough information to make a good decision .
When you have a prospective candidate in mind , rather than iterating through rounds and rounds of interviews , put them into your team for a day and watch them work .
After the day is over get your team together and let them tell you if you should hire this person or not .
The advantages of this approach are clear .
You do n’t need to assume culture fit ( or do multi- choice psych analysis ) , you simply test it .
You find out first hand from the people you trust if they would be happy to work with this person , after all that ’s what they will have to do .
You get a glimpse of the depth of your applicant ’s skills as well as the breadth .
You find out how easily and well they can grok a new system and absorb what they are being told .
And you do all this in an atmosphere which is a lot less formal than an interview and one where a developer can feel a lot more comfortable .
This is further enhanced if you ask your people to put the prospective candidate ‘ through their paces ’ beforehand .
Innovate To Attract The Innovators
Surely we ca n’t ask a person to spend a whole day working and interviewing before we even hire them .
Can you not ?
Why not , are you not a compelling enough place to work ?
If your face is getting red right now – fix that first and then work on your hiring process .
If you ’re worried about inconveniencing a person by asking them to give up so much of their time for free , just imagine how inconvenienced you ’ll be when you realize you ’ve hired a crappy candidate 6 months too late .
Be innovative and you will draw people who enjoy an innovative atmosphere , people who will be happy to take a day just so they can go through an interesting and different interview process .
You need to become the kind of company that will attract the sort of employees you want to hire .
Your interview process and the way you hire people is the first step .
It is up to you if you want to take it .

Israel refused to accept the findings of a highly critical UN inquiry into the Gaza war and said today it would launch a diplomatic offensive to prevent any risk of prosecutions .
No independent inquiry into the military 's conduct during the war last January would be held , a clear rejection of one primary recommendation from the UN report .
The inquiry , headed by a former South African judge , Richard Goldstone , delivered a detailed and damning criticism of the war , accusing both Israel and armed Palestinian groups , notably Hamas , of war crimes and possible crimes against humanity .
It was by far the most serious international inquiry into the three - week war , which left 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis dead and which triggered a wave of criticism across the world .
" This report was conceived in sin and is the product of a union between propaganda and bias , " said Mark Regev , spokesman for the Israeli prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu .
" Israel is a country with a fiercely independent judiciary … Everything done by the military in Israel is open to judicial review by the independent judiciary . "
Israel had refused to co-operate with the inquiry , not letting the team enter Israel or the occupied West Bank .
It said the UN human rights council , which commissioned the inquiry , was biased against Israel .
" The mandate was biased from the beginning and it would have been a mistake to give credibility to a mission that has more in common with a kangaroo court than it does with a serious investigation , " Regev said .
For its part , Hamas also rejected the criticism .
" The Palestinian people and the Palestinian resistance were in a position of self - defence and not of attack .
One cannot compare the simple capabilities of the resistance with the great strength of the occupation , " said Ismail Haniyeh , a Hamas leader and former Palestinian prime minister .
After the inquiry was published yesterday evening , a legal team from Israel 's foreign ministry met with other government officials to prepare an analysis of the UN report .
Netanyahu reportedly held meetings into the night on the impact of the findings .
Israel is concerned that , when the UN human rights council discusses the report later this month , it could agree to pass it to the UN security council .
The security council could then decide to pass the findings on to the international criminal court , where arrest warrants could be issued ahead of prosecutions .
Israel 's deputy foreign minister , Danny Ayalon , who is on a visit to Washington , said he would meet the US ambassador to the UN , Susan Rice , to minimise the impact of the report before it reaches the UN security council .
Other senior figures from the Israeli government are expected to begin a round of telephone calls with ministers from other governments , particularly the five permanent members of the security council , to head off any decision that might lead to prosecutions .
The Ha'aretz newspaper said priority calls would go out to EU nations , in the hope of influencing the debate at the UN human rights council in Geneva .
The 575 - page UN report said that Israeli military personnel should face " individual criminal responsibility " for grave breaches of the laws of war .
Although critical of both sides , it singled out Israel and its policy towards the Palestinians of Gaza for the most serious condemnation .
It accused Israeli troops of using Palestinians as human shields , a war crime , and said the long Israeli economic blockade of Gaza amounted to " collective punishment intentionally inflicted by the government of Israel on the people of the Gaza Strip " .
It recommended that the UN security council should require Israel to investigate the allegations raised , and if it failed to do so within six months the case should be passed to the prosecutor of the international criminal court .
Each country that is a high contracting party to the Geneva conventions had a duty to search for and prosecute those responsible , it said .
The inquiry rejected Israel 's argument that the war was a response to Palestinian rocket fire and therefore an act of self - defence .
Instead , it found the war was " a deliberately disproportionate attack designed to punish , humiliate and terrorise a civilian population " .
Israeli actions depriving Gazans of means of subsistence , employment , housing and water , and denying their freedom of movement " could lead a competent court to find that the crime of persecution , a crime against humanity , had been committed " , it said .
But the inquiry also condemned Hamas .
It said Palestinian rocket attacks did not distinguish between civilian and military targets , caused terror among Israeli civilians and " would constitute war crimes and may amount to crimes against humanity " .
Gazan security forces – controlled by Hamas – carried out extrajudicial executions and the arbitrary arrest , detention and ill - treatment of people , especially political opponents .
It also called for the release of Gilad Shalit , an Israeli soldier held captive in Gaza for more than three years .
Chinese Zodiac : Tiger Aims For Total Control
According to the Chinese astronomy , the destiny of a person is determined by the position of planets at the time of his birth .
Based particularly on the position of Jupiter in its orbit , the celestial cycle is broken up into 12 segments , which correspond to 12 years represented by various animals such as the rat , ox , tiger , rabbit , dragon , snake , horse , ram , monkey , rooster , dog and boar .
Beginning with the rat , each year corresponds to a particular animal .
This continues for a cycle of 12 years , after which the cycle begins all over again .
People born under different signs ( according to their year of birth ) have typical characteristics , behave in typical ways , and have predictable destinies .
People born under the sign of the tiger are said to be generally unpredictable , powerful and strongly passionate .
Humanitarian qualities and their generosity , coupled with their authoritarian air and magnetic personalities make them born leaders .
Tigers will fight for a worthy cause till death , and their ambition is total control .
It is prudent to maintain caution with this zodiac sign as tigers feel intensely and are often prone to mood swings .
Emotional outbursts and stress induced negative reactions are typical characteristics of tigers .
Belonging to the third trine along with the horse and the dog , this zodiac seeks a true lover and is a gifted orator .
Relationships receive highest priority , defiance against injustice and honor add to the nobility of tigers .
In a negative sense , tigers can be reckless and impulsive , impatient , obstinate , selfish and restless .
However , these characteristics may be curbed and channelized in the right direction .
The fixed element for the tiger is wood ( like the dragon ) .
People belonging to the tiger zodiac should practice moderation in all aspects of their lives .
If their considerable energies are directed towards worthwhile efforts , they will achieve recognition and acknowledgement in life .
Mercury , a vaccine preservative , was withdrawn from childhood jabs five years ago after evidence linked it to brain damage .
However , the Sunday Express has discovered the pandemic ­vaccine , to be rolled out across the country within weeks , contains the heavy metal .
It also contains a chemical called squalene , used to stimulate the immune system to respond to the vaccine .
Some scientists believe squalene is linked to autoimmune illnesses including multiple sclerosis , rheumatoid arthritis and lupus .
Squalene was included in the anthrax jab given to British and US soldiers during the 1991 Gulf War .
Many claim it caused them permanent neurological damage , known as “ Gulf War syndrome ” .
Female soldiers given the vaccine were advised not to become pregnant for at least 18 months because of the risk of birth defects .
As these town halls are going on around the country , one thing is for sure , the anger is manufactured by a small sliver of people pumped by the lobbyist and insurance companies .
That is a fact .
If anyone watch these town hall meetings , which is starting to turn many Americans OFF , their concerns are over the top and they sound very UNINFORMED .
They come prepared with false talking points and this " do n't take my medicare away " is a sure indication that these people do n't understand nor do they know what they are talking about .
Sarah Palin has not helped the political discourse , period .
For me , she is as smart , sharp as a box of rocks , and that is not much .
She has been blasted by Senator Johnny Isakson and now Murkowski for out right lying about the health care bill and death panels .
Finally , the general public is looking and are not dumb .
Seeing a man bring a gun to a presidential town hall meeting , no matter what side of the aisle you are on is not a good thing .
If something happens out here to ANYONE , the finger pointing will definitely go back to the Republican Party , for their lack of moral responsibility and leadership .
U.S. Sen . Lisa Murkowski on Tuesday told an Anchorage crowd that critics of health care reform , the summer 's hottest political topic , are n't helping the debate by throwing out highly charged assertions not based in fact .
" It does us no good to incite fear in people by saying that there 's these end - of - life provisions , these death panels , " Murkowski , a Republican , said .
" Quite honestly , I 'm so offended at that terminology because it absolutely is n't ( in the bill ) .
There is no reason to gin up fear in the American public by saying things that are not included in the bill . "
Murkowski's analysis of the health - care reform measures was delivered to a Commonwealth North crowd of about 130 at the Dena'ina Civic and Convention Center .
The nonpartisan group focuses on public policy issues .
Former Gov. Sarah Palin stirred up controversy last week by suggesting on her Facebook page that people like her parents and Down syndrome son might have to appear before " Obama 's ' death panel ' so his bureaucrats can decide , based on a subjective judgment of their ' level of productivity in society , ' whether they are worthy of health care .
Such a system is downright evil . "
Experts who have reviewed the various pieces of legislation , which run for hundreds of pages , say there 's no such provision .

A Chinese worker has allegedly killed himself over a missing iPhone 4G prototype , Venturebeat reports .
Sun Danyong was an employee at electronics manufacturer Foxconn .
He was supposed to ship iPhone 4G prototypes to Apple ( AAPL ) .
He got 16 prototypes from a local Foxconn factory , but soon discovered that one was missing .
He reported the the missing prototype .
Danyong 's apartment was then illegally searched by Foxconn employees , and he was detained .
There are allegations about what happened to Danyong , which can be read in the full article here .
Later that week , Danyong jumped to his death from his apartment building .
We have no idea what actually lead to this man 's tragic death , but VentureBeat makes the case that Apple 's intense emphasis on secrecy played a role .
VentureBeat :
Taiwan - based Foxconn makes Apple ’s iPhones and iPods , along with numerous other hardware devices for other international technology companies .
It faces cutthroat competition from other manufacturers around China and the world .
A leak of the next generation of Apple ’s crown jewel , the iPhone , could badly hurt Foxconn ’s business relationship with Apple .
The pressure within Foxconn to maintain Apple ’s secrets , then , is not surprising .
" But it 's quite possible that many of you simply wo n't believe it .
So you may choose not to believe any of what I 've told you .
Maybe you 'll still believe that it was some sort of ' super technology ' ,
What you choose to believe is up to you . "
First of all , everything written below is true and is virtually word - for - word a transcript of the conversation .
I have changed names for obvious reasons .
Apologies in advance for the lack of funneh .
Picture the scene :
It 's a snowy December 's night somewhere north of the Watford Gap .
Thanks to a small fuckup involving a patient the size of a whale and my back , I am now on light duties in the ambulance control room .
It 's coming up to 1 am , there 's a force 8 gale and blizzard battering the control room .
*BEEP *UCC : " Ambulance Service " Operator : " Blackburn connecting phone number 01234567890 " UCC : " Thank you operator .
Go ahead caller .
What 's the address please ?
" Caller : " Um..I 'm at the junction of Any Street and Thingy Road in Arsetown ( insert name of quite scroaty town here . ) " UCC : " OK , I 've got that address .
What 's the problem tonight ?
" Caller ( sounds like a young lad ) " I 'm really sorry to bother you , but I did n't know who else to call .
" U : That 's OK , just tell us what the problem is and we 'll get something sorted .
Caller : I 'm really really cold .
I 've been out on the street all day and I 'm freezing .
I 've tried the police and they gave me a number for a hostel but I 've got no cash on me and I can't feel my feet now .U : ( clicking through questions ) OK , what 's your name ?
C : It 's LukeU : OK Luke , my name 's Carrot .
I 'm just going to ask a few questions .
They 're not going to delay us getting any help to you .
C : ( starts crying ) I 'm really sorry .
I 'm so sorry .U : Hey , that 's OK .
Do n't worry .C : I 'm just wasting your time , I 'm just wasting everyone 's time ... U : ( I stop typing ) .
Listen Luke , you 're not wasting anyone 's time .
I 'm here until 7 in the morning , so you can take as long as you want .
C : Well , I dunno who to talk to or anything .U : Well you can talk to me .C : Well .... I told my mum at lunch that I 'm gay .
I 've got this boyfriend and he 's great and everything so I thought I should tell her because I love him , and I love her .U : Right ...C : So I told her , and she told me to get out of the house , that she did n't want to know me if I was a fucking fag , and she was n't having me in her house .
So she shoved me out the front door .
I got my coat but my wallet and my mobile is still at home .U : OK ...C : I had a few coins in my pocket so I phoned my boyfriend to hope he'd take me in .U : Does he live with his parents too ?C : No , he 's 32.U : Right , and how old are you ?
C : I 'm 17 .
I 'll be 18 next month .U : OK , so what happened ?C : He just laughed and said I was a stupid cunt , and hung up on me .U : He hung up on you ?
C : Yeah .U : I see .C : So then I just wandered town .
A nice lady bought me a cup of tea in the cafe , but now everything 's closed and I 've got nowhere to go .
It 's my fault .
It 's my fault for being gay .
I should n't be gay ...( breaks down in tears .
) U : Right Luke , stop right there .
There is NOTHING wrong with being gay .
Do n't let two silly people make you feel otherwise .
I 'm gay too , and I know exactly how it feels to be on the receiving end of stupid idiots like that .
But it worked out for me and it'll work out for you .
Now we need to get you sorted out first of all .
Do you have any relatives or friends nearby ?
C : No , we just moved here from ( another town about 20 miles away ) so I know nobody apart from my boyfriend .U : Right , this is what I am going to do .
I am going to send an ambulance to you , not on blue lights but they will be with you shortly , OK ?
They will look after you and get you warmed up .
C : Oh God , what about college ?
I 'm doing my A - levels ....U : Let 's not worry about that at the moment .
Let 's get you sorted first .
Can you give me the number of the hostel ?
C : Yeah , it 's 019876543321U : OK , I 'll get onto them and get that sorted .
I 'm going to give you my direct number when you get sorted at hospital , so ring me as soon as possible from the hospital , or if that fails , call 999 and ask to speak to Carrot .
C : Thank you .
Thank you so much .U : The ambulance crew should be with you now .C : Yeah I can see them .U : OK , I 'm going to terminate the call now .
Let me know how you get on .C : Thanks so much .
Bye.U : Bye .So I went and got the hostel sorted ( despite an argument with a stroppy warden about him being under 18 ) .
At 6 am , I get a phonecall on my direct phone .U : Ambulance control , Carrot speaking .
C : Hi Carrot , it 's Luke .U : Hi Luke .
How are you doing ?
C : I 'm much better thanks .
I 've got the nurse with me who wants to have a word .
Nurse : Hello , is that the calltaker ?U : Yes it is .N : I thought you might like to know - Luke was so cold when we got him here that he was clinically hypothermic .
20 minutes more outside and he would be dead .
He 's fine now he 's dried out and warmed up .U : Well , that 's great news .
I 've managed to get a hostel sorted .
N : Well , what 's the address ?
We will pay the taxi fare for him .
So Luke got into the hostel , where he stayed over Christmas .
He then moved back to where he used to live where he moved in with his Dad .
Luke is now 21 years old .
He finished college with 2 A's and a C at A level and went to university .
He has just finished his final year and looks set to get a 1st in his degree .
He is one of the nicest , most well rounded young men I have ever had the fortune to meet ... and I was lucky enough to meet him .
He 's had a few relationships , some good , some shite , but now he seems to be with a lovely , and quite frankly barking , bloke who clearly loves him to bits .
So I should feel proud and warm inside ?
Well I should , but I was very close to telling him to fuck off and stop wasting our time within the first 30 seconds of the call because I was tired and busy .
Sometimes it really does pay to listen . ( , Fri 4 Sep 2009 , 19:07 , 56 replies
Watch this really beautiful full - length trailer for ‘s historical epic “ . ” and director Alejandro Amenábar traveled back to ancient times to tell a modern story about a progressive woman standing against religious dogma and persecution .
Hypatia struggles to preserve scientific knowledge amid the clash of zealots in Alexandria , whose rising Christian population grows increasingly militant toward Jews and worshippers of the Egyptian gods .
Amenabar dove into astronomy research but said he did not want to make a movie about a figure such as Galileo because everyone already knew his story .
Amenabar ’s studies eventually led him to Hypatia , a woman dealing with current issues in ancient times .
Rachel Weisz plays astrologer - philosopher Hypatia of Alexandria , who fights to save the collected wisdom of the ancient world .
The central dramatic event is the sacking of Alexandria ’s fabled library , the repository of “ all the knowledge of the world ” up to that time , and the parallel drawn between early - day Christian fundamentalists , who have just been legalized by the Roman Empire at the story ’s start , and a certain other religion ’s present - day fanatics is entirely clear .
The story also creates a love triangle of sorts among Hypatia and her devoted slave ( ) and one of her students ( ) .
Her slave Davus ( Minghella ) is torn between his love for his mistress and the possibility of gaining his freedom by joining the rising tide of Christianity .
Premiered at the Cannes Film Festival the movie will be shown at Toronto Film Festival next month .

HYST - BOB 1
Remember our mantra : HAVE YOUR SHIT TOGETHER BEFORE IT HITS THE FAN !

At this point , we have a rescue plan for our documents and irreplaceable photographs .
We now need to turn this into a survival kit for our wealth .
We keep these in a bag which becomes our BOB ( Bug Out Bag ) , aka a ' Grab - n - Go ' bag .
Different people have different needs , so there is going to be some diversion past this point as to what people choose to put in that bag beside the vital records and photographs .
The most important part of the bag is , believe it or not , THE BAG .
Your BOB should be a dedicated bag that you use ONLY for that purpose .
If you are cheap , you can use an old pillow case or go buy a $ 10 duffel bag at Wal - Mart .
Some people turn their BOB into an uber - Survival Kit that weighs 80 pounds .
DO NOT DO THIS !
If you cannot lift your BOB with one hand , then it is too heavy .
Our next topic for conversation , then , is supplies .
I do n't mean supplies in the context of having food and water available , I 'm talking about critical supplies .
Things that you need to get through the next 24 or 48 hours .
For most people the # 1 item on that list is going to be their prescription medications , if any .
We need to establish some criteria for making decisions about what goes in the bag , but first , let 's get every person in the house set up with their own BOB .
This is the bag that each member of the family can grab during Escape Plan Alpha - the 60 Second Plan .
The bag that each member of the family selects should be large enough to hold all the essential items on their list .
It should also be small enough for them to carry .
Any child over the age of 5 will be personally responsible for his or her BOB .
I find that a small or medium sized duffel bag works well .
If you are strong enough to carry two bags , then you might have your own BOB in addition to your laptop bag .
That is what I do since my laptop bag does n't have enough room to accomplish the BOB task .
Let 's talk about what does not go into the BOB .
First , no luxury items .
Remember that we want a kit that contains only essentials .
The things we need for the next 24 to 48 hours .
Nothing goes into the bag that can be replaced .
Video games , toys , and other non-essentials do not belong .
Your pistol does not belong in your BOB .
Your pistol belongs in its holster on your hip .
Your rifle goes over your shoulder .
Spare ammo can go into the BOB , but remember that you have to carry it so do n't make it too heavy .
Resist the temptation to fill your BOB with crap .
If you really think you need a toothbrush and a razor to survive , then make sure they are small and light .
Your BOB is not a Dopp kit .
Always have the towel .
The towel is not optional .
A basic starting adult BOB contains the following : 1 or 2 16 oz bottles of water .
High energy snacks like Snickers bars or other energy bars - but not more than one or two .
( Chips do n't last well in BOBs ...
Remember to change out food and water items at least once a year .
A five year old Snicker 's bar is kind of stale . )
A change of clothing .
Two changes of undergarments .
You may have to change the clothing out seasonally .
A working flashlight .
I prefer small , light LED headlamps .
A personal first aid kit .
A small radio or MP3 player that is radio capable .
A small towel .
A supply of prescription medicines .
Maps , travel information , detailed rendezvous information for each member of the family , and a copy of all of your families emergency plans .
( The easy way to do that is to just keep your Preparedness Workbook in your BOB .
A pen and some paper or small notebook .
A full duplicate set of house and car keys .
That 's only the start , but it 's a good start .
If you can fit all of that into your BOB and you have room left , do n't worry .
We 'll need that space a little later on .
The personal first aid kit does not have to be elaborate .
Some aspirin and a few Band - Aids in a Zip - Loc baggie is fine .
What you 're trying to avoid with this is having to pull out your ' big ' first aid kit every time someone has a scratch or a little headache .
The contents may need to be adjusted for children .
Infants and toddlers should have a diaper bag , which will essentially be their BOB .
Taking a long drive with an infant and no disposable diapers is one of those long nightmares that is best avoided at all costs .
Especially if you have cloth seats .
Assembling your BOBs does not have to be expensive .
I like to use a small backpack for my BOB .
Other items may be included , so long as they do not make the bag heavy , especially for the kids .
There are some other things that go into your BOB , but we 'll get to those a little later .
For now , just get it started and have it ready .
The various books and magazines all tell you how to put these bags together , with some variations on the theme .
They tell you all about all kinds of useful stuff you need in your ' kit ' - but remember , Survival is NOT a kit !
What the books and magazines do not tell you is what the bag is actually for - which seems so intuitive that nobody ever explains it .
Well , I 'm going to explain it to you now and then you 'll say , " Oh . I never thought of that . "
Either that , or you 'll say , " Well , DUH !
Everybody knows that , doofus . "
In any case , I 'm gonna tell you , so just stick with me , OK ?
In one year , fire departments respond to about 400,000 residential fires that claim the lives of over 3,100 people .
Residential fires are the most common disaster in the United States , affecting more families than any other .
Floods - especially flash floods - are # 2 , claiming almost 150 lives each year .
Fire , though , is the big one .
You are more likely to wake up to find your house on fire than you are to experience a widespread disaster of any kind .
I 'm going to give you the brief sermon about smoke alarms now .
Now that you know that fire is the most common disaster , you should install smoke alarms in your home .
If you already have them , make sure the batteries are fresh .
Fire is your most likely disaster .
Smoke alarms are your primary warning system to help you protect Health and Wealth .
Do it .
A lot of those 3,100 people die because they do not have working smoke alarms in their homes .
Either they do not have them , or the batteries died a long time ago .
Studies also indicate that people die in fires because they do not get out of their homes in time .
They do not get out because they stop to look for pets , call 911 from inside the home , or stop to get dressed .
Let 's look at two scenarios .
Pre-HYST , you wake up in the night to the sound of your smoke alarms .
The house is on fire !
You roll out of bed naked , stumble about trying to put some clothes on and eventually manage to be ' decent ' .
You dash out into the living room , which is now filled with smoke , and you start searching for Whiskers the Cat , who you finally find under the sofa .
He does n't come when you call , and you can't quite reach him so you spend some time working on that .
When you do manage to fish the ungrateful creature out from under there , you stand up with him to try to get out of the house - but it's too late - you are overcome by smoke and you die on the floor .
Post - HYST , you wake up in the night to the sound of your smoke alarms .
The house is on fire !
You roll out of bed naked , snatch your BOB and your wife 's BOB out from under the bed , grab your laptop bag , and dash out of the door .
Your wife , who grabbed Junior out of his crib in your bedroom is right behind you .
She 's naked too .
( May as well get as much play out of that as I can ...)
The whole family rendezvous at the mailbox , where you all unzip your BOBs and pull on some clothes .
Whoever is dressed first dials 911 on the cell phone .
If the weather is warm , you can call before you get dressed .
Health and Wealth protected .
Too bad about Whiskers , but you were more of a dog person anyway ...

On Morning Joe today , Joe Scarborough hammered the birthers .
Scarborough said , “ Instead of trying to figure out what ’s happening to their country , the terrible things that are happening economically to their country , they embrace conspiracy theories , and they make themselves look like cartoon characters . ”
Here is the video courtesy of Media Matters :
Scarborough said , “ I mean we ’ve seen the birth certificate .
Here is what I do n’t understand about these conspiracy theorists .
A birth certificate has been shown .
That ’s not enough .
This is not enough for people , nor is enough for these people who should actually be focusing on policies , focusing on the fact that Washington is stealing their money , their children ’s money , and their grandchildren ’s money . ”
Advertisements
He continued , “ It also is not enough for these people that the Honolulu newspaper … the Honolulu Advertiser on the day Barack Obama was born 47 years ago had a birth announcement for Barack Hussein Obama .
Now that is not enough for these people .
They would rather be like sea lions barking at waves .
Instead of trying to figure out what ’s happening to their country , the terrible things that are happening economically to their country , they embrace conspiracy theories , and they make themselves look like cartoon characters …
Again it is like the 9/11 conspiracy theorists .
There is nothing you can do . ”
I think the Castle incident was the moment that the birthers were exposed to the mainstream , and that is why there is such a large pushback to debunk their conspiracy theories .
The birthers have been around on the Internet for a long time , but since the mainstream media pays no attention to the Net , they had no idea just how widespread the birthers had become within the GOP .
Joe Scarborough realizes that the birthers make the Republican Party look insane .
If these conspiracy theorists define the GOP to voters at large , the Republicans will have an even bigger problem than they do now .
I think you are going to see more Republicans coming out an acknowledging Obama ’s citizenship , because they realize that they have to get rid of these birthers .
Face Lift Costs
A face lift is a surgical procedure performed by a plastic surgeon where excess fat is removed and muscles in the face are tightened , revealing more youthful - appearing facial skin .
Face Lift Cost
Face lift costs vary with surgeons and by location .
The average total cost of a face lift surgery is between $ 6,000 and $ 15,000 .
This cost includes the surgeon ’s , the anesthesiologist ’s , and the hospital ’s fee .
Some patients can end up paying up to $ 25,000 for a face lift plastic surgery that is performed in connection with another procedure .
Other procedures that can be done in conjunction with face lifts include eyelid surgeries ( blepharoplasty ) , forehead lifts ( brow lifts ) , nose surgeries ( Rhinoplasty ) , chin surgeries , facial implants , and skin treatments .
If all the procedures are conducted simultaneously , the cost will be lower because there will be only one combined surgeon , facility and anesthesia fee , and it would require less total surgery duration .
To cover all these costs , most plastic surgeon ’s offer patients financing options .
What is a Mini Face Lift ?
A mini facelift is a cosmetic surgery procedure that is relatively new in that it tightens the facial skin and diminishes the look of wrinkles , making patients appear younger - looking .
It is painless and carries less risk than a full face lift .
It can be over and done within an hour .
It has adopted the nickname “ Weekend Facelift , ” as it can be done over the weekend and has patients back to work by Monday morning .
Mini Face Lift Cost
Mini face lift costs are between $ 1,300 and $ 1,800 , depending on the physician and location .
It is another elective surgery procedure not covered by health insurance , so check with the doctor concerning any financing options .
What is a Laser Treatment ?
A laser treatment is a non-surgical approach to surgical face lifts .
It does not require any incisions to be made and instead , uses a light beam to destroy the outer layer of the face , stimulating new growth of collagen cells , revealing new skin .
It also tightens the skin , leaving patients with fewer lines and wrinkles .
Some risks include minor discolorations and sensitivity of the face after treatment , but those side effects will soon dissipate within 2 weeks .
Laser Treatment Costs
Fraxel laser treatment for skin resurfacing costs between $ 1,000 for 1 treatment , up to $ 5,000 , depending on the number of treatments needed to clear up acne , skin blemishes , wrinkles , skin laxity and other skin irregularities .
Non solo in politica ci sono i farabutti .
Non solo nella stampa ci sono i farabutti .
Non solo in tivù ci sono i farabutti .
Silvio Berlusconi e il fido servitore Bruno Vespa si sono accorti ieri sera che moltissimi italiani sono farabutti e non hanno più intenzione di farsi fregare .
Un misto di minacce , intimidazioni , insulti e menzogne , questo è stato lo spettacolo indegno di ieri sera a Porta a Porta , dove il capo del governo è corso a prendersi i meriti di altri , a inaugurare casette per terremotati pagate da altri e costruite da altri .
E naturalmente , secondo il suo stile , a insultare gli avversari e a mentire .
Dopo aver preteso e ottenuto lo spostamento di una trasmissione concorrente ( Ballarò ) e dopo aver ordinato lo slittamento di una trasmissione sua ( Matrix ) , la coppia diabolica Bruno - Silvio ha fatto una solenne figura di merda : 13,47 per cento in prima serata su Raiuno .
Appena 3.219.000 spettatori , molti dei quali orripilati da quello spettacolo indegno .
Uno share con cui qualunque altro programma sarebbe chiuso e cacciato a calci nel culo ( la media di Porta a Porta in prima serata è del 18,30 per cento ) .
Un vero disastro .
La gente ha preferito guardare Garko su Canale Cinque ( 5.750.000 spettatori , 22,61 di share ) , che almeno non è asfaltato in testa , mente un po ’ di meno , è alto e non insulta la gente .
Ora due semplici domande :
1 ) Possiamo permetterci di avere un premier che va in giro a dire di avere un gradimento del 70 per cento e poi in prima serata senza concorrenza ( perché viene chiusa ) fa solo io 13 ?
Dove è finito il 57 per cento di italiani che manca all ’appello ?
2) Possiamo permetterci ( con i nostri soldi ) di pagare 1.187.000 ( un-milione - cento-ottasette- mila ) euro all ’anno un conduttore che non sa fare le domande e che fa ascolti tanto mediocri che chiunque li facesse a Raiuno in prima serata sarebbe cacciato ?

La CPU è uno dei più complessi circuiti ad alta scala d'integrazione .
Basti pensare che per la sua creazione sono necessarie centinaia di step .
In questo articolo cercheremo di delineare , a grandissime linee ed in maniera esemplificata , il processo di creazione di una CPU Intel .
Il seguente articolo è una traduzione rielaborata personalmente ( e con l'aggiunta di qualche ulteriore commento esplicativo ) a partire dalla slide pubblicata da Intel sul suo sito e segnalata dall ' utente Vt64 del forum di InformaticaEasy .
In realtà la procedura è praticamente la medesima per qualunque moderna CPU prodotta da altre aziende , AMD inclusa .
Tutto ha inizio dalla comune sabbia , che contiene Silicio , il secondo elemento chimico più frequente presente al mondo ( dopo l'ossigeno ) .
Il Silicio è presente all ' interno della sabbia nella forma del diossido di silicio ( SIO2 ) ed è l'elemento di base per la costruzione di un semiconduttore , CPU incluse .
Il Silicio viene estratto dalla sabbia e purificato mediante una procedura che richiede diversi passaggi , fino a raggiungere la qualità ottimale per la realizzazione di un semiconduttore .
Tale stadio del silicio è indicato con il nome Electronic Grade Silicon ed è talmente puro che contiene un atomo di impurità ogni milione di atomi di silicio .
Nell 'immagine riportata è possibile osservare un cristallo , denominato Lingotto , formato dalla fusione del silicio purificato .
Un lingotto , composto da silicio " Electronic Grade Silicon " , pesa circa 100 chili ed è formato da silicio puro al 99,9999 % .
Il Lingotto è tagliato tramite appositi macchinari in sottili dischi in silicio che prendono il nome di Wafer .
I " biscotti " vengono sottoposti ad un certosino processo di levigazione al termine del quale assumono una finitura lucida a specchio .
Intel acquista i wafer da terzi , dunque la vera e propria modellazione delle CPU a partire dai dischi di silicio avviene a partire dal prossimo step .
Il processo produttivo a 45 nm di Intel " High -k Metal Gate " utilizza wafer aventi diametro pari a 300 millimetri .
Inizialmente le prime CPU erano invece realizzate con circuiti stampati su wafer da 50 mm .
Un incremento del diametro dei dischi in silicio si traduce in una drastica diminuzione dei costi di produzione per ogni chip prodotto .
Inizia quindi il processo di litografia sul wafer .
Si procede cospargendo su di esso una particolare sostanza simile al film fotoresistivo ( in gergo Photo Resist ) .
Il wafer viene fatto ruotare durante questa fase per far sì che su di esso venga steso un velo sottile ed uniforme di tale sostanza .
Il wafer così ricoperto viene esposto a raggi ultravioletti ( UV ) .
La reazione chimica che avviene è simile al processo che si innesca in una fotocamera appena si preme il pulsante dell ' otturatore .
L'esposizione agli UV avviene interponendo tra la sorgente luminosa ed il wafer una " maschera " che funziona da stampino , poichè crea i vari schemi di circuiti a seconda delle zone di luce ed ombra .
Una lente interposta nel mezzo riduce l'immagine proiettata dalla maschera in modo da imprimere sul wafer un'immagine del circuito più piccola fino a quattro volte rispetto a quella presente sulla maschera .
Sebbene solitamente su un singolo wafer sono " costruite " centinaia di CPU , a partire da adesso focalizzeremo l'attenzione sul componente di base di ogni circuito integrato : il transistor .
Questo componente funziona come uno switch , poichè controlla il flusso di corrente elettrica in un chip elettronico .
I ricercatori Intel hanno sviluppato transistor così piccoli che 30 milioni di essi possono essere contenuti nella punta di uno spillo .
Segue una procedura di pulizia dello strato fotoresistivo , che viene rimosso con del solvente : a pulizia ultimata permangono sul wafer soltanto le tracce impresse dalla maschera tramite raggi UV .
Ciò che resta di tale materiale precedentemente " spalmato " serve a proteggere le parti del wafer che non devono essere incise .
Il resto , ovvero le superfici del wafer " a nudo " , verranno invece incise con sostanze chimiche ( processo di Etching ) .
Dopo l'incisione , il materiale fotoresistivo è rimosso : a questo punto la forma desiderata del circuito diviene visibile .
A questo punto si procede applicando un nuovo strato di materiale fotoresistivo che serve a proteggere le aree del chip che non dovranno essere contaminate dagli ioni .
Mediante un processo che prende il nome di Impiantazione Ionica ( comunemente chiamata drogaggio , o doping ) , infatti , le aree esposte del wafer in silicio sono bombardate ad alta velocità con impurità chimiche chiamate ioni ( accelerati da un campo elettrico a 300000 Km / h ) .
La loro presenza all ' interno del silicio serve ad alterale la conduttività elettrica di determinate aree .
Si rimuove quindi nuuovamente il materiale fotoresistivo .
Nella foto seguente il materiale drogato è evidenziato in colore verde .
Il transistor è prossimo al suo completamento .
A questo punto vengono praticati tre fori su un layer isolante ( identificato in color magenta ) sovrapposto al chip .
Questi tre fori verranno riempiti con del rame ( mediante galvanostegia ) e ognuna di esse rappresenterà uno dei tre terminali del transistor ( base , collettore , emettitore ) .
Il wafer è inserito in una soluzione in solfato di rame ; gli ioni di rame sono depositati sul transistor mediante un processo denominato galvanostegia .
Gli ioni viaggiano dal terminale positivo ( anodo ) a quello negativo ( catodo ) che è rappresentato dal wafer .
Alla fine di tale processo , sulla superficie del wafer si deposita un sottile strato di rame .
Il materiale in eccesso viene ripulito : ecco i tre terminali del transistor ben in evidenza , isolati elettricamente dal materiale isolante precedentemente applicato .
Si realizza dunque l'interconnessione dei vari transistor mediante diversi " fili " ( interconnessioni metalliche ) .
La combinazione e disposizione delle diverse interconnessioni dipende in funzione dell ' architettura della CPU progettata dagli sviluppatori a priori , a seconda delle funzionalità di cui si vuol dotare la CPU ( ad esempio i modelli appartenenti alla famiglia Core i7 ) .
Nonostante i chip per PC sembrino estremamente sottili , in realtà hanno almeno 20 livelli che formano una circuiteria decisamente complessa : osservando il chip con una lente di ingrandimento , è possibile notare una intricata rete di linee di circuiti e transistor che assomigliano a futuristiche autostrade multilivello .
La CPU è oramai pronta .
O meglio , dovremmo parlare al plurale visto che ogni wafer ne contiene decine e decine .
Il wafer è sottoposto ad un test preliminare che verifica la funzionalità dei vari chip , che dovranno fornire l'output atteso a partire da un input inviatogli .
A questo punto il wafer è ritagliato in piccole porzioni , chiamate die , ognuna delle quali coincide con il chip racchiuso nel package di ogni CPU .
Il packaging , lo step successivo , interessa soltanto le CPU che hanno risposto correttamente al test precedentemente effettuato .
Ecco il die di una CPU Intel Core i7 , precedentemente ritagliato da un wafer cui apparteneva .
L'" impacchettamento " della CPU consiste nell ' inserire il die tra un PCB inferiore ( un sottostrato ) ed un dissipatore di calore ( lamina in alluminio superiore ) .
Il PCB integra l'interfaccia elettrica e meccanica tra CPU e il resto del sistema ( motherboard ) .
La lamina in alluminio è invece denominata IHS ( Integrated Heat Spreader ) e su di essa viene installato il dissipatore per la CPU .
Ecco la CPU ultimata ( nellla foto precedentemente inserita , una CPU Intel Core i7 ) .
Un microprocessore è il prodotto del processo di fabbricazione più complesso al mondo .
Infatti , tale processo si compone di centinaia di fasi ( in questo articolo sono state menzionate soltanto le più importanti ) ed è necessario che lo sviluppo avvenga in un ambiente a temperatura , umidità e concentrazione molecolare dell 'aria controllate ( una fabbrica di CPU ) , nella quale gli " omini coniglio " governano le preziose macchine di precisione che consentono la realizzazione di ogni CPU .
Seguono dei test finali durante i quali la CPU viene testata relativamente alle sue caratteristiche chiave ( dissipazione del calore e frequenza massima ) .
A seconda dei differenti risultati di test , le CPU con le stesse capacità sono inserite in uno stesso tray di trasporto .
Ecco che si inizia a parlare di batch ( quello più fortunato in overclock , quello che scalda di più , ecc ... ) .
La CPU viene infine inserita in una confezione di vendita ( se destinata all ' utente finale ) oppure in confezioni meno " eleganti " se destinate agli assemblatori di computer ( OEM ) o , perchè no , ai fortunati recensori di prodotti Intel ...

Alber Elbaz speaks about “ lightness ” during interviews before his collections .
I think his summation of what women need seems pretty accurate .
Yes , we need lightness / ease / mobility .
I love the way Elbaz makes clothes .
His Lanvin spring 2008 collection made me cry .
I like lightness .
He is rare , a genius , and I like that he is chubby .
Pies should be light too .
I do n’t like big pies , with one flavor .
I want to change everyday .
I have internet , my iPhone , and many choices .
I ’ve simply turned into a big ball of vacillation - going back and forth between a circle of different flavors / opportunities .
This is why fashion blogs are so great .
Mobility , I can access blog content from anywhere , magazines are heavy , they need to stay at home so my shoulder can rest .
After I ’ve had a little view on one person ’s blog , I move onto the next and the next .
All different .
All fast , all immediate gratification .
Pies , they need to be the same .
I want a couple of bites , and I want to be done with it .
I want to pop open my bag when I ’m hungry and taste a little sweetness .
I do n’t want commitment .
I want to be promiscuous with my food .
I want to eat pie , but I do n’t want a whole slice - I want to try other flavors too , but for just a little , and move onto another .
If I have one slice , I may have guilt hanging over me all day .
I want little pies , yes , with more pie crust than filling .
50 calories or less , no guilt .
Eating pie slices makes me feel fat .
Pie pops , perhaps this would work .
Rotating flavors .
Grab and go .
In and out .
Blackberry , pumpkin , apple , banana …my favourites .
You see I am very slutty about my food .
Yes , this post revolves around lollipop sticks .
The different flavors .
Cinnamon , Sugar , cornstarch , these three were the main ingredients used to hype the filling .
Cornstarch is for thickening .
I made blackberry filling with just sugar and cornstarch .
I label all my homemade jams and fillings .
For some reason images work better for me than text .
With the same lollipop stick , I ’ve sealed the pie , making indents all around the pop .
Very crucial to slather egg whites on pie exterior .
This is what gives it the “ Betty Crocker ” touch .
Without this , the pies would n’t look as blistered or nicely toasted .
Blackberry :
Apple :
Pumpkin :
Pies to go .
Work friendly , Driving friendly , Boyfriend friendly , Cellulite friendly , and embarrassment free pie pops .
Wii Sports Resort has been a major focal point of Nintendo 's strategy for the past couple of years , and the game carries the not insubstantial responsibility of selling the Motion Plus peripheral to the gaming public .
The $ 20 hardware has succeeded where Nintendo has so far failed with the Vitality Sensor : it ships with its own killer app in the sequel to the original Wii Sports .
The strategy has paid off ; Nintendo has shared the numbers for the game 's first week of availability , and the $ 50 game and peripheral package has sold over 500,000 units .
Nintendo was quick to tout the numbers .
" Through Monday we sold one copy of Wii Sports Resort roughly every 1.5 seconds continuously since it launched in the United States , " said Cammie Dunaway , Nintendo of America 's executive vice president of Sales & Marketing .
" This tells us consumers were eagerly waiting to get their hands on these fun activities , and it's a great start for a game that will have long - lasting appeal . "
Wii Sports Resort opens the door for the MotionPlus
You can read our review of the uneven , but enjoyable , collection of sports games , but the story here is just how quickly Nintendo has been able to turn the Motion Plus peripheral into a success in the US .
Not only have a half - million units of the hardware been put into American homes through the pack - in deal with Wii Sports Resort , but during the month of June the NPD Group reported that Nintendo sold 169,000 units .
Not impressed yet ?
That 's not including the number of units that were packed into Tiger Woods PGA Tour 10 on the Wii , which sold 272,400 units in June .
Now , it 's possible that some of those games were sold without the peripheral , but the draw of the title was the tight integration of the MotionPlus ; it 's safe to assume that the majority of units were purchased with the hardware included .
The MotionPlus experience adds much to the game , making the Wii version of this year 's Tiger Woods the definitive version of the game ; a rarity on Nintendo 's console .
This degree of success should help the piece of mind of developers who may have been afraid of splintering their sales by supporting the MotionPlus .
The upcoming Red Steel 2 will require the peripheral ; the success of Wii Sports Resort must allow UbiSoft to breathe easier after betting so aggressively on the hardware 's success .
Ars Technica spoke with High Voltage software — creators of the Conduit and the upcoming Grinder — about the company 's plans to support the MotionPlus in its upcoming games , and they were also banking on Nintendo 's success with Wii Sports Resort .
" There is no denying that peripherals do fracture the market and because of that , we do have concerns along those lines , " David Pellas , director of Game Design at High Voltage , explained to Ars .
" That said though , we do believe that Nintendo is taking the best course of action by making the hardware fairly cheap to purchase and by providing it as a free pack - in with Wii Resort . "
He was bullish about the game 's chances .
" This game will most likely be one of the highest selling games on the platform , thereby giving the hardware the best chance to reach many gamers . "
Now that the projections have proven real , the door is opened for widespread Motion Plus support .

The Wall Street Journal featured the article , Among Dolphins , Tool - Using Handymen Are Women .
Its subheadline reads :
In a Sign of Animal Ingenuity , the Marine Mammals — and One Cross - Dresser — Are Seen Making Hunting Implements
The facts presented in the article seemed to strongly imply that we should rethink the notion that dolphins are “ mere ” animals .
They certainly seem to address the question of whether dolphins are capable of abstract reasoning , which is a characteristic of humans in the general case that helps to distinguish us from most of the rest of the animal kingdom at least .
My criteria for whether we should treat some creature ( humanoid or otherwise ) as having ethical significance , of being considered to have rights per se , are somewhat different from the usual “ Is it intelligent ? ” question that probably comes to most people ’s minds , however .
I would limit such consideration to those beings capable not just of abstract reasoning , but of ethical reasoning .
If they cannot reason about right and wrong , they have no more ethical significance than a pet .
Surely , we should not be cruel to our pets , but that does n’t mean that killing one is worthy of the appellation “ murder ” .
A fair number of humans do n’t even meet such criteria for ethical significance , though , as an accident of birth or later acquired defect , thus making mine an unpopular set of criteria .
A while back , I remember an occasion where a friend and I debated the matter of whether any animals might meet the criteria of ethical significance .
Considering I have a stricter set of criteria for ethical significance than most , it might seem surprising that in this discussion I was the one suggesting that a nonhuman species has shown strong evidence of such ethical significance .
In particular , I argued that while dogs ( for instance ) have only shown , first , signs of evolutionary development of pack behaviors , and second , that they are trainable , dolphins have exhibited behaviors that seem strongly indicative of making decisions on ethical grounds .
The friend — I ’ll call him “ Justin ” for purposes of this discussion , since he is n’t online often enough for me to ask his permission to “ out ” him as the other party in the discussion — disagreed that any observed dolphin behavior really provided a convincing case for ethical reasoning .
It was a long time ago , so I do n’t really recall for sure , but I think Justin may have disagreed with me on the subject of what constitutes ethical significance , too ; I think he found it strange that I ’d exempt a sufficiently mentally limited ( but still nominally functional ) human from ethical significance .
The kinds of behaviors to which I referred in my arguments included acts of obvious , wanton cruelty , and apparent vindictiveness , neither of which really seemed to derive from any evolutionary benefit other than perhaps intelligence .
That alone is not enough , however .
Coupled with that was the fact that many cases of dolphins choosing to risk themselves to preserve the life of a human , particularly a child , have been documented .
They have also been known to disagree on such matters , just as humans do on whether dolphins should be preserved from the dangers of tuna nets .
Alas , I do n’t have any links for such instances right now , in part because I have n’t found the earlier online discussions I ’ve had on this subject .
All of this came to mind today when I stumbled across an article in Science Daily , Evidence Points To Conscious ‘ Metacognition ’
In Some Nonhuman Animals .
The term “ metacognition ” refers to not just abstract reasoning , but reasoning so abstract that it encompasses reasoning about the act of reasoning .
From the article :
[ J. David ]
Smith recounts the original animal - metacognition experiment with Natua the dolphin .
“ When uncertain , the dolphin clearly hesitated and wavered between his two possible responses , ” he says , “ but when certain , he swam toward his chosen response so fast that his bow wave would soak the researchers ’ electronic switches .
This description of a dolphin ’s behavior shows some sign that it was considering the relevance and trustworthiness of its own thoughts in determining a correct answer .
I recognize that behavior in myself from time to time , such as when I ’m driving and pull up to a stoplight , considering whether I should get in the turn lane at this intersection or go straight and turn at the next intersection when my destination is further down a parallel street .
As long as I do n’t have another car behind me that I would hold up unnecessarily , I might let off the accelerator and coast forward , giving me more time to decide on a course of action , and find myself questioning my own reasoning .
Smith explains that metacognition is a sophisticated human capacity linked to hierarchical structure in the mind ( because the metacognitive executive control processes oversee lower - level cognition ) , to self - awareness ( because uncertainty and doubt feel so personal and subjective ) and to declarative consciousness ( because humans are conscious of their states of knowing and can declare them to others ) .
Doctor Smith understates the importance of this kind of research :
In fact , he concludes , “ Metacognition rivals language and tool use in its potential to establish important continuities or discontinuities between human and animal minds . ”
It is much more important than that , at least for me , because it draws much closer to definitively proving a case for calling the unnecessary killing of a dolphin “ murder ” , rather than simply an unjustified act of callousness .
In somewhat unrelated news , it seems that Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor may be showing evidence of ethical reasoning , too !
I find this even more surprising .
I had initially thought her merely well - trained by societal pressures .
Of course , it ’s still possible this is just a particularly extreme form of far - leftist trained behavior , but it ’s still encouraging .
( Thanks to medullaoblongata for pointing out the Sotomayor article , and to a long - ago Chipping the Web for the tool - using dolphins article . )
Following his speech to the United Nations on Thursday , Venezuela President Hugo Chavez was confronted with questions by a Fox News reporter .
Speaking through a translator , his comments were almost predictably derisive as he called the network filled with “ poisons , ” suggesting the reporter ’s mind “ has many confusions . ”
Prior to airing the clip of Chavez ’s remarks , Fox and Friends host Gretchen Carlson noted his comments about the UN chamber smelling different now that George W. Bush is no longer president of the United States .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ He says the room has a different aroma this time around , ” Carlson began .
“ It has a little bit more hope . ”
In the clip , when Chavez ’s interpreter identified the Fox News reporter , it was as though the Venezuelan president ’s eyes lit up .
“ Fox News ? Oh … ” Chavez said , lips slowly rising into a smile as two fingers stroked his chin .
He began speaking in Spanish .
“ I love when I see people from Fox News , ” his translator said .
“ You know how [ inaudible ] call you ?
‘ The stupid people from Fox News . ’
That ’s the way they call you .
Not you , of course , not you .
Of course not .
[ Inaudible ] is , uh , deficious .
Your mind has many confusions , perhaps poisons . ”
Asked for a response to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s apparent denial of the Holocaust , Chavez asked several questions of his own .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Have you seen the images in Iraq ? ” he asked .
“ How the Americans are killing people in Iraq ?
Have you seen those ?
Have you seen this ?
[ Inaudible ] …
Your network hides everything and your president , Bush , [ you ] supported Bush and you ’re criticizing Obama because he ’s black .
So , that ’s why your mind is filled with poison . ”
After the clip , Fox News host Steve Doocy defended the network , claiming they show “ both sides of the story . ”
“ If we did n’t have both sides of the story , would we have just run that ?
Absolutely not , ” he suggested .

Then Doocy took aim at Chavez over Venezuela ’s roundly - criticized shutdown of what is apparently opposition media .
Many in Venezuela and around the world have called the government takeovers of numerous radio and TV stations an assault on free speech .

“ He would love to pull the plug on Fox News , ” the host said .
“ But , he ’s there and we ’re here . ”

PET project : ( From left ) DVC Prof Danie Visser , Prof Jean - Paul Franzidis , and students Jean - Gabriel Hartmann and Matthew Bickel were among those who attended the launch of UCT 's new particle - tracking facility , PEPT Cape Town .
Here the group takes a look at the facility 's converted PET scanner - said to be the most sensitive in the world - that will be used to track the particles .
The world 's second positron emission particle tracking facility , PEPT Cape Town , has opened at the iThemba LABS national cyclotron centre near Faure .
The facility was set up by Professor Andy Buffler and Dr Indresan Govender of UCT 's Department of Physics .
The decision to situate it at iThemba LABS was driven by the regular availability of radioisotopes produced by the Radionuclide Production Department .
The facility received a major leg - up last year when the world 's most sensitive positron emission tomography ( PET ) scanner , the ECAD EXACT3D , was donated to UCT by Professor Jan Cilliers of Imperial College , London .
In April this year the camera was decommissioned at Hammersmith Hospital in London , where it had been used for PET research for over a decade .
The new laboratory at iThemba LABS is the world 's second operational facility after the Positron Imaging Centre at the University of Birmingham .
It will be available for multi-disciplinary research by local and international scientists .
Current UCT PEPT projects include research in physics , engineering and medicine .
Seed funding for PEPT Cape Town was provided by the National Research Foundation , UCT ( the Centre for Minerals Research , the Minerals to Metals Initiative and the UCT Equipment Committee ) , Imperial College in London , and the Centre for Sustainable Resource Processing in Australia .
In addition , Anglo Platinum and Xstrata are funding UCT - lead PEPT research at the Positron Imaging Centre at the University of Birmingham .
PEPT is based on the tracking of a single tracer particle which has been labelled with a radionuclide .
This provides the basis for a technique for the characterisation and visualisation of particulate flow within aggressive industrial environments .
These include tumbling mills , flotation cells and powder mixers .
PEPT is currently the only non-invasive technique capable of mapping the in - situ flow fields in robust industrial systems to the level of detail that is demanded for mechanistic modelling .
I wrote yesterday that I did not like how this was going down and I do n't .
We need to show up to these meetings .
We do n't have to act like them , but we need to be there for support .
The media is doing a piss poor ass job in local coverage .
What we are seeing is independent bloggers , etc. , taking their footage and passing it along .
We do n't get the FULL STORY , because we are getting an edited version .
Rep. Lloyd Doggett ( D - TX ) , whose health care town hall Saturday turned into a " mob scene " of shouting protesters , just summed up this whole thing .
CNN anchor Rick Sanchez asked Doggett why , if public opinion polls are split down the middle , we 're only hearing from opponents .
I 'll tell you , unless more Americans who are suffering under the insurance companies get out there and express their opinion , write their letter to the editor , call these talk shows -- if they do n't get their message out the insurance companies will win in September and we just cannot let that happen .
This is what it is about .
If we do n't let our voices be heard , the orchestrated chaos will continue and health care reform will lose .
Here is House Leader Steny Hoyer getting a " busta move " from the teabaggers :
" You 're lying to me , " said " Patriots " ringleader Don Jeror -- who previously organized the area Tea Party back in April , interestingly -- interrupting Hoyer .
" Just because I do n't have sophisticated language , I can recognize a liar when I see one . "
Jeror also declared : " Why would you guys try to stuff a health care bill down our throats in three to four weeks , when the President took six months to pick a dog for his kids ? ! "
And these groups are being bused in by " K " Street :
The DNC is out with a stinging rebuke of the tea party protesters who are disrupting health care town hall events hosted by Democratic members of Congress .
" The Republicans and their allied groups - desperate after losing two consecutive elections and every major policy fight on Capitol Hill - are inciting angry mobs of a small number of rabid right wing extremists funded by K Street Lobbyists to disrupt thoughtful discussions about the future of health care in America taking place in Congressional Districts across the country , " says DNC spokesman Brad Woodhouse .
Here is a list of places the teabaggers are targeting and also more town hall meeting information here .
These are our congress critters .
As much as we may be angry with them for some things , they need our support to do the right thing and pass health care with a STRONG public option .
We need to show up .
If we languish , do n't take this seriously , do you honestly think we will get health care reform passed ?
Please , wake up and think again .
And teabaggers at Senator Dodd 's town hall meeting .
These nutjobs even had NERVE to make fun of Dodd 's cancer , pathetic :

This Week With Barack Obama
( CNN ) -- Rowaida Abdelaziz does n't want your pity .
Rowaida Abdelaziz says wearing the hijab sometimes interferes with usual U.S. teenager activities , but that it 's worth it to her faith .
She does n't want your frosty public stares ; the whispers behind her back ; the lament that she 's been degraded by her father .
What the Muslim high school senior wants you to understand is that she does n't wear the hijab , the head scarf worn by Muslim women , because she is submissive .
" It represents beauty to me , " says Abdelaziz , the 17 - year - old daughter of two Egyptian parents living in Old Bridge , New Jersey .
" My mom says a girl is like a jewel , " Abdelaziz says .
" When you have something precious , you usually hide it .
You want to make sure you keep it safe until that treasure is ready to be found . "
The nation has heard plenty of debate over racial profiling .
But there 's a form of religious profiling that some young Muslim women in America say they endure whenever they voluntarily wear the hijab .
The hijab , also known as the veil , is the headscarf worn by Muslim women around the globe .
It 's a simple piece of cloth , but it can place young Muslim women in Western countries in difficult situations .
Some hijab - wearers say that strangers treat them as if they 're terrorists .
Others ask them if they 're a nun -- or even allergic to the sun .
In some cases , their worst critics are not Americans , but fellow Muslim Americans .
The pressure on Muslim teenagers in the U.S. who wear the hijab may be even more acute .
Their challenge :
How do I fit in when I wear something that makes me stand out ?
Randa Abdel - Fattah , who has written two novels about this question , says wearing the hijab can " exhaust " some young Muslim women in the West .
" You can sometimes feel like you 're in a zoo : locked in the cage of other people 's stereotypes , prejudices and judgments , on parade to be analyzed , deconstructed and reconstructed , " says Abdel - Fattah , a Muslim who has Palestinian and Egyptian parents but was born in Australia .
Abdel - Fattah says people should not assume that Muslim women who wear the hijab are being controlled by men .
She , too , struggled with the choice of wearing a hijab when she was a teenager .
" When it comes to the hijab -- why to wear it , whether to wear it , how to wear it -- there is theology and then there is practice and there is huge diversity in both , " says Abdel - Fattah , author of " Does My Head Look Big in This ? "
The surprising history behind the hijab
Some women say the hijab makes them feel like they 're locked in a cage .
But others say it leads to personal freedom .
Sarah Hekmati first wore the hijab at age 15 growing up in Detroit , Michigan .
She is the daughter of Iranian parents who left Iran in 1979 during the Islamic revolution .
Hekmati says the hijab liberated her from some teenage angst :
Does my hair look good ?
Am I cute enough ?
Should I lose weight ?
" It gave me a sense of identity , " she says .
" I really liked the purpose behind the hijab -- a woman covering herself so that a man should know her for her mind , not her body . "
That purpose can be traced back to the Quran , Islam 's holy text , which encourages women to dress modestly , says Faegheh Shirazi , author of " The Veil Unveiled . "
Some Muslims take the Quran 's advice as a command for women to wear the hijab , while others disagree , she says .
" The Quran is very ambiguous about whether you have to wear the veil or not , " Shirazi says .
The hijab , however , actually predates Islam , Shirazi explains .
The first known reference to veiling ( Shirazi uses the term hijab and veil interchangeably ) was made in an Assyrian legal text in the 13th century B.C. , Shirazi says .
In the Assyrian , and later , the Roman and Byzantine empires , the veil was a symbol of prestige and status , she says .
By the 12th century , the veil had been imposed on women in the Muslim world to exclude them from public life , Shirazi says .
" A sign of distinction had been transformed into a sign of exclusion , " she writes in her book .
People are still debating the meaning of the hijab today .
In 2007 , British Muslim groups protested when schools were given the right to ban students from wearing full - face veils .
In 2008 , Turkey 's top court upheld a ban on wearing Muslim headscarves at the country 's universities .
That same year , a Muslim woman was briefly jailed at a suburban Atlanta , Georgia , courthouse after refusing to remove her hijab in court .
Some moms against hijab wearing
The debate over the hijab can literally hit home for some young Muslim women .
Those that wear the hijab in the United States can befuddle their mothers , who often immigrated to the West so they could be free from wearing the hijab and other rules imposed on women .
That 's what happened to Hekmati , the Muslim - American from Detroit .
Her mother , Behnaz , was puzzled by her daughter 's decision to wear the hijab .
Behnaz Hekmati grew up in Iran , where she did not wear the hijab .
Young women who attended college in Iran like she did generally did n't wear the hijab , she says .
Behnaz Hekmati warned her daughter that wearing the hijab would arouse the suspicion of Americans .
" I said Sarah , when you cover your head here the people think you are political -- they see you differently , " Behnaz Hekmati says .
Most of the trouble , though , came from Iranian - Americans , who came to the United States to escape the Islamic fundamentalists who seized power in 1979 , she says .
" The Iranians here bother her more than Americans , " Behnaz Hekmati says .
" They say , ' We got rid of you guys .
We came here because we did n't want to see you guys anymore . ' "
Hekmati was more concerned as a teenager about more personal issues , like her relations with boys .
The hijab made it more difficult , she says .
Few asked her on dates .
Guys always seemed to put her in the " friend category . "
She wondered if she was attractive .
" I wondered at times : Am I always going to be a guy 's friend and nothing more . "
Strangers in public saw her as something else -- a subjugated woman .
They looked at her with pity , she says .
Some were just baffled .
" One guy asked me if I was allergic to the sun , " Hekmati says .
Abdelaziz , the New Jersey high school senior , also had her tense public encounters : angry looks , people feeling sorry for her or assuming her father ordered her to wear the hijab .
" It 's not oppression ; it 's not that I 'm accepting degradation -- it 's about self - respect , " she says .
But it 's more about faith as well .
She says the hijab affirms " Islam in the most respectful and purified way . "
" When you actually wear it , it opens your eyes , " she says .
" It makes you want to explore your religious faith . "
At times , Abdelaziz says she wonders what it would be like to attend her prom , get a tan at the beach and have a boyfriend .
But she says her decision to honor her faith is already paying off .
" It really feels good , " she says .
" It felt like I was missing something and now I 'm complete .
I finally understand my purpose . "
Why Is Phone Fidelity So Poor ?
I am not the first to say this and surely I will not be the last , but : is n’t it strange that with all the technological improvements in our lives in the past few decades , the audio fidelity of so many of our phone calls is so abysmal ?
I do n’t use the phone all that much — in part because in many cases it ’s less convenient than e-mail , but also because , I ’ve realized lately , poor audio quality is a strong disincentive .
Nearly every call I make or receive has at least one person on a cell phone or cordless phone , and probably 60 percent are between two cell phones .
The quality of most cell - phone calls beats the tin - can - and - string setup that kids used to play with , but only marginally .
My home phone , a cordless Uniden on a digital phone network provided by Time Warner , offers better baseline quality than my cell phone but a steady diet of distortion , dropouts , and even dropped calls .
The other day , I happened to have a conversation on a real land line with another person on another real land line and I was shocked : I could actually hear .
It was the first really good phone conversation I ’ve had in about three years .
The convenience of cell phones and even cordless home phones is gigantic .
But the audio fidelity is so poor as to make me wonder if :

Update : a very small sunspot group of two specks formed on the sun in the final hours of the month Monday according to NOAA SWPC , their monthly sunspot number will be positive ( though very small - likely 0.2 or 0.3 , the lowest of this solar minimum but not a zero month ) .
SIDC in Belgium , the official source said 28 observatories did not see a countable spot and had a preliminary 0 number for the month ( here ) .
Sunday , August 30th marked the 51st straight day without a sunspot , one of the longest stretches in a century .
One more day and we would have had a spotless month but like last August some observatories saw a spot on the sun for a few hours one day .
It would have been either the first or second spotless month since 1913 depending on whether you count last August as spotless .
It is unclear whether such small specks would have been seen in 1913 .
In fact it rises into 4th place among all spotless periods since 1849 ( first table here ) .
Note :
It is 5th place if you accept a spotless August 2008 which would have led to a stretch of 52 days .
The total number of spotless days this transition from cycle 23 to 24 is now 704 , exceeding the number for cycle 15 in the early 1900s ( below , enlarged here ) .
We have had 193 spotless days this year ( 79 % of the days ) .
We are in the top 20 years in 16th place .
We will very likely rapidly rise up the list in upcoming weeks and rival 2008 ’s 266 days and likely end in the top 5 years .
2007 , 2008 , 2009 will only have 1911 , 1912 , 1913 in the top 20 as string of 3 per transition ( below , enlarged here ) .
The cycle minimum probably was December , 2008 .
January 2009 ’s 13 month average came up a bit due to slight bump in activity in June and July but if August should end up sunspotless and September low , we could have a double bottom .
Still , the 12.7 years assuming December 2008 was longest in two centuries ( below , enlarged here ) .
Only cycles 4 ( peaking in 1788 ) and 6 ( peaking in 1816 ) were longer than cycle 23 ( which peaked in 2000 ) .
You can see on this chart , by 13 years after the solar minimum year , most of the last 5 cycles already had recovered , in one case already to the solar max of the subseuent cycle ( below , enlarged here ) .
This cycle has continued to decline in the solar irradiance , solar flux , sunspot number and geomagnetic activity after 10 years .
On the following chart produced by Anthony Watts , you can see the Total Solar Irradiance declining whereas the prior cycle was rebounding ( below , enlarged here ) .
Also see the daily TSI which goes through short term cycles at the lowest point of the last few months as of the last plotted measurement .
Clilverd et al 2006 suggests using a statistical analysis of the various cycles ( 11 , 22 , 53 , 88 , 105 , 213 , and 426 years ) shows the next two cycles will likely be very quiet much like those of 200 years ago in the early 1800s , the so called Dalton Minimum , the time of Dickens ( with snows and cold in London like last winter ) ( below , enlarged here ) .
See what David Archibald shows what the result might be if Clilverd is correct here .
Some have not ruled out an even stronger Maunder like Minimum .

La présence d'une force armée et progressivement militarisée dans nos rues et sur nos routes n'est pas destinée à nous protéger .
Les policiers ont appris que le crime paye très bien et ils n’hésitent jamais à substituer leurs intérêts personnels à ceux du public qu’ils ont pourtant juré de servir .
Sans parole et sans honneur , ils n’admettent jamais leurs crimes , se croyant au - dessus des lois et méprisant le public qu’ils sont pourtant théoriquement chargés de protéger .
La police existe pour s’assurer que tu gardes ta gueule bien fermée et que tu n'oses surtout jamais remettre en question le statu quo qui place la quasi totalité des pouvoirs entre les mains d’une micro-minorité .
For this generation of students to remain competitive with their international peers as adults , they need to start spending more time in school .
This week President Obama proposed that American school children extend their time in class , either by lengthening the school day , or spending less time on summer vacation .
“ We can no longer afford an academic calendar designed when America was a nation of farmers who needed their children at home plowing the land at the end of each day , ” Obama said .
He continued to say “ That calendar may have once made sense , but today , it puts us at a competitive disadvantage .
Our children spend over a month less in school than children in South Korea .
That is no way to prepare them for a 21st century economy . ”
In fact , American children spend the least amount time in the classroom when compared to other countries .
Currently , the school year length in the States is 180 days .
Advocates are pushing further toward a 200 - day school year , which would align with Thailand , Scotland and the Netherlands , and leave us a close second with Israel , South Korea and Japan , who leads with a 243 - day school year .
This comes as Obama makes it very clear that education is on his hot - list of priorities .
He admits the notion of spending more time in school is not “ wildly popular ” , but necessary .
He was applauded for his breadth of knowledge regarding the public education system in the U.S.
He cited that one - third of the 13 - and 14 - year - olds in our country cannot read at an appropriate level for their age , and that the eighth grade curriculum is two years behind competing nations .
He says the part of the problem is our “ race to the bottom ” mindset , wherein states are comfortable with lower standards for students .
Obama and his Secretary of Education Arne Duncan are truly advocates for a superior education system than that we ’ve previously and currently known .
It ’s imperative that states use the stimulus package money to rebuild curriculum , increase teacher pay , improve school conditions , offer newer technologies to students and even extend the school year to ensure that this generation can not only keep up with their international peers , but even surpass them in the professional environment of the coming decades .

" Conyers , Nadler Applaud DoJ Appointment of ' Relentless ' Special Prosecutor for Torture Probe "

I have several reservations : 1 . I question whether an investigation is truly independent when a current DOJ employee is selected to be a special prosecutor .
2 . If the investigation is limited to instances , such as threats to execute , that exceeded the abominable OLC torture memos , the impact will be worse than no prosecutions .
It 's let 's prosecute " the bad apples " as we saw with Abu Ghraib .
3 . The Bybee / Yoo memos should not provide a legal standard by which we determine whether to prosecute .
To the contrary , those memos should furnish the basis for prosecution of their authors and prosecution ofthose ( Cheney / Addington ) under whose direction the torture memos were prepared .
4 . I 'd have been far more impressed with the Conyers / Nadler press release if they had added , and , oh , by the way , we 're filing articles of impeachment against Judge Bybee .
While it is helpful to call on the DOJ to appoint " special counsel to review the entire interrogation program to determine if any crimes were committed , " the truth is that both Conyers and Nadler are in a position to expedite matters by filing articles of impeachment against Bybee .
Why have they not done so ?

sibel speaks :
And then I fulfilled my obligation , as a former FBI contractor who has signed various non-disclosure agreements , to inform the FBI and the Department of Justice that I have been requested to provide my testimony and I am supposed to let you know .
They had a day or so to respond .
They passed the deadline .
And after the deadline , they came back with some whimsical unconstitutional warning saying that under the non-disclose agreement , the FBI and the Department of Justice needed 30 days to review what I was about to testify .
I had the attorneys check that and it turned out this is not legal , because oral testimony cannot be submitted — you do n’t know what is going to be asked in court .
Therefore , the warning they gave me was unconstitutional and not legal .
They did n’t have any legal grounds to stop me from testifying , so I went and , under oath , during this five - hour long deposition , answered all the questions , and talked about everything I knew that had to do with Congressional corruption cases that involved various Turkish entities .

In announcing the appointment of this Republican prosecutor , Holder stated : “ I have made it clear in the past that the Department of Justice will not prosecute anyone who acted in good faith and within the scope of the legal guidance given by the Office of Legal Counsel regarding the interrogation of detainees .
I want to reiterate that point today , and to underscore the fact that this preliminary review will not focus on those individuals . ”
Scott Horton observes , as I have previously , that the decision to torture predated the torture memos .
" These memos were solicited and written as get - out - of - jail cards to get CIA interrogators , at least some of whom raised concerns about the legality of what was being done , to use the new techniques . "
So tell me something , Mr. Holder , how can memos that were prepared as a bad faith , after - the - fact rationalization be relied upon in good faith ?
Why did you not release the OLC report which slams the deficiencies of these legal sophistries you now rely upon to evade accountability ?
Obama and Holder are violating their oath of office --- to faithfully execute the law .
It seems that , like the public option , campaign promises to restore the rule of law were nothing more than hot air .

Well , and it also assumes that one can torture in good faith , and , unless you happen to be a machine , I do n't think it 's possible to make a case for that ... even if you did not torture until the boss gave you some bogus legal opinion to make it seem to the weak - minded that you were torturing in good faith .

And , so , Ernie , you are 100 % correct .
Obama and Holder have been and still are carrying on with the un-Constitutional policies of the last administration , and in breach of their oaths .
The only sign of " good faith " lurking in this mess is if you read it that there were no good faith actors in the torturing and that all those involved , thereby , will end up being prosecuted through this little maneuver ... if Durham will make so bold as to take the heat off of them with such a flagrant observance of The Rule of Law .

You can no longer apply the New World Order - Military Industrial Congressional Complex brainwashed model of logic to this sham of Democracy and called the US Federal government and expect a different result .
All the corrupted gov agencies , departments , and branches that are completely controlled by these super rich US elite lying anti-enviro bastard self serving rulers will cuntinue to protect themselves and their interests to the best of their ability .

I re-read my last colorful post and want to make clear that I am not trying to insult anyone at Bradblog .
On the contrary , I actually love this website , the intellectual exchange of information , and the tireless work of Brad and others following our broken system of US elections etc .
I have been studying what is going on for sometime now and will do anything to wake people up less becoming a politicians with a target on my head to help lead the mislead US majority who generally grasp at straws at the end of the day about what to do .
An American majority must understood that their sheer numbers could cause a change effective almost immediately that could correct this ugly world scenary imposed by these 5 % elites .
Unfortunately , most Americans are not nearly up to speed , trapped in their own debt enslavement trying to get by , or their own personal twisted rationalization how this does n't effect them to even conceptualize what needs to be done .
However , I really believe many at Bradblog have their eye on the ball .
Even if the necessary revolutionary dots are not yet connected to end the rule of these New World Order Imperialist oil - coal barons , bankers , and defense contractors that run our country and control the US military yet , I think Bradbloggers can join together in the light of truth .

Grizzly Bear Dancer ... Your two comments are sadly spot on , just as Ernest 's and 99's are .
I do however believe in a universal , karmic force that handles unjust situations such as this country is experiencing .
That 's where I place my optimism .
I appeal to that karmic reciprocating force daily in my actions and thoughts and I see it at work .
I hope , albeit far fetched that Holder and the DOJ are compelled to fully prosecute to the highest degree ... all the way into the Whitehouse .
I hope they 're compelled by the force of our thoughts and the force of Justice in the universe .
It 's a longshot ... but surely possible from where I sit .
This torture prosecution is out of our hands ( as if we ever had a say in the first place ) .
Personally it is too depressing to concede victory to the lying , thieving oligarchy of fat cat pimps .
We 're still in the game as it were ... although it 's late in the 4th quarter and we 're losing bigtime .
I 'm not investing a lot of emotional energy in these prosecutions ... I am however holding out hope that Bush - Cheney - Rumsfeld , Yoo , Gonzo and all of the knowing crooks , will sit at the table of karma to dine on the pile of shit they 've dealt .
There is responsiblity in the universe ..

You 're getting warmer , Karen !
Keep looking - the CIA is but one tendril of the Medusa that has the US , and dangerously , nearly the rest of the world too , in its fetid grasp .
It 's gonna take a Steven Kingian effort to excise this horrid tumor from our society .
I fear we 're going to have to destroy the village in order to save it .
I hate to say it , but it appears that the BAD GUYS have won , and they 'll soon have their way by ending life on this planet as we know it .
Oh well ...

Yeh these bastards are insulated beyond belief .
Why do you think Bush , Cheney , Rove , Rumsfeld , Rice and all the other fcking Bushit Administration criminals are still free to live , work , and openly offer their opinions nationally throughout the channels of the corporate US media they control ?
THEY HAVE NO CONCERN .
The Obama Administration is their people .
The Military Industrial CONGRESSIONAL
Complex , a named coined by a 5 star WWII general turn President named Dwight D. Eisenhower coined the phase in his concerns of what he saw developing as a US industrial arms war machine .
He expressed that he foresaw that a combination of greed and unfit individuals would carelessly lead the US into war , abuse US war powers , and take control of our nation LEFT UNCHECKED .
Now we have this big money corporate military sellout Congress after the cover -up of the Pentagon war event bombings known as 9 - 11 to authorize the extradinary amounts of money , arms , and waging of illegal wars .
Could anyone ever imagine how much cash is still being pumped into promoting the muslim terrorist lies of the 3 World Trade Center bombings ?
Military high - tech nanothermite cutter charges that left their signature on steel samples has been positively identified in a peer reviewed paper but what corporate US mass media has this been published in ?
Silence of course .
Learn the truth at ARCHITECTS AND ENGINEERS FOR 9 - 11 TRUTH .
www.ae911truth.org
The greedy loser criminal bankers at the Federal Reserve cannot and will not ever be held accountable by an UNDERDOG ( fictional cartoon character ) even if this said person existed because it is not a government entity no more than the unaccountable BLACKWATER merchant killers ( not apart of the US military ) in Afganistan .
But the Afgan heroin trade is grow 'in !!!
That 's who runs our money system , prints US dollars all at their cost and of course legally taxes the US people .
These unregulated uknown bankers are the big money deciders of the corporation known and in turn the fascist sphere of influence on the world .
They must be stripped of this power with safeguards to never be able to exert their control on the country of the United States .

Grizzly Bear Dancer said : f ( YOU ) anyone with a 5th grade education and average intelligence thinks these loser criminals are going to implicate themselves ...

But Cheney has already implicated himself .
He has repeatedly stated publicly that he authorized water boarding .
He 's brazen about it precisely because he knows Obama / Holder lack the scroats to prosecute him .

Thank you for taking my words to task .
What I actually meant was not that these insulated New World Order lying criminal murderers like fomer Haliburton contractor head turn VP Dick Cheney would not ever admit their guilt for any of their treasonous illegal acts , BUT that this U.S. ruling class HAS NOT ever faced prosecution let alone conviction and sentencing in a U.S. or World court .
While Architects and Engineers at www.ae911truth.org have not and do not speculate on who is responsible for taking down the 3 World Trade Towers buildings bombed on 9 - 11 or the orchestrated US corporate mass media cover up in conjuction with the government , they do provide the many levels of evidence to support controlled demolition .
They also provide closed case evidence for the use of high tech miilitary thermate cutter charges .
I personally have no problem implying the Bushit Administration was resposible for the deaths of Americans by taking down the World Towers on 9 - 11 to get Americans and world people behind their " war on terror " campaign because I know all about these greedy fcking killers .
These Illuminati New World Order anti-environmentalists have n't gone down for their staged false flag miitary attack and the truth is not even the commonly accepted story .
They have remain in control of the U.S. along with their new puppet president in place .
In 2009 , the Military Industrial Congressional Complex is sitting tall and all the other governmemt 's corrupted agencies have " their " people in place so it could look better .
The only positive point I can add today is that I like Blue Hawk in his post agree that KARMA CAN BE A REAL BITCH .
I can also admit that I have sent out prayers to the spirits of those who died on 9 - 11 and call on them to help expose these traitors and so can you .

I watched in horrified awe as the traitors to America used patriotism to herd the sheep for the slaughter ....
And our fear fed , unthinking population swallowed that force fed fear whole .
We were sold a fear based world view ; by chicken hearted greedy bastards who traded us out for filthy lucre .
It 's been said that " We get the government we deserve " .
Well it 's here , we deserve it .
For those of us who are awakened and want better , I truly do n't know what the next step is .
There is a great wall of ignorance that most folks cling to with a passion ... I have no idea how to surmount that .
Places like Bradblog keep us informed ... but too many people do n't want to know .

Hacker Attack Documentary
Tweet Description :
This is a very old ( so old its in black and white :) )
Discovery Channel documentary which traces through the early hacking scene , highlights include - phreaking , interview with Phiber Optic , early credit card number generators , identity theft using social security numbers , the 2600 club , early penetration testing and interview with a couple of ethical hackers , cloning of cellular phones and demonstration of early reconnaissance and hacking techniques such as using the finger daemon , rlogin , rsh , brute force password cracking etc .
Its a bit slow , but definitely a good one time watch .

The Iraqi man who threw his shoes at former US President George W Bush has been released from custody after nine months in a Baghdad jail .
Muntadar al - Zaidi's act of protest last December made him a hero in large parts of the Arab world and beyond .
Zaidi was convicted of assaulting a foreign leader and was sentenced to three years in jail - later reduced to 12 months after an appeal .
He said he was tortured by government officials while he was imprisoned .
The BBC's Hugh Sykes , in Baghdad , says although Zaidi became a hero to many , large numbers of Iraqis think his actions were unforgivably rude .
' Goodbye kiss ' Zaidi 's family has been preparing to hold a party for him , saying he has received offers of money , jobs and even marriage from sympathisers across the Arab world .
MUNTADAR AL - ZAIDI
Worked for Egypt - based broadcaster since 2005 Was kidnapped by gunmen while reporting in Baghdad in 2007 Detained by US troops for a night in 2008 , his brother says , before they freed him and apologised
In pictures : Fashion of shoe - ing
In the shoe thrower 's footsteps Profile : Shoe - throwing reporter
His family claims he was even offered a golden horse by the Emir of Qatar .
His action was also celebrated in internet games and on T - shirts .
He was meant to be released on Monday , but red - tape meant he had to spend another day in jail .
When news of his release filtered through to his family 's home in Baghdad , there was an eruption of celebration with women dancing and singing .
His brother , Uday , told a crowd of journalists : " Every time Bush turns a new page in his life he will find Muntadar 's shoes waiting for him . "
He said Zaidi still feared for his life and would fly to Greece for medical check - ups .
His family had previously said the reporter was beaten while in prison , suffering a broken arm , broken ribs and internal bleeding .
Those allegations have been rejected by the Iraqi military .
The previously little - known journalist worked for the private Cairo - based al - Baghdadia TV .
As he flung the shoes , Zaidi shouted : " This is a goodbye kiss from the Iraqi people , dog .
This is from the widows , the orphans and those who were killed in Iraq . "
Mr Bush had been giving a joint news conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki , and the incident was seen as hugely embarrassing for both men .
But in an interview afterwards , Mr Bush insisted he did not harbour any ill feeling about it .
" It was amusing - I 've seen a lot of weird things during my presidency , and this may rank up there as one of the weirdest , " he said .

The Federal Government has unveiled plans to toughen its counter - terrorism laws , including a change to allow police to break into a suspect 's home without getting approval from a judge .
It also wants to make it easier to stop suspects getting out of jail on bail .
But the Government is planning to put a cap on the amount of time suspects can be held without charge .
Attorney - General Robert McClelland says the tougher laws would protect Australians .
" The Government is committed to ensuring the focus of Australia 's national security and counter - terrorism laws remains on preventing a terrorist attack from occurring in the first place , " he said .
But some argue toughening the laws would have the opposite effect .
Nicola McGarrity from the Terrorism Law Project at the University of New South Wales says the laws could take away the protection of the judiciary .
" It 's fundamentally undermining the safeguards that exist , " she said .
" It 's taking away the protection of having a judicial officer make a warrant . "
But new limits will be imposed on other controversial powers .
In the case of Dr Mohammed Haneef , who was detained in 2007 , police were allowed to question him without charging him for a total of one day .
The clock stops ticking , however , when the suspect goes to sleep or the police need time to check with agencies overseas .
In the end , Dr Haneef was held for 12 days without charge before a magistrate ordered his release .
So Mr McClelland says the Government is planning to introduce an eight - day limit .
" To enable the law enforcement authorities to have that time and balance it against the rights of individuals - that we would hope our society cherishes - and that is the right not to be detained without charge , " he said .
But legal analysts , including Ms McGarrity , argue that eight days is still too much time and that the detainment period should be capped at three days .
" What normally happens with police is they exercise those powers up to the extent of those powers , " she said .
The Government also wants to press ahead with controversial plans to make it a crime to urge attacks on someone based on their nationality or religion .
The Attorney - General says he has seen intelligence and phone tap logs that back the need for this law .
Mr McClelland says it is the kind of law that could have been used against people involved in attacks on Indian students if nationality , race or religion was the driving force .
Another proposal in the discussion paper released on Wednesday was to make terrorism hoaxes punishable by up to 10 years in prison .
The naming of a terrorist organisation would also stay current for three years , instead of one , before expiring , the paper said .
The public has until September 25 to comment on the discussion paper .
But the Shadow Attorney - General , George Brandis , says he is sceptical about the Government 's level of commitment to national security .
" In the last budget , for example , the Australian Federal Police 's counter - terrorism program was scaled back by $ 1.4 million , " he said .
" The AFP 's intelligence programs were scaled back by $ 3.2 million .
There was a 7 per cent reduction in the staff of the Australian Crime Commission . "
An Australian man will be putting his toilet seat down in the future after discovering a python almost twice his size curled up in the bowl .

Snake wrangler Chris Peberdy was called to a house in rural Virginia near Darwin in far northern Australia after the owner , Erik Rantzau , spotted a 3 - metre - long ( almost 10 feet ) carpet python in his toilet .
Peberdy told Reuters : " It 's not unusual to find snakes of that size in the tropics but you do n't find usually them in toilets .
" He must have come up through a drain .
He was cruising around the house at night and returning to the toilet by day . "
Peberdy said the owner lives on a rural property where snakes are respected , so he left the python alone and used a different bathroom until it could be safely removed .
It took the snake wrangler four trips out to the house to catch the carpet python , which is non-venomous and kills its prey by constriction .
" He was so tightly curled into the pipes that I could not move him but eventually he popped out far enough for me to catch him , " said Peberdy who is called out to catch up to 1,000 snakes a year .
The captured snake was released back into the bush about 2.5 kms ( 1.5 miles ) from the house .
Peberdy had some advice for people living in that area : " Keep the toilet seat down and look before you sit ! "

I took this with my Canon G10 camera .
It is a little heavier than a Nikon or Panasonic , but I always get great results from the photos without having to carry around my heavy DSLR .

Get a Loaf , you certainly need to get a loaf or two .
I 'm no business guru , just a gamer and an industry customer , but I still understand the basics .
By your dumb ass logic , all other business should n't give a f**k what their customers think either .
If you had any business and did n't care about your customers , you would not last very long .
I hope , if you have a car
I 've worked in games retail and seen first hand what happens when things are good and very bad .
If you treat your customers well with intelligence and respect , they are more likely to return .
I can see a sketch coming on :
' Hey all you customers , you are all stupid f**ks .
Guess what , we are going to raise the prices and fleece you some more , because we are n't content getting £ 40 , and our greed knows no bounds . '
Oh yeah , and you know those preowned games the industry is trying to kill , well those we no doubt be on the rise , as people look to get their hit at a decent price .
Piracy would also rise .
I believe in paying a fair price for a game and £ 40 is that price .
Start messing with that , and I 'll just be buying less games and the industry as a whole will loose out .
Damn , imagine paying for Terminator Salvation ( an average to cheese game ) for £ 60 ?
You 'd feel robbed .
Its a shame that from those now in bed with WoW , a game built on the foundations of good community links , would pull this crap , giving us all the finger and saying f**k community and f**k you too .
Just shows how money can corrupt .
I feel sorry for the devs of MW2 , to have such suits spoiling what they 've built .
I have more respect for the likes of Capcom , Atlus and Valve who treat their customers right , and reap the cash rewards .
This is why I buy their games more .
And what do you know , free Left 4 Dead content coming in Sept 09 , that my friend is what I call good customer service .
Some frequently asked questions ( FAQs ) about minimalism and living the minimalist life , for those new to the concept .
Q : Why be a minimalist ?
A : It ’s a way to escape the excesses of the world around us — the excesses of consumerism , material possessions , clutter , having too much to do , too much debt , too many distractions , too much noise .
But too little meaning .
Minimalism is a way of eschewing the non-essential in order to focus on what ’s truly important , what gives our lives meaning , what gives us joy and value .
Q : Is n’t minimalism boring or too sparse , with nothing in your life ?
A : This is a misconception about minimalism — that it ’s necessarily monk - like , empty , boring , sterile .
Not at all .
Well , it can be , if you go in that direction , but I do n’t advocate that flavor of minimalism .
Instead , we are clearing away all but the most essential things — to make room for that which gives us the most joy .
Clear away the distractions so we can create something incredible .
Clear away all the obligations so we can spend time with loved ones .
Clear away the noise so we can concentrate on inner peace , on spirituality ( if we wish ) , on our thinking .
As a result , there is more happiness , peace , and joy , because we ’ve made room for these things .
Q : What is minimalist living ?
A : It ’s simply getting rid of things you do not use or need , leaving an uncluttered , simple environment and an uncluttered , simple life .
It ’s living without an obsession with material things or an obsession with doing everything and doing too much .
It ’s using simple tools , having a simple wardrobe , carrying little and living lightly .
Q : What are the benefits of minimalism ?
A : There are many .
It ’s lower in stress .
It ’s less expensive and less debt .
It ’s less cleaning and maintaining .
It ’s more enjoyable .
There ’s more room for creating , for loved ones , for peace , for doing the things that give you joy .
There ’s more time for getting healthy .
It ’s more sustainable .
It ’s easier to organize .
These are only the start .
Q : What does the schedule of a minimalist look like ?
A : There ’s no single answer to this question , but a minimalist would probably focus on doing less , on having a less cluttered schedule , but what ’s on his or her schedule would be important .
A minimalist might not actually keep a schedule or calendar , at one extreme , if he did n’t have much to do each day — he might instead live and work moment - by - moment , or just decide each morning to focus on one or two important things .
A minimalist would also save a lot of time because of having less clutter and fewer possessions .
That means less time cleaning and maintaining , and less time searching for things .
A minimalist who clears away distractions and single - tasks would also waste less time with those distractions and in switching back and forth between tasks ( multi- tasking ) .
In general , all this results in more time for relaxing , for hobbies , for creating , for doing fun things .
Q : What rules do I need to follow to become minimalist ?
A : There are no set rules .
There ’s no one way .
What I suggest for living minimally is n’t what someone else would recommend , nor is it how you would live your minimalist life .
In general , however , you want to live simply without too many unnecessary possessions , distractions , clutter , or waste .
You want to live frugally , debt - free , sustainably , naturally .
Q : Do you need to be vegan or vegetarian to be minimalist ?
A : No .
While I believe the vegan / vegetarian lifestyle is consistent with minimalism , you can eat simply as an omnivore as well .
Again , there ’s no one way .
A minimalist would try to eat naturally , without too much processing , and not eat too much food ( such as the ridiculous portions at most restaurants these days ) .
Q : I believe in simplifying , but why should I be so frugal — what wrong with a few REALLY nice things ?
A : Frugality is simply a way of not spending on unnecessary things — sticking to the essentials .
Is there anything wrong with a few really nice things ?
Not necessarily .
If you need to buy something , it ’s usually better to go for quality , rather than cheap , because it ’s better made and will last longer .
Minimalism is about quality over quantity .
However … it ’s always good to examine whether it ’s good to have an attachment to material things .
This is n’t something I ’ve completely succeeded with — I love my Mac , for example — but it ’s something I ’ve been working on .
I am much less attached to possessions than I was just a few years ago , and I recommend that everyone examine their relationship with physical things , with products , and see if it ’s really what they want .
Q : What about finding minimalism in America — where you need to have a car and a job ?
A : This whole site is about finding minimalism within the American culture and society — as well as other industrialized nations — not on some remote desert island .
The complexities and social expectations of the United States ( and other industrialized countries ) is exactly why minimalism is needed .
All the advice I give on this site ( and Zen Habits ) is aimed at people in these modern societies .
I ’ve lived a minimalist life on Guam , and now in San Francisco .
It ’s a matter of choices .
Do you need to be as minimalist as me , or someone living in the wilderness ?
Not at all .
It ’s not about that .
It ’s about finding simplicity and finding what ’s important to you , and making choices , rather than adopting the consumerist mindset that most people have .
Q : Are n’t you being contradictory by claiming to be a minimalist and owning a Mac , or a house , or having six kids ?
A : Again , there ’s no one way .
Everyone must find his own path , and mine is different than what someone else would consider minimalist .
Also , I have never claimed to be perfect – I ’m striving for minimalism , but I always have room for improvement .
I have things that are inconsistent with minimalism , or at least by the definition of others .
I ’m working on it .
I should say a word or two about having six kids and minimalism .
Having six children is inconsistent with my message of simplifying , frugality , downsizing , being green .
I do n’t have a defense – but I do have an explanation for the inconsistency .
I had my kids before ( and during ) my change in philosophy .
In fact , my philosophy is evolving even now , so I ca n’t claim to have believed in the things I believe in now , for a very long time .
Many things I believe in are only recent developments .
As an example – only recently , I made the decision to transition back into veganism ( I was vegan once , but have been lacto - ovo veggie for over a year ) .
But I own a pair of leather sandals – do I throw them out ?
Would n’t that be wasteful ?
Is it better to be wasteful but consistent with my beliefs ?
It ’s hard to say .
However , I have decided it would be most unethical for me to throw out my children , just because I now believe in downsizing .
It was a tough decision , but I ’m sticking by it .
As a result of my simplifying , I am able to enjoy my time with my children , and I have to admit , they are the best thing to happen to me .
I do n’t regret having them one bit , even if they are inconsistent with my philosophy of downsizing .
On the good side , I believe that even with six kids — being vegan , buying less stuff , being energy conscious , going car - less , walking more for transportation – I actually use fewer resources than the average person in developed countries ( and far less than the average American ) – this is according to online carbon footprint calculators .
It ’s not a justification for having six kids , but just a note that things are n’t as bad as they could be .
Q : Why do n’t you have a comment button or comments on this site ?
A : I purposely did n’t include comments on this site for a couple of reasons :
1 . I already manage several other blogs , and get a ton of comments at Zen Habits , and having to manage another blog ’s comments is too much for me .
I just do n’t have the time , and if I had to do it , I could n’t do this blog .
2 . I love dialog with readers — it ’s what makes blogging such a joy — but commenting is n’t the only way .
I encourage you to reply to me about any of these posts via Twitter or on your blog .
The dialog then will be less local and more widespread .
3 . I like the idea of keeping things simple on a blog about minimalism .
Q : How is mnmlist.com different than Zen Habits ?
A : Well , Zen Habits is about simplicity , and mnmlist.com is about minimalism — ca n’t you see the difference ?
Seriously , though , there will be a different focus here than at Zen Habits , which covers a wide range of topics besides simplicity , including productivity , changing habits , health & fitness , family , finances , happiness , and yes , simplicity .
This blog will focus pretty much exclusively on minimalism , a passion of mine .
Not all Zen Habits readers are incredibly interested in minimalism , so I ’m breaking off this blog for those who are .
If you have other questions that I should include here , please let me know on Twitter !
Ikea 's corporate structure is insanely complicated .
It is technically owned by a Dutch charitable nonprofit — a strategy that allows the group to pay 3.5 % tax on annual profits of € 553 m .
However , the charity itself appears to do almost no charitable giving .
Most of the money disappears into generic line - items like " other operating charges " which it refuses to explain .
In 2004 , the last year that the INGKA Holding group filed accounts , the company reported profits of € 1.4 billion on sales of € 12.8 billion , a margin of nearly 11 percent .
Because INGKA
Holding is owned by the nonprofit INGKA Foundation , none of this profit is taxed .
The foundation 's nonprofit status also means that the Kamprad family cannot reap these profits directly , but the Kamprads do collect a portion of IKEA sales profits through the franchising relationship between INGKA Holding and Inter IKEA Systems .
Inter IKEA
Systems collected € 631 million of franchise fees in 2004 , but reported pre-tax profits of only € 225 million in 2004 .
One of the major pre-tax expenses that Inter IKEA systems reported was €590 million of " other operating charges . "
IKEA has refused to explain these charges , but Inter IKEA Systems appears to make large payments to I.I.
Holding , another Luxembourg - registered group that , according to The Economist , " is almost certain to be controlled by the Kamprad family . "
I.I . Holding made a profit of €328 million in 2004 .
In 2004 , the Inter IKEA group of companies and I.I .
Holding reported combined profits of € 553 m and paid € 19 m in taxes , or approximately 3.5 percent . [ 22 ]
The Berne Declaration , a non-profit organization in Switzerland that promotes corporate responsibility , has formally criticized IKEA for its tax avoidance strategies .
In 2007 , the Berne Declaration nominated IKEA for one of its Public Eye " awards , " which highlight corporate irresponsibility and are announced during the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland . [ 24 ]
Why is anime viewed negatively in America ?
Why is the American anime industry suffering ?
What can we , as anime fans , do to change things ?
Would we even want to ?
Anime is something that is very much a part of my life , from 5th grade where I spent every morning sitting in my living with a bowl of cereal and watching Sailor Moon to hanging out with my friends last night watching Hayate no Gotoku !.
It is something that I ’m passionate about .
Why ?
Well , having grown up in America , I was very limited in what I was exposed to , simply because America is a country obsessed with political correctness .
Japan however is so different creatively that , to me , anime is refreshing and awe - inspiring .
It ’s a beautiful medium , but unfortunately the bulk of America does not agree with me , either because they tried it and did n’t like it , or simply do not want to give it a try at all .
So , I decided to write an in - depth piece to answer some questions .
Why is anime viewed in such a negative manner without many even being exposed to it at all ?
Why is the industry suffering in America ?
As anime fans , can we do anything to help the genre we love so much ?
Would we even want to deal with the ramifications of having something so precious to us be considered ‘ popular ’ by American standards ?
Whether you ’re an anime fan or not , you might want to stay tuned , there is plenty to learn .
Why is anime viewed negatively in America ?
The truth of the matter is that we humans in general are wary of what we do not understand .
Humans are creatures of habit ; we form routines and stick to them , comforted in the knowledge that we know every part and step of it through and through .
Americans are firm in their beliefs and how they were raised , and that , in my opinion , contributes largely to the anime industry ’s unfavorable reputation , even when most of the country has never even viewed anime , or , in many cases , never even heard of it .
I have broken it down into two topics which I think cover a good bulk of the issue .
Cultural Differences
Any anime fan will tell you that anime is chock - full of references to Japanese history and culture .
American programs are the same way , but because America is such a large and influential nation , a lot of shows , music , and books that we take cultural pieces from are available all over the world .
This is not the case with Japanese shows , music , and books in America , and so a lot of the things you see in anime can seem very confusing at first , especially if you are not familiar with anime or are new to it .
Here are some examples :
Nose Bleeds
Mmm , tasty .

In anime , you may see a man ’s nose start suddenly spewing copious amounts of blood .
It is rumored that the Japanese believe that when a man sees a woman he finds attractive , his heart begins to race faster and starts pumping more blood , resulting in a possible nosebleed .
Whether this is true or not , when you see it in an anime , it means the man in question is seriously aroused .
Seriously .
Head Veins
Oh , he looks pleased .
( Bleach )
The red marks you see above adorning Ichigo ’s head have perplexed many a beginner anime fan .
These marking are actually used to represent blood veins , and their presence on his head is meant to represent a vein about to pop in his head .
In other words , he ’s angry and frustrated .
You ’ll see this a lot in other anime as well .
Here ’s a few more :
A sweat drop hanging off of a character ’s head is an indication that they feel embarrassed , either for themselves or for someone in the area who ’s being an idiot .

Holding up your pinky while talking to someone in an anime means that you are referring to that person ’s significant other .
in an anime means that you are referring to that person ’s significant other .
Those triangular white thingies with the green square on them are in fact food .
It ’s called an onigiri , or rice ball .
The green square on them is actually seaweed , and having one or two of them is considered a traditional on - the - go breakfast in Japan .
Like I said , there are many , many others , but these are just a few of the more common ones .
Because these things are not commonplace to Americans , they can be seen as confusing , and too much confusion will inspire anyone to turn off the television and grab a bottle of aspirin .
I know I have had several people refer to seeing these things and say that it turned them off to anime , and I ’m sure they ’re not the only ones .
The American Cartoon Stigma
Americans tend to view animation as a purely children ’s medium .
I find this very ironic , since shows like The Simpsons , King of the Hill , and Family Guy have been around for years and are very popular .
Do n’t think that America is the first country to create an animated series driven towards adults ; in fact , anime has always mostly been for adults and teenagers .
Any genre of television program or movie you can think of in America , you can find in anime form in Japan .
Here are some great examples of genres and an anime series that fits the criteria .
Sitcom
Naoki and Kotoko : Meant to be !
( Itazura na Kiss )
Itazura na Kiss ( The Mischievous Kiss ) is about a girl , Kotoko , who is rejected by the man she loves , Naoki .
Through certain events , she winds up living with him in his house , and being forced to live side - by - side begins to change the both of them as they prepare to graduate High School and start on their own paths .
This is the perfect example of a sitcom ( which , lets remember , stands for situational comedy ! ) .
Many shows like Friends are based around the drama of friends and enemies living together , and that dynamic has always bred both serious , tender moments and outright hilarious ones .
Itazura na Kiss encompasses all of this .
The only difference is it ’s animated .
Drama
It ’s all a CONSPIRACY !
( Welcome to the NHK )
Welcome to the NHK ( which , by the way , stands for Nippon Hōsō Kyōkai , a major television broadcasting company in Japan ) is a show about a man named Sato , who is a hikikomori ( basically , a slightly agoraphobic recluse ) who comes upon the kindness of a girl who is intent on helping him break out of his ways and gain control of his life back .
This anime is a rather deep drama , exploring the dark sides of every character in the show and exposing how everyone , in some capacity , has a struggle of their own , and that nobody can truly make it through anything by themselves .
While I do n’t think there ’s anything quite like Welcome to the NHK out in America right now , many dramatic shows and movies explore the same set of themes , breaking down the human condition for all to see .
Horror
Sort of like Heroes … if it were written by Stephen King .
( Boogiepop Phantom )
Boogiepop Phantom is the story of an event that happened 5 years ago .
A huge beam of light crashed down , and several murders occurred .
This 12 episode series goes through the perspectives of several people involved in these murders who somehow gained mysterious powers from the beam of light , supposedly given to them by the Death God only known as the Boogiepop .
This story sort of mashes together many of today ’s popular supernatural television shows along with the overly - populated horror movie genre of America .
Again , there ’s nothing exactly like this show in America , but its a combination of several popular genres .
Action
Epic .
That ’s all there really is to say .
( Cowboy Bebop )
Cowboy Bebop is an action story set in space .
Spike and his friends roam around space catching bounties for money , just trying to fill their stomachs .
However , as their pasts catch up to them , we get to see them change and grow , swirling into a shocking and emotional climax that shook the anime world .
This one of the most classic anime series ’ of all time , and a must - watch for any anime fan new or old .
The high - paced action coupled with futuristic technology is reminiscent of some of the most classic American action films of all time .
These are just some examples of shows that are very much like some of America ’s most popular films and programs , they ’re just animated .
Animation is great for these types of things because you can draw things that no amount of special effects could really muster , opening up a ton of creative opportunities .
The fact that such an opportunity is lost on America is one of the saddest things about the bad rap anime has in America .
Why is the American anime industry suffering ?
This is a topic that is probably the most vital to the anime industry .
Like every other business in America nowadays , the anime industry is suffering from lack of money and support .
However , I would like to explore some of the reasons why I think this is , starting with the most important and controversial topic of all .
Downloading and Streaming
What a great idea , right ?
Anime fans can download and stream videos of anime online to check out what ’s new and to test out new anime before they buy it , and its a cheap way to get new people into anime .
So , what could go wrong ?
Simple .
Nobody goes out and buys the damn stuff .
The possibilities listed above are great , but people are either too lazy or greedy to spend their money on the official products , or they simply cannot afford them .
This greatly brings down the money going into the industry , and therefore causes anime companies to let people go or skimp on certain things .
A great example of this is Media Blasters , who has lately been dropping the process of getting American voice actors to dub their work and instead simply putting English subtitles on their work and releasing it that way to cut costs .
The cycle goes like this : People download and stream , but do n’t buy .
Because of that , companies lose money and they have to jack up the costs of anime DVDs to stay profitable .
The prices get so high , nobody wants to buy them , and so they resort to downloading and streaming , and it goes on and on like that .
Truly it is a destructive cycle .
Let ’s talk about fansubbers briefly .
For those of you who do n’t know , a fansub group is a group of people who take it upon themselves to translate and subtitle an anime , then post it online for people to download and enjoy .
So what are some of the things that go in to fansubbing ?
Well , I happen to be good friends with a fansub group , and these are just some of the things they have to go through to bring the anime to you :
Finding a good quality rip of an episode that will be pleasing to the eye , but not so large in file size that it will be inconvenient to the person downloading it .
that will be pleasing to the eye , but not so large in file size that it will be inconvenient to the person downloading it .
Translate everything that is spoken , which involves finding someone fluent enough in both English and Japanese to be able to make sense of what is being said .
They also have to reword it so that it makes sense to an American viewer , as the Japanese , like us , have terms and phrases they use that we would not understand .
, which involves finding someone fluent enough in both English and Japanese to be able to make sense of what is being said .
They also have to reword it so that it makes sense to an American viewer , as the Japanese , like us , have terms and phrases they use that we would not understand .
Time the subtitles to fit with the spoken words and program them into the video file .
Obviously , this is a huge labor of love .
Most fansub groups do this out of pure love and passion for the series in question , but some do try to put them onto DVD and sell them , which is ( obviously ) highly illegal .
Adding that to the pot of everything else above makes the positives of anime downloading and streaming harder and harder to grasp at .
Lack of funding will make any business collapse , and so this issue is very much the cornerstone of the troubles the American anime industry is having .
Censorship
Like I stated in the beginning , the creative minds of the Americans and the Japanese are very different .
While we are obsessed with not offending anyone , Japan is much more lax in this regard , specifically in violent and sexual content and how it is portrayed .
While any American parent would be horrified to have their child exposed to such a thing , the Japanese find it to be a comical device , and it is often found , in small doses of course , in many children ’s programs .
However , here , it is censored .
Because much of an anime series ’ magic can come from some of its more violent or sexually humerous scenes , a lot of the poignancy of a story can be lost due to censorship .
Or , it can just be plain hilarious , confusing , and infuriating .
Here are some great examples of censorship of anime in America .
Violence
What ?
HOW DARE YOU ERASE THE PAIN AND SUFFERING DRIPPING ON THE SIDE OF MY FACE ? ( Naruto )
Everything from blood to guns is often cut out of anime .
Here are some shows that have been a victim of this .
Yu - Gi-Oh ! , believe it or not , is normally chock - full of guns , but they were all edited out in America .
Instead , the bad guys do a lot of …pointing .
Yeah .
Sailor Moon was also cut due to this .
There was a scene where Rini , a .k.a.
Sailor Chibi Moon , pulls a toy gun on Sailor Moon herself , but that was considered too naughty for the kids , even when a flag popped out of it after Rini pulled the trigger !
Saint Seiya is normally full of blood , but when it came to America , the blood was changed to a blue - green color , and was referred to as ‘ Mystical Energy ’ .
Yeah , I ’m totally buying that one .
Abusive Substances
Mmm , nothing like lighting up a good ol ’ lollipop to take the edge off .
( One Piece )
Replacing things like cigarettes with random items is a very common type of censorship in America when it comes to anime .
Here are some other examples :
Dragonball Z is the victim of this in many ways .
Many DBZ characters are actually smokers , but you ’d never know because they all got erased .
There ’s also lots of nudity and peeing on people ’s heads in this show , but that ’s a whole different issue .
Sailor Moon herself had an episode in America where she got ‘ silly ’ after drinking too much ‘ punch ’ .
Suuuure .
Sexuality
I feel pretty , oh so pretty ~ ( Pokémon )
Nudity , cross dressing , and homosexuality are big a big no - no when it comes to cartoons in America , and so the above episode of Pokémon was actually never aired .
The other big instance of this is Sailor Moon .
Here ’s what was censored :
Just about all of the Sailor Scouts ’ transformation sequences were censored in America , as they had nipples showing !
The only Scout to actually have a chunk of their sequence cut out completely , though , was Sailor Jupiter ; at one point , her skirt flies up , and so they cut that out completely .
Zoicite , one of Queen Beryl ’s henchwoman , was actually a hench men in Japan .
His relationship with Malachite was still in - tact in Japan , meaning , GASP , they were gay together !
in Japan .

Sailor Neptune and Sailor Uranus were portrayed as cousins in America , but in reality , they ’re lovers .
The Sailor Starlights were three women who were looking for their Princess .
To do this , they masqueraded as a boy band singing group , and then transformed into their true Sailor Scout selves when in battle .
Because of all the gender - bending , they actually cut the series off in America right before they were introduced .
Religion
Holy Crucifixion , Batman ! ( Sailor Moon )
Religion is a very sensitive issue in America , and so scenes like the one above were cut out completely .
The last episode of the first season of Sailor Moon was in fact a two - parter , but they edited it so severely that it got truncated into one single episode , mostly because the dead bodies of the Scouts were hanging in a cross - like position for most of the time .
Nice .
As you can see , a lot of censoring goes on in anime in America , and while it may be good for the kids , it pisses of the hardcore anime fans , and that turns them off to the point where they do n’t want to support the official releases .
The past couple of years , however , have seen a rash of uncut anime DVDs being released , and many FUNimation shows are released in both TV edited and unedited versions .
Alterations of an Original Series
This not only angers anime fans , but its not even useful like the censorship sometimes is .
A lot of names and storyline are simplified so that it can be easier for American audiences to understand , but it can also ruin the integrity of a series .
Here are some examples of some theme song changes .
Saint Seiya , aside from the censoring of blood mentioned above , got its ass handed to it in other ways .
It was renamed ‘ Knights of the Zodiac ’ when it came to America , and its original opening theme , Pegasus Fantasy , got replaced with a sub- par cover of the Flock of Seagulls ’ hit I Ran .
Makes me cringe just watching it .
Sailor Moon keeps getting mentioned , but it got screwed over that badly .
It ’s original opening , Moonlight Densetsu , had its lyrics translated into English .
However , the words in English have nothing to do with the original lyrics of the song .
with the original lyrics of the song .
Ronin Warriors , known in Japan as Yoroiden Samurai Troopers , not only got a whole new opening that was not really a song so much as it was a speech about how great they were , but they mixed up the armors and voices !
Here ’s some examples of some name change issues :
Sailor Moon , for the last time I swear !
The five main characters in Japan were named Usagi , Ami ( Ah- mee ) , Rei , Makoto , and Minako .
In America , they were Serena , Amy , Raye , Lita , and Mina .
Some of these names do sound sort of alike .
Interestingly enough though , in the Sailor Moon comics , Usagi was not known as Serena , but as Bunny , which is the literal translation of the word ‘ Usagi ’
( This all stemming from the fact that she ’s Sailor Moon and there ’s a custom in Japan involving a rabbit in the moon ) .
Like I said , these changes make sense to a small degree , but changing the name Naru to Molly , or Mamoru to Darien ?
Come on now !
Names can also be horrible mispronounced .
Ryu Hoshi of Street Fighter fame is known in America as ‘ Rhai - you ’ , when it is meant to be pronounced ‘ Ree - yo ’ .
The way all of the above affects an anime as a whole is largely the reason , in my opinion , why the American anime industry is having so much trouble , which brings me to the last two parts of this whole beautiful thing .
What can we , as anime fans , do to change things ?
Well , here are some ways I can think of for anime fans to help change what we ’ve seen here .
Supporting the industry financially is probably the biggest .
Buy the official releases !
Feel free to show streams and downloads to your friends , but urge them to buy the official releases themselves , and do n’t make copies of your DVDs for them ; you ’re only making it worse !
Also , use your voice to spread the word about how downloading and streaming affects the industry !

Also , use your voice to spread the word about how downloading and streaming affects the industry !
Getting involved with the industry itself is another great idea .
Attending anime conventions is a great way to not only keep up on the latest news , but to also purchase official merchandise you ’d never find anywhere else .
Also , if you want to see an anime you know of brought over to America , e-mail some anime companies such as ADV , Bandai , and FUNimation and tell them what you want !
If they see the fanbase , they ’ll put forth the effort ( we hope ) !

Share the anime love with everyone !
Invite friends over for a night of watching anime , and invite anyone who may be curious about anime .
A nice big group of people is perfect for answering questions and giving opinions on the best way to start watching anime .
If you see an anime that you think a friend may like , suggest it to them !
While these may not do much , they are some things we can do to improve the situation .
However , that raises one final question .
Would we even want to change things ?
On my Facebook , I started adding a bunch of my favorite j-pop and j - rock to my iLike application , then posted some of my favorite songs and videos with messages urging my non-anime loving friends to give the music a try .
My friend Spyke then yelled at me , telling me to stop urging others to listen to it , because if it became popular in America , it would somehow be ruined .
How can you blame him for being afraid of that , given what you ’ve read above ?
Because of the way anime is treated in America , many anime fans are reluctant to see new anime come over .
However , by keeping active in the industry and supporting what you love , you can show these companies that we prefer the good ol ’ unedited , original stuff .
Also , we should all keep in mind that the Japanese anime companies do make money off of the American releases , and so I believe that fact should also be taken into account in these matters .
It ’s not as if anime will just disappear from America if we keep this up ; it will also affect Japan ’s anime industry .
So , in the end , the decision is really yours .
If you ’re not an anime fan , you can either try to get into it or just not bother .
If you already are one , you can try to learn more about it and get involved in the industry , or you can just keep on being a casual watcher .
Nobody can force anyone to do anything in this situation .
However , my choice is clear : I choose to be active and support the anime industry by informing others , buying my favorite titles whenever I have the financial ability to , and to just keep on enjoying it and sharing it with my friends .
Because in the end , anime is meant to be enjoyed .
This is all just about preserving that enjoyment .
WATCH - Breezy and warm for the middle of the week !
On Wednesday , my editor walked up to my desk to ask what I was writing about .
" For all I know , you could be writing about ostriches , " she said .
" Actually , " I replied , " did you know an ostrich can call itself a financial planner ? "
And take your money , if you like .
Anyone -- banker , painter , serf , newspaper columnist -- can call himself a financial adviser / analyst , wealth manager or investment consultant .
It 's perfectly legal .
This is , after all , a free and capitalistic society .
" People call themselves all kinds of things they really are n't , " said Kevin Anselm , head of enforcement for the state Division of Finance and Corporate Securities .
" It 's been more of a problem on the insurance side than on the securities side . "
Now , Oregon is trying to address the problem .
The state proposes joining eight others in barring the misleading or fraudulent use of financial designations .
It wo n't be easy .
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority , the self - policing overseer of U.S. securities firms , lists 86 designations in use .
Among them : certified senior adviser , certified senior consultant , accredited financial counselor and three - dimensional wealth practitioner .
No , special glasses are n't needed for that last title .
All these designations lead to 3 - D confusion for consumers , particularly senior citizens -- perhaps as designed .
Apparently , 17 percent of investors age 55 to 64 said they would take advice from someone with the nonexistent designation of " Certified Advisor for Senior Investing , " according to a yet - unpublished survey by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the AARP .
As ever before , it 's largely up to you to protect yourself and your money .
Just ask Carrie J. Raanes .
Nine years ago , Raanes , a real estate agent , sold Brendan T. Jones a home in hilly Persimmon Country Club near Gresham .
They became friends , she said , and he talked of how he invested money for family and pals .
He seemed real , she recalled .
His e-mail address included the name " nasdaqbtj . "
His brokerage account statements referred to himself as " Your financial planner . "
Raanes gave Jones $ 42,000 over three years to invest .
Her most recent statement , dated April 15 , showed her account value at $ 55,548 , mostly invested in " stocks , rights and warrants . "
But last year , the market and real estate crash forced Raanes to dip into her savings .
Unfortunately , Jones has refused to return her money , she alleged in a complaint filed with federal and state securities regulators .
Raanes said she 's asked for a check repeatedly this year -- in person , via e-mail and phone text messages .
She recently discovered Jones is not registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or the state Division of Finance and Corporate Securities , as required of any broker - dealer or investment adviser .
The state agency is now investigating Jones .
" I 'm almost 50 years old , and I 've learned you can't trust anybody , " said Raanes , who has lost four homes she owned in Sandy to foreclosure , including her own .
" If you do n't know how to check out a company , ask questions . "
Did Jones invest the money ?
I do n't know .
He asked to get off his property when I approached him at his home Tuesday .
" I believed everything he told me , " Raanes added .
" That was n't smart . "
The new rules proposed by the state would prohibit financial and insurance product salespeople from claiming to be a financial planners , specialists or advisers without proper education and oversight .
Violators could face fines of up to $ 100,000 .
The rules would also bar the use of acronyms or titles that falsely convey a person has special training in advising seniors -- or any other class of consumer -- on such products .
The Oregon Insurance Division is investigating a case in which a salesperson used the title " Chartered Senior Financial Planner , " agency spokeswoman Lisa Morawski said .
She declined further comment .
Designations earned from programs that receive federal loan money would be exempt from the rules .
So would titles from programs accredited by the American National Standards Institute and The National Commission for Certifying Agencies .
A public hearing on the rules is scheduled Oct. 22 at the Department of Consumer and Business Services in Salem , the agency overseeing the insurance and securities divisions .
Washington is a bit ahead of Oregon .
Financial planners must be licensed as an investment adviser with the state or SEC , said Mike Stevenson , director of securities at the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions .
It also passed a rule last year regulating the use of " senior " financial designations .
So , what is a trustworthy title ?
In the accompanying article , you 'll see a list of the most common and legitimate financial designations .
You 'll also find links to sites where you can verify a person 's designation .
Of those listed , the most reliable require a recipient to meet a fiduciary standard .
That is , they require the designee to put the client 's interest ahead of their own .
The three that do are Certified Financial Planner , Registered Investment Adviser and Investment Adviser Representatives -- particularly those who make money on a fee-only , commission - free basis .
While those folks will occasionally have interests that conflict with yours , they offer the safest advice and management of money .
Safer than a newspaper columnist .
Safer than an ostrich .

Titles indicate certain standards are met
There are about 90 designations used by salespeople and advisers to convey some sort of financial , insurance or planning expertise .
What follows are the most common , along with descriptions about their education requirements and consumer safeguards .
Certified Financial Planner ( CFP ) :
Recipients must pass a difficult exam , gain three years ' experience , take continuing education courses and abide by a code of ethics enforced by the
They also hold themselves to a fiduciary standard .
It is a trusted designation , particularly those operating on a fee - only basis .
That means they charge by the hour , by a set fee or by assets under management .
In contrast , fee - based planners can be compensated by commissions from financial products .
Registered Investment Adviser and Investment Adviser Representatives :
Firms and / or individuals providing securities advice for pay .
They must be licensed by or registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or state regulators .
They also must hold themselves to a fiduciary standard , meaning they must put their clients ' interests above their own .
Again , fee - only advisers offer the fewest conflicts of interest .

Recipients must pass a tough exam , satisfy work requirements and meet state licensing requirements .

Personal Financial Specialist ( PFS )
: Awarded by the AICPA to CPAs who specialize in personal financial planning .
You do n't find many of these around , but they 'll be well - educated if you do .
Chartered Life Underwriter ( CLU )
:
, which educates insurance and financial services professionals , awards this designation to those who have at least two years ' work experience , passed courses and agreed to abide by a code of ethics .
They do n't , however , abide by a fiduciary standard .
After all , they sell products .
Chartered Financial Consultant ( ChFC )
:
awards this designation , mostly to insurance agents and finance reps , and also applies a code of ethics .
However , recipients are n't held to a fiduciary standard .

Melbourne has posted its hottest day on record for the first half of September after warm , windy conditions swept across Victoria .
Wind gusts of up to 85 kilometres an hour have been recorded so far , but the gusts could reach as much as 100 kilometres on Saturday night .
Senior forecaster Richard Carlyon says northerly winds have fuelled the hot weather across the state .
" We got to 29.9 in Melbourne , we have never had a day above 29 degrees in the first half of September , " he said .
" It was n't an all - time September record - that was 31.7 degrees back in the late `80s .
" This is unprecedented .
" But there is a cold front pushing in from the west and that will bring some milder air across the state overnight .
" The temperature is not expected to be nearly as high on Sunday , " he said .

At the time of publication , it represented the best available science .
Throughout the first half of the twentieth century , the Aral Sea was the world ’s fourth - largest lake .
In the 1960s , the Soviet Union began a massive irrigation project in what are now Kazakhstan , Uzbekistan , and Turkmenistan , diverting water from the rivers that feed the Aral Sea to irrigate farmland .
As its water levels dropped , the lake began splitting into smaller pieces : the Northern ( Small ) Aral Sea and the Southern ( Large ) Aral Sea .
The Southern Aral Sea further split into eastern and western lobes .
The Earth Observatory ’s World of Change : Evaporation of the Aral Sea feature tracks this process over the past decade .
This update shows that by August 2009 , virtually nothing remained of the Southern Aral Sea ’s eastern lobe .
The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) on NASA ’s Terra satellite captured this true - color image of the Aral Sea on August 16 , 2009 .
Although the Northern Aral Sea ( upper right ) still appears healthy , the Southern Aral Sea consists of two isolated water bodies : an irregular oval shape directly southwest of the Northern Aral Sea , and the long , thin remainder of the Southern Aral Sea ’s far western lobe .
Although the faintest glimmers of blue - green appear in the eastern lobe , earth tones predominate , surrounded by a ghostly film of pale beige .
Lake sediments from this depleted water body have provided ample material for frequent dust storms .
Much of what finally doomed the Southern Aral Sea was an attempt to save its neighbor to the north .
In 2005 , Kazakhstan built the Kok - Aral Dam between the lake ’s northern and southern portions to preserve water levels in the north .
The Northern Aral Sea actually exceeded expectations with the speed of its recovery , but the dam ended prospects for a recovery of the Southern Aral Sea , which some authorities already regarded as beyond help .

Non as in non-profit .
The first issue is the way you describe yourself .
I know what you ’re not but what are you ?
Did you start or join this non -profit because of the non part ?
I doubt it .
It 's because you want to make change .
The way the world is just is n't right or good enough for you … there 's an emergency or an injustice or an opportunity and you want to make change .
These organizations exist solely to make change .
That 's why you joined , is n't it ?
The problem facing your group , ironically , is the resistance to the very thing you are setting out to do .
Non-profits , in my experience , abhor change .
Take a look at the top 100 twitter users in terms of followers .
Remember , this is a free tool , one that people use to focus attention and galvanize action .
What ?
None of them are non-profits .
Not one as far as I can tell .
Is the work you 're doing not important enough to follow , or is it ( and I 'm betting it is ) paralysis in decision making in the face of change ?
Is there too much bureaucracy or too much fear to tell a compelling story in a transparent way ?
Beth has a great post about the feeling of vertigo that non-profits get when they move from the firm ground of the tried and true to the anti-gravity that comes from leaping into change .
Where are the big charities , the urgent charities , the famous charities that face such timely needs and are in a hurry to make change ?
Very few of them have bothered to show up in a big way .
The problem is same as the twitter resistance :
The internet represents a change .
It 's easy to buy more stamps and do more direct mail , scary to use a new technique .
Of course , some folks , like charity : water are stepping into the void and raising millions of dollars as a result .
They 're not necessarily a better cause , they 're just more passionate about making change .
A few years ago I met with two ( very famous ) non-profits to discuss permission marketing and online fundraising and how they might have an impact .
Each time , the president of the group was in the room .
After about forty five minutes , the meetings devolved into endless lists of why any change at all in the way things were was absolutely impossible .
Everyone looked to the president of the group for leadership , and when he did n't say anything , they dissembled , stalled and evaded .
Every barrier was insurmountable , every element of the status quo was cast in stone .
The president of the group was ( he thought ) helpless .
When was the last time you had an interaction with a non-profit ( there 's that word again ) that blew you away ?
Please do n't tell me it 's about a lack of resources .
The opportunities online are basically free , and if you do n't have a ton of volunteers happy to help you , then you 're not working on something important enough .
The only reason not to turn this over to hordes of crowds eager to help you is that it means giving up total control and bureaucracy .
Which is scary because it leads to change .
If you spend any time reading marketing blogs , you 'll find thousands of case studies of small ( and large ) innovative businesses that are shaking things up and making things happen .
And not enough of these stories are about non-profits .
If your non -profit is n't acting with as much energy and guts as it takes to get funded in Silicon Valley or featured on Digg , then you 're failing in your duty to make change .
The marketing world has changed completely .
So has the environment for philanthropic giving .
So have the attitudes of a new generation of philanthropists .
But if you look at the biggest charities in the country , you could n't tell .
Because they 're ' non ' first , change second .
Sorry if I sound upset , but I am .
The work these groups do is too important ( and the people who work for them are too talented ) to waste this opportunity because you are paralyzed in fear .

The Lahore madrassa that opposed the Taliban Pakistani madrassas , religious schools , are often seen in the west as incubators for terrorism .
Most do not fit that stereotype .
Madrassas stress Koranic studies but many also provide what is called a modern education - maths , sciences , computer technology .
They provide free education where the state cannot .
I recently visited one that paid a terrible price for its moderate stand .
Jamia Naeemia is a madrassah in Lahore .
On the 12 June this year , the Imam , Dr Safrez Naeemi , was talking to a student in his office .
Dr Naeemi had drawn international attention by speaking out against the Taliban .
He had issued a fatwa condemning suicide attacks .
Students continue their studies despite the murder of Dr Naeemi
In planning my trip I had arranged to speak to Dr Naeemi about the message of moderation he was preaching .
It was not to be .
On that day , 12 June , a young man walked into his office and detonated a bomb jacket .
Dr Naeemi , the student and the bomber died instantly .
Killing Dr Naeemi sent a chilling message from the extremists to religious moderates - criticise us , condemn us and we will kill you .
The space for dialogue in a dangerously divided Pakistan narrowed even further .
Ignorance
While I was there , the office was being repaired but windows in the student dormitories above the courtyard were still blown out , and outside walls scarred with the impact of the explosion .
Raghib Naeemi is determined his father 's message of peace will be his legacy Muhammed Raghib Hussein Naeemi , Dr Naeemi 's son , heard about the attack in a phone call while he was driving .
He says he was angry , very angry but he knew immediately what he had to do .
" I realised that I would have to be very calm .
So I ordered all of my father 's students not to harm anyone , not to start fires , not to kill anyone . "
Raghib Naeemi says that what the Taliban wanted was to create further instability in an already insecure city : " Those people who planned this nasty action against my father , they thought that after he died there would be violence , there would be riots and killing of other people . "
I talked to one of Dr Naeemi 's students and asked him how he felt about the suicide bomber .
He paused and I could feel his sadness and then he said : " The suicide bomber was just a child , he knew nothing about it , whether he was doing right or wrong .
He was brainwashed and he was doing what he was given training for . "
Violence
The extremists feed off the widespread anger amongst Pakistan 's estimated 100 million young people .
Many have no education , no jobs , no future .
Raghib Naeemi says the Taliban understand how badly Pakistan has failed to provide for its citizens and exploit that knowledge skilfully : " Violence is in our society .
When young people express their views , they express them very violently and this anger is in all our young people .
And whoever puts a small fire to their anger - it will explode " .
The banner by Dr Naeemi 's grave says that he was a martyr Raghib Naeemi and the students he has inherited from his father say they will continue to denounce violence .
As we leave I pass the place where Dr Naeemi is buried .
The soil on the grave is still fresh .
And on the wall is a banner .
It says in Urdu : " Dr Safrez Naeemi , martyred .
Long live Islam .
Long live Pakistan . "
I learn later that just about the time I am leaving the madrassa a suicide bomber has blown himself up in an attack on a bus in Rawalpindi .
He was said to be 20 years old .

— A group of Durham residents are taking aim at speeders with the threat of a paintball gun .
The group , Angry Neighbors With Paintball Guns , says it is posting signs at strategic locations throughout the city , warning motorists to slow down or risk being shot at with a paintball gun .
More On This
" We are a small group of neighbors who have reached the limits of our patience with the city 's inability -- some might say unwillingness -- to address the issue , " the group wrote in an e-mail Monday to WRAL News .
It would not say if the signs were to serve only as an attention - grabber or if it plans to shoot paintballs at vehicles .
“ Who we are is n't important , " a second e-mail stated .
" What is important is that the City of Durham realize [ sic ] that this is a problem that needs to be solved .
Stay tuned for further developments .
” The group says it is also disappointed that the city has stopped funding its PACE Car program , which was designed to help prevent speeding .
Kammie Michael , a Durham police spokeswoman , said budget and staffing constraints forced the dissolution of the program .
The department , however , has increased patrols in the area recently , Michael said and residents have complimented the police department on its response .
" The Durham Police Department enforces traffic laws , and we plan to continue to be responsive to traffic concerns from residents throughout the city , " she said .
Michael said it is a crime to shoot a paintball at a vehicle and that the signs could be a distraction for some drivers and make the problem worse .
Some residents who live near the intersection of Markham and Glendale avenues , where a sign was posted Monday morning , said they like the signs because it brings attention to the speeding problem .
" I think it 's a very good sign , and it shows there is some initiative in our neighborhood , " resident Angelo Abbate said .
" I thought it was good fun , " resident Rusty Haynes said .
" I 'm not sure anybody will actually get plugged with a paint pellet , but we 'll see . "
While the Australian government dawdles on changes to the country 's classification guidelines , games continue to be " refused classification " on the grounds they exceed the maximum rating of MA15 +.
The latest game on the chopping block ?
Left 4 Dead 2 .

Yup , Valve 's Zombie shooter has been refused classification , which means it can't be made commercially available in the country .
Not quite the same as a banning , but it has the same effect .
We 've contacted Valve for comment , and will update when / if we hear back .
Previous games to have suffered this fate usually receive an MA15 + rating later down the line after edits have been made to the offending content .

UPDATE - Here 's why it was " refused classification " :
* The game contains violence that is high in impact and is therefore unsuitable for persons aged under 18 to play .
*
It notes that this violence is " inflicted upon ‘ the Infected ' who are living humans infected with a rabies - like virus that causes them to act violently . " *
The report singles out the use of melee weapons as those that " inflict the most damage " and cause " copious amounts of blood spray and splatter ( sic ) , decapitations and limb dismemberment … or even cause intestines to spill from the wounds . "
*
In conclusion , the Board finds that the " interactive nature of the game increases the overall impact of the frequent and intense depictions of violence .
This coupled with the graphic depictions of blood and gore combine to create a playing impact which is high . " *
Interestingly , the report also reveals that it was n't a unanimous decision and that " a minority of the Board is of the opinion that the violence is strong in playing impact and therefore warrants an MA15 + classification " instead .
However , the majority voted to refuse classification .

" It notes that this violence is " inflicted upon ‘ the Infected ' who are living humans infected with a rabies - like virus that causes them to act violently " .
Remember , kids , these are the people refusing the game classification .
People who think zombies with limbs missing and their guts hanging out are " living humans " .

It was an unprecedented surveillance operation involving hundreds of police officers , and a plot that prosecutors said was unparalleled in its terrible ambition .
But it has taken two prosecutions to prove beyond reasonable doubt that a plot which changed the nature of air travel was genuine .
Now , the British men behind a plan to launch suicide bomb attacks on a succession of transatlantic airliners are facing a life in jail .
Almost 18 months ago , prosecutors first told a jury of an ingenious plan to create liquid bombs disguised as soft drink bottles .
It was this plot that in August 2006 brought chaos to international aviation as liquids were almost entirely banned from hand luggage on planes .
And those restrictions , and the huge costs they cause , remain in place today .
But while the first jury at Woolwich Crown Court convicted the three ringleaders of conspiracy to murder , it stopped short of concluding their targets were planes .
OPERATION OVERT IN NUMBERS 26,000 exhibits collected 102 property searches 80 computers and other devices seized 226 seized from inside internet cafes 15,000 CDs 500 Floppy disks 14,000 Gigs of data Countries visited : Japan ( because of the type of batteries they had ) , Pakistan , South Africa , Mauritius and Belgium .
Source : Met Police
Now , after a lengthy retrial , a second jury has found the three men accused guilty of targeting ordinary travellers .
A jigsaw of extraordinary evidence had finally come together to justify the massive delays at airports and moments of high political tension between governments tracking terror plots around the world .
The race to bring to justice Abdulla Ahmed Ali , Assad Sarwar and Tanvir Hussain took place over a matter of weeks .
But the story of what the police came to call Operation Overt began in the aftermath of al - Qaeda 's 9/11 attacks on America .
As US forces poured into Afghanistan , the decades - old refugee crisis worsened .
The Islamic Medical Association , a charity shop in Clapton , east London , raised money and collected equipment to send to refugee camps on the Pakistan - Afghanistan border .
AHMED ALI'S TRAVELS Feb 2003 : Pakistan refugee work Jan 2004 : Pilgrimage to Mecca Aug 2004 : Pakistan refugee work ( In Pakistan at the same time as the 7/7 and 21/7 ringleaders ) Jan 2005 : Returns to UK June 2005 : Back to Pakistan May 2006 : Final visit on family business Ali and Sarwar went to deliver aid to the refugee camps - and their experiences radically altered their world view .
Abdulla Ahmed Ali , the ringleader of the group , was shocked by the appalling conditions .
His anger was compounded by the failure of the 2003 mass protest against the Iraq war .
The anger felt by men like Ahmed Ali turned him against the UK and America and he turned to radical Islamists who were increasingly calling for attacks on Britain .
As the security services watched some of the people moving in these circles , Ahmed Ali became an object of interest .
MI5 officers twice approached Arafat Khan - Ahmed Ali's old school friend and one of the co-accused found not guilty of the plot .
Officers told Khan that they needed help working out who was a danger in east London .
He refused to become an " asset " .
Baggage opened But when Ahmed Ali himself returned from Pakistan in June 2006 , investigators were sufficiently interested in him to secretly open his baggage before it got through to the arrivals hall .
Shopping trips : Sarwar bought suitcase to store bomb parts in woods
Inside they found an unusual powdered soft drink , Tang , and a large number of batteries .
The find was out of the ordinary - and officers decided they needed to know more .
In the coming weeks , the Metropolitan Police and MI5 mounted a surveillance operation that would grow into the largest ever conducted in the UK .
By the time of the arrests , 220 more police officers had been drafted in from other forces .
During this time Ahmed Ali and Assad Sarwar , his deputy based in High Wycombe , Bucks , were sending e-mails to Pakistan .
These coded messages only became clear after the arrests ; they were thinly veiled communications to their jihadist contacts .
The orders came back to push ahead with the project - or " presentation " as Ahmed Ali described it .
They needed to look for willing volunteers and watch out for surveillance .
The e-mails were not available to the prosecution in the first trial - but became a critical part of the story second time around .
Sarwar , convicted at Woolwich Crown Court as the " quartermaster " of the plot , was watched busily buying items that did not fit with his daily needs - and which had a potentially deadly context .
Bomb factory : Ordinary flat in East London
His e-mails talked about acquiring Calvin Klein aftershave for a business opportunity - but instead he was buying hydrogen peroxide , a legitimate chemical that can be turned to a deadly use .
The quantities of aftershave he referred to bore a striking similarity to the quantities of chemicals he amassed .
When MI5 secretly broke into the east London flat being used by Ahmed Ali , they were alarmed by what they saw .
It appeared to be a bomb factory - but a very strange one .
On 3 August , MI5 's tiny camera and microphone recorded Ahmed Ali and co-accused Tanvir Hussain , also convicted , constructing odd devices out of drink bottles .
If these were bombs , why were they so small ?
The security services started picking up the clues .
Some of the men were heard reviewing numbers , and talking of " 18 or 19 " .
Did that mean 19 devices , 19 targets or perhaps 19 conspirators ?
Then a surveillance team watched Ahmed Ali in an internet cafe , researching flight timetables for two hours .
Jigsaw pieces
It all came together .
The bombs did not need to be big - they just needed to be made from small parts - and powerful enough to rip a hole in an airliner 's fuselage .

In 2001 Richard Reid tried to bring down a jet with a small explosive device in his shoe .
Counter - terrorism chiefs had been expecting jihadists to use small bombs again - and they had also not ruled out a mass mid-air attack after one such plot was stopped in Asia in 1995 .
Ahmed Ali 's scheme appeared to cover both possibilities .
Since 2001 , there have been a series of extremely dangerous plots in the UK - and the Operation Overt convictions are a major milestone in these huge trials .
The plot is believed by intelligence sources to have been directed by Al - Qaeda .
Why did all these men turn to violence ?
The reason can be found in their own words , writings and martyrdom videos ; a simple and seething anger over British and American foreign policy , and an overwhelming belief that Muslims were its helpless victims .
Now , following two very difficult trials , these men all face life sentences .

This Week at War : McChrystal Plays Defense
Afghanistan and civil - military relations
Gen . Stanley McChrystal ‘s report on the situation in Afghanistan is likely to strain relations between the Obama administration and the uniformed military .
The arrival of McChrystal ’s report in Washington is likely to spark its own low - level war of finger - pointing and blame - shifting between civilian policymakers in the White House and McChrystal ’s staff and defenders in the Pentagon .
This strain in civil - military relations could last through the duration of the U.S. military ’s involvement in Afghanistan and beyond .
McChrystal ’s report is supposedly secret , but anonymous staffers have already revealed its themes to the Washington Post .
The goal of these staffers is to protect McChrystal and the uniformed military against White House officials they likely do n’t trust .
These staffers have evidently concluded that they need to leak first in order to establish their position and put White House staffers on the defensive .
The first task for McChrystal ’s report ( and its leaking defenders ) was to show how President Barack Obama ‘s supposedly limited war aims actually result in broad , expensive , and open - ended goals for Afghanistan :
Although the assessment , which runs more than 20 pages , has not been released , officials familiar with the report have said it represents a hard look at the challenges involved in implementing Obama ’s strategy for Afghanistan .
The administration has narrowly defined its goal as defeating al - Qaeda and other extremist groups and denying them sanctuary , but that in turn requires a sweeping counterinsurgency campaign aimed at protecting the Afghan population , establishing good governance and rebuilding the economy .
McChrystal ’s report has thus shifted responsibility over to the White House to either the rally the country and the Congress around a big nation - building campaign or to explicitly scale back the desired war aims .
Next , according to the Washington Post , McChrystal ’s report lists numerous obstacles that could prevent success , barriers that are outside of the U.S. military ’s control :
For instance , McChrystal thinks a greater push by civilian officials is vital to shore up local Afghan governments and to combat corruption , officials said .
He is emphatic that the results of the recent Afghan presidential election be viewed as legitimate , but is also realistic in acknowledging that the goals of the government of Afghan President Hamid Karzai and the coalition are not always as closely aligned as they could be , they said .
Separately , officials said , McChrystal ’s assessment finds that U.S. and other NATO forces must adopt a less risk - averse culture , leaving bases and armored vehicles to pursue insurgents on foot in a way that minimizes Afghan civilian deaths .
In others words , McChrystal is saying , do n’t hold me responsible for success if Karzai ’s election is a fraud , civilian officials do n’t show up , or European soldiers are not allowed to patrol .
The report illustrates the basic struggle between civilian policymakers and military commanders .
Each side looks to the other to solve its problems .
The White House staff is hoping that McChrystal will deliver a clear , high - probability war - winning strategy , a strategy that would reduce Afghanistan as an issue of concern .
McChrystal , like all field commanders , wants his political masters to give him a realistic and measurable objective , with the resources needed to accomplish it .
McChrystal ’s report implies a pessimistic outlook for U.S. success in Afghanistan .
If he and his staff had an optimistic view about the Afghan challenge , there would have been no need to be so diligent about clarifying responsibility for what comes next .
In the case of success , all would share the glory .
McChrystal ’s report is a preemptive defense against blame and recrimination .
That does not bode well for either the U.S. mission in Afghanistan or for civil - military relations .
Communication breakdown
In the latest issue of Joint Force Quarterly , Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm.
Michael Mullen shouts down the concept of " strategic communications .
" Mullen implies that the concept of strategic communications is condescending .
What really matters , he believes , are U.S. policies and how they are executed .
Communicating the results of those policies is not the problem .
Mullen says :
Our messages lack credibility because we have n’t invested enough in building trust and relationships , and we have n’t always delivered on promises …
That ’s the essence of good communication : having the right intent up front and letting our actions speak for themselves .
We should n’t care if people do n’t like us ; that is n’t the goal .
The goal is credibility .
And we earn that over time …
To put it simply , we need to worry a lot less about how to communicate our actions and much more about what our actions communicate .
In his essay , Mullen mentioned happy moments for the United States ’s public image : the voyage of the Great White Fleet , the Marshall Plan , and disaster relief missions .
If that was the only type of interaction the U.S. government had with the outside world , then Mullen makes a good , but trivial point — the State Department would not need an under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs .
Unfortunately , the U.S. government has not found a way to limit its interactions in the world to just economic reconstruction , disaster relief , and harmless publicity tours .
Long before the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , the United States found it had to defend its interests , protect its citizens abroad , oppose revisionist powers , supports its friends , and occasionally attempt to prevent human suffering .
Taking a side in a conflict means making an enemy out of someone .
Mullen apparently believes that clever communications cannot compensate for " what our actions communicate . "
He is probably correct .
But he never explains how the United States , a great power with global responsibilities , can avoid taking consequential actions in the first place , actions that will anger somebody somewhere .
Writing on ForiegnPolicy.com , James Glassman , the last under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs , agrees with Mullen on one thing — the U.S. should stop bothering with whether various aggrieved people like the America .
Instead , Glassman suggests , U.S. public - diplomacy efforts should encourage the citizens of countries to focus on their own bad guys instead of the U.S .
For Glassman , it ’s OK if most Pakistanis hate the U.S. as long as even more of them hate the Taliban and al Qaeda .
Having experienced the harsh reality of being the U.S. government ’s public diplomat , Glassman ’s minimalist strategy may be the best he could salvage .
Its success depends on having an enemy who is politically incompetent , out of touch with the populace , and incapable of adaptation .
That is a good description of al Qaeda .
But counting on such an adversary is not a formula for success .
The U.S. government continues to have trouble with strategic communications .
Mullen and Glassman ’s essays show more ideas are needed .

My experiences of Google AppEngine usage
Test description
Hits per second print ' Hello world ' 260 1 read from Datastore , 1 write to Datastore 38 1 read from Datastore 60 10 reads from Datastore , 1 write 20 1 read from memcached , 1 write to memcached 80 1 read from memcached 120 Non - google complete PHP application , 6 SQL queries , http://3.14.by/ 240
Scaling
Sources
from google .
appengine .
ext import db
class Counter ( db .
Model ) : nick = db .
StringProperty ( ) count = db .
IntegerProperty ( )
res = Counter . gql ( " WHERE nick = ' test3 ' " ) print ' Content - Type : text / html ' print '' print ' < html > < body > < h1 > This is datastore performance test </h1 >' print ' < h2 >
It reads a counter , and increment it ' 's value in datastore < / h2 > ' for v in res : v . count = v . count + 1
print ' New counter value : ' , v . count
# v.put ( ) print '< / body ></html >'
Overall issues list
Any call to Datastore might fail randomly .
Google says probability of this dropped from 0.4 % down to 0.1 , but it will be there .
Datastore is not designed to be rock solid .
You will have to write additional code to handle exceptions here .
Memcached is not THAT memcached you used to .
This one is slow ( some 100s op / s while REAL memcached could handle 10’000 and more ) .
You really need to find a place to serve static data .
You cannot have large files here , and again , it is slow .
Some reports says URLFetch is less reliable in comparison to what we used to .
You can not choose datacenter .
For example , if you live in Europe , and AppEngine places your application at US , your users will feel it slow .
It would be " moved " to Europe eventually , but you have no control over it .
Think twice - Google might serve almost unlimited number of requests if waiting for 100 - 200 ms in average is not a problem .
But to pay for that , you will have to invest a lot of efforts in making your code random - timeouts proof .
What I would like to see changed in AppEngine to make it as cool as GMail
Much more deterministic behavior .
Less timeout exceptions .
You may send me a warning to email saying that I need to optimize a script , but users should have 0 chance to face issues caused by that .
As I was saying , it is not always possible to handle all possible issues , as we might run out of CPU time per request .
Much higher datastore & memcached performance .
What if we put memcached on the same server , and communicate via shared memory ?
I am sure current approach is more reliable , but too slow ( probably it is fast , but shared among many clients ) .
Datacenter selection
Cluster - aware applications API .
Give us some small server - local ultra - fast storage , and give us events " initialize storage " and " release storage " .
That 's it .
Some thoughts
Where this can and ca n’t be useful
Conclusion
This article was written in the first months of Google AppEngine .
Today it is completely obsolete . :
This article is not about " I am so clever , Google is so stupid " .
This article is about some Google AppEngine problems ( or peculiarities ) which might not be obvious for newcomers .
You know , Google did really nice things : great search , and awesome mail .
It gets a lot of valuable private information about our habits through that , but we continue to use these things because they are so awesome at solving their task ... There was some hype about AppEngine lately , so I ’ve decided to give it a try in my new project .
I ’ve chosen Python with Google ’s native libraries to ensure best compatibility & performance .
I ’ve started from the performance tests , and the results were ….
Disappointing : Tests were done on 20 concurrent requests from 2 different servers at the same continent .
Averages for 7 seconds of execution .
Some might say " Hey !
They are not terrible , my [ place url here ] could handle just 2 hits per second , so even 38 is a nice upgrade " .
Well , first of all , this is hello - world class application .
It is as simple as possible .
Real application would have 5 - 25 memcached / datastore calls , and would have more logic in here .
I believe that Web Developers whose " classic " web - applications could not handle 100 hits per second must be executed .
You see , the only way for me to avoid suicide while working with AppEngine is to use 1 memcached call per request , and that 's it .
Also , for the ‘ 10 reads 1 write ’ test I was getting ‘ Error : Server Error ’ for more than 10 concurrent requests ( internal error was ‘ too much contention on these datastore entities .
please try again ’ ) .
I was expecting that at some point I would get more nodes .
Unfortunately , after 10 minutes of stress testing & wasting 10 % of my daily CPU quota , speed was still the same .
Probably it does not react on load that fast .are really simple ( like this one ) : Samples are deployed here : http://mafiazone-dev.appspot.com/ .
So , Google guys are correct when they say that " performance is almost the same no matter what is the scale of your application " .
That 's right , it is slow in low scale , and also slow at large scale .
You see , even single request to anything which could hold data ( memcached or Datastore ) takes huge amount of time .
If you need to perform serveral requests to show a page - you are likely end up in timeout exceptions sometimes .
That was really disappointing .
Classic web applications ( like my homepage ) could easily serve 10'000'000 hits per day on a single server , and with further optimization could serve 30 ' 000'000 ( at average 500 hits per second for 8 - 10 rush hours ) .
How many of the projects need at least 10 % of that ?
What if 0.01 % of these hits would trigger an unrecoverable error caused by random timeouts ( because any handling procedures would need extra CPU time , which is really limited per call ) ?
Here is what you should consider when thinking about using Google AppEngine for your project :
Some time ago I was working with really nice technology – it was all redundant and reliable , " cloud " - like , convenient API interfaces , but it took 4 seconds to render forum page on 4 - CPU Server .
It sucked .
It does not matter how cool technology is If it lack performance ( google ’s case ) or usability – it would continue to suck .
It ’s great for mostly read - only simple ( i.e. no complex DB logic , little data ) applications without load peaks .
This might be awesome solution for “ homepage ” with some photos of your cat with rare changes and 0 maintenance and cost .
It ’s not that great for more complex sites which experience digg / shashdot effect from time to time .
Google AppEngine would not be able to scale it rapid enough to handle 100 hits / second peak .
Does that mean that Goggle devs and architectors are stupid ?
Not at all .
It is really hard to allow scalability for software which is not specifically optimized for scalability .
They did their best , but the end result has limited applicability .
But if your task fits nicely in AppEngine limitations and storage performance / error rate – this might be perfect solution for you . :
Yes , I know it scales if you do not write a lot .
My goal was to look at the lower - level performance , the basics .
No matter how many nodes you would have , you will never get 20 - 80 ms response time ( which is essential for ' snappy ' web - application ) . :
Yes , I know that proper counter implementation is " sharded counter " .
In this article I was not benchmarking " counter " , but tested some lower - level performance .
Yes , we know that Datastore is slow , and it is even slower if you write to the same record .
If you do n't like this test , you may look at read - only and 10 read 1 write tests only . :
I have n't noticed any DDOS protection , probably it was too slow to get close to 500 hits / second hard limit and 7200 requests per minute limit .

The findings may explain why champagnes in particular taste so nice
It is champagne 's bubbles which give the drink flavour and fizz , and glasses that promote bubbles will improve the drinking experience , scientists say .
Research shows there are up to 30 times more flavour - enhancing chemicals in the bubbles than in the rest of the drink .
Wine experts say the finding changes completely our understanding of the role of bubbles in sparkling drinks .
The study is reported in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) .
Commenting on the research , Dr Jamie Goode , founder of wineanorak.com , said : " In the past , we thought that the carbon dioxide in the bubbles just gave the wine an acidic bite and a little tingle on the tongue , but this study shows that it is much more than this . "
FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from Today programme According to Dr Goode , the research demonstrates that using fluted glasses for sparkling wine and champagne is more than simply a matter of etiquette .
" Glasses that encourage more bubbles to come up are going to be better , " he says .
" At the bottom of proper champagne glasses , they put a little bit of ( rough ) glass , which encourages the nucleation of the flow of bubbles . "
Essence of champagne Dr Gerard Liger - Belair of Reims University , France , is one of the authors of the PNAS report .
He said : " It 's the very first time that we have been able to detect the fine chemistry of champagne aerosols which are really the essence of champagne . "
Dr Liger - Belair admits to having been " obsessed " with bubbles all his life .
He used an ultra-high resolution mass spectrometer to study the detailed chemical composition of the aerosols emerging from sparkling wine and champagne .
The research could lead to even better tasting sparkling drinks " The flavour of sparkling wine is determined by the contribution of hundreds and hundreds of different components .
We have to detect which of these components are important in the aerosols . "
Dr Liger - Belair and his colleague Philippe Schmitt - Kopplin , of the Institute for Ecological Chemistry and Molecular BioGeochemistry in Neuherberg , have studied five champagnes and high - quality sparkling wines so far .
They discovered that in all cases the bubbles were very much richer in the essential flavours of the wine .
According to Dr Goode , the findings may explain why champagnes and sparkling wines produced using the " champagne method " taste so nice .
" It seems that the traditional champagne method ensures that there is a fine stream of bubbles , which , presumably , will give you a more enduring aromatic lift . "
The next stage of the research is to compare the raw scientific data with the subjective reactions of expert wine tasters to discover the precise chemicals in the bubbles that give the best tasting drink , and then to explore the possibility of making champagne and sparkling wines taste even better .

THE new head of the antitrust division of America 's Department of Justice , Christine Varney , sees Thurman Arnold , a predecessor who took office in 1938 , as a model .
Arnold 's appointment created an uproar .
His book , “ The Folklore of Capitalism ” , published a year earlier , was widely seen as a satire on the inadequacy of the country 's antitrust laws .
He was , in his own words , “ responsible for the first sustained programme of antitrust enforcement on a nationwide scale . ”
This vigorous approach , in Ms Varney 's view , was an important part of “ that era 's legacy for modern economic policy ” .
In other words , Ms Varney means business .
In recent years “ the pendulum swung too far from Thurman Arnold 's legacy of vigorous enforcement , ” Ms Varney argued in May in one of her first speeches after Barack Obama appointed her .
Companies are likely to find themselves scrutinised at least as intensively as they were under the administration of Bill Clinton , when many senior antitrust officials in the justice department and Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) cut their teeth on a celebrated anti-monopoly lawsuit against Microsoft .
( Ms Varney was an adviser to the software giant 's chief victim , Netscape . )
Ms Varney 's comments before she got her current job have led to widespread speculation that she intends to make Google her version of Microsoft .
“ I think we 're going to continually see a problem , potentially , with Google , ” she said in a speech last year .
“ Companies will begin to allege that Google is discriminating , not allowing products to interoperate with other products . ”
The FTC has already begun an investigation into the overlap between the boards of Google and Apple , which doubtless contributed to the resignation earlier this month of Eric Schmidt , Google 's boss , from Apple 's board .
Yet updating antitrust for the digital age is but one part of Ms Varney 's ambitious agenda .
She believes that the failure of the administration of George Bush to enforce antitrust effectively contributed directly to the current economic crisis .
Whereas Arnold used competition policy to reinvigorate an economy afflicted by central planning , she plans to use it to combat the damage done to the economy by what she sees as excessive deregulation , including , it seems , that of the financial system .
Ms Varney has already thrown out the conclusions of a report published by her predecessor last September on Section 2 of the Sherman Act of 1890 , the sacred text of American antitrust policy .
The report was widely seen as a last - ditch attempt by the Bush administration to make it harder for its successor to pursue a determined anti-monopoly policy .
According to Ms Varney , it “ sounded a call of great scepticism regarding the ability of antitrust enforcers — as well as antitrust courts — to distinguish between anticompetitive acts and lawful conduct , and raised the related concern that the failure to make proper distinctions may lead to ‘ over - deterrence ' with regard to potentially pro-competitive conduct . ”
Whether a listless attitude to antitrust on the part of the Bush administration really contributed to the economy 's swoon is debatable , to say the least .
Although it did not mount a landmark case akin to the prosecution of Microsoft , there was plenty of activity on Mr Bush 's watch .
As Ms Varney acknowledges , cartels were pursued enthusiastically , with record convictions , jail terms and fines .
The break - up of a vitamins cartel was a notable victory .
Mr Bush 's justice department also fired a shot across Google 's bow , in effect squelching a mooted tie - up with Yahoo !
last year .
It was passive at times : it waved through mergers such as Whirlpool 's acquisition of a rival maker of white goods , Maytag , and the nautical combination of Carnival Cruises and Princess Cruises , which many experts felt it had reasonable grounds to block .
But the FTC was more energetic .
Indeed , relations between the two antitrust enforcers were cool , especially after the justice department refused to support the FTC 's effort to persuade the Supreme Court to bar drugs firms from striking deals with makers of generics to stop potential rivals from entering the market .
( These deals are likely to be revisited by the Obama administration . )
The FTC also adopted a particularly sweeping definition of market power when it resorted to the courts to block the organic retailing merger between Whole Foods Market and Wild Oats , only for the deal to go ahead after the firms made modest concessions .
The courts also overruled the Bush administration 's attempt to block the acquisition of PeopleSoft by a rival database firm , Oracle .
They are likely to be one of the main constraints on the Obama administration 's activist urges , especially if it seems to be pursuing a firm simply because it is big ( something Ms Varney says she will not do ) .
The Supreme Court , in particular , has made several decisions in recent years that have narrowed trustbusters ' room for manoeuvre .
Even if the courts prove unexpectedly pliant , trustbusters may still fall foul of one of the problems that dogged the prosecution of Microsoft : the difficulty of finding a workable remedy .
Fines would have had too little impact ; breaking up the firm would have been both drastic and not guaranteed to succeed in ending monopoly abuses .
Likewise , if Google were found some day to have abused its commanding position , it is hard to imagine how the cure could be better than the disease .
Addressing abuses in the finance industry may also prove difficult .
Even the biggest banks have a global market share of less than 10 % , so they do not fit the classic definition of a monopoly .
Instead , the worry is that some banks have simply become too big to fail .
The other big challenge facing America 's antitrust enforcers is possible disagreement within Mr Obama 's cabinet .
Ms Varney may want to put big firms ' feet to the fire , but there are plenty of voices whispering dire warnings in the president 's ear .
In particular , they say , given the wretched state of the economy , why risk upsetting the few bits that are growing strongly with gratuitous antitrust cases ?
Already , the Department of Transportation has ignored Ms Varney 's recommendation that it block the proposed integration of Continental Airlines into an international alliance .
The trustbusters , it seems , do not enjoy a monopoly over policy on business within the Obama administration .

IMP UPDATE FROM MAVIS :
CBO dismisses co-ops ' relevance
Amid the coverage of the boost the CBO 's scoring ( .pdf ) gave to Max Baucus 's bill yesterday , an element of the CBO report appears to have gone mostly unnoticed , a wonky friend points out :
The report paints co-ops — the leading alternative to a true public option — as basically irrelevant to the plan 's cost .
The co-ops are dealt with , in fact , in a passing parenthetical remark :
( The proposed co-ops had very little effect on the estimates of total enrollment in the exchanges or federal costs because , as they are described in the specifications , they seem unlikely to establish a significant market presence in many areas of the country or to noticeably affect federal subsidy payments . )
The CBO confirms what liberal co-op critics have charged :
That they will neither cover many people nor put downward pressure on costs , the two supposed benefits of the public option .
So far there had been no exception to its tacit rule that those who broke the law of probity must pay ; and every one was aware that even Beaufort and Beaufort 's wife would be offered up unflinchingly to this principle .
A man disposed to view human nature as it is , without either flattering its virtues or exaggerating its vices , will see sufficient ground of confidence in the probity of the Senate , to rest satisfied , not only that it will be impracticable to the Executive to corrupt or seduce a majority of its members , but that the necessity of its co-operation , in the business of appointments , will be a considerable and salutary restraint upon the conduct of that magistrate .
The buccaneer on the wave might relinquish his calling and become at once if he chose , a man of probity and piety on land ; nor , even in the full career of his reckless life , was he regarded as a personage with whom it was disreputable to traffic or casually associate .
Near the Cathedral I saw another instance of probity .
An old man was peddling dolls and toy fans .
" I am rejoiced to hear you speak of Monsieur d'Emery as calculated for a post which requires a man of probity .
I was really afraid that you were going to force that villain Particelli upon me . "
At one time she thought Antonio ought to have left carriage , horses , every thing , and flown to her rescue , as Charles had done ; but now she saw that the probity of his soul forbade it .
Six days were allowed as the utmost term , and D'Artagnan was sufficiently acquainted with the good - will , the good - humor , and the relative probity of these illustrious recruits , to be certain that not one of them would fail in his appointment .
As this gentleman was a native born citizen of the United States , a person of great probity and worth , he was selected by Mr .
There is that time , many years ago , when we did not act quite as honorably , quite as uprightly , as we perhaps should have done -- that unfortunate deviation from the path of strict probity we once committed , and in which , more unfortunate still , we were found out -- that act of folly , of meanness , of wrong .
Honest Tyckelaer , with a heart full of spite and malice , and with no particular plan settled in his mind , was one of the foremost , being paraded about by the Orange party like a hero of probity , national honour , and Christian charity .
This sum , Mr Clennam would be happy to learn , he had , through the promptitude of several friends who had a lively confidence in his probity , already raised , with the exception of a trifling balance of one pound seventeen and fourpence ; the loan of which balance , for the period of one month , would be fraught with the usual beneficent consequences .
DEET is the gold standard for insect repellent .
I ’ve covered it fairly extensively at the Bug Blog–it ’s the best thing we have to prevent a wide spectrum of insects from biting and transmitting an even wider spectrum of diseases .
So …Sigh .
Some new DEET research was published this month , and the media…well , has done a crappy job of covering it .
Here ’s the latest headline : Insect Repellent DEET is Neurotoxic .
One thing all the news stories have in common is a very alarmist tone , and reprinting freely from a press release that has very little connection to the reality of the paper .
When you look at the research , they did NOT find that DEET is neurotoxic , and it does NOT cause nerve damage .
Here ’s the take home :
If you decide not to use DEET insect repellent on the basis of this bad journalism , you are probably putting yourself in danger .
DEET is really the only repellent we have that can deal with ticks , and also protects against a wide range of biting flies .
The results in this paper are preliminary , need to be confirmed , and even IF confirmed , remain irrelevant to the average person who might want to use DEET .
Right , that ’s the message .
Now to the details .
Here is what the researchers ACTUALLY found :
Corbel , V. , Stankiewicz , M. , Pennetier , C. , Fournier , D. , Stojan , J. , Girard , E. , Dimitrov , M. , Molgo , J. , Hougard , J. , & Lapied , B. ( 2009 ) .
Evidence for inhibition of cholinesterases in insect and mammalian nervous systems by the insect repellent deet BMC Biology , 7 ( 1 ) DOI : 10.1186/1741-7007-7-47
“ electrophysiological studies were performed on isolated mouse phrenic hemidiaphragm muscles .
We showed that 500 µM deet prolonged by about threefold the decay time constant of synaptic potentials on endplate regions of the muscle fibre … ”
Wha ?
Ah .
Here ’s a translation into English ( by me ) :
We put DEET directly onto mouse cells and insect neurons in test tubes .
It had a mild inhibitory effect on an important enzyme .
The amount of DEET we used on mouse cells was 500 times the level that was active for insect cells .
The amounts we used were several orders of magnitude larger than you would ever encounter in life as a human user of DEET repellent .
The best breakdown of this story I ’ve seen yet was at Neuroskeptic .
In fact , Neuroskeptic saved me a whole lot of time and work by writing an excellent article that I will now swipe here and quote freely :
“ the fact that DEET can act as a cholinesterase inhibitor in the lab changes nothing .
It ’s still safe , at least until evidence comes along that it actually causes harm in people who use it .
You ca n’t show that something is harmful by doing an experiment showing how it could be harmful in theory . ”
This paper , when combined with decades of DEET usage data with very , very few adverse affects reported , is really not news at all .
It ’s interesting , sure .
But it ’s not at all relevant to the average American trying not to be bitten while BBQing .
I also agree with this statement from Neuroskeptic :
“ To be fair , there is one cause for concern in the paper – in the experiments , DEET interacted with other cholinesterase inhibitors , leading to an amplified effect .
That suggests that DEET could become toxic in combination with cholinesterase inhibitor insecticides , but again , the risk is theoretical . ”
In some situations , DEET is combined with other compounds that it could , potentially , interact with–but that almost never happens in the US .
Those situations are more common in military and tropical uses .
This is a good note to be careful , and to monitor that in the future .
There is also some ( laboratory ) evidence that sunscreen can increase absorption of DEET , and the two should be combined with caution .
If you are using DEET sensibly , you have nothing to worry about .
What is sensible DEET use ?
Borrowing from The American Pediatric Society , as well as my own experience :
Do not use DEET under clothing .
Put it ON your clothing .
Do not use DEET on the hands of young children ; avoid applying to areas around the eyes and mouth .
Do not use DEET over cuts , wounds or irritated skin .
Wash treated skin with soap and water after returning indoors ; wash treated clothing .
Avoid spraying in enclosed areas ; do not use DEET near food .
20 % DEET is enough for nearly all US situations .
You can buy higher concentrations , but do n’t .
Do n’t spray DEET on spandex ( it ’s a long story , but trust me .
This wo n’t end well for you )
Do n’t drink , smoke , or otherwise do butt - stupid things with DEET .
It ’s safe , but only if you play by the rules .
A press report on August 10 revealed that the government of Italy is planning to modify if not dispense with its post - World War II constitutional limitations on conducting offensive military operations ; that is , to reverse a 61 - year ban on waging war .
The news story , reminding readers that “ Italy ’s post - World War II constitution places stringent limits on the country ’s military engagements , ” stated the Italian government intends to introduce a new military code “ specifically for missions abroad , ” one that – in a demonstration of evasiveness and verbal legerdemain alike – would be “ neither of peace nor of war . ” [ 1 ]
On August 10 and 11 , respectively , the nation ’s Defense Minister Ignazio La Russa and Foreign Minister Franco Frattini were interviewed in the daily Corriere della Sera in in tandem they bemoaned what they described as undue restrictions on the Italian armed forces in performing their combat roles in NATO ’s war in Afghanistan .
Commenting on La Russa ’s and Frattini ’s assertions , another news account summarized them as follows :
“ Italy ’s 2,800 soldiers operate under a military peace code , which largely restricts them to shooting back if they are attacked .
Changes could give the troops heavier equipment and allow them to go on the offensive . ”
Frattini is quoted as saying , “ We need a code for the missions that aim to bring peace , which cannot be achieved only through actions for civilians but also through real military actions . ” [ 2 ]
The tortuous illogicality of that claim is an attempt to circumvent both the letter and the spirit of Article 11 of the 1948 Italian Constitution which reads in part that “ Italy repudiates war as an instrument offending the liberty of the peoples and as a means for settling international disputes . ”
The rest of the Article includes , and in doing so anticipates the nation ’s inclusion in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization the following year , “ it agrees to limitations of sovereignty … . ”
Article 11 is emblematic of similar ones in the post - World War II constitutions adopted by , or rather imposed on , those powers responsible for unleashing history ’s deadliest war in Europe and Asia :
The members of the Berlin - Rome - Tokyo Axis or Tripartite Pact .
The 1949 Constitution of the Federal Republic , amended and extended to all of the country after unification in 1990 , contains a Ban on preparing a war of aggression , Article 26 , which reads : Activities tending and undertaken with the intent to disturb peaceful relations between nations , especially to prepare for aggressive war , are unconstitutional .
They shall be made a punishable offense .
The 1947 U.S. - authored Japanese constitution contains an equivalent , Article 9 , which states :
“ Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order , the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes .
“ In order to accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph , land , sea , and air forces , as well as other war potential , will never be maintained .
The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized . ”
U.S. military , especially air , bases in Germany , Italy and Japan have been used in every major military campaign waged by the Pentagon from the Korean War to the current one in Afghanistan for basing bombers and for the transit of troops , weapons and equipment .
So despite constitutional requirements to repudiate and renounce and bans against preparing for war , the three former Axis nations have indeed been partners to a series of armed conflicts for sixty years .
But for most of that period , indeed for almost a half century , the nations ’ legal prohibitions against direct military aggression have been observed even in the breach .
Italy was a founding member of NATO in 1949 , though unlike most others did n’t send troops for the Korean War .
Along with the United States , Britain , Canada , France , the Netherlands , Belgium and Luxembourg did .
Greece and Turkey deployed contingents as a precondition for NATO membership , which they received in 1952 , but West Germany , which joined in 1955 , did n’t .
Although Australia , New Zealand , the Philippines and Thailand supplied troops , Japan did n’t .
The war proscriptions were abandoned by two of the three nations , Germany and Italy , in NATO ’s war against Yugoslavia in early 1999 .
Both countries supplied military aircraft for the 78 - day air war and the U.S. and NATO air base at Aviano served as the main hub for daily bombing runs against military targets , non-military infrastructure and civilians .
U.S. , British , Canadian , Spanish , Portuguese and other warplanes operated out of the base .
The semantic acrobatics of the current Italian Foreign Minister Frattini in attempting to deny that war is war have already been examined , and comparable statements by German and Italian cabinet ministers and parliamentarians in 1999 were no less convoluted and transparently false .
Germany and Italy had gone to war against a nation ( with no troops outside its own borders ) for the first time since the days of Hitler and Mussolini and , moreover , against a nation that the two fascist leaders had attacked 59 years earlier .
The post -World War II , post - Nuremberg restriction against military aggression by the defeated Axis powers was violated and for the past decade Germany , Italy and Japan have continued asserting themselves as military powers on a regional and international scale , culminating in the three nations participating in various degrees in the U.S. - NATO war in Afghanistan currently .
Germany now has the maximum amount of troops parliamentary limitations – at least for the time being – allow : 4,500 and another 300 manning NATO AWACS recently deployed for the escalation of the war .
It has the fourth largest contingent in Afghanistan after the U.S. , Britain and Canada .
Italy has the sixth largest amount of troops , 3,250 , in command of Western Afghanistan near the Iranian border , and just as the 1999 war against Yugoslavia was the first air war either nation had engaged in since World War II , so Afghanistan is the first ground war .
Germany has lost 38 soldiers so far and Italy 15 .
A poll conducted by a major Italian daily in late July showed that 56 % of Italians want a withdrawal of their nation ’s troops from the Afghan war theater , but Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , Foreign Minister Frattini and Defense Minister La Russa insist they will stay and have recently added 500 more troops and committed to deploying more Predator drones , Tornado warplanes and military helicopters .
Late last month defense chief La Russa said , “ It is possible we will also increase the number of helicopters to have better aerial coverage , as well as deploying our Tornadoes offensively . ” [ 3 ]
At the same time Foreign Minister Frattini spoke in a similar vein : “ We will increase the use of Predator ( unmanned surveillance aircraft ) and Tornado ( fighters ) , not just for reconnaissance but for real coverage ( of
troops ) . ”
An Italian news account at the time added , “ He also said Italy would reinforce the armour of its Lince troop carriers and send new generation armoured vehicles . ” [ 4 ]
Five previous articles in this series have documented Germany ’s rise as a post - Cold War global military power [ 5,6,7,8,9 ] , including the ongoing transformation of the Bundeswehr into an “ international intervention force , ” [ 10 ] and the Merkel administration ’s policy “ to drop some of [ Germany ’s ] post - World War II inhibitions about robust security measures , including the use of military force abroad and at home ” [ 11 ] and a 2006 German Defense Ministry White Paper demanding that the army “ be thoroughly restructured into an intervention force ” [ 12 ] , with one of its authors stating “ it is time that Germany moved on from its postwar inhibitions about force . ” [ 13 ]
On August 8 , weeks after “ German troops embarked on their largest military offensive since World War II in Kunduz , ” it was reported that “ German Defence Minister Franz Josef Jung said in a newspaper interview … that the country ’s armed forces could be in Afghanistan for up to 10 more years . ” [ 14 ]
That the German government is openly advocating the use of its army at home as well as abroad , and did just that by deploying Bundeswehr forces in Kehl this April against anti-NATO protesters during the 60th anniversary Alliance summit , was dangerous ground first trod by the Berlusconi government in Italy a year ago when 3,000 troops were deployed in Rome , Milan , Naples and Turin against immigrants and Roma ( gypsy ) communities as well as – allegedly at least – crime syndicates .
The use of the military for domestic purposes is a disturbingly reminiscent of practices not seen in Italy and Germany since the era of Mussolini and Hitler .
Two months afterwards it was reported in an article called “ NATO pours rent money into Mafia coffers ” that in Naples , where NATO ’s Allied Joint Force Command Naples was established in 2004 , “ government funding earmarked to support NATO end[ed ] up in the pockets of Italy ’s most violent criminal organisation . ” [ 15 ]
Another news story last November recounted this :
“ The head of Naples ’ anti-mafia task force , Franco Roberti , censured NATO and U.S. officials for knowingly leasing houses to suspected mob bosses in a story published in the Italian daily Corriere della Sera .
Rent paid by Americans and NATO personnel garner landlords between 1,500 and 3,000 euros a month — fees that can be two or three times above the market value . ” [ 16 ]
Italian troops were back on the streets of the nation ’s cities and the Casalese camorra was not only unmolested but enriched .
Last year Berlusconi also confirmed that the plans reached during his previous tenure as prime minister to expand the U.S. Camp Ederle at Vicenza with the nearby Dal Molin airport into “ the biggest American military base outside the US ” [ 17 ] would continue apace .
Camp Ederle already hosts 6,000 U.S. troops and will soon house all six battalions of the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team , some currently in Germany .
The 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team has been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan in recent years .
Late last July U.S. troops from the Vicenza - based Southern European Task Force ( Airborne ) contributed to a force of 1,000 soldiers deployed to Georgia for the NATO Immediate Response 2008 exercises – the largest number of American troops deployed to the Caucasus nation at one time – to train the armed forces of their host nation for a war with Russia that would ensue within days .
“ U.S. personnel responsible for training members of the Georgian military remain stationed inside the volatile country , where fighting erupted Friday [ August 8 ] between Russia and Georgia over the breakaway province of South Ossetia .
“ The U.S. European Command said on Monday that there were no plans at this time to withdraw the U.S. military trainers from the country . ” [ 18 ]
In January of 2008 the Italian government announced that it was building a highway to connect Vicenza with the Aviano air base .
“ Airborne soldiers based at Caserma Ederle in Vicenza use Aviano for training and for hooking up with planes for long deployments :
The 173rd Airborne Brigade ’s last three deployments downrange have all involved launches from Aviano . ” [ 19 ]
Decades - long interpretations of the Japanese Constitution ’s Article 9 against remilitarization have agreed that the nation could not rearm for military actions abroad and could not engage in what is euphemistically called collective self - defense .
The first is a self - evident prohibition against deploying troops , warships and warplanes outside of Japanese territory and waters to participate in armed hostilities .
The second is a ban on entering into bilateral and multilateral military treaties and alliances that obligate Japan to aid other nations engaged in war and join programs like the U.S. - led global missile shield project .
Over the past eight years successive Japanese governments have violated both components of the constitutional ban on stationing troops in conflict zones and on entering into joint defense arrangements which are in truth only partially defensive in nature .
Tokyo first tested the waters on stationing troops abroad when it deployed 600 soldiers to East Timor in 2002 to join those from Australia , Argentina , Bangladesh , Brazil , Britain , Canada , China , Fiji , Finland , France , Italy , Japan , Malaysia , New Zealand , Norway , Pakistan , the Philippines , Portugal , Singapore , South Korea , Sweden , Thailand and the United States .
The following December the government of Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi authorized 600 soldiers and hundreds of more support personnel to be sent to Iraq nine months after the invasion of the country by the U.S. and Britain .
The Iraqi deployment marked the first time that Japanese military forces were sent to an active war zone since World War II .
Much as with Italian and German leaders who cannot pronounce the word war even while prosecuting one , Tokyo called its deployment force the Japanese Iraq Reconstruction and Support Group .
The name aside , Japaneses troops were stationed in support of allies who had invaded Iraq in violation of international law and without United Nations sanction and were at the time conducting large - scale combat operations .
The nation ’s soldiers remained there until 2006 when the focus of the U.S. and its NATO allies started shifting back to Afghanistan .
In 2006 Japan compensated for its troop withdrawal by providing the occupation forces airlift operations in Iraq , then ended that mission last December when the Afghan War emerged as the uncontested priority of its Western military allies .
Japan has supported the latter war from its inception and “ Despite its pacifist constitution , Japan has participated in an Indian Ocean naval mission since 2001 that provides fuel and other logistical support to the US - led coalition fighting in Afghanistan . ” [ 20 ]
It provided the majority of fuel to U.S. and NATO warships in the Indian Ocean , including those firing Tomahawk cruise missiles into Afghanistan .
Japan briefly withdrew its naval forces at the end of 2007 , but redeployed them a year later where they remain in support of the world ’s major war .
What is remarkably still referred to as pacifist Japan , then , has actively supported the West ’s last two wars .
In an interview last month with the U.S. Armed Forces newspaper Stars and Stripes Japanese Democratic Party Diet member Keiichiro Asao , touted to become the nation ’s next defense minister should his party , substantially ahead in current national polls , win the next election , spoke of the Afghan War and said “ If peace talks proved successful in part of Afghanistan , even if other areas were still combat zones , ‘ then we might send ground troops to that area to help build back civil society . ' ” [ 21 ]
Troops on the ground in the world ’s preeminent theater of war would strip away the remaining vestiges of Japan ’s post - World War II demilitarization and the nation would fully join the ranks of Germany and Italy as war belligerents .
And just that has been planned for years , as in January of 2007 the Japan Defense Agency was transformed into the Ministry of Defense , a ministry that had n’t existed since the nation ’s defeat in World War II .
In the same month it was reported that then Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Defense Minister Fumio Kyuma were “ considering authorizing [ Japan ’s ] troops to launch pre-emptive strikes during international peacekeeping operations ” and planned “ to study ways to ease the constitutional ban on Japan to use force to defend its allies in so - called ‘ acts of collective self - defense . ’
“ The government plans to achieve the goal by changing the interpretation of the constitution , ” stated the Yomiuri daily newspaper . [ 22 ]
Three months later a report titled “ Japan To Consider Fighting for Allies Under Attack ” detailed that “ Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe is leaning toward allowing Japan to exercise the right to collective self - defense in four cases , ” which include “ the use of Japan ’s missile defense system against a ballistic missile attack on an allied country , such as the U.S. , ” the Kyodo News Agency revealed . [ 23 ]
The other three instances in which Tokyo would be prepared to violate the constitutional ban against so - called collective defense are cases of “ a counterattack when a warship sailing along with a Japanese vessel comes under attack , or when a military unit in a multinational forces is attacked , and in some situations when Japan is working as part of a UN peacekeeping operation . ” [ 24 ]
It ’s worth recalling that Prime Minister Abe continued the tradition of his predecessor Koizumi in paying annual visits to the Yasukuni shrine where Japanese war dead including 14 convicted World War II era war criminals are buried .
“ ‘ It ’s not appropriate for the government to specifically draw a conclusion ’ on the war responsibility of the war criminals , ” Abe told the Japanese Diet on October 3 , 2006 . [ 25 ]
The visits by Japanese prime ministers to the shrine from 2001 - 2006 outraged China , the two Koreas , Thailand , the Philippines and other nations that had already “ specifically draw [ n ] a conclusion ” about the war crimes perpetrated against their countries and peoples and the rehabilitation of the guilty parties in a bid to revive Japanese militarism .
The most dangerous application of Japanese plans for preemptive military attacks and the first of the four scenarios laid out by the government in 2007 to justify joint military action is that pertaining to so - called missile defense , which in fact is incorporating Japan into a US - led global interceptor missile grid which includes land , air and sea components and which will be integrated with the deployment of surveillance satellites and missiles in space .
On August 11 the commander of the Russian Air Force , Col. Gen. Alexander Zelin , warned that “ By 2030 … foreign countries , particularly the United States , will be able to deliver coordinated high - precision strikes from air and space against any target on the whole territory of Russia . ” [ 26 ]
The following day Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi addressed the 65 - nation Conference on Disarmament in Geneva and warned against an “ arms race in outer space , ” stating that “ Outer space is now facing the looming danger of weaponization ” and “ Countries should neither develop missile defense systems that undermine global strategic stability nor deploy weapons in outer space . ” [ 27 ]
In 2005 the U.S. and Japan agreed to establish a missile defense facility at the American Yokota Air Base in western Tokyo .
A local news sources , Kyodo , said of the project that “ Japan ’s success will have an impact on the nuclear potential of China and Russia in East Asia .
There is no doubt that the two countries will step up their efforts to develop missiles with a higher performance . ” [ 28 ]
In May of 2007 Pentagon chief Robert Gates “ urged Japan to declare the right to collective defense so its missile defense shield can be used to intercept North Korean ballistic missiles targeted at the United States … . ” [ 29 ]
North Korea is the pretext employed to expand the global missile shield system with its threat of nuclear blackmail and threat of a first strike against Russia and China to the East .
However , as reported of the Gates ’ initiative at the time , “ The U.S. demand on collective defense reflects its strategy to boost its deterrence toward China and also carries Washington ’s hope that Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe will partially allow the use of such a right by revising the Constitution . ” [ 30 ]
In the same month , May of 2007 , it was revealed that “ Japan ’s defense ministry has been providing U.S. forces with intelligence gathered by its Air Self - Defense Force ’s early warning radar network since late April ” and that “ The ministry began permanent linking of the ASDF ’s intelligence gathering network with the headquarters of the U.S. 5th Air Force at Yokota Air Base in Tokyo before the two countries agreed to boost information - sharing for missile defense at a top security meeting in Washington on May 1 … . ” [ 31 ]
Two years ago the ruling Liberal Party completed post - Cold War plans to reverse the situation where “ Japan ’s pacifist Constitution bans warfare and overseas military action .
The Japanese government ’s current interpretation is that the Constitution prohibits Japan from exercising the right to defend an ally under attack ” [ 32 ] .
That is , Article 9 will be either eviscerated of any real force or scrapped altogether .
As Japan intensifies its demand that Russia ’s Kuril Islands be ceded to it in a resurgence of post - World War II revanchism , Tokyo has joined its former allies in Berlin and Rome in casting off constraints placed on the use of its military abroad , including in “ preemptive ” actions , imposed on it after World War II .
With the collapse of the socialist bloc in Eastern Europe a generation ago and with NATO moving it to take over former Warsaw Pact territory , many demons that had lain dormant for decades have been awakened from their slumber , including unabashed militarism , irredentist and other demands to redraw borders , and World World II revisionism and revanchism .
And Fascism .
In February of 2007 the Bucharest Court of Appeal in Romania , which joined the German - Italian - Japanese Axis during World War II , ruled that the participation of 800,000 Romanian troops in Hitler ’s invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 was a “ war for the liberation of Bessarabia and Bucovina ” ( modern day Moldova ) . [ 33 ]
In late July of this year the mayor of the Romanian city of Constanta , Radu Mazare , wore a Nazi military uniform at a fashion show in the city and said “ I wanted to dress like a general from the Wehrmacht because I have always liked this uniform , and have admired the strict organization of the German army . ” [ 34 ]
Two years earlier Rein Lang , the Justice Minister of Estonia , a member in good standing of NATO and the European Union , celebrated his fiftieth birthday in pub in a “ Hitler night ” celebration which included a one - man play called Adolf in which the lone actor recited “ Hitler ’s monologue before [ his ] suicide with a swastika in the background .
In this monologue the Fuhrer called on his allies to ‘ further promote ideas of the Third Reich . ' ” [ 35 ]
This July 26 veterans of the Estonian SS 20th Division celebrated a 1944 battle with the Soviet army in the latest of a series of annual commemorations of the Nazi past .
The events included a march and “ Supporters of fascism from the Baltic states , Holland , Norway , Denmark and even from Georgia took part in the parade . ” [ 36 ]
As a Russian commentator said of trends in the country , “ People who make no attempt to conceal their appreciation of Nazism and Nazi ideology are running Estonia . ” [ 37 ]
Three months before 300 Latvians marched in the annual Legionnaires Day parade which honors the nation ’s Waffen SS veterans who “ took part in punitive operations and mass killings of Jews , Belorussians and Latvians . ” [ 38 ]
Latvia is also a member of NATO and the EU .
The yearly marches are staged in the capital of Riga and although not endorsed by the government the latter provides police protection to the Nazi sympathizers and has arrested anti-fascist protesters in the past .
The prototype for this fascist resurgence was Croatia in 1991 with the rehabilitation and glorification of the Nazi- allied Ustashe and the new brown plague has even spread to Ukraine , where last year President Victor Yushchenko , product of the 2004 “ Orange Revolution ” and a U.S. client whose poll ratings recently have sunk to under 1 % , “ conferred posthumously the title of Hero of Ukraine on Roman Shukhevich , one of the chieftains of Ukrainian Insurgent Army , which fought along with the Third Reich , and has signed a decree on celebrating the day of the Insurgent Army ’s formation . ” [ 39 ]
In his waning days Yushchenko is intensifying efforts to drag his nation into NATO despite overwhelming popular opposition and has officiated over developments like the erection of statues in honor of Stepan Bandera , leader of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army .
With the return of Germany , Italy and Japan to waging and supporting wars and the revival of Nazi sentiments in Europe a student of the future could be forgiven for thinking that the Axis powers were the victors and not the losers of World War II and that the Nuremberg trials had never occurred .

Bans on lighting up indoors , tobacco advertising stopped , under - the - counter sales , the war against smoking goes further every year .
But could plain , white packets be the nuclear option against the industry ?
Marketing cigarettes used to be a lot easier .
There were brands that were smooth , ones that were tasty , while others made you attractive to women , or men .
You were " never alone with a Strand " .
Kools were " as cool and as clean as a breath of fresh air " .
Camels were even sold on the basis that doctors smoked them .
When you think of someone who smokes Benson and Hedges or Marlboro , there are very different images - the sophisticate versus the cowboy
Becky Freeman
University of Sydney Now , in the UK and many other jurisdictions , cigarette advertising is largely banned .
From tomorrow , it will be a legal requirement for all packs of cigarettes to carry a graphic health warning , showing such images as diseased lungs and deeply yellowed teeth .
And on 12 October , the government 's health bill could bring in a ban on tobacco displays in newsagents and other shops in England , Wales and Northern Ireland .
Similar plans are going through the Scottish Parliament .
But the anti-smoking lobby is not satisfied .
They want the nuclear option .
They want " plain packaging " .
Brand images Recall all the famous brands and their liveries , the purple of Silk Cut , the red of Marlboro , the gold of Benson & Hedges and the two tone red stripe of Embassy .
Now imagine them all in plain white packets with the name of the cigarettes in a standardised font ... and a prominent health warning of course .
All packs now have to carry graphic images of tobacco - related conditions
It would reduce smoking by stopping people having brand attachment , says Sydney University 's Becky Freeman , co-author of The Case for the Plain Packaging of Tobacco Products .
" When you think of someone who smokes Benson and Hedges or Marlboro , there are very different images - the sophisticate versus the cowboy .
Take that away and you do n't have people expressing identity through cigarette brands . "
The drive to plain packaging was started by anti-smoking activists in Canada in the 1990s , but it has n't been enacted by any government .
Ms Freeman is still optimistic .
" It is just a matter of time before one country does it , then it will be like dominoes . "
The British anti-tobacco group
Ash is also in favour of the move .
Pastel colours " It would draw attention more to the health warnings rather than being distracted by the branding , " says Amanda Sandford , research manager .
What particularly concerns the anti-smoking groups is the use of subtle cues in cigarette branding .
After the EU banned the use of such terms as " light " and " low tar " , because they wrongly suggest some cigarettes are less harmful than others , consumers continued to identify these " qualities " through associations such as silver and pastel coloured packets .
Once upon a time cigarette adverts espoused their positive qualities " The research on the existing packaging shows that this is really the last route tobacco companies can use to promote their brands to the consumers , " says Ms Sandford .
" Now we have an advertising ban there is no doubt the industry is using the packets themselves to promote the brand .
The packs give out certain messages . "
The tobacco industry vehemently opposes the idea of plain packaging .
One unintended consequence would be a rise in smuggling and potentially harmful counterfeit cigarettes in the market , says Catherine Armstrong , of British American Tobacco .
" At the moment they have to go to a lot of trouble to make the cigarettes look like the brands . "
The measure would also be likely to be the subject of legal challenges from tobacco firms , as the packaging design represents part of their intellectual property .
The anti-smoking advocates say their legal advice suggests otherwise .
Government opposition " Cigarettes are still a legal item which can be sold .
People have a right to make a choice of brand , " says Ms Armstrong .
There is no evidence that plain packaging would cut smoking among the young , says Ms Armstrong .
The public health minister Gillian Merron has indicated that the government is not in favour of plain packaging .
Recent years have seen a wave of anti-smoking measures
She recently told the Commons : " No studies have been undertaken to show that plain packaging of tobacco would cut smoking uptake among young people or enable those who want to quit to do so . "
So , the clause on plain packaging added while the bill was in the House of Lords may fail .
And , according to Ms Armstrong , the tobacco industry is not quaking with fear about a wave of plain packaging legislation .
But anti-smoking activists think otherwise .
" The tobacco companies themselves are screaming , " says Ms Freeman .
" They are putting their ducks in a row to combat it . "
And indeed , the agenda for the upcoming tobacco trade show Tab Info Asia 2009 , seems to suggest there is concern in the industry .
One workshop is described as " John Luik challenges you , working in teams , to come up with ingenious ways of operating in an increasingly regulated , plain - pack , dark market environment " .
And tobacco firms have responded in ingenious ways in the past to restrictions .
When firms in the UK were no longer allowed positive messages in adverts , they turned it to their advantage .
The slashed purple silk of Silk Cut and the oddly - placed gold packets of Benson & Hedges are two of the best - known advertising campaigns ever .
Viral marketing Iain Ellwood , head of consulting at Interbrand , say further restrictions like plain packs could even play into the hands of the tobacco firms .
" The current trend is for word of mouth campaigning , social media and viral marketing .
" There is a potential short term blip in debranding the packs .
Having these bland , basic packs might be soon as cool . "
Of course , the firms may fear maintaining separate brand identities will be hard to maintain in the long term .
" If you lose all of that they can't navigate your offer quite as well so less likely to buy , " says Mr Ellwood .
The drive to plain packaging is part of the " denormalisation " of smoking , says Simon Clark of smoking rights pressure group Forest .
" It is a form of commercial censorship .
No other product comes in plain white packaging .
For some people it will make smoking slightly illicit .
It will make smoking cool again . "
Here is a selection of your comments .
It just goes to show there is no limit to the steps that a small group of obsessives will take to persecute smokers .
I 'm fully expecting to be called soon to apply for my smokers licence , cigarette ration book and ' smoker ' tattoo to be applied to my forehead .
Listen carefully - I know the risks , life is a risk , we all die one day .
Get over it , and move on .
Road traffic deaths are a major cause of early death in the UK - so lets make all cars painted white with pictures of car crashes on .
Have adverts for them banned and all information about fuel consumption and safety censored .
Fatty foods are a major cause of early death in the UK - lets make burger bars sell their burgers in white boxes with gory pictures of clogged arteries on .
Have adverts for them banned and demand they are hidden from shop display and censor any information about calories and fat .
Bob Smith , Reading , UK
As a smoker I can assure you that I was not so feeble minded as to be lured into smoking by pretty packaging , nicotine is the addiction and it was considered cool to smoke ( all the adverts said so ) when I began .
If the government is so concerned about public health why not go all out and impose a total prohibition throughout the British Isles ?
This of course could never and would never be contemplated by the government because the revenue lost in taxes would be tremendous .
Teresa Hewitson , Ashington , Northumberland I 'm not a smoker , I quit several years ago , but frankly this war on smoke is getting a little out of hand .
firstly the smoking of tobacco products is perfectly legal in this country .
Therefore it is completely unjustifiable to attempt to tell someone where and when they can do it .
This would impact on the civil liberties of the aforementioned smoker .
Vices ( of all legal natures ) are a huge source of income for the UK government , and I feel they are trying to have it both ways , they want the tax revenue but they also want to be seen as progressive health aware thinkers .
IT is my view that you cannot be both , either smoking is ok or it is n't .
The government has no right to dictate the things we can legally do in this country .
Mike , Worcester I do not think this is a good idea , if all cigarettes came in identical packaging it would n't make me stop smoking .
I also think that taking brand loyalty out of the equation will cause a price war between the tobacco companies .
I would no longer go and ask for a specific brand but for the cheapest .
This would cause the price of cigarettes to plummet and young people would by them because they are so cheap .
Sorry ASH i think your shooting yourself in the foot here !
Dave , Glasgow , Scotland I am a smoker however I welcome the day where there is an outright ban on tobacco products in the UK .
It is high time that the government banned tobacco in all forms because unlike alcohol there is no safe limit in terms of consumption I have myself health related issues caused by smoking .
John Baetke , Guildford
Tar black with the word " CANCER " in big black letters front and rear will do it .
Ca n't we have a campaign where we all squirt vile perfume over smokers .
Why should they have the monopoly of stinking the place out and making us stink too ?
MadMole , London Maybe it would help if cigarettes and tobacco were sold only in chemists / pharmacies , where health professionals were on hand to offer advice and guidance for those who wanted to reduce or quit their habit ?
This would also help reduce the chances for underage smokers to purchase them .
Jai Gomer , Wales , UK
As a founding member of Lesmahagow & Area Community First Responders , I can argue the case against the smoking world .
We are a group of volunteers who are trained ( just like paramedics ) to respond to 999 medical emergencies , where in so many cases smoking is the root cause of our public 's issues .
Eradicating the advertising of tobacco will reduce these calls out full stop , and help improve the health of our small village , giving us , the Community First Responders , more time to spend with our loved ones , instead of attending these " smoking related " call outs .
I believe taking branding off cigarettes and cigars will help towards this target , but , as a smoker myself , I will not change my own habits .
Kevin Avis , Lesmahagow
The most iconic cigarette branding was the black and gold of the JPSs ( as used on the packets and on the Lotus F1 cars ) , followed closely by the red and white of Marlboro ( as used on the old McLaren F1 cars ) .
Even now , 30 years later , they 're instantly recognisable , so it must be the case that cigarette branding has an impact .
However , as a non-smoker , I 'm not sure that reducing packaging to all white will reduce smoking - it'll just mean that people buy the cheapest brand , sparking off a price - war .
Bryn Roberts , Richmond , Yorkshire , UK Perhaps all cars could be " unbranded " as well .
I do not know of ANY car that does not pollute on a much larger basis than a cigarette or 20 .
Banning smoking found a ... saving of lives .
Banning vehicle pollution may save a lot more .
Those who rant on the anti-smoking campaign should also set the agenda by giving up their car .
Kelly , Durham UK
" One unintended consequence would be a rise in smuggling and potentially harmful counterfeit cigarettes in the market , says Catherine Armstrong , of British American Tobacco . "
As opposed to the perfectly harmless cigarettes currently on the market !
Tony Bell , Warrington , UK Great news .
I wont get jeered at for smoking the cheapest cigarettes I can found now .
As long as the brand name is printed on the pack , bring it on .
Steve N , Birmingham , UK I 'm sixteen years old and I smoke .
Personally , the packaging of a certain brand of cigarettes would not deter me from buying them .
I do n't like brands such as Lambert and Butler or JSP as I do n't like the taste .
I smoke Marlborough lights because I enjoy the taste .
Maybe for others it is a case of looking good with a certain brand of cigarettes in their hands , but I do not think that it would have an impact as much as hoped .
Megan , York
Anyone else remember those almost plain black and almost plain white packs called Death and Death Light ?
They were great and for the short time they were available I reckon they must have been one of the most successful brands on the market .
This is exactly what 'll happen with this half - baked idea .

Press release :
Harvard study finds nearly 45,000 excess deaths annually linked to lack of health coverage
Lack of health insurance now more lethal
A study published online today estimates nearly 45,000 annual deaths are associated with lack of health insurance .
That figure is about two and a half times higher than an estimate from the Institute of Medicine ( IOM ) in 2002 .
The new study , " Health Insurance and Mortality in U.S. Adults , " appears in today 's online edition of the American Journal of Public Health .
The Harvard - based researchers found that uninsured , working - age Americans have a 40 percent higher risk of death than their privately insured counterparts , up from a 25 percent excess death rate found in 1993 .
Lead author Dr. Andrew Wilper , who worked at Harvard Medical School when the study was done and who now teaches at the University of Washington Medical School , said , " The uninsured have a higher risk of death when compared to the privately insured , even after taking into account socioeconomics , health behaviors and baseline health .
We doctors have many new ways to prevent deaths from hypertension , diabetes and heart disease - but only if patients can get into our offices and afford their medications . "
The study , which analyzed data from national surveys carried out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , assessed death rates after taking education , income and many other factors including smoking , drinking and obesity into account .
It estimated that lack of health insurance causes 44,789 excess deaths annually .
Previous estimates from the IOM and others had put that figure near 18,000 .
The methods used in the current study were similar to those employed by the IOM in 2002 , which in turn were based on a pioneering 1993 study of health insurance and mortality .
Deaths associated with lack of health insurance now exceed those caused by many common killers such as kidney disease .
An increase in the number of uninsured and an eroding medical safety net for the disadvantaged likely explain the substantial increase in the number of deaths associated with lack of insurance .
The uninsured are more likely to go without needed care .
Another factor contributing to the widening gap in the risk of death between those who have insurance and those who do n't is the improved quality of care for those who can get it .
The research , carried out at the Cambridge Health Alliance and Harvard Medical School , analyzed U.S. adults under age 65 who participated in the annual National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys ( NHANES ) between 1986 and 1994 .
Respondents first answered detailed questions about their socioeconomic status and health and were then examined by physicians .
The CDC tracked study participants to see who died by 2000 .
The study found a 40 percent increased risk of death among the uninsured .
As expected , death rates were also higher for males ( 37 percent increase ) , current or former smokers ( 102 percent and 42 percent increases ) , people who said that their health was fair or poor ( 126 percent increase ) , and those that examining physicians said were in fair or poor health ( 222 percent increase ) .
Dr. Steffie Woolhandler , study co-author , professor of medicine at Harvard and a primary care physician in Cambridge , Mass . , noted : " Historically , every other developed nation has achieved universal health care through some form of nonprofit national health insurance .
Our failure to do so means that all Americans pay higher health care costs , and 45,000 pay with their lives . "
She added : " Even the most liberal version of the House bill would have left 17 million uninsured , according to the Congressional Budget Office .
The whittled down Senate bill will be worse - leaving tens of millions uninsured , and tens of thousands dying because of lack of care .
Without the administrative savings only attainable through a Medicare - for - all , single - payer reform - real universal coverage will remain unaffordable .
Politicians are protecting insurance industry profits by sacrificing American lives . "
Dr. David Himmelstein , study co-author and an associate professor of medicine at Harvard , remarked , " The Institute of Medicine , using older studies , estimated that one American dies every 30 minutes from lack of health insurance .
Even this grim figure is an underestimate - now one dies every 12 minutes . "

I found this video today , and it does an amazing job of explaining the public plan , and knocking down some of the sillier counter - arguments against it .
It might be a bit remedial to some of the experts here , but it 's a great video to forward to others .
“ The most important thing to do after being diagnosed is to get a dietary consultation , ” Dr. Murray said .
With planning , you can learn to base your diet on fruits , vegetables , rice and potatoes .
“ I have some patients who rarely use those special gluten - free products , ” he said .
Get in the habit of reading labels , advises Elaine Monarch , executive director of the Celiac Disease Foundation , a nonprofit organization in Studio City , Calif .
Soy sauce , for instance , often has wheat protein as a filler .
But Ms. Monarch found a brand of light soy sauce at her local grocery with no wheat that cost much less than one specifically marked as gluten - free .
“ There are often alternatives to specialty products , but you have to look , ” she said .
Gluten - free bread is more expensive than traditional bread and often less palatable .
And that holds for many gluten - free items .
Some people , including Mr. Oram , end up buying a bread machine and making their own loaves .
Nicole Hunn , who cooks gluten - free meals for her family of five and just started the Web site glutenfreeonashoestring .com , avoids mixes , which she says are expensive and not that tasty , and instead bakes with an all - purpose gluten - free flour from a company called Bob ’s Red Mill , which can be used in place of wheat flour in standard recipes .
If you ’re too busy to cook , look for well - priced gluten - free food at large chains like Whole Foods Market and Trader Joe’s .
“ Trader Joe ’s now carries fantastic brown rice pasta that is reasonably priced and brown rice flour tortillas that can sub for bread with a variety of things , ” says Kelly Courson , co-founder of the advice site CeliacChicks.com .
Ms. Courson put out a Twitter message to her followers and learned that many were fans of DeBoles gluten - free pastas , which can be bought in bulk on Amazon , and puffed brown rice cereal by Alf ’s Natural Nutrition , just $ 1 a bag at Wal - Mart .
Finally , it may be worthwhile to join a celiac support group .
You can swap cost - cutting tips , share recipes and learn about new products .
Many groups invite vendors to bring gluten - free products to meetings for members to sample  members can buy items they like at a discount and skip the shipping charges .
Support groups typically have meetings , as well as newsletters and Web sites where you can post questions .
Groups to check out include the Celiac Disease Foundation and the Gluten Intolerance Group of North America .
Finally , if you itemize your tax return and your total medical expenses for the year exceed 7.5 percent of your adjusted gross income , you can write off certain expenses associated with celiac disease .
You can deduct the excess cost of a gluten - free product over a comparable gluten - containing product .
Let ’s say you spend $ 6.50 on a loaf of gluten - free bread , and a regular loaf costs $ 4 ; you can deduct $ 2.50 .
In addition , you can deduct the cost of products necessary to maintain a gluten - free diet , like xanthan gum for baking .
If you mail order gluten - free products , the shipping costs may be deductible , too .
If you have to travel extra miles to buy gluten - free goods , the mileage is also deductible .
You ’ll need a doctor ’s letter to confirm your diagnosis and your need for a gluten - free diet , and you should save receipts in case of a tax audit .
The launch of a space shuttle is an awesome experience .
First , you see it - an incredibly bright light from its engines .
Then you hear it - a low - pitched rumble and a deafening crackling .
But the overriding sensation that stays with you is one that you feel - a vibration that goes right through your body .
With Discovery 's ( STS - 128 ) launch to the ISS on Friday , we are now really in the end days of this extraordinary vehicle .
There are just six further flights before the orbiter is retired and America has to turn to a new concept - a new vision - for human spaceflight .
A panel of experts led by former Lockheed Martin chairman and chief executive Norm Augustine is in the process of giving President Obama its assessment of the different options for getting future US astronauts into space .
The new White House incumbent must then decide on a way forward , taking into account the advice of his top scientist John Holdren and new US space agency chief Charles Bolden .
The current Nasa roadmap calls for the creation of two replacement rockets known as Ares 1 and Ares 5 .
The first would launch a crewship , Orion .
The second , much bigger rocket would be used to lift heavy cargo .
This " space architecture " , which goes under the name Constellation , would aim to get humans beyond low - Earth orbit again , to go back to the Moon by 2020 and then to Mars someday .
The Augustine committee has held a number of its meetings in public and its discussions have given some remarkable insights into the difficulties that now face the roadmap .
For one thing , it is billions of dollars short of the funding it needs for full implementation .
It also contains a strange paradox : it produces a new crew - carrying capability at just about the same time as the US is currently scheduled to abandon the International Space Station ( ISS ) in 2016 by ditching it in the Pacific Ocean .
In other words , Nasa would be able to launch its astronauts into space but they would n't immediately have anywhere to go .
No - one I speak to in the space business seriously believes that will happen .
Indeed , most seem to think that if there is one sure - fire outcome of the review process then it will see the US sign up to an extension of ISS operations , in the first instance to 2020 and then perhaps even to 2025 .
The reasoning that is given : what is the point of spending $ 100 bn to build an enormous science lab in sky only to dump it just as it becomes fully capable ?
It is thought that the cumulative lab time devoted to microgravity research in orbit prior to the ISS programme is about six months if you take all short - duration flights together .
Even in its assembly phase , the ISS has surpassed that , and in truth its science endeavours have n't really got going yet .
The station has only just gone from a three - person crew to a six - person crew .
That doubling actually translates to a four - fold increase in astronaut time available to science activity .
Friday 's shuttle launch also marks something of a watershed .
Discovery 's mission will be fitting out the station with the last of its major research facilities .
Among the final delivery boxes is the Materials Science Research Rack , which incorporates the European - built Materials Science Laboratory ( MSL ) .
This is really the start of materials science on the ISS .
I 've written previously about the advantages of studying the melting and solidification of alloys and other metals in the absence of gravity .
The types of fine - scale structures that form when molten samples cool in weightless conditions can look very different to how they would on Earth , and this can fundamentally change the properties of those materials .
The intention is not to mass - manufacture in orbit but to better understand processes and systems such that when the lessons are applied back on Earth in the large - scale industrial setting , huge benefits accrue .
I spoke with Olivier Minister just prior to the launch of Discovery .
Olivier coordinates the materials science experiments on the ISS for the European Space Agency , and I asked him to give me an example of the sort of return that could come from the aluminium research that will initiate MSL operations :
" If we can have a full understanding and control of the casting process of an engine block , for example , we could conceptually direct the solidification process such that the properties are what they should be where they should be .
" In the bulk of the engine block , it does n't matter too much but in the location of the cylinder lining , you would want to have specific microstructures and properties to limit the wearing out of the engine block .
" And in terms of a production process : if it takes only 30 seconds instead of 40 seconds to fill the mould of the engine block and solidify it , then at the end of the year on several hundreds of thousands of engine blocks , that 's a massive economy . "
If the US does indeed extend its commitment to the ISS , it wo n't of course ease the financial headache it now faces .
Money spent on the station is money that cannot be spent on other activities such as developing new rockets .
And if the Augustine committee buys into the ISS , it will narrow somewhat the options the President can pick up .
Mark Uhran , Nasa 's associate administrator for the space station , is in no doubt however where American commitment should lie , and he spoke bullishly last weekend about the need to maintain the orbiting platform :
" It is clearly a benefit - cost decision that has to be periodically revisited over the next few years .
It 's expensive to continue to operate and maintain a spacecraft of this magnitude in orbit , and the benefits have to be worth that cost .
" We 're confident that once we ramp up this R&D programme , we will have ample justification to continue it .
How many years it continues remains to be seen in the success and productivity of the research programme . "
One of the ways to ease the learning of Perl for those the none English speakers is to have translated documentations and tutorials for them .
Even if they know English it is easier if they do n't have to learn something in a foreign language .
We already have some of the Perl documentation translated to a few languages but IMHO they have not received enough attention .
So let me announce the first version of perldoc.org .
I 'd like to thank Tiago Stock , the owner of that domain who let me use it for the advancement of Perl .
My plan is to help the people who would like to have a translated version of the Perl documentation available on the web .
Currently there are two sites the French and the Italian version .
The site is built using the code that John Allen wrote for the previous version of perldoc .
perl.org and released more than half a year ago .
Still many features of the original site are missing but I did not want to wait more with the announcement .
I hope some people will be interested and start to improve the code so we can have all the features back soon .
The code is now on Github .
Please fork it .
The documentations themselves are maintained by other people .
I am just using the packages released in the POD2 ::* namespace .
PARIS , France ( CNN ) --
Former first lady Laura Bush praised the performance of her husband 's successor Monday , breaking with many Republicans in telling CNN that she thinks President Obama is doing a good job under tough circumstances .
Former first lady Laura Bush defended President Obama 's decision to address the nation 's schoolchildren .
She also criticized Washington 's sharp political divide during an interview covering a range of topics including her thoughts on first lady Michelle Obama , former Vice President Dick Cheney , the situation in Afghanistan and Myanmar , and life after eight tumultuous years in the White House .
Bush sat down with CNN on Monday during a United Nations meeting in Paris , France , where she was promoting global literacy , a cause she trumpeted during her husband 's administration .
The typically reserved former first lady defended Obama 's decision to deliver a back - to - school speech to students , putting her at odds with many conservatives afraid that the president will use the opportunity to advance his political agenda .
" I think he is [ doing a good job ] , " Bush said when asked to assess Obama 's job performance .
" I think he has got a lot on his plate , and he has tackled a lot to start with , and that has probably made it more difficult . "
Michelle Obama is also " doing great , " she said , in part by turning the White House into a comfortable home for her family .
Watch more of the interview »
Referencing the uproar over Obama 's address to schoolchildren , which will be aired nationwide Tuesday , Laura Bush said it 's " really important for everyone to respect the president of the United States . "
Bush did n't completely dismiss the concerns of some conservatives but noted that controversial Education Department plans recommending that students draft letters discussing what they can do to help Obama had been changed .
" I think there is a place for the president ... to talk to schoolchildren and encourage " them , she said .
Parents should follow his example and " encourage their own children to stay in school and to study hard and to try to achieve the dream that they have . "
Bush indicated that she did n't think it was fair for Obama to be labeled a " socialist " by critics and expressed her disappointment with the intensely polarized nature of contemporary American politics .
Part of the reason for the polarization , she said , was the increase in the number of congressional districts dominated by either strongly conservative or liberal voters .
" We 've seen that for the last eight years , certainly , and we 're still seeing it , " she said .
" That 's just a fact of life . "
iReport.com : Share your thoughts on Obama 's speech
Bush conceded that after her husband was elected president , he was unable to replicate his success as governor of Texas in reaching across the aisle to Democrats .
" He was disappointed that that was not the way it worked out in Washington , " she said .
" I 'm sure President Obama did n't expect it to be that way [ either ] .
...
All of us need to do what we can to come together on issues . "
Despite her husband 's disappointment , he is " doing very well , " she said .
Both of them are now working on their memoirs , she noted .
Though the former first lady criticized the excessive partisanship of Washington , she expressed gratitude for Cheney 's decision to vocally defend her husband 's performance .
Cheney has been outspoken in his defense of the Bush administration 's national security record , which has been sharply criticized on , among other things , questions relating to the detention and interrogation of terrorist suspects .
" I think that Vice President Cheney has every right to speak out , and I appreciate that he is defending " the administration , Bush said .
" I think that is important .
I think there is a place for that . "
Bush also said it does n't bother her husband that Cheney 's " out there being critical . "
The former first lady said her husband still speaks with Cheney occasionally .
Multiple sources have indicated that the two men parted ways on several issues in the last years of their administration , including Bush 's refusal to offer a pardon for former top Cheney aide Lewis " Scooter " Libby .
Libby was convicted on charges of perjury , obstruction of justice and lying to investigators looking into the leak that resulted in the exposure of CIA agent Valerie Plame Wilson .
Though Bush expressed confidence that her husband will ultimately be remembered as " somebody who stood for freedom and who stood for the security of our country , " she admitted that she 's worried about the current situation in Afghanistan .
" I 'm very concerned , of course , " she said .
" All of us are concerned , and everybody , as they look at Afghanistan from around the world , really hope and want to [ do ] whatever they can to help the government stabilize , to see that the elections were fair . "
Bush said she hoped people " will redouble their efforts " to help the country fend off Taliban and al Qaeda extremists .
She also repeated her outspoken criticism of the government of Myanmar , also known by its former name of Burma , which has come under fire for imprisoning pro-democracy activist Aung San Suu Kyi .
" She 's always been held under house arrest [ because ] they 're afraid of her popularity .
They think that undermines their regime , " Bush said .
" I hope that they 'll see what she really wants .
...
She wants [ the nation to have ] a peaceful transition to a democracy and to have the chance for Burma to really build itself [ into ] a very wealthy and educated nation . "
After her husband 's eight controversial years in the White House , what does Bush have to say to critics who believe he had a negative , destructive influence in the world ?
" I would say that that 's absolutely not right , " Bush said .
" I do n't think they have either the right view of him or what his responsibilities are and were as president of the United States . "

SRT - 501 , the company ’s special formulation of resveratrol , is being tested against two cancers , multiple myeloma and colon cancer that has spread to the liver .
A chemical mimic of resveratrol , known as SRT - 2104 , is in a Phase 2 trial for Type 2 diabetes , and in a Phase 1 trial in elderly patients .
( Phase 1 trials test for safety , Phase 2 for efficacy . )
Image AGE WELL David Sinclair , left , and Christoph Westphal , co-founders of Sitris Pharmaceuticals , in Dr. Sinclairs laboratory in Cambrdge , Mass .
The company develops drugs that mimic resveratrol , a chemical found in some red wines .
Credit ... Robert Spencer for The New York Times
Dr. Gallagher said that unpublished tests in mice showed that another chemical mimic , SRT - 1720 , increased both health and lifespan ; after two years , twice as many mice taking the drug were alive compared with the undosed animals .
Resveratrol itself has not been shown to increase lifespan in normal mice , although it does so in obese mice , laboratory roundworms and flies .
Sirtris has so far been doubly fortunate .
No severe side effects have yet emerged from the clinical trials .
The company has also been lucky in having apparently picked the right horse , or at least a good one , in a fast - developing field .
Besides the sirtuins , several other proteins are now known to influence longevity , energy use and the response to caloric restriction .
These include the receptors for insulin and for another hormone called IGF - 1 , and a protein of increasing interest called TOR ( “ target of rapamycin ” ) .
Rapamycin is an antimicrobial that was recently found to extend lifespan significantly , even when given to mice at an advanced age .
Since TOR is involved in the response to caloric restriction , rapamycin may extend life through this pathway .
Sirtuins may not be the most important genes for longevity , Dr. Sinclair conceded at the conference , because the pathways controlled by the sirtuins , TOR and the others “ all talk to each other , often by feedback loops . ”
Many theories of aging attribute senescence to the inexorable buildup of mutations in a person ’s DNA .
Dr. Sinclair said that in his view “ aging can be reversed ” because the DNA mutations did not directly cause aging .
Rather , they induce the sirtuin molecules that help control the genome to divert to the site of damage .
With the sirtuins absent from their usual post , genes are not regulated efficiently , and the cells ’ performance degrades .
Diversion of the sirtuins should be a reversible process , in Dr. Sinclair ’s view , unlike DNA damage , which is not .
“ In five or six or seven years , ” said Christoph Westphal , Sirtris ’s other co-founder , “ there will be drugs that prolong longevity . ”
During this period , debt exploded .
In 1960 , Americans ’ personal debt amounted to about 55 percent of national income .
By 2007 , Americans ’ personal debt had surged to 133 percent of national income .
Over the past few months , those debt levels have begun to come down .
But that does n’t mean we ’ve re-established standards of personal restraint .
We ’ve simply shifted from private debt to public debt .
By 2019 , federal debt will amount to an amazing 83 percent of G.D.P. ( before counting the costs of health reform and everything else ) .
By that year , interest payments alone on the federal debt will cost $ 803 billion .
These may seem like dry numbers , mostly of concern to budget wonks .
But these numbers are the outward sign of a values shift .
If there is to be a correction , it will require a moral and cultural movement .
Our current cultural politics are organized by the obsolete culture war , which has put secular liberals on one side and religious conservatives on the other .
But the slide in economic morality afflicted Red and Blue America equally .
If there is to be a movement to restore economic values , it will have to cut across the current taxonomies .
Its goal will be to make the U.S. again a producer economy , not a consumer economy .
It will champion a return to financial self - restraint , large and small .
It will have to take on what you might call the lobbyist ethos  the righteous conviction held by everybody from AARP to the agribusinesses that their groups are entitled to every possible appropriation , regardless of the larger public cost .
It will have to take on the self - indulgent popular demand for low taxes and high spending .
A crusade for economic self - restraint would have to rearrange the current alliances and embrace policies like energy taxes and spending cuts that are now deemed politically impossible .
But this sort of moral revival is what the country actually needs .
Here ’s Ted Kennedy , from early 2007 , laying into Senate Republicans for refusing even to allow a vote on raising the federal minimum wage , which had stagnated for a decade .
It ’s vintage Teddy Kennedy and puts what ’s coming this fall into an important perspective .
It ’s worth a few minutes of your time .
Watch it .
For many , the immediate reaction to government censorship is disbelief or even anger .
These are appropriate reactions to news of the Marines banning access to social networking websites such as Twitter and Facebook .
The Marine Corp reasons these sites provide a " haven for malicious actors " and " are particularly high risk due to information exposure . "
Yes , like the " malicious actors " that exposed information on protests in Iran via Twitter .
The U.S. Department of Defense is considering extending the censorship to all branches of the military .
However , perhaps anger and disbelief are not the appropriate reactions when the Iraqi government censors the Internet .
The government is ordering Internet service providers ( ISPs ) to block access within the country to websites that incite violence or provide pornographic material .
Yes , this represents a step away from increased human freedom in Iraq , but this may not necessarily be a negative development .
Iraq cannot and must not be held to the same standards of countries like the United States .
Its citizenry falls on a drastically different location along the path of human development ( as outlined by the World Values Survey [ WVS ] ) .
For example , in 2006 , the most recent WVS results , when asked " How much freedom of choice and control , " 12.3 % of Iraqi citizens answered " None at all , " with 53.2 % answering that it is not important .
By contrast , only .8 % of U.S. citizens answered " None at all , " with 13.2 % answering not important .
Iraqi citizens currently favor survival values over self - expression values .
Until a shift toward self - expression values occurs , censoring websites that incite violence and propagate extremist materials fits Iraq 's current position along the path of human development .
Additionally , the Iraqi Constitution states the following :
Article 36 : The state guarantees in a way that does not violate public order and morality : A. Freedom of expression , through all means .
B. Freedom of press , printing , advertisement , media and publication .
It is not the proper role of government to legislate morality .
However , by specifically stating , " in a way that does not violate public order and morality , " the Iraqi government holds the constitutionally - alloted power to censor the Internet for pornographic and violence - inciting material .
If we are to condemn the attacks on countries like Honduras for acting in accordance with their constitutions , we must not attack Iraq for acting in accordance with its constitution .
The makers of Gardasil are trying to get the HPV vaccine approved for boys , which is why now people are questioning the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine , rather than if it makes girls slutty .

Pharmaceutical company Merck has had a human papillomavirus vaccine for males in the works for some time and is currently seeking FDA approval for the vaccine .
In women , HPV causes genital warts and can lead to cervical cancer , which about 10,000 women are diagnosed with each year .
For men , the vaccine also prevents HPV , which can cause penile and anal cancer , and cancer of the mouth and throat .
About 7,500 men are diagnosed with these cancers per year and vaccinating boys also helps prevent the spread of the virus to men's sexual partners .

Though there have been concerns raised about the safety of the vaccine for girls , the debate has centered mostly on whether being vaccinated against the STD would make girls more likely to have sex .
Now that there is a male vaccine people are focusing on whether it 's safe and cost effective to have boys vaccinated , especially when they can't get cervical cancer , reports The Washington Post .
The prospect of boys sleeping around has n't entered into the debate .
" We are still more worried about the promiscuity of girls than the promiscuity of boys , " said Susan M. Reverby , a professor of women 's studies and medical history at Wellesley College .
" There 's still that double standard . "
Since the male vaccine was proposed , people have wondered if parents would be willing to vaccinate their sons .
" For girls , you can go right to protection against cervical cancer .
That 's a powerful argument , " said Gregory D. Zimet , a professor of pediatrics and psychology at Indiana University .
" For boys , you have to make several arguments .
Part of it is an altruistic argument .
I think it 's persuasive , but it 's more complex . "
Debbie Stein of Maryland says she would have her 11 - year - old son vaccinated .
" My feeling is it 's a serious virus that causes cancer , and there 's no reason not to vaccinate him , " she said .
" I think it will protect him and protect his wife in the future .
I do n't want to see him when he 's 35 or 40 have a wife die of cancer . "

Merck says they wo n't launch another big ( and ultimately unsuccessful ) push to have schools require boys be vaccinated like they did after the FDA approved Gardasil for girls in 2006 .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is currently examining the results of a study presented last month on the safety of the vaccine for boys .
If the panel endorses it , that will influence whether schools require the shot , and if insurance companies will cover the costs .

In June the committee will consider several cost - benefit analysis , since the vaccine costs about $ 500 for three shots .
Though vaccinating boys will reduce the amount of virus that is transmitted back to girls , some are questioning if it 's worth it since boys are less affected by cancers associated with HPV .
Professor Zimet says questions of cost should n't be what 's driving public health policy .
" This is a vaccine that principally benefits women 's health .
I wonder if it was the reverse , and there was a vaccine for women that helped prevent prostate cancer in men , this would be as much of an issue , " he said .

On HTML 5 Drag and Drop By Francisco Tolmasky on August 16 , 2009
HTML 5 is shaping up to be quite an impressive step up from the capabilities web developers are currently constrained to .
One of my favorite new features provided by the spec is support for native drag and drop .
Cappuccino and many other JavaScript libraries have had drag and drop support for quite a while now , but with one important caveat : the drag operations were limited to within the browser window .
This was not only visually displeasing , but prevented you from being able to share data in a user friendly way from one web app to another , or even to other desktop apps .
HTML 5 aims to change all this by giving us access to the computer ’s native drag system and clipboard .
I took the last week to really familiarize myself with this API and its various implementations on current browsers so I could start adding support for it in Cappuccino .
I feel that this gave me a pretty unique perspective on the current state of this feature which I ’d like to share , mainly because I ’ve had to make it work in a number of real ( sometimes shipping ) applications , as opposed to simplying creating small demos .
The good news is that last night I was able to land my first commit which adds full HTML 5 drag and drop support for Safari and other WebKit - based browsers .
Here is a short movie that shows this feature in action in our internal 280 Slides builds :
As you can see , this feature enables you to easily share data , whether it be images and shapes or full slides , from one presentation to another .
What ’s particularly cool about this is that you wo n’t have to change your existing code at all since Cappuccino simply detects when you are on a compliant browser and magically “ upgrades ” to native drag and drop .
On older browsers , you will still get the old in - browser implementation .
Ah , the beauty of abstraction .
This is n’t to say that working with this feature was all peaches and cream though .
For starters , this feature is far from complete in any browser .
I experienced a tremendous amount of bugs , crashes , and inconsistencies in all the browsers I tried .
On the one hand , I got to play with a very exciting new toy , and on the other I was given a glimpse into the future of the bugs I would be dealing with for years to come ( just when we thought the whole cross - browser thing was starting to become managable ) .
This is n’t surprising of course , it is a very new addition and the spec is n’t even 100 % complete yet .
For this reason , I ’ve decided to split this post up into two pieces .
In the following I will be discussing what I believe to be actual and serious design flaws in the current API , as well as a few suggestions I have for how they might be remedied .
I will also separately link to a page that has all the bugs and inconsistencies I discovered ( as well as the associated tickets I filed on them ) , and workarounds when I could find them .
I believe the main “ theme ” of the problems I encountered was due to the fact that I am trying to build full - blown applications as opposed to dynamic web pages .
This however is no excuse , as one of HTML 5 ′s supposed goals is to usher in an era of more web apps that are more competitive with desktop apps .
This is precisely why Google is supporting it so heavily .
Lazy Data Loading
One of the key facilities of drag and drop is the ability to provide , and get , multiple representations of the same data .
Different web pages , web apps , and desktop apps support different kinds of data , so it is up to your application to give them something they can work with .
Take 280 Slides for example :
When a user drags the slides out of slides navigator , he may be planning to drop it to any number of locations .
If he is dragging it from one instance of 280 Slides to another , then we want to provide a serialized version of these slides so that they can be added to the other presentation .
If however , he drags these slides into a program like Photoshop , then we would want to provide image data .
If he were to drag them to his desktop , then perhaps we could provide a PDF version .
He could even drag them to his text editor and expect the text contents of his slides to be pasted .
Multiple Data Types
The way you do this currently is with the setData function , which allows you to specify different types of data :
This is incredibly common on the desktop , and you ’ve probably never noticed it precisely because it works so well : things seem to just do the right thing when you drag and drop them .
However , an unfortunate side effect of this feature is that you end up doing a lot of extra unecessary work .
The user only ever drops the item to one location , and so all the other formats you ’ve created were wasted processing time .
This is not a big deal for simple cases of drag and drop , but it becomes quite noticable in large applications like 280 Slides .
In the example above , creating serialized and image representations of these slides can become quite slow depending on how many elements are in the individual slides and how many slides you are moving .
Because of this you may experience a lag when you first drag the slides out .
The worst part is , if all you intended to do was reposition the slides in the same presentation , then you did n’t need any of these formats !
This problem was solved in a very simple and intelligent way on the desktop a long time ago : simply delay supplying the actual data until the drop occurs .
At the point of the drop , you actually know which of the 5 supplied types the user is interested in , so create it then .
Not only does this save you from doing uncessary work , but generally users notice time spent processing after a drop a lot less ( because there is no expected user feedback to stutter ) .
I ’ve thought a lot about a good way to allow the user to do this with the existing setData method , and I think it could be done by simply allowing developers to provide functions that could be called when the data is needed :
Perhaps a more backwards compatible alternative would be :
Although I do n’t really think this is necessary since this API is so new .
Either way , this allows us to use the existing setData method , while not actually needing to calculate the string value until getData is actually called by the drop target .
Initiating Drags
Another major hurdle I encountered was in controling the way drags are actually started .
Currently this is a delicate dance of preventDefaults and interactions between mousedown , mousemove , and dragstart , in combination with the draggable HTML attribute .
The basic problem with this is that it leaves the decision to create a drag entirely to the the browser .
Again , this is just fine for simple cases , but it really starts to break down when you are building full on applications in the browser .
On the other hand , frameworks like Cocoa allow the developer to initiate the actual drag sequence .
Lets look at why this is important with a simple example .
It is quite common to want to start a drag event on the initial mouse down , instead of waiting for additional mouse move events .
In these cases , it would be more confusing if the initial mouse down did nothing .
This is currently impossible to achieve with the HTML 5 drag and drop APIs .
In Cocoa , this would be quite simple , requiring the developer simply start the process in mouseDown : instead of mouseDragged :
This is just a simple example of course .
More complex widgets provide even more cases where drag and drop in the browser really works against you .
Take tables in Mac OS X , which provide different behaviors depending on what direction the users drags in :
As you can see , when a user drags upwards in a table on Mac OS X , the selection of the table changes ( in other words , no drag takes place ) .
On the other hand , if the user drags left , right , or diagonally in any way , then he is allowed to move these files .
This is very intuitive experience when you use it , and is absolutely trivial to implement in Cocoa :
However , this is again basically impossible with the current HTML 5 API , as you can never be a part of the decision as to whether an object is dragged or not .
Once you get the drag event , it ’s too late .
You can imagine that this would become even more cumbersome in applications like Bespin that revolve less around specific tags and more around content that is drawn to a canvas elements .
When a user drag in Bespin , they have to decide between any number of actions .
I think a good solution to this would be to simply allow the developer to manually kick off a dragging event loop from either a mousedown or mousemove callback .
Something like this :
In both these cases , calling startDrag would result in no further mousemoves / mouseups being fired in this event loop , and instead would kick off the drag event loop with a “ dragstart ” event .
A matching cancelDrag ( ) could be provided as well .
This would allow you to cancel a drag , but not any other specific behavior such as selection .
Currently calling preventDefault cancels both drags and selection .
This actually leads to a number of other confusing results .
For example , if you place a textfield within a draggable element , it is essentially impossible for text selection to happen in that textfield , even if you set the textfield itself to not be draggable .
Drag Images
One of the nice parts about drag and drop is that you are allowed to set any arbitrary image or element as what is actually rendered during the drag process with the setDragImage method :
However , on Firefox it is required that this element already be visible .
Now , I was n’t sure whether to list this as simply a bug in Firefox or an actual design flaw , but I chose to list it as a flaw because the documentation at mozilla.org would seem to suggest that they may consider this to be “ correct behavior ” .
Safari does not have this restriction , and in fact Firefox even seems to make an exception for canvas elements .
Firefox seems particularly strict about this requirement too , as I tried positioning an element offscreen in a negative position , setting its visibility to hidden , setting the display to none , and even placing the element in an offscreen iframe , anything to prevent having to actually flash the element in some random portion of the screen before dragging it .
It seems to me that this method exists for the purpose of showing something different , and thus it ’s a bit unreasonable to expect it to already be not only in the document , but visible as well .
My request here is simple : that it should simply work the way it does in Safari .
Conclusion
Drag and drop is an incredibly important part of the way we interact with computers , which is why it is so crucial that we get it right from the beginning .
I really hope my concerns are heard and that we can come up with some good solutions to the initial problems I faced with this young API , so that we can avoid the windows of incompatibility that plagued the last updates to HTML .
In the meanwhile , I ’ve filed a bunch of bugs and documented my current experiences here .
WASHINGTON  President Obama on Tuesday will nominate Ben S. Bernanke to a second term as chairman of the Federal Reserve , administration officials said .
The announcement is a major victory for Mr. Bernanke , a Republican who was appointed by President George W. Bush almost four years ago and who had briefly served as chairman of Mr. Bush ’s Council of Economic Advisers .
A top White House official said Mr. Obama had decided to keep Mr. Bernanke at the helm of the Fed because he had been bold and brilliant in his attempts to combat the financial crisis and the deep recession .
“ The president thinks that Ben ’s done a great job as Fed chairman , that he has helped the economy through one of the worst experiences since the Great Depression and that he has essentially been pulling the economy back from the brink of what would have been the second Great Depression , ” the White House chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel , said Monday night .

BMW Sauber has several offers on the table from parties interested in saving the Formula 1 outfit , with evaluation of those bids due to analysed by team chiefs over the next few days .
The Hinwil - based team has taken its first step in trying to secure its future by officially re-entering next year 's world championship before last Monday 's deadline , even though details of a rescue package have not been finalised .
Although an offer from shareholder Peter Sauber to take over the outfit was recently rejected by BMW , the former F1 team principal is now working with BMW motorsport director Mario Theissen to try to secure the outfit 's future .
Theissen said he was optimistic that a solution could be found , even though he acknowledged it would not be straightforward to come to a settlement .
" It 's not easy but there are opportunities , " he said in Valencia .
" There are interested investors , apparently a wide spectrum from just an interested question up to a structured concept with a profound business plan .
And we are currently evaluating these . "
He added : " Fortunately I 'm not working on my own , I am doing it together with Peter .
He is trying very hard to use his connections and he is talking to people .
We are doing it jointly .
" I can not tell you anything about the on - going negotiations .
As I have said , there are several interested parties and we are just about to evaluate the individual proposals . "
Theissen has also dropped a hint that he could leave his position within BMW to take up a role with the new version of the team if a buyer is found .
" That 's still open , " he said about the suggestion .
" I 'm not thinking about it .
The first priority is to secure the future of the team in my current role with the team .
Then after the season we can see what will happen to me . "
Theissen also denied any suggestion that the team 's poor form this year was the catalyst for the decision by BMW to quit F1 .
When asked how different the situation would have been if BMW Sauber was winning races , Theissen said : " I think not too much different because the underlying theme was that the board has said there was a shift in the corporate strategy .
" This is something which happens not from one day to another .
It 's a long - term issue .
A continuous move .
And then there are apparently other instant events which trigger such a decision and in this case it has been the obligation to sign up ( to the Concorde Agreement ) for three more years , under a certain environment and that was basically the culmination . "
Young Jean Lee ’s Theater Company – The Shipment
You know you ’re not colorblind , right ?
Young Jean
Lee continuously reminds you of this fact as her piece “ The Shipment ” pushes and pulls at racial identity , stereotypes , perception and memes .
The Shipment , divided into five parts , is smart , funny , and painfully insightful .
It opens with actor / dancers Mikeah Ernest Jennings and Prentice Onayemi who dance and spring around the stage in ecstatic and playful fashion .
It ’s disarmingly joyful and extremely likable .
It ’s a perfect prologue and an extremely skillful misdirection that puts the viewer into a space where they wo n’t know exactly what to expect from piece .
The short opening dance is followed by Douglas Scott Streater , who comes on stage and does a caricature of a stand - up comedian .
Think “ Night at the Apollo ” or Chris Rock and you capture the essence of Streater ’s piece .
“ You think I want to be here talking about race ?
I want to be talking about poop ! ” exclaims Streater .
It ’s an important moment addressing the core issue of exactly where the issue of race lives .
It poses the questions ‘ must a black comedian joke about race because he ’s black ? ’ or maybe even the underlining question ‘ can someone who is n’t black create a show dealing with seemingly black specific issues ? ’
Douglas Scott Streater is electrifying in this part of The Shipment , extremely likeable and extremely funny .
He makes it easy to completely lose the sense that you ’re watching an experimental theater piece and actually believe that you ’re at a stand up show .
Streater ’s stand up routine is followed by an odd robotic and cartoonish lampoon of racial stereotypes .
It ’s done with a minimalist set , in a quasi improv style .
The price reminded me of seeing a long form improv piece at the Improv Olympics in Chicago or perhaps seeing an segment of South Park written and directed by Young Jean Lee .
While this was n’t my favorite part of the show , it was oddly amusing in its outlandish style and rhythm and the actors are so likeable in ‘ The Shipment ’ that it ’s a joy to follow along whatever they do .
No sooner do you feel like you ’ve got a grip on ‘ The Shipment ’ than Young Jean Lee pries your fingers away and shows you that you do n’t .
The cartoonish farce is followed by an extremely naked and beautiful song .
Three of the actors stand at the edge of the stage , with the house lights raised , piercingly staring at each and every member of the audience as they sing in harmony .
During this part of the show Young Jean Lee forces you out of your role of observer of this work , you ca n’t just comfortably sit in the dark laughing and clapping , saying “ they ’re not talking about me . ”
The song is hauntingly beautiful and having the piercing gaze of an actor meet your eyes is a unique theatrical experience that is wonderful , amazing and terrifying all at once .
The final piece of ‘ The Shipment ’ is a seemingly conventional one act play that takes place at a cocktail party in an upscale apartment .
As with the other pieces of the show , the ensemble cast works extremely well together here .
It ’s expertly performed and very entertaining .
There are a number of twists and turns in the final piece of the evening which are best left unspoiled , but as with the rest of the work , expect to have your perceptions turned on its head .
Young Jean Lee ’s ‘ The Shipment ’ is an example of how successful a piece of experimental theater can be .
In many ways it ’s extraordinarily confrontational , dealing with deep issue of racism and racial identity , but it ’s done so well , with such a charismatic and likeable cast that it does n’t turn the audience off or push them away .
It ’s easy to shock an audience and push at their comfort zone , it ’s a lot more difficult to make them laugh and carry them along while you push at their comfort zone .
Young Jean Lee and her company of actors accomplish this is an amazing way , with a night of theater that should not be missed .

Maybe Forever
I knew I was in trouble when PICA ’s guest artistic director Cathy Edwards introduced Meg Stuart ’s piece as “ wonderfully atmospheric ” .
To me that ’s often code for a piece which has a lot of style and very little substance .
Unfortunately , Meg Stuart ’s ‘ Maybe Forever ” lacked in both style and substance .
Opening on an extremely dimly lit stage ( I could barely make out anything I was seeing ) , two figures gyrate , roll around and move on the floor .
They ’re accompanied by looped audio with sounds of a dock or bay .
Yes , it ’s ‘ atmospheric ’ , but atmospheric of what ?
The stage is so dimly lit you can barely see a thing .
Once the lights do finally go up you see the two performers echo some of the movements barely visible before .
I would n’t call the movement in Maybe Forever dance .
The gyrations and frequent arm moves of the piece have little flow , no finesse and very little sense of connection with anything outside the insular world that ’s created on stage .
These gyrations are occasionally interrupted by singer - songwriter Niko Hafkensch whose songs are n’t bad but they all seem to blend into one never ending waltz .
His songs begin as enjoyable but they become almost unbearable as the sounds and themes circle back around and around .
At one point Meg Stuart performs some quasi spoken word accompanied by angular gyrations .
It comes off as pretentious and self indulgent an aspect which echoes throughout the entire piece .
Sure , I get that Stuart is paying out aspects of her relationships , there are themes of ecstasy , love , hate , death , rape and longing .
But the piece seems to have almost no regard for the audience .
There ’s no connecting points , nothing to really grasp on to and certainly nothing to enjoy .
It ’s theater as therapy for the artist and there ’s no pleasure in being a voyeur to it .
Maybe Forever goes on for a full hour and a half , repeating movements and themes over and over and over again only to loop back around to them and revisit them again .
I have no problem with a piece obsessed with its theme .
Last year at TBA Lessar and Company did a phenomenal dance piece on the theme of relationships .
It ’s was beautiful , moving and challenging .
This piece never breaks out of its own insular world , never gives the viewer a connecting point or anything more than the same shard of broken dreams on loop .
I was a lone boo , in a trickle of polite applause .
There were turned heads , rude comments and shock over this audible communication of displeasure with the puce .
To me , polite applause would have been as disingenuous as the piece itself .

SEPTEMBER 9--A
Texas man is facing felony charges in two states for placing prank phone calls that caused significant damage to fast food restaurants .
James Tyler Markle , who was exposed last month in a TSG story on Pranknet , an online network of criminal prank callers , was arrested yesterday for a June 20 call targeting a McDonald 's in Lufkin , Texas ( Markle lives in Diboll , a neighboring city ) .
Markle confessed to the crime following his arrest , according to police .
As detailed in this criminal complaint , Markle , 19 , convinced a McDonald 's worker to set off the restaurant 's fire suppression system , which released a liquid from overhead extinguishers .
Markle then told the employee that the liquid contained a toxin and directed the worker to break the store 's windows " for ventilation . "
Four windows were eventually smashed and the eatery incurred damages in excess of $ 5000 , according to police .
Investigators connected Markle to the call after subpoenaing records for his Skype account , which showed that calls were placed from his number to the McDonald's , and then to the cell phone of a McDonald 's employee .
Shortly after placing the June 20 call , Markle , a convicted child rapist , was in the Pranknet chat room crowing about his successful attack on the restaurant .
As seen in this transcript , Markle -- who used the nickname " Prankster " -- reported that he was " about to go by McDonalds and take some pics " of the damage , and promised to " let yall see them . "
He also referred to the eatery 's broken windows and the triggering of the business 's Ansul fire suppression system .
Markle , pictured in the mug shot at left , was charged with making a felony terroristic threat and jailed in lieu of $ 10,000 bond .
Markle was also charged yesterday with placing an identical prank call to a Wendy 's in Gretna , Louisiana on June 21 .
As with the prior day 's call to McDonald's , Markle ( posing as a corporate official ) allegedly convinced a Wendy 's employee to trigger the fire suppression system and break windows , according to a Jefferson Parish Sheriff 's Office report .
An excerpt of that harrowing call , which was broadcast in the Pranknet chat room , can be listened to here .
As a frantic , gasping worker busts out windows , Markle assures the man , " Sir , you 're gonna be a hero . "
Markle , who was linked to the Wendy 's call via his Skype records , has been charged with terrorizing and criminal damage , both felonies ( the terrorizing count carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison ) .
He confessed to the June prank when interviewed yesterday by a pair of Louisiana investigators , according to a source .
Upon release from the Texas jail , he will be transported to Louisiana to face those charges .
Markle is also the subject of a criminal probe in Lexington , Kentucky for his role in placing a July 20 call to a Homewood Suites hotel .
That call ended with a worker drinking a urine sample provided by a guest .
Markle is the second Pranknet member to be arrested following TSG's August 4 story .
Shawn Powell , a convicted sex offender known as " Slipknotpsycho , " was arrested last month for a prank call targeting an Arby 's in Baytown , Texas , where the 24 - year - old resides .

Two separate sources — one inside the company and one outside it — have confirmed to Ars tonight that Google plans to launch an operating system built in some fashion around its new Web browser , Chrome .
One source says that the new OS will be launched soon , perhaps as early as tomorrow .
Tentatively called " Google Chrome OS , " the project appears targeted at netbooks , the tiny portable computers typically used only for such light tasks as Web browsing and e-mail .
Chrome , of course , is n't an operating system , but a quick - booting OS built around a single application like Chrome would be a natural fit for a netbook .
With such an OS , Google could obviously make it extra easy for users to access the full range of Google cloud applications through the browser — Google Docs , Gmail , Google Maps , etc .
Beyond the bare outlines , we have little solid information at this point , though the idea of a Google OS is n't some novelty ; in fact , it 's been aired publicly for years .
In early 2006 , we reported on Google 's denial that it was prepping an OS distribution of its own based on Ubuntu , but the idea had already been rumored at that point for some time .
More recently , the ( relative ) ease of porting Android to netbooks led to plenty of speculation that Google 's full computer OS , when it appeared , would be based on Android .
The varied speculation over the years may result from the fact that Google can take several possible paths to build such an operating system .
One possibility is that the OS could be a port of the Android mobile platform that has been modified to deliver a more netbook - friendly user interface .
This seems highly unlikely , however , as Google has unambiguously stated in the past that it has no plans to adapt Android to netbooks itself .
The search giant prefers to leave that as an exercise for third - party adopters .
It 's also worth noting that an Android netbook port is n't really consistent with the concept of a " Chrome " operating system .
The Android browser has very little in common with Chrome on the desktop ( for example , the Android browser uses Apple 's SquirrelFish JavaScript engine instead of Chrome's V8 ) .
Another possible approach might be that Google is building a separate lightweight Linux operating system that can be used as a host environment for Chrome .
Speculation that Chrome itself could be used as a standalone operating system has been floating around ever since Chrome 's launch , but those ideas are based on some fundamental misconceptions about how multiprocess browsing works .
The fact that Chrome uses multiple processes does not make it an operating system itself .
Ars has contacted Google for official comment on Google Chrome OS , but has yet to receive a response .
Bill O'Reilly Gets Owned by Teenager

Bill - o going on about drugs then interview 's a teenager and gets owned !
Hilarious !
Must See !
" My hope is that one day Fareeda and her kind can be returned to their native habitat and that is why it is so important to educate people about tigers and keeping the breeding programmes going . "
The organs of the inner ear have a direct effect on brain blood flow , independent of blood pressure and carbon dioxide levels in the blood .
Researchers writing in the open access journal BMC Neuroscience used a series of human centrifuge experiments to investigate the effects of stimulation of the otoliths and semi-circular canals on cerebrovascular response .
Dr. Jorge Serrador , from Harvard Medical School , worked with a team of researchers , including NASA scientists , to carry out the tests .
He said : " While a role for the vestibular system in the autonomic response to position has been documented , this is the first study to demonstrate a direct effect of otolith stimulation on cerebral blood flow . "
The researchers stimulated the vestibular organs of 25 healthy people by tilting them forwards and backwards , and by translation on a centrifuge .
Changes in cerebral flow velocity were dependent on the frequency of vestibular stimulation and were in opposition to changes in blood pressure and not directly related to changes in end tidal CO 2 .
Speaking about the implications of these results , Serrador said : " Standing up places the head above the heart and thus makes it harder to provide blood flow to the brain .
Having a connection between the otoliths , which tell us that we are standing , and the cerebrovasculature may be part of the adaption that allows us to maintain our brain blood flow when upright .
This connection might explain the reduced cerebral blood flow in some people .
For example , aging is associated with vestibular loss that might contribute to reductions in global cerebral blood flow .
Similarly , patients with orthostatic intolerance could have underlying vestibular impairment that exacerbates cerebral hypoperfusion when upright .
The knowledge gained from this study might lead to new treatment options for these conditions . "
CLEVELAND , Ohio -- Verizon Wireless , the nation 's largest cell phone company , may refund thousands or even millions of dollars to customers because of problematic " data usage " charges .
Verizon , with 84 million customers , also is making changes in staff training , internal procedures and customer service after a Plain Dealer column Aug. 15 revealed widespread billing problems .
The Money Matters column chronicled the writer 's six - month ordeal with $ 1.99 - per- month data charges and the possible causes given by Verizon 's customer service workers .
All , it turned out , were wrong or only partly true .
More than 400 Plain Dealer readers responded to the newspaper with complaints similar to the ones in the column .
The readers collectively pay for more than 1,000 phone lines .
In addition , calls to customer service and visits to Verizon stores increased noticeably after the column .
Take a look at your bill
Where to look for the data usage charge :
The first page of your bill should have a section labeled " Quick Bill Summary . "
Look under the summary for " Usage Charges , Data . "
What to do if you spot an error :
Call Verizon customer service ( 800-922-0204 ) or visit a full - service store to investigate the charges and ask for a credit .
If Internet usage is the issue , ask technical support to track down the Web sites visited , and dates and times .
If premium text messages are the issue , determine whether you have applications that are downloading information automatically .
Go to your " menu , " then click " media center . "
You may need Verizon 's help determining what applications cost money .
You can block features you do n't use and do n't want to be charged for by accident , such as Internet access or the weather forecast .
Access your account
online
, call customer service or visit a store .
At a minimum , thousands of customers apparently have been charged $ 1.99 per month for Internet " data usage " even though they had not tried to go online .
In some cases , customers were charged when their phones were off , the batteries were dead , the phone 's Internet access was blocked or even when the phones did n't have the software to go online .
Verizon vows to work with every customer nationwide who complains about unknown data and text charges .
The company is prepared to give customers refunds retroactively , which could amount to a few dollars or more than $ 100 per phone line , depending on the extent of the issue .
Roger Tang , region president for Verizon , said Monday that the data charges were not a trick .
" We do n't want to zing stuff into people 's bills in hopes they do n't catch it , " said Tang , who 's in charge of services in Ohio , Pennsylvania and West Virginia .
" We 're not interested in charging customers for things they accidentally access .
Our brand reputation is everything . "
Of the faulty explanations from Verizon 's customer service reps , Tang said , " Clearly , you identified a training gap I have to address . "
Verizon does n't yet know all of the possible causes for the $ 1.99 charges .
Executives are investigating complaints on an individual basis and are tracking patterns .
Some charges might be caused by a customer hitting a series of buttons and inadvertently accessing the Internet .
Others might result from an automatic download for a service the customer may not realize he has .
How to block
Verizon says the company may not have done enough to inform customers what can be blocked - and what the customers can do themselves by accessing their accounts online .
Here are features that you can block :
• Application downloads
• Premium texting
• Web access
• V-Cast music
• Mobile TV
• Text - messaging
In addition , as a service to parents , Verizon allows the account holder to turn capabilities on and off - for example ,
blocking a phone
from being used for calls after 10 p.m. or for text - messaging during school hours .
Parents also can track their child 's whereabouts through a service called
" chaperone . "
If the child 's phone leaves certain boundaries - say off a certain street - the parent is sent a text message .
" There 's work now being done at the ranch , " said Tang , who , along with three other Verizon executives , met with The Plain Dealer for more than 1½ hours Monday .
Verizon vows to work with every customer nationwide who complains about unknown data or text charges .
The company representatives said they do n't know how widespread the issues are but believe they 're nationwide .
" We 're taking this one step at a time , " said spokewoman Laura Merritt .
" We 're still digging . "
Hundreds of Verizon customers told The Plain Dealer that they got the same incorrect information both in stores and from customer service workers in call centers .
Some readers say they 've been battling the charges for more than a year .
Most said they 're tired of calling Verizon month after month .
Some were irate because they 'd punished their children because they wrongly believed the kids had gone on the Internet .
One reader said his mom's phone was charged for Internet access - weeks after the mother had died and her phone sat idle in her empty home .
Karen Fullerman of Twinsburg is typical of customers who complained to The Plain Dealer last week .
Fullerman has three phone lines ; two are for her 23 - year - old twin daughters .
Fullerman has been charged $ 1.99 on one or two phones every month .
And sometimes there 's an extra $ 9.99 download fee .
Fullerman , who recently lost her job , said every dollar counts these days .
She insists that none of the three has gone on the Internet .
And she said Verizon has told her repeatedly that the company has blocked the phones ' ability to go on the Internet - yet the Internet charges continue .
The same is true for James Grega of Brunswick , whose four phone lines with Verizon have been getting charged sporadically for about four months .
" The phones are still being charged after I had them blocked , " Grega said .
" Their assurance that the $ 1.99 charges would stop has been a joke . "
Also frustrating to customers are several incorrect statements from Verizon workers :
Verizon can't determine the dates or times of supposed Internet access .
The company can , said Joseph Hall , an associate director of customer service for Verizon .
You can't block a phone 's ability to access the Internet without blocking the phone 's ability to send pictures .
You can .
A a $ 1.99 data usage charge could be caused by the company 's " backup assistant " service .
It can't ; the service does n't involve data usage and is a different line item for subscribers .
The company can't refund charges beyond the current month .
" We do it all of the time , " Hall said .
Brian Forneris of Amherst has made a mission of complaining every month he's hit with $ 1.99 data usage charges or $ 9.99 premium text message charges .
" I had success for a few months with getting Verizon to remove / credit the charges , " he said .
" However , they have refused to do so some months .
I suspect that they hope that people will not dedicate the time and effort to wait on hold and argue for a few dollars . "
Ferneris is standing on principle and talked to them as recently as last week .
" They continue to claim that they cannot block the ability to access megabyte usage without also blocking text messaging capabilities . "
Hall , the customer service executive , said customers should n't be able to get charged $ 9.99 for premium texting by accident .
The process requires a " double opt - in , " meaning the customer must provide her phone number to a third party ( such as an online IQ test or daily horoscope update ) .
Then , the customer must respond to a text message sent to the phone to agree to the charges .
Some customers say they 've never given such consent .
Besides increasing worker training , Verizon will change one policy as soon as possible to cut back on Internet charges incurred through hitting the wrong buttons .
The default home page for most phones is Verizon 's Web page .
The company is changing its policy to not count visits to the home page as Internet time , Tang said .
Mac BlackBerry users , rejoice !
I just got word from Research In Motion that it plans to release a new version of its BlackBerry Desktop Manager software for Apple 's Mac OS X operating system in September .
BlackBerry Desktop Software for Mac
There are n't currently too many details available on the forthcoming release ; however , RIM posted the following information on its Inside BlackBerry blog this morning :
BlackBerry Desktop
Software key features include :
- Sync your iTunes playlists , calendars , contacts , notes and tasks
- Add / Remove applications - Update your device when new software becomes available
- Backup and restore your device data with such features like automatically scheduled backups and optional encryption
- Manage multiple devices
The software will reportedly support Mac OX 10.5.5 and above .
I grilled RIM on the subject of BlackBerry Desktop Manager support for Mac in 2008 and was told to expect some kind of solution this year .
RIM already released a beta version of BlackBerry Media Sync for Mac earlier this year , which lets BlackBerry users sync music from their iTunes music libraries .
And I recently queried the company 's public relations manager on the subject of additional Mac - specific software , but was told that I 'd hear from the company as soon as it could share additional information .
I guess today 's that day .
On first glimpse , the Mac version appears to be able to perform all of the same core functions of the Windows - specific BlackBerry Desktop Manager , but we 'll have to wait until more details become available -- or beta version leaks -- before we know for sure .
One thing that is n't address is whether or not users will be able to modify BES mail settings , like they can with the Windows version .
This is great news for BlackBerry users with Mac computers .
Still , I must say , it 's about # $ % ^&* time , RIM !!

Astronomy Picture of the Day Discover the cosmos !
Each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is featured , along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer .
2009 September 4
6 Years of Saturn
Credit & Copyright : Alan Friedman
Explanation : Today , planet Earth passes through the plane of Saturn 's rings .
From the perspective of earthbound astronomers , Saturn 's rings will be edge - on .
The problem is , Saturn itself is now very close to the Sun , low on horizon after sunset , so good telescopic images will be difficult to come by .
Still , this composite of Saturn views taken from 2004 - 2009 ( lower right to upper left ) illustrates the change in ring tilt over the last six years and includes a nearly edge - on ring view , based on images captured earlier this year .
While Saturn 's south pole is clearly seen in the sequence , particularly at the lower right , it will be hidden in the coming years .
Saturn 's north pole will be increasingly visible , along with the tilting rings , as the planet emerges this fall in the predawn sky .
Auf dem Kongress zur Medienwoche Berlin - Brandenburg machten sich Vertreter der Rechteinhaber einmal mehr für eine " abgestufte Erwiderung " auf Urheberrechtsverstöße nach französischem Vorbild stark und formulierten weiterreichende Ansprüche .
Aus der Filmindustrie kommt ein Appell zur längeren Aufbewahrung von Verbindungsdaten für die Bekämpfung von Urheberrechtsverstößen im Netz .
Nötig sei eine 14 - tägige Speicherdauer bei allen Internetprovidern , forderte Martin Moszkowicz , Vorstand von Constantin Film , am heutigen Dienstag in Berlin .
Die Provider würden die IP - Adressen , die Rechteinhaber seit einem Jahr als Basis für zivilrechtliche Auskunftsansprüche nach den dahinter stehenden Kundendaten nutzen können , derzeit bei Flatrates gar nicht oder nur sieben Tage zugänglich machen .
Dies reiche oft nicht aus , um die Personendaten von Rechtsverletzern abzufragen .
Darüber hinaus machte sich Moszkowicz für ein Verfahren der " abgestuften Erwiderung " auf Urheberrechtsverletzungen bis zu Anschlusssperren stark , wie es in Frankreich vorangetrieben wird .
Auch Alexander Skipis , Geschäftsführer des Börsenvereins des Deutschen Buchhandels , sprach sich auf dem von der Verwertungsindustrie dominierten Urheberrechtsforum für Internetsperren aus .
Diese könnten eventuell das " geringere Übel " als der Klageweg sein .
Entscheidend sei , " dass wir rechtsstaatliche Verhältnisse im Internet haben " .
Das französische Vorbild bedeute nicht immer , dass eine " digitale Todesstrafe " verhängt werde " , erläuterte Matthias Leonardy , Gesellschaft zur Verfolgung von Urheberrechtsverletzungen ( GVU ) .
Es gebe viele Unterstufen zwischen Aufklärungskampagnen und dem " Abknipsen " der Nutzer vom Internet .
Jeder Urheberrechtsbruch " muss klar verfolgt werden , sonst verlieren wir kulturelle Vielfalt und Märkte " , machte sich auch Dieter Gorny , Chef des Bundesverbands Musikindustrie , für ein härteres Durchgreifen stark .
Er sei aber an dieser Stelle " kein Körbchenfan " , warnte er vor überzogenen Hoffnungen der Rechteinhaber auf den Gesetzgeber und einen " 3. Korb " der Urheberrechtsreform .
Andererseits möge bitte aber auch niemand " sozialromantisch glauben " , dass das Netz " ein riesengroßer Sandkasten der Selbstverwirklichung " sei : " Ein Internet , das alles darf , finde ich erschreckend . "
" Das Internet ist kein rechtsfreier Raum , sondern ein globales Kommunikationsmedium " , hielt Jens Seipenbusch , Vorsitzender der Piratenpartei Deutschland , dagegen .
Es habe den Prozess der Veröffentlichung komplett demokratisiert .
Zugleich verwies der Politiker auf das Paradox , dass die Verwertungsindustrie früher Zugang zu Werken schaffen sollte und diesen jetzt beschränken wolle .
Der Pirat setzte sich dafür ein , dass für private Zwecke getätigte Kopien generell keinen Rechtsverstoß darstellen sollten .
Der Jurist Oliver Süme vom eco-Verband sah ebenfalls keinen Anlass zu rechtlichen Änderungen .
Warnhinweise bei Rechtsverstößen zu verschicken sei heute bereits möglich .
Zudem gebe es erste gerichtliche Anordnungen zum " Einfrieren " von Verbindungsdaten , um einen Auskunftsanspruch später geltend machen zu können .
Für ein ausgeglichenes Urheberrecht , das auch die Interessen der Nutzer an Informationsbedürfnis und eigener kreativer Betätigung berücksichtigt , trat Annette Kroeber - Riel von Google ein .
Vorwürfe , dass der Suchmaschinenprimus es mit dem Copyright nicht so eng sehe , wies sie zurück : " Wir helfen , Urheberrechtsverletzungen zu finden . "
Als zusätzliche Wahlmöglichkeit pries Michael Carroll , Gründungsmitglied von Creative Commons ( CC ) , den Versuch der Initiative an , über alternative Lizenzen Werke stärker für kulturelle Verwendungen wie Remixe zu öffnen .
Dies sei im Internet besonders wichtig , das viele Nutzer selbst Inhalte generierten .

How Impressive Is Usain Bolt ?
A Freakonomics Quiz
Last week , the sprinter Usain Bolt ran 100 meters in 9.58 seconds , shattering the existing world record .
For his feat , Bolt may just be named athlete of the year .
In some ways , what is more remarkable than Bolt ’s feat is how slow the improvement has been in the 100 - meter dash .
Back in 1968 , Jim Hines became the first person to break the 10 - second barrier , finishing the race in 9.95 seconds .
In 1991 , Carl Lewis got the world record down to 9.86 seconds .
In 1999 , Maurice Green ran 9.79 seconds .
Asafa Powell ran 9.72 in 2008 .
Thus , between 1968 and today , the world record time had improved by 3.7 percent , or less than 0.1 percent per year .
This is in spite of the fact that there have surely been technological advances in tracks and shoes , as well as expanding knowledge of weight training and fitness .
The world ’s population has increased substantially , as have nutrition levels , especially in developing countries .
The biggest puzzle to me is not how remarkable Usain Bolt is , but rather why it ’s been so hard to get people to sprint faster .
So here is the quiz : what human activity is the polar opposite of sprinting in the sense that the gains achieved over the last 40 years are most extraordinary ?
Here are the ground rules .
It has to be something done by humans .
It has to be an activity in which achievements have been consistently tracked for at least 40 years .
It can not be an activity in which the improvements have been driven primarily by changes in technology .
( For instance , anything that has to do with the use of computers would be excluded from the contest because it is likely driven by the explosion in computing power . )
I have in mind one activity that has seen the most remarkable improvements I can think of .
The first person to highlight that same activity wins a prize .
In addition , if people can come up with even better examples than my own , another prize goes to the person whose activity has shown the greatest improvement .
Good luck to all .
We ’ll accept contest entries for 48 hours .
Addendum :
The winner is announced here .
If you 've ever felt doomed to repeat your mistakes , researchers at MIT 's Picower Institute for Learning and Memory may have explained why : Brain cells may only learn from experience when we do something right and not when we fail .
In the July 30 issue of the journal Neuron , Earl K. Miller , the Picower Professor of Neuroscience , and MIT colleagues Mark Histed and Anitha Pasupathy have created for the first time a unique snapshot of the learning process that shows how single cells change their responses in real time as a result of information about what is the right action and what is the wrong one .
" We have shown that brain cells keep track of whether recent behaviors were successful or not , " Miller said .
Furthermore , when a behavior was successful , cells became more finely tuned to what the animal was learning .
After a failure , there was little or no change in the brain — nor was there any improvement in behavior .
The study sheds light on the neural mechanisms linking environmental feedback to neural plasticity — the brain 's ability to change in response to experience .
It has implications for understanding how we learn , and understanding and treating learning disorders .
Rewarding success
Monkeys were given the task of looking at two alternating images on a computer screen .
For one picture , the animal was rewarded when it shifted its gaze to the right ; for another picture it was supposed to look left .
The monkeys used trial and error to figure out which images cued which movements .
advertisement
The researchers found that whether the animals ' answers were right or wrong , signals within certain parts of their brains " resonated " with the repercussions of their answers for several seconds .
The neural activity following a correct answer and a reward helped the monkeys do better on the trial that popped up a few seconds later .
" If the monkey just got a correct answer , a signal lingered in its brain that said , ' You did the right thing . '
Right after a correct answer , neurons processed information more sharply and effectively , and the monkey was more likely to get the next answer correct as well , " Miller said , " But after an error there was no improvement .
In other words , only after successes , not failures , did brain processing and the monkeys ' behavior improve . "
Split - second influence
The prefrontal cortex orchestrates thoughts and actions in accordance with internal goals while the basal ganglia are associated with motor control , cognition and emotions .
This work shows that these two brain areas , long suspected to play key roles in learning and memory , have full information available to them to do all the neural computations necessary for learning .
The prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia , extensively connected with each other and with the rest of the brain , are thought to help us learn abstract associations by generating brief neural signals when a response is correct or incorrect .
But researchers never understood how this transient activity , which fades in less than a second , influenced actions that occurred later .
advertisement
In this study , the researchers found activity in many neurons within both brain regions that reflected the delivery or withholding of a reward lasted for several seconds , until the next trial .
Single neurons in both areas conveyed strong , sustained outcome information for four to six seconds , spanning the entire time frame between trials .
Response selectivity was stronger on a given trial if the previous trial had been rewarded and weaker if the previous trial was an error .
This occurred whether the animal was just learning the association or was already good at it .
After a correct response , the electrical impulses coming from neurons in each of the brain areas was more robust and conveyed more information .
" The signal - to - noise ratio improved in both brain regions , " Miller said .
" The heightened response led to them being more likely to get the next trial correct , too .
This explains on a neural level why we seem to learn more from our successes than our failures . "
In addition to Miller , authors include former MIT graduate student Mark H. Histed , now a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard Medical School , and former postdoctoral fellow Anitha Pasupathy , now an assistant professor at the University of Washington .
This work is supported by National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and the Tourette 's Syndrome Association .
Amazon also benefits greatly from its advanced inventory management methods and ability to negotiate beneficial payment terms with vendors .
The company sells such a large volume of merchandise , and can predict customer demand so accurately , that it generally sells products within 65 days , before it has to pay suppliers for them .
That arrangement , which analysts call “ negative working capital , ” is unusual outside of grocery stores and allows Amazon to avoid the huge capital charges associated with buying and storing such a broad line of inventory .
It also boosts the company ’s cash flow , which it has used to pay down its debt to $ 109 million at the end of June from a hefty $ 2 billion in 2000 , and to add more product lines to its Web site .
Amazon ’s profit and margins have always been slender ; it earned only $ 645 million in 2008 , up 36 percent from the year before , compared to Wal - Mart ’s $ 13.4 billion , up 5 percent .
But Wall Street is more enamored by the promise of the online retailer , valuing Amazon at around 60 times earnings and Wal - Mart at 15 times earnings .
“ They do n’t have to incur huge inventory carrying costs and can add product categories almost ad infinitum , ” said Jeffrey Lindsay , an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein .
“ Amazon has an almost magical business model in terms of inventory management . ”
AMAZON’S incursion into general retail has rivals scurrying to regroup and stop its advance .
In August , Target , which allowed Amazon to run its
Web site for the last decade , announced it would end the affiliation when its contract was up in 2011 , following other one - time Amazon partners like Borders and Toys “ R ” Us .
This month , Wal - Mart said it would allow other retailers to sell their products on Walmart.com , mimicking Amazon ’s third - party marketplace and trying to match its vast selection .
Analysts believe Sears , which owns Kmart , is preparing to allow outside sellers on its sites as well .
But the Amazon effect may be most deeply felt by small independent stores , which cannot hope to compete with Amazon ’s selection and prices and recall in fear how the company hastened the fate of both independent booksellers and prominent electronics chains like Circuit City .
Like many small business owners , Ken Lombardi , the C.E.O. of his family ’s 60 - year - old Lombardi Sports in San Francisco , views Amazon as a source of some of his business troubles .
Though his store has been hit hard by the recession and the expansion of a sporting goods chain , R.E.I. , in the Bay Area , Mr. Lombardi says that it is Amazon that has helped depress profit margins and snagged sales for basics like silicone swim caps , undershirts and running shoes  which , he adds , Amazon can offer without California ’s 8.25 percent sales tax .

Trouble has flared as world leaders gather in the US city of Pittsburgh for the G20 summit .
Police fired pepper spray and rubber bullets at marchers after they rolled rubbish bins and threw rocks .
The clashes began after hundreds of protesters , many shouting anti-capitalist slogans , tried to march from the outlying Lawrenceville neighbourhood toward the convention centre where the summit is being held .
The protesters banged on drums and chanted as they marched through the streets .

Hi . I am a Moron .
I 've lived with ZOT administered health care and I think it 's GREAT !
TomTGradeczek
Posted on by TomTGradeczek
I posted my complete opinions about living 7 years with government run healthcare plans in other countries ( they were fabulous and gave great peace of mind at low cost ) , my opinions of the government employee healthcare programs using private insurance in the USA ( they were all generally poor to bad ( Humana , Blue Cross Blue Shield , Aetna etc. ) , the fact that I am older now and will be using VA medical facilities , unless I am too far to travel to one of them , in which case I 'll use Medicare .
The absolute worst medical care I got in the last 40 years that I 've used private insurers , government program insurers , and just paying for medical and dental care out of my pocket was with private insurance carriers , because they are basically charging us all a hidden tax of about 28 % of every dollar we spend to pay for other things besides actual health care and administration is for outrageous executive salaries , stock options , advertising designed to scare us all into worrying about health care if these companies do n't make hundreds of millions of dollars in profits and " return on investment " ( Private insurance companies make us all feel like cattle ) .
I 'm going to break the one long post I made 2 days ago ( that was deleted by the moderator at Freep ) into a bunch of small posts , because I never was told why the post was deleted .
So here is the first item that might have made the moderator delete my post .
I wonder how many of the hysterical people complaining about a government backed healthcare plan they have NO experience with , have EVER had ANY experiences lasting a few years with government run healthcare programs in other countries .
I explained how my 5 years on the Canadian health care program ( QHIP ) were very good , and how I needed services that I still need today , but the doctors loved it because the paperwork was low .
The people needing health care ( I was a university Business School lecturer at the time ) all paid a high percentage of their salary to support the system ( I paid between 5 % - 9 % of my income to QHIP ) .
For this I could pick my own doctor and all the prescriptions were extremely inexpensive ( which is why Americans are running across the border to buy prescription drugs in Canada ) .
I had a number of major injuries while I was on the QHIP program .
I sprained both my ankle and knee in a motorcycle collision with a car and I was in a hip - to - toe cast for 4 weeks .
I cut myself while making dinner and needed 7 stitches , I was treated for and cured of an ulcer , and I caught Legionnaire 's disease from someone returning from a Philadelphia convention in 1976 and was hospitalized for 4 days .
I was young and perhaps I should n't have required so much expensive medical care , but stuff happens .
The system worked extremely well , I picked my own doctors and prescriptions / tests were very inexpensive ( of course the healthcare plan payroll deductions paid for all that ) .
It may take 5 additional comments to cover my great experiences with another country 's government single payer healthcare program , my really bad healthcare experiences with every private insurance company I 've used in the USA , and why Rupert Murdoch gets away with buying shares in American Healthcare Insurance companies .
Then Rupert Murdoch ( who owns FOX ) hires commentators or uses syndicated feeds from commentators who try to whip up hysteria against any government run healthcare program in the USA .
Of course this is just Rupert 's way of manipulating us in America ( Rupert has a government run Australian health care system he can use if he wishes ) , so the value of Rupert 's investments in US health care insurance companies keeps making him more and more money .
I 'll just keep putting up those REAL experiences from my own life , and my comments about how commentators are helping millionaires to make more money on the backs of the wage slaves in the USA who use private health care insurance companies .
If I step over the line criticizing the damage done to Americans ' right to Life ( health is an obvious requirement here ) , Liberty and of course The Pursuit of Happiness ( hard to do with a huge hidden tax being levied on us by the health insurance companies , and the hysteria they create about whether we will be able to get any health care at all . )

Keep your laws off my BODY !
When this health care for all  crap passes , right now the legislation states that it will be illegal to sell private policies over the date of passage .
It also says that HSAs will no longer be allowed .
That means that my current policy will no longer be allowed and neither I nor my employer will be allowed to privately purchase an alternative .
I will not accept the public option that I will be dictated to join .
I will not give the government control over my physical body .
I will not pay their fines , I will not surrender to the impending warrant for my arrest .
When they knock on my door , I will not answer .
When they kick it in , I will make the news .
Hows that for unification , libtards ?
You loons are currently legislating my death .
I will chose the terms and I will bring as many of you along as possible !

I ’ve had experiences with Govt run health care - in China .
Maybe their problem is that they started socialized medicine when they were a poor country .
In sum , it was awful .
The cost was very low , but poor service ( and sanitation ) meant one would have to wait in lines foreover .
Also , anyone seeking good care would need to make friends and quietly pay bribes to the good doctors to see have them see you .
Their socialized medicine became such a joke that a private system operating both legally and illegally exists next to it .
It now combines the worst of both systems ....

“ For this I could pick my own doctor and all the prescriptions were extremely inexpensive ( which is why Americans are running across the border to buy prescription drugs in Canada ) . ”
Canada ( among many other countries ) dictated terms to the pharmaceutical companies .
Either supply the drugs at a deep discount , or generic drugs would be allowed to compete against the patent medicines .
It 's free - riding plain and simple .
Americans pay the full freight for developing the drugs .
The rest of the world pays a far smaller share of R&D costs .
If the same prices were offered in the U.S. ; few , if any , new treatments would be developed there .
I 'm a Canadian & I do n't deny that I 'm happy to take advantage of the situation .
At least I recognize it for what it is -- there 's no magical formula that will cut drug costs for everyone ( but , perhaps Americans would be paying less , if the rest of the world payed a bit more ) .

Athletes riding their luck in Torino by Lincoln Archer for CNN
Hosp has a lucky pig sending her positive vibes .
RELATED SPECIAL REPORT  Quiz : Torino 2006 Quiz Medal Tracker  Special : Winter Olympics 2006 YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Winter Olympics Skiing Nicole Hosp Lindsey Kildow or or Create Your Own TORINO , Italy --
There is a pig living a peaceful existence in the Austrian alpine village of Bichlbach , a little cold perhaps , but otherwise perfectly happy .
For now .
This pig is blissfully unaware , living in its sty surrounded by bucolic splendor , that its days are numbered .
The animal was given to its owner , Austrian skier Nicole Hosp , as a lucky charm by Hosp 's sister Sonja .
Hosp is hoping the swine will bring her mountains of luck as she swoops down the slopes of San Sicario , and for the remainder of the World Cup skiing season .
And after that , she is going to eat it .
" What else would you do with a pig ? " she said during a break from competition .
But Hosp also sees a more mystical reason for eating the Lucky Osterhase , or " luck Easter bunny " , as the pig is known , than merely the prospect of ham , bacon and pork in plentiful supply .
" That way I 'll have its luck inside me for the next year , " she said .
That which gives the pig its power , it seems , also seals its fate .
Hosp is not the only athlete with an animal in her corner .
U.S. skier Lindsey Kildow is said to have a lucky cow , which was being moved from Austria to France to be closer to Kildow as she competes .
Kildow has not yet said what lies in store for the cow after the completion of the Games .
Presumably , however , it could not be allowed to remain in Austria lest it receive word of the future awaiting Hosp 's talisman .
The efficacy of Kildow 's cow is a matter of some conjecture .
The 21 - year - old from Colorado spectacularly crashed out of training for the women 's downhill event , all but crushing her hopes for a medal .
On the other hand , believers in such things could argue that Kildow was extremely lucky to have emerged from such a heavy fall with only minor injuries .
Barely 24 hours after being taken off the course on a stretcher , she was out of hospital and preparing to ski the event after all .
Russian biathlete Olga Pyleva was seen cuddling a white furry toy known as a " Cheburashka " after winning silver in her first ever Olympic race , but her luck turned dramatically for the worse when she was stripped of the medal after failing a drug test .
Russian officials said a doctor who treated Pyleva for an ankle injury in Siberia in January gave her a medication that contained the banned stimulant carphedon but did not list it among its ingredients .
" It 's a shocking situation , " Pyleva told Russian television , " because I 've always been against using banned medications .
" What 's happened now is just monstrous stupidity . "
Unlucky 17
The amulets and trinkets were out in force among the superstitious in Italy on day seven of competition , the 17th of February .
In Italy , the 17th has the negative power wielded by the number 13 in other countries .
By coincidence -- or is it ? -- day seven fell on Friday the 17th .
One Torino taxi driver who spoke to AP ran to touch a metal gate , the Italian version of touching wood , after hearing mention of the alignment of day and date .
" I once had a motorcycle accident at 17:17 on Friday 17 , how can I not believe in it ? " he said , although adding that he did not carry a charm to protect him .
" I just try to be more careful on such a day . "
The mystique surrounding 17 is said to have developed from its depiction in Roman numerals as XVII .
This is an anagram of " vixi " , which in Latin is roughly translated as " I died . "
Out of deference to the superstition , turn 17 at the sledding track at Cesana is the only one without a nickname .
Nevertheless , many competitors have come to grief on the course , crashing out on a track some describe as treacherous but that officials call " challenging . "
Time to call in the pigs .
