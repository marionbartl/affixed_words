I 've had this blog for 15 years .
The views here are my own .
This is a personal blog .
SUSAN JAMES , a 50 - year - old probation officer in Bakersfield , Calif. , has been a competitive runner for almost three decades .
“ I ’ve spent a lot of hours running through this city , ” she said .
Which is beginning to worry her .
“ Twenty years ago , I did n’t have asthma or allergies , ” she said .
Today , she has both , probably due to the same improbable cause .
“ My doctor told me I ’m allergic to Bakersfield air , ” she said .
“ I ’m actually allergic to it . ”
In May , the American Lung Association called Bakersfield the third - sootiest city in the country , behind Los Angeles and Pittsburgh .
The news did n’t surprise Ms. James .
“ Sometimes my chest aches ” midrun , she said .
To combat the pollution , she may soon join a gym for the first time .
“ I ’ve got a lot of years to run still , and I ’m not sure if I can do it outside , ” she said .
The Bush administration ’s long overdue U.S. Climate Action Report – 2006 , given a stealth release on Friday afternoon July 27 , lacks a forthright discussion of a range of likely adverse climate change impacts on the U.S. and fails to draw on the IPCC 2007 impacts assessment report and the substantial scientific literature on which it is based , including the assessment of North America impacts .
The failure to use this material , and the overall evasiveness of the impacts and vulnerability chapter of the report , was clearly a political decision .
Administration officials have once again defaulted on an opportunity to address a crucial challenge for national preparedness .
In a major report delivered on July 27 to the Secretariat of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change , the Bush Administration says that , since 2001 , it has dedicated nearly $ 29 billion to advance climate - related science , technology , international assistance , and incentive programs .
However , that considerable investment has apparently not been enough to purchase a full , clear , and unambiguous acknowledgment from the Administration in U.S. Climate Action Report — 2006 ( CAR4 ) that human activity is rapidly changing climate , that impacts are now being observed , that the consequences will grow steadily throughout the 21st century and beyond , and that the U.S. is vulnerable and must prepare for those impacts .
In contrast , reports submitted to the UNFCCC Secretariat by other national governments show no such reluctance to accept and acknowledge the international scientific consensus on the causes and consequences of climate change , and the implications for their countries .
A Stealth Release
The Department of State submitted the report on Friday July 27 , marking the event only with a brief media note from the department ’s Office of the Spokesman .
The media note includes a link to the report .
The report was not mentioned in the department ’s daily briefing that day ; nor did the White House Council on Environmental Quality mention the report ’s release on its Web site .
Under climate treaty guidelines the report was due December 31 , 2005 , and thus was submitted 19 months past the deadline .
The very low profile release suggests that the Administration would like to avoid the kind of press coverage it attracted when it released the previous edition in this series , U.S. Climate Action Report - 2002 ( the Third National Communication ) .
Andrew Revkin of the New York Times kicked off a political storm for the Administration with a front page story on June 3 , 2002 ( “ U.S. Sees Problems in Climate Change ” ) , focusing on the report ’s Chapter 6 on Impacts and Adaptation .
Revkin ’s article asserted that the 2002 report ’s discussion of climate change impacts presented a sharp contrast to previous statements on climate change by the administration , which had always spoken in generalities and emphasized the need for much more research to resolve scientific questions .
( Note : See the Council on Environmental Quality ’s Online Reading room for White House documents related to the Revkin piece , in the Climate Action Report section of the CEQ FOIA Responses ) .
According to guidelines [ PDF ] approved by the U.S. and other parties to the UNFCCC , Chapter 6 of each country ’s report is supposed to discuss the expected impacts of climate change , vulnerability and adaptation measures .
Yet the report ’s coverage of expected impacts is haphazard and incomplete , with a lot of major impacts not even mentioned .
A notable exception to CAR4 ’s dismal discussion of expected impacts is a box in Chapter 6 that was added after the public review period .
It summarizes in bullet form the major conclusions of the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment ( ACIA ) .
According to the box , the ACIA authors found that :
Arctic climate is now warming rapidly , and much larger changes are projected .
Arctic warming and its consequences have worldwide implications .
Arctic vegetation zones are very likely to shift , causing wide - ranging impacts .
Animal species ’ diversity , ranges , and distribution will change .
Many coastal communities and facilities face increasing exposure to storms .
Reduced sea ice is very likely to increase marine transport and access to resources .
Thawing ground will disrupt transportation , buildings , and other infrastructure .
Indigenous communities are facing major economic and cultural impacts .
Elevated ultraviolet radiation levels will affect people , plants , and animals .
Multiple influences interact to cause impacts to people and ecosystems .
Current information on impacts on polar regions and on the North American region
The ACIA findings are not discussed in further detail in the text of Chapter 6 .
Nor are they mentioned in CAR4 ’s Executive Summary ( Chapter 1 ) .
Lack of forthright discussion of full range of likely climate change impacts and failure to use available IPCC North America impacts assessment
While CAR4 notes U.S. involvement with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) Fourth Assessment report ( specifically the IPCC Working Group II contribution , Climate Change 2007 : Impacts , Adaptation and Vulnerability ) , it fails to exploit the content of that report ( see Summary for Policymakers [ PDF ] ) , instead relying on the IPCC ’s dated Third Assessment report published in 2001 .
The North America chapter [ PDF ] of that report was accepted in April 2007 by the U.S. and other governments and certainly was available to draw upon , though it has not yet been released in its final copyedited and published form .
The IPCC report ’s Summary for Policymakers ( SPM ) [ PDF ] , however , was approved in final form in April 2007 and was made publicly available at that time .
The IPCC Summary highlights major expected impacts for North America for the range of ( unmitigated ) climate change projected by the IPCC during the 21st century , as follows :
Moderate climate change in the early decades of the century is projected to increase aggregate yields of rainfed agriculture by 5 - 20 % , but with important variability among regions .
Major challenges are projected for crops that are near the warm end of their suitable range or depend on highly utilized water resources .
[ high confidence ]
Warming in western mountains is projected to cause decreased snowpack , more winter flooding , and reduced summer flows , exacerbating competition for over - allocated water resources .
[ very high confidence ]
Disturbances from pests , diseases , and fire are projected to have increasing impacts on forests , with an extended period of high fire risk and large increases in area burned .
[ very high confidence ]
Cities that currently experience heat waves are expected to be further challenged by an increased number , intensity and duration of heat waves during the course of the century , with potential for adverse health impacts .
The growing number of the elderly population is most at risk .
[ very high confidence ]
Coastal communities and habitats will be increasingly stressed by climate change impacts interacting with development and pollution .
Population growth and the rising value of infrastructure in coastal areas increase vulnerability to climate variability and future climate change , with losses projected to increase if the intensity of tropical storms increases .
Current adaptation is uneven and readiness for increased exposure is low .. [ very high confidence ]
The report fails to report on these findings reported by the IPCC Working Group II Summary for Policymakers , and offers no explanation for failing to acknowledge them
The Administration may claim that it does not reference the IPCC 2007 Fourth Assessment Report on climate change impacts because CAR4 was issued before the IPCC report became available .
The State Department media note says that " The report takes into account activities up to and including 2006 . "
Similarly , the report itself ( Chapter 1 ) says : " This review was undertaken to account for activities up to and including 2006 . "
Chapter 6 adds that the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report " will be completed in November 2007 . "
That argument would be evasive in several respects .
First , important portions of the IPCC 2007 report were in fact completed and citable prior to July 27 when CAR4 was released .
This includes all three working group Summary for Policymaker documents and the full text of both the Working Group I and Working Group III reports .
Second , the report could have cited the literature upon which the IPCC relied — none of which was published in 2007 .
There is no reason why CAR4 could not have drawn fully on the same body of literature to draw conclusions similar to those of the IPCC .
In fact , it did not draw on much of the key literature published since CAR3 — despite a boom in the literature since then .
The North America chapter of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report ( Working Group II on Impacts ) specifically notes the " [ a ] vailability of much more literature on all aspects of impacts , adaptation , and vulnerability in North America . "
Third , Chapter 6 in fact does refer to several other 2007 reports , including two that are listed as " in press " in the appendix of CAR4 .
If these publications are cited , why is IPCC 2007 not also discussed ?
We conclude that the Administration and the Climate Change Science Program leadership have failed to draw on the conclusions of the IPCC 2007 report because to do so would require acknowledging the likelihood of a wide range of adverse societal and environmental consequences of climate change that the Administration is unwilling to discuss forthrightly .
This was clearly a political decision , without scientific justification .
Other countries are more forthright in discussing climate change impacts
Comparison of key statements on expected impacts drawn from the Executive Summaries of Fourth National Communications reports submitted to the UNFCCC Secretariat by different countries
In contrast to reports submitted by other countries , the executive summary of the U.S. report does not cite any specific expected impacts .
It contains only one line related to impacts .
In contrast , other countries typically acknowledge and cite specific impacts ; and are more detailed in their discussion .
U.S. :
http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/89646.pdf
" Since 2002 , U.S. research has led to new insights into the impacts of climate change and variability on key physical processes ( e.g. , snowpack , streamflow , extreme events ) that have implications for a range of socioeconomic sectors . ”
Canada :
http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/natc/cannc4.pdf
“ … the magnitude , timing and regional impacts of climate change could have serious repercussions on Canada ’s natural resources , social and economic systems , and infrastructure , and possibly on the health and general well - being of Canadians .
As a consequence of climate change , weather variability could in turn generate damaging consequences for the health of Canadians .
While there may be limited positive impacts associated with global warming , Canada ’s vulnerability to extreme weather events such as droughts , floods , hurricanes and violent thunderstorms and windstorms could also increase .
Impacts of climate change on precipitation and evapo - transpiration could affect soil moisture levels and erosion , water quality and safety , surface and ground water levels , hydrologic cycle variability and predictability , and wetland area extent .
Consequently , these could have serious ramifications for agriculture , tourism , municipal water supplies , water transportation and wildlife habitat .
The forestry and fisheries sectors could also be threatened by possible changes in climate . ”
European Community
http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/natc/eunce4.pdf
Predicted sea level rises could impact up to 68 million people in the EU .
Temperatures are expected to increase leading to more deaths due to high temperatures during summer but fewer cold related deaths in the winter .
Northern Europe is expected to have increased precipitation , Southern Europe less with potentially more droughts .
New Zealand
http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/natc/nzlnc4.pdf
The broad expected pattern of climate change effects in New Zealand is : increased temperatures ( with greater increases in the winter season , and in the north of New Zealand )
decreased frost risk but increased risk of very high temperatures
stronger west–east rainfall gradient ( wetter in the west and drier in the east )
increased westerly winds
increased frequency of extreme ( heavy ) daily rainfalls
increased sea level .
Japan
http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/natc/japnc4.pdf
“ Research to date indicates that climate change may have a major effect on Japan ’s agriculture , forestry , fisheries , water resources , coastal management , natural ecosystems , and human health .
For example , it is estimated that , due to global warming , the number of typhoons will decrease and their maximum intensity will increase slightly .
In terms of rice cultivation in paddy fields , it is estimated that the production volume will increase in upper latitudes while problems may occur with growth due to higher temperatures in lower latitudes .
It is thought that demand for water supply will increase by approximately 1.2 to 3.2 percent per 3 °C increase in temperature .
Furthermore , it is thought that heat stress will increase due to higher temperatures in summer , with effects also seen on human health due to increased vectors and improved growth conditions for pathogenic organs and parasites . ”
Questions for the Bush Administration about the Report
In April 2007 , the U.S. and other countries accepted Climate Change 2007 : Impacts , Adaptation and Vulnerability , the contribution of Working Group II to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
In addition , the U.S. and other governments approved the Summary for Policymakers ( SPM ) [ PDF ] of that report .
Approval of the WG II SPM preceded the CAR4 public review period ( 4 May – 1 June 2007 ) and submission of the final CAR4 report to the UNFCCC Secretariat ( 27 July 2007 ) .
Why does the CAR4 report cite only the IPCC ’s dated Third Assessment Report ( published in 2001 ) while failing to cite the IPCC ’s most recent report and the North America climate change impacts identified in that report – particularly the SPM , which was publicly available in final form in April ?
( SPM ) [ PDF ] of that report .
Approval of the WG II SPM preceded the CAR4 public review period ( 4 May – 1 June 2007 ) and submission of the final CAR4 report to the UNFCCC Secretariat ( 27 July 2007 ) .
The IPCC WG II Summary for Policymakers describes the main expected impacts for North America “ for the range of ( unmitigated ) climate changes projected by the IPCC over this century . ”
Are these impacts specifically cited or discussed in Chapter 6 ?
If not , why not ?
In their National Communications to the UNFCCC Secretariat , other governments address a wide range of expected impacts .
In contrast , the Administration discusses only a limited set of expected impacts and fails to even mention most of the North American impacts specifically highlighted in the IPCC Working Group II Summary for Policymakers ( SPM ) .
That SPM was approved line - by - line in April by the U.S. and other governments .
Does the Administration in fact expect impacts beyond the limited set identified in CAR4 ?
If so , what are those impacts and why does the report not specifically acknowledge them ?
The Department of State issued a Federal Register notice on April 8 2005 that said it “ intends to make available for public review a draft national communication in summer of 2005 . ”
That review was delayed nearly two years –until May 2007 .
Why ?
The Third U.S. Climate Action Report was due no later than November 30 , 2001 and was submitted 6 months late in May 2002 .
In contrast , the Fourth report was due no later than December 31 , 2005 , and was submitted 19 months past the deadline on July 27 , 2007 .
What accounted for the extraordinary delay in submitting the 4 th Climate Action Report ?
What was the role of the Council on Environmental Quality in producing the report ?
Which individuals at CEQ were actively involved with reviewing and approving it ?
Who wrote Chapter 6 of the fourth Climate Action Report ?
Who reviewed drafts of the Chapter ?
Will the Department of State release the comments that were submitted in response to its Federal Register notice on April 8 2005 ?
Will the Department of State release the comments that were submitted during the public review period from May 4 2007 to 1 June ( in response to its Federal Register notice of 4 May 2007 ) ?
Did any U.S. government agencies , including the U.S. Climate Change Science Program Office , submit comments to the Department of State on drafts of Chapter 6 of the Climate Action Report ?
What were those comments ?
Will the Department of State release those comments ?

Thanks for the tip , Phil !
Reporter 's Notebook :
There was a time when selling Linux ( or even just writing about it ) was an evangelical endeavor .
Users needed to be sold on Linux 's benefits and , more importantly , assured that it actually worked .
LinuxWorld after LinuxWorld , vendors upped the ante with new technologies and genuinely new initiatives .
Not so at LinuxWorld San Francisco 2007 .
This is the year that Linux is so mature , so stable , so tried and true , that it 's actually , dare I say it ?
Boring .
Hey do n't give me that snarky look and do n't flame me .
I 'm not the one who first said it .
None other than Linux kernel maintainer Andrew Morton expressed a similar sentiment on the very first day of LinuxWorld .
" The kernel is a very dull project and that 's the way we want it to be , " Morton said .
Linux itself is now so mature and stable that it is running mission - critical datacenters and applications around the globe .
Linux is at the core of the Internet itself , it 's the plumbing of the modern information economy .
No major new announcements or revelations came out of this event .
Vendors like IBM and Novell announced partnerships and virtualization ( as it has been for nearly two years ) remained a buzzword .
Kevin Kettler , Dell 's CTO , did a whole presentation with the only real purpose being to show that , " Oh yes , virtualization on Linux is a stable reality . "
Yes that 's a good thing , and , yes , it is something that many enterprises and end users will benefit from .
As time progresses , the stability of Linux , as well as its favorable licensing terms , may well make Linux the big winner in the virtualization game .
Novell 's CEO Ron Hovsepian got it a bit wrong in his keynote .
He argued that application availability is the key to the success of Linux , which is absolutely correct .
He also argued that the Linux Standards Base ( LSB ) is n't enough to enable software vendors to write applications across various Linux distributions , which is also somewhat accurate .
But he strayed when he said he wanted to create some magical new effort or group for which he offered no concrete details or plans that would do what the LSB does not .
That is , make a standard Linux such that an application vendor can easily develop for all Linux distributions .
The answer to Hovsepian 's dilemma is simple .
Virtualization is the key to wide application availability on Linux .
It is also the key to the widespread use of Linux .
As virtualization becomes the dominant compute paradigm for IT , the question no longer is which operating system has more application support .
The question becomes which platform is best for virtualization .
The role that Linux plays in the virtualization space is as the enabler , the plumbing , the operating system that lets applications run virtual machines on top .
It is also the underlying operating system in the virtual machine appliances themselves .
So sure , the fact the no crazy news emerged from LinuxWorld may not be exciting .
But having vendors push the merits of virtualization on Linux does make a point , though .
When it comes to Linux in the datacenter , boring is good .
It 's stable , mature and it works .
And it 's not going to surprise you .
Sean Michael Kerner is a senior editor with internetnews.com .
Sun Microsystems is the latest company to become a patron of the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) .
The FSF 's corporate patron program allows companies to provide financial sponsorship for the FSF in return for free license consulting services .
High - profile FSF patron affiliates include prominent technology companies like Google , Nokia , IBM , Cisco , and Intel .
FSF involvement represents
Sun 's latest attempt to take a more active role in the open - source software community .
Over the years ,
Sun 's position on the FSF 's GPL license has changed many times .
In 2004 , when Sun first considered adopting the GPL , Jonathan Schwartz said that the company viewed " the GPL as a friend . "
A year later , Schwartz expressed a very different opinion when he condemned the GPL and characterized its share - alike clauses as a " predatory obligation " and " intellectual property colonialism . "
Sun officially put an end to the flip - flopping last year , when the company finally released its Java programming language under the GPL .
Sun representatives have also expressed interest in potentially dual - licensing OpenSolaris to make it available under the GPL as well as the company 's own CDDL license .
Now that Sun has liberated the source code of its two flagship products , it seems clear that the company is willing to practice what it preaches .
Sun 's newly - announced support for the FSF tells us that Sun's GPL adoption is n't just another passing phase for the company .
Sun 's interest in the GPL3 , an upcoming revision of the GPL , probably played a role in the company 's decision to become more involved with the FSF .
At present , developers of the Linux kernel do not intend to transition to the GPL3 .
If Sun adopts the GPL3 for OpenSolaris and the Linux kernel remains with current version of the license , it could potentially stimulate the growth of the OpenSolaris community and help Sun attract community contributors who are ideologically aligned with the FSF .

こないだこのブログで アイヒャーの文章を紹介した時 ふと思い出して 、2000 年にグラフィックデザイナーたちが共同で出したマニフェスト「 First Things First」もそのうち紹介しますと書いていたら、今度、下北沢でやることなってるイルコモンズ・アカデミーの共謀者である 加藤さん がテキストを送ってくれましたので紹介します。以前、雑誌「アイデア」の「エミグレ」特集号に掲載されてた翻訳をお手本に自分で訳してみようと思って、すこしはじめていたのですが、送ってもらったテキストの方がずっとよかったので、手を加えず、そのまま転載します。ちなみに加藤さんは、2000年にこの宣言に署名して、当時いたデザイン会社を辞めたそうです。もしそうしてなったら、気流舎はなかったかもしれないと考えると英断だったかも。ということで、デザイナーの方もそうでない方も、ぜひ一読を。▼「本当に大切なことを一番に 」
声明文この声明文に名を連ねる私たちは、グラフィック・デザイナー、アートディレクター、ビジュアル・コミュニケーターである。私たちが育ってきたこれまでの社会では、広告の仕事が、自分たちの才能を活かし、高収入をもたらし、効果も見えやすい理想的な職業のナンバー・ワンであるかのように思わされてきた。多くのデザイン関係の教師や指導的な立場の者たちも、そう信じて指導にあたってきたし、業界でも広告関係には高い報酬が支払われ、さらにおびただしい量の書籍や出版物により、この「広告至上主義」は動かしがたい事実として定着してきた。デザイナーたちはこれに踊らされ、犬用のビスケットやデザイナー・ブランドのコーヒー、ダイヤモンド、洗剤、ヘアージェル、煙草、クレジットカード、スニーカー、痩身クリーム、ライト・ビール、RV車などの販売促進のために、自らの技術と想像力を使ってきた。コマーシャルの仕事をこなしていれば食いはぐれることはなかったが、今や多くのグラフィック・デザイナーたちが、ほぼすべての時間をコマーシャル制作に注ぎ込むまでに成り下がってしまった。それにつれて、人々はデザインというものを、コマーシャルとしてしか感じなくなった。デザイナーたちのプロとしての時間とエネルギーが、本来生活に必要とされていないものの需要を生み出すために、消耗されているのである。私たちはこんなデザインのあり方に平気でいることはできなくなってきた。広告やマーケティング、新ブランド開発に主に取り組んでいるデザイナーは、消費者の話し方、考え方、感じ方、反応の仕方や関係の持ち方そのものまでがコマーシャル・メッセージによって変えられていくような、そんな精神的環境を作り出し、積極的に支持していることになる。すなわち私たちは、人々の対話を減らし、蝕んでいくように誘導しているに他ならない。私たちの問題解決の力を活かす、もっと有益な活動が少なからずある。環境、社会、文化における未だかつてない危機的状況に、今こそ、私たちは注意を向けなければならない。文化的対立を調和し、社会的キャンペーン活動、書籍や雑誌の出版、展示会、教材やテレビ番組、映画、チャリティー活動など、情報の加工が求められるさまざまなプロジェクトに、私たちの専門的知識を活かし協力することが必要とされている。私たちは、従来の価値観を見直し、より有益で持続可能かつ民主的なコミュニケーションのあり方を志向し、モノの生産から脱却して、新しい意義づけを模索し創造していくことを目指そうと提案する。人々が互いの考えをぶつけ合う機会がだんだん減ってきている。もっと機会を増やしていかねばならない。消費主義はあまりに肥大しすぎている。これに対抗する新たな視点を、視角表現やデザインを活用し、提示していかなくてはならない。1964年に、22名のビジュアル・コミュニケーターたちが、自分たちの才能をもっと意味あることに使おうという声明を出した。商業主義のグローバル化が爆発的に広がる中、このメッセージの緊急性は高まっている。私たちは、この声明が実現しないままさらに数十年が過ぎ去ることを許さないために、ここに新たに発表するものである。（以下署名）-------------------------------------------------------------------------------ちなみに、この共同声明は改訂版で、1963年に英国のデザイナーのケン・ガーランドが起草し、翌年、22人のデザイナーたちの連名で発表されたものを、「アドバスターズ」が1999年に雑誌に再掲載したことがきっかけとなって、2000年に改訂されたもので、この2000年版にはジョナサン・バーンブロックを筆頭に、「ＣＯＬＯＲＳ」のアート・ディレクターティボール・カルマンなど、いろんな国のデザイナーたちが名前を連ねています。日本の総理大臣みたいに「日本人が自分で書いたものじゃないからダメだ」なんて、そういう了見の狭いことは云わず、「どこの国の誰が書いたものでもいいものはいい」というおおらかで柔軟な、というか、普通の発想で改訂されたもので、憲法だってそれでいいと思います。ということで、この宣言に賛同する方は、このエントリーのコメント欄に署名をどうぞ。もちろん署名したからといって、会社をやめる必要はありませんよ(笑 ) 。
Conyers : Impeachment off Pelosi 's table , but not mine Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday August 29 , 2007
Print This Email This Rep. John Conyers declared House Speaker Nancy Pelosi could not stop him from beginning impeachment proceedings in the House Judiciary Committee against a 'long list of people ' in the Bush administration , although he did not make a firm commitment to begin proceedings .
" Nancy Pelosi has impeachment ' off the table , ' but that 's off her table , it is not off John Conyers ' table , " the Michigan Democrat said during a town hall meeting in his district Tuesday .
" Nancy Pelosi , who I actually supported , cannot prevent me from introducing an impeachment resolution against , well I 've got a long list of people who are eligible . "
Conyers did not announce plans to begin impeachment proceedings , which he has previously said would be politically untenable .
Rather , his speech seemed to indicate that pro-impeachment activists did not yet convince him that Bush and Cheney deserved to be booted from office .
A Conyers spokesman did not immediately respond to RAW STORY 's request for clarification of the congressman 's comments .
" I want you to know that I have no reticence , no reluctance , no hesitation to use the tool of impeachment ... whenever I feel that it is appropriate , " Conyers said .
" I only wish that I could be moved by a lot of people coming to my office . "
One activist who helped organize hundreds of protesters who traveled to Washington to push Conyers to begin impeachment remains unconvinced that the congressman will actually take action .
" I think John Conyers ... is saying , ' I 'm not going to do what my constituency wants , I 'm going to do what the Democratic leadership wants , ' " Tina M. Richards , CEO of Grassroots America , told RAW STORY Wednesday .
Although she acknowledged Conyers " adamantly wants to impeach , " Richards said he is being precluded from doing so by Pelosi and other top House Democrats .
Hundreds of impeachment activists are expected to descend on Pelosi 's office next month to pressure the House Speaker to allow impeachment proceedings .
The 21 - term congressman , who took control of the Judiciary Committee this year , boasted that he was the first to introduce a resolution calling for Richard Nixon 's impeachment .
Conyers mentioned frequent visits by anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan , who recently led hundreds of protesters to urge him to begin impeachment proceedings .
He told the activists he would not begin impeachment hearings because there is not enough support among Democrats , who control the House , for the move .
" I understand the politics of impeachment , " Conyers said .
" But we have something going on now that we 've never had before . "

Soaring birth deformities and child cancer rates in Iraq
By James Cogan
10 May 2005
Iraqi doctors are making renewed efforts to bring to the world ’s attention the growth in birth deformities and cancer rates among the country ’s children .
The medical crisis is being directly blamed on the widespread use of depleted uranium ( DU ) munitions by the US and British forces in southern Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War , and the even greater use of DU during the 2003 invasion .
The rate of birth defects , after increasing ten - fold from 11 per 100,000 births in 1989 to 116 per 100,000 in 2001 , is soaring further .
Dr Nawar Ali , a medical researcher into birth deformities at Baghdad University , told the UN ’s Integrated Regional Information Networks ( IRIN ) last month : “ There have been 650 cases [ birth deformities ] in total since August 2003 reported in government hospitals .
That is a 20 percent increase from the previous regime .
Private hospitals were not included in the study , so the number could be higher . ”
His colleague , Dr Ibrahim al - Jabouri , reported : “ In my experiments we have found some cases where the mother and father were suffering from pollution from weapons used in the south and we believe that it is affecting newborn babies in the country . ”
The director of the Central Teaching Hospital in Baghdad , Wathiq Ibrahim , said : “ We have asked for help from the government to make a more profound study on such cases as it is affecting thousands of families . ”
The rise in birth defects is matched by a continuing increase in the incidence of childhood cancers .
Six years ago , the College of Medicine at Basra University carried out a study into the rate of cancer among children under the age of 15 in southern Iraq from 1976 to 1999 .
It revealed a horrific change between 1990 and 1999 .
In the province of Basra , the incidence of cancer of all types rose by 242 percent , while the rate of leukaemia among children rose 100 percent .
Children living in the area were falling ill with cancer at the rate of 10.1 per 100,000 .
In districts where the use of DU had been the most concentrated , the rate rose to 13.2 per 100,000 .
The results were cited at the time in campaigns to end the UN - imposed and US - enforced sanctions against Iraq , which were held responsible for the death of as many as 500,000 Iraqi children from malnutrition and inadequate medical treatment .
The study noted : “ Most doctors and scientists agree that even mild radiation is dangerous and increases the risk of cancer .
The health risk becomes much greater once the [ DU ] projectile has been fired .
After they have been fired , the broken shells release uranium particles .
The airborne particles enter the body easily .
The uranium then deposits itself in bones , organs and cells .
Children are especially vulnerable because their cells divide rapidly as they grow .
In pregnant women , absorbed uranium can cross the placenta into the bloodstream of the foetus .
“ In addition to its radioactive dangers , uranium is chemically toxic , like lead , and can damage the kidneys and lungs .
Perhaps , the fatal epidemic of swollen abdomens among Iraqi children is caused by kidney failure resulting from uranium poisoning .
Whatever the effect of the DU shells , it is made worse by malnutrition and poor health conditions ....
“ Iraq holds the United States and Britain legally and morally responsible for the grave health and environmental impact of the use of DU ... ”
( A version of the report is available at : http://www.iacenter.org/depleted/du_iraq.htm).
Terrible as these results were , the last six years have witnessed a further rise in the number of children under 15 falling ill with cancer in Iraq .
The rate has now reached 22.4 per 100,000 — more than five times the 1990 rate of 3.98 per 100,000 .
Dr Janan Hassan of the Basra Maternity and Childrens Hospital told IRIN in November 2004 that as many as 56 percent of all cancer patients in Iraq were now children under 5 , compared with just 13 percent 15 years earlier .
“ Also , ” he said , “ it is notable that the number of babies born with defects is rising astonishingly .
In 1990 , there were seven cases of babies born with multiple congenital anomalies .
This has gone up to as high as 224 cases in the past three years . ”
The statistics point to the long - term consequences of depleted uranium contamination .
Munitions containing an estimated 300 tonnes of DU were unleashed by coalition forces in southern Iraq in 1991 .
A decade after the war , DU shell holes are still 1,000 times more radioactive than the normal level of background radiation .
The surrounding areas are still 100 times more radioactive .
Experts surmise that fine uranium dust has been spread by the wind , contaminating swathes of the surrounding region , including Basra , which is some 200 kilometres away from sites where large numbers of DU shells were fired .
A 1997 study into the cancer rate among Iraqi soldiers who fought in the Basra area during the 1991 Gulf War found a statistically significant increase in the rate at which they were stricken with lymphomas , leukaemia , and lung , brain , gastrointestinal , bone and liver cancers , as compared to personnel who had not fought in the south .
One in four of the American personnel who fought in first Iraq war — more than 150,000 people — are also suffering a range of medical disorders collectively described as “ Gulf War Syndrome ” .
While the US military denies there is any relationship , exposure to depleted uranium is one of the factors blamed by veterans and medical researchers .
Somewhere between 1,000 and 3,000 tonnes of DU was expended during the three - week war in 2003 .
Unlike 1991 , however , where most of the fighting took place outside major population centres , the 2003 invasion witnessed the wholesale bombardment of targets inside densely - populated cities with DU shells .
Christian Science Monitor journalist Scott Peterson registered radiation on a simple Geiger counter at levels some 1,900 times the normal background rate in parts of Baghdad in May 2003 .
The city has a population of six million .
Given that it was two to four years after the 1991 war before cancer and birth defect rates began to rise dramatically , the fear among medical specialists is that Iraq will face an epidemic of cancers by the end of the decade , under conditions where the medical system , devastated by years of sanctions and war , is unable to cope with the existing crisis .
Dr Amar , the deputy head of the Al - Sadr Teaching Hospital in Basra , one of the main hospitals treating Iraqi cancer patients , told the Sydney Morning Herald on April 29 : “ We do n’t have drugs to treat tumours .
I have a patient with tumours who is unconscious and I do n’t have drugs or a bed in which to treat him .
I have two women with advanced ovarian cancer but I can give them only minimum doses of only some of the drugs they need .
“ Two or three days ago we had to cancel all surgery because we had no gauze and no anaesthetics .
Our wards are like stables for horses , not humans .
We ca n’t properly isolate patients or manage their diets .
We do n’t have proper laboratory facilities ....
“ If you are sick do n’t come to this hospital for treatment .
It is collapsing around us .
We ’re going down in a heap . ”
Building a simple crystal radio .
A crystal radio is the distilled essence of a radio .
It has very few parts , it needs no batteries or other power source , and it can be built in a short time out of things you can find around the house .
The reason a crystal radio does not need any batteries is the amazing capabilities of the human ear .
The ear is extremely sensitive to very faint sounds .
The crystal radio uses only the energy of the radio waves sent by radio transmitters .
These radio transmitters send out enormous amounts of energy ( tens of thousands of watts ) .
However , because they are usually far away , and we have at most a few hundred feet of wire for an antenna , the amount of energy we receive with the crystal radio is measured in billionths of a watt .
The human ear can detect sounds that are less than a millionth of even that .
We are going to launch right into this chapter by building a working radio using parts that we buy at stores like Radio Shack or through mail order .
We will try to use common household objects when we can , but our emphasis will be to quickly put together a radio that works .
Later we will learn more about radios by looking at even simpler versions that might not work as well as our first radio , but can show the important radio concepts more easily , because they have fewer parts .
Then we will improve our radio , making it louder , making it receive more stations , and making it look real nice .
Lastly , we will build each part of the radio from scratch , using things we find around the house .
This will take a lot longer than our first radio , but it can be done by replacing store - bought parts one at a time , so we always have a working radio .
Our first radio
For our first radio , we will need these parts :
A sturdy plastic bottle .
I have used the plastic bottle that hydrogen peroxide comes in , or the bottles that used to contain contact lens cleaner .
They are about three inches in diameter , and 5 to 7 inches long .
Shampoo bottles also work , but you will want to get the ones with thick walls , rather than the thin flimsy ones .
This will make it easier to wind wire around them .
A sturdy plastic bottle .
About 50 feet of enamel coated magnet wire .
Most common gauges ( wire diameters ) will work , but thicker wire is easier to work with , something like 22 gauge to 18 gauge .
This can be bought at Radio Shack ( part number 278 - 1345 ) , or you can take apart an old transformer or electric motor that is no longer needed .
You can also use vinyl coated wire such as Radio Shack part number 278- 1217 , which in some ways is easier to use than enamel coated wire ( it is easier to remove the insulation ) .
A Germanium diode .
Most stores that sell electronic parts have these .
They are called 1N34A diodes ( Radio Shack part number 276 - 1123 ) .
These are better for our radio than the more common silicon diodes , which can be used but will not produce the volume that Germanium diodes will .
We also carry it in our catalog
A telephone handset .
You listen to this radio just like you listen to the phone .
If you have an old telephone sitting around , or can find one at a garage sale , you are set .
Or you can buy the handset cord ( Radio Shack part number 279 - 316 ) and borrow the handset from your home phone ( using it for the radio will not harm it ) .
A set of alligator jumpers .
Radio Shack part number 278- 1156 , or you can find them anywhere electronics parts are sold .
About 50 to 100 feet of stranded insulated wire for an antenna .
This is actually optional , since you can use a TV antenna or FM radio antenna by connecting our radio to one of the lead - in wires .
But it 's fun to throw your own wire up over a tree or on top of a house , and it makes the radio a little more portable .
Use a sharp object like a nail or an icepick to poke four holes in the side of the bottle .
Two holes will be about a half an inch apart near the top of the bottle , and will be matched at the bottom of the bottle with two more just like them .
These holes will hold the wire in place .
Thread the wire through the two holes at the top of the bottle , and pull about 8 inches of wire through the holes .
If the holes are large and the wire is loose , it is OK to loop the wire through the holes again , making a little loop of wire that holds snuggly .
Now take the long end of the wire and start winding it neatly around the bottle .
When you have wound five windings on the bottle , stop and make a little loop of wire that stands out from the bottle .
Wrapping the wire around a nail or a pencil makes this easy .
Continue winding another five turns , and another little loop .
Keep doing this until the bottle is completely wrapped in wire , and you have reached the second set of holes at the bottom of the bottle .
Cut the wire so that at least 8 inches remains , and thread this remaining wire through the two holes like we did at the top of the bottle .
The bottle should now look like this :
Now we remove the insulation from the tips of the wire , and from the small loops we made every 5 turns ( these loops are called ' taps ' ) .
If you are using enameled wire , you can use sandpaper to remove the insulation .
You can also use a strong paint remover on a small cloth , although this can be messy and smelly .
Do n't remove the insulation from the bulk of the coil , just from the wire ends and the small loops .
If you are using vinyl coated wire , the insulation comes off easily with a sharp knife .
Next we attach the Germanium diode to the wire at the bottom of the bottle .
It is best to solder this connection , although you can also just twist the wires together and tape them , or you can use aligator jumpers ( Radio Shack part number 278 - 1156 ) if you are really in a hurry .
Cut one end off of the handset cord to remove one of the modular telephone connectors .
There will be four wires inside .
If you are lucky , they will be color coded , and we will use the yellow and black wires .
If you are not lucky , the wires will be all one color , or one will be red and the others will be white .
To find the right wires , first strip off the insulation from the last half inch of each wire .
Then take a battery such as a C , D , or AA cell , and touch the wires to the battery terminals ( one wire to plus and another to minus ) until you hear a clicking sound in the handset earphone .
When you hear the click , the two wires touching the battery are the two that go to the earphone , and these are the ones we want .
The ' wires ' in the handset cord are usually fragile copper foil wrapped around some plastic threads .
This foil breaks easily , sometimes invisibly , while the plastic threads hold the parts together making it look like there is still a connection .
I recommend carefully soldering the handset wires to some sturdier wire , then taping the connection so nothing pulls hard on the copper foil .
Attach one handset wire to the free end of the Germanium diode .
Solder it if you can .
Attach the other wire to the wire from the top of the bottle .
Soldering this connection is a good idea , but it is not necessary .
Now clip an alligator jumper to the antenna .
Clip the other end to one of the taps on the coil .
Clip another alligator lead to the wire coming from the top of the bottle .
This is our ' ground ' wire , and should be connected to a cold water pipe or some other metal object or wire that has a good connection to the earth .
At this point , if all went well , you should be able to hear radio stations in the telephone handset .
To select different stations , clip the alligator jumper to different taps on the coil .
In some places , you will hear two or more stations at once .
The longer the antenna is , the louder the signal will be .
Also , the higher you can get the antenna the better .
Now that your radio works , you can make it look better and be sturdier by mounting it on a board or in a wooden box .
Machine screws can be stuck into holes drilled in the wood to act at places to attach the wires instead of soldering them .
A radio finished this way looks like the following photo .
Note the nice little touch of using brass drawer pulls on the machine screws to hold the wire .

Computerized simulations have revolutionized games like backgammon .
Can they do the same for America 's favorite and most statistically backward sport ?
It 's early in the third quarter of a tie game and your favorite NFL team has the ball , facing fourth and goal from the two - yard line .
Should it kick the field goal or go for the touchdown ?
In the past , this question would have been almost metaphysical in nature .
Depending on their various philosophies , some coaches would elect to kick the field goal and others would try to ram the ball into the end zone .
Actually , scratch that .
Almost to a man , they would try the field goal , as it's the safer bet to put points on the board .
Courtesy Frank Frigo Frank Frigo ( right ) and Chuck Bower , the creators of ZEUS .
But , almost to a man , they are wrong .
Or so says a computer - modeling program called ZEUS , which replaces philosophy with statistics .
ZEUS 's founders claim that the advice coming from their little robot can help most NFL teams win at least one more game every year .
ZEUS , first designed in 2001 , works not by analyzing historical data but by creating its own .
Its architects , backgammon experts Frank Frigo and Chuck Bower , based ZEUS on the neural network programs that have come to dominate their board game of choice .
But instead of creating a bot that modeled dice rolls and checker movements , Frigo and Bower set out to develop one that mimics all of the action of an NFL game , from runs to passes to kicks to penalties , and keeps detailed stats of the simulated games it plays .
The driving force behind ZEUS is an idea called match equity .
In a game between equally - matched opponents , the thinking goes , each play changes the likelihood that a given team will win .
Take the example above .
The team on offense ( let 's call it the Bears ) already has a game winning chance ( GWC ) above 50 % by the time it reaches the two - yard line , because it is in position to score , and even if it does n't , the team on defense ( let 's call it the Jets ) will probably have crappy field position .
At the fork in the road that is the coach 's choice between kicking and going for a touchdown , ZEUS can play out hundreds of thousands of games based on that decision .
As it turns out , teams that kick the field goal win almost 4 % fewer games than those who go for the touchdown .
( Bower and Frigo have several other examples of how play calling affects GWC at their barebones website , Pigskinrevolution.com . )
Frigo and Bower have pitched rights to their idea to several different NFL teams , but so far , none are biting .
Part of the reason could be the cost of an exclusive license , which Frigo tells Gelf is in the low six figures .
Another factor could be that , as in backgammon , the modeling program can only be used as a tutor NFL rules stipulate than any such coaching aid has to be turned off during games .
But the major reason , Frigo says , is the backward culture of the NFL .
" It 's not real sophisticated , " he says .
Gelf talked to Frigo , a former world backgammon champ , about how he was able to get ZEUS to create real NFL stats , how it can be used to settle bar debates , and why conservative coaches are like smokers .
The following interview has been edited for clarity .
Courtesy Wikipedia GNU backgammon is one of the neural - net - based software programs that have revolutionized the game .
: What do football and backgammon have in common ?
Frank Frigo : A lot .
Which is why we started the project in the first place .
Backgammon went through a real technological revolution in the very late 1970s .
TD - Gammon was the first program that was ever able to beat a world champion at any board game of skill [ Editor 's note : The technical description of the program is here ] .
The part that most people did n’t realize is that they played a very short match and the robot got somewhat lucky .
It did n’t really play better than a human at this point .
But nonetheless , it was quite a programming achievement .
So that was an early version of a neural net that they had developed for gaming , well before Deep Thought or Deep Blue had been developed for chess .
A later version came out that was called " Snowie , " which is still today considered to be the best backgammon playing program in the world .
It plays every bit as well as a top human expert .
GM : So how have computers changed the game ?
FF : It 's changed the game in the sense that the learning curve is a lot different .
I had been playing for about 15 years pretty seriously by 1994 when I won the championship .
Nowadays , somebody who gets a really good bot like Snowie 4 and locks themselves in a room for two years and studies like crazy can become a very , very good player .
It 's also revolutionized the game in the sense that it 's overturned some strategies .
Back in the 1970s , you would argue forever about what was the right or wrong play and never really resolve it .
Now , if there 's a play that 's in question that somebody made , we stick it in the bot , we do an extended rollout a simulation of 20,000 games or whatever and whatever that answer is , it 's pretty much the end of discussion .
The model came up with really unconventional ideas that were overturning some of the human evolution of the game .
Basically , the human evolution of the game is , there 's some guy who has some decent tournament success , he writes a book professing some ideas , people anchor on those notions and just run with them without ever testing them .
GM : That sounds pretty similar to football .
FF : Time goes by and no one really challenges it because it 's almost like the dogma of the game .
People do n’t want to challenge the experts .
Along come these neural nets that suggest that in certain situations where humans were making these really romantic plays and taking risks where they did n’t need to something simple was far superior .
We realized that these human subtleties of the game , the psychology of the game , were highly overrated .
The proof in the pudding was that the models could perform every bit as good or better than a human , and we could test it .
We could have them play , and sure enough they could compete .
Some of the things from the human evolution of the game got confirmed ; others were overturned .
We witnessed this in backgammon , and it occurred to me early on that there were other games that we could apply these types of strategies to .
The one thing that really jumped out at me about football was the situational nature of the game .
There was a stop - action element to it .
You set up for a play .
There were these multi-variables : how much time is on the clock , what 's the score differential , what 's the ball position , how many timeouts , etc .
All of these things affect the decisions and these directional choices were really similar to backgammon situations where you 're at a fork in the road .
It ’s a fourth down and you 're deciding between a very deliberate path of punting or kicking a field goal or going for it ; or you 're deciding between a one - and a two - point conversion after a touchdown ; or accepting a penalty or not .
These types of thing are pretty transparent decisions .
You line up and are choosing a particular path .
That 's very similar to backgammon and the multivariable nature is very similar to backgammon .
Courtesy Wikipedia ZEUS often disapproves of Bears Coach Lovie Smith 's decisions .
: Why football and not , say , baseball ?
FF : Baseball is a very good fit and we thought very hard about it , but the difference is that in baseball , the sabermetricians had already penetrated the game .
We met with Paul DePodesta , who was then the GM of the Dodgershe 's looked at ZEUS .
They 've done some pretty sophisticated things in baseball much earlier .
But the NFL is a very curious culture , I 've got to tell you .
From meeting with a lot of these guys , it 's not real sophisticated .
You 'll hear stories that these teams are really into technology .
Do n't believe what you hear .
They 're not .
GM : How well does the data that ZEUS creates match up with historical data ?
FF : We built this model that could mimic NFL teams .
The only guy who had ever done real historical work was Peter Palmer in The Hidden Game of Football .
We went back and got his data where he had looked at very common situations and discovered how often a typical team wins in given situations , given point differentials , given field positions for some very common types of situations .
We then laid ZEUS results against the Palmer results and the correlation was staggeringly on .
That was really the final stamp of approval that we had created a core model that was behaving pretty darn close to a real game .
Now we have this core model , so we can feed it any unique situation and say , " Okay , against two equal teams , play this to conclusion , with the first play being a punt and the first play being a short run . "
Which fork in the road wins more often ?
People say , " That 's all well and good , but can you really replicate how real humans behave ?
Can you capture all the subtleties of the game ? "
One of the other things that we learned from programming achievements of backgammon is that this whole notion of skill differentials and emotion and momentum do n’t make a whole hell of a lot of difference when you were comparing play A versus play B .
We suspected this might be the case in football .
I can have the model play it out 500,000 times for the first play being a punt and the first play being a run .
GM : What if one team is much better than the other one ?
FF : We have a customization input .
We have the ability to program in the unique aspects of offense and defense and special teams for each team .
The model can now behave like any two teams in the NFL .
By mid-season , when the statistics start to become significant , I can put in the fact that this is a very good rushing team , this is a very poor rushing defense that they are playing .
I can put in the custom traits where hard statistics exist to further customize the two teams .
GM : Does customization change the outcome significantly ?
FF : It can change it , but a lot of times , it does n’t necessarily overturn the fact that play A was better than play B . Between two clones , it might be that play A was 3 % better than play B .
When I now put in the custom features of both teams , it might be that play A is still better than play B , but now it 's only 2.4 % better .
All the coach really cares about is choosing the right play .
GM : What about up until the middle of the season when we do n’t yet have statistically significant numbers ?
FF :
The big question that everybody asks is , " How do you know that your customizations are really accurate ? "
Sometimes , there are hard statistics and sometimes it 's early in the season and maybe we 're not 100 % sure how good those customization inputs are .
The model will now go back , after it does its initial valuation , and it tries to overturn its own recommendation .
It will go back after it says the run was better than the punt .
Let 's make the rushing team the worst rushing team in the NFL .
Let 's make the punting team the best punting team in the NFL .
Let 's make the punt return the worst punt return in the NFL .
Let 's make the rushing defense the best rushing defense in the NFL .
It now sets up parameters that would be the worst - case scenarioby far the most likely scenario to overturn the model 's recommendation .
It 's far worse than anything you could contrive in reality .
Now the model re-runs the simulation under those conditions .
It then compares the change that was made .
Surely that will make a change in the results in terms of magnitude of the error .
The fascinating thing is , often it does not flip the decision .
We then built an algorithm that , after the sensitivity analysis is done , you compare the core simulation result with the worst - case simulation result and the probability that the decision gets overturned and the magnitude by which it gets overturned results in a confidence factor .
If the confidence factor is 10 , that means that the worst - case custom simulation did n’t overturn the original decision , it only changed the magnitude .
In other words , the coach made a blunder .
Now , if overturns it by a little bit , the confidence factor gets watered down .
The way ZEUS works , it gives a recommendation .
Some of the decisions that [ New York Giants ' Coach Tom ]
Coughlin made in our ESPN analysis were confidence - level - 10 blunders .
Some of them were lower .
What we tell coaches is , if the confidence level is zero to three , ZEUS is saying something that you need to pay attention to , but if there are extraneous factors some gut feel you 've got about the way your guys are performing it 's not unreasonable to overturn the ZEUS recommendation .
If you get into the midrange of four to six or seven , it gets a lot less likely that ZEUS is wrong ; when you get up into seven , eight , nine , almost nothing should overturn it , and when you get to 10 , forget about it .
It 's irrefutable .
GM : What do coaches that you talk to think about two backgammon players coming and telling them how to coach ?
FF : Well , they put more stock into the artistry of the game , what they view to be momentum and the emotional aspect of the game .
In fact , we had one meeting with the St. Louis Rams a couple years back .
We had basically the whole coaching staff in front of us with the exception of [ head coach Mike ] Martz .
One of the guys , who was an ex- football player , said to me , " Here 's the part you do n't understand . "
He was talking down to me a little bit .
He said , " When I put my guys out on the field , when I put them out on a fourth and short , there 's a momentum and emotional aspect to this that your model can't take into account . "
He goes , " I 've got to look those guys in the eye when they come to the sidelines .
And if I put their butts on the line to go for it on a fourth and short based on your model and we fail , they 're going to be dejected . "
What I did n't say to him at the time was that I think he was underestimating his players ' ability to handle emotions .
The argument I did make to him was , " OK , I do n’t disagree with you that there 's such a thing as negative emotionally - induced momentum .
But if you 're going to make that argument , then you would agree that if they succeed on the fourth and short , that they should get a boost .
Is that fair ? "
He agreed .
I said , " Would you also agree that you were more likely to succeed on that fourth and short than fail ? "
" Yeah . "
So the net momentum emotional effect was a positive in going for it .
And he kind of shut up .
It 's a typical example of these coaches .
They only see the negative side of the equation .
Courtesy Wikipedia Bengals Coach Marvin
Lewis knows coaching is n't just about winning .
: Almost everything that ZEUS tells us is that these coaches are too risk - averse .
Is it because they are concerned with something other than just winning ?
FF : Absolutely .
We met with Marvin Lewis a couple years ago in Cincinnati and he looked me in the eye and said to me , " I do n’t disagree with what ZEUS is saying .
You guys might very well be right that we 're calling something too conservative in that situation .
But what you do n’t understand is that if I make a call that 's viewed to be controversial by the fans and by the owner , and I fail , I lose my job . "
He was brutally honest about it .
That 's what 's going on .
You 've got this culture where nobody wants to stick their head out .
You 're a head coach , you 're making $ 1.5 million a year , and if you operate within the status quo or improve a little bit , you 're going to lock up your five year contract .
You can't really blame these guys for having this individual risk profile .
The real shame is that it 's misaligned with what should be the owner 's profile .
There 's no question there 's a risk aversion .
GM : Has ZEUS ever found a coach to be too aggressive ?
FF : There have n't been a lot of examples .
There have been cases where guys have gone for it on a fourth down and should n’t have or we did n’t agree with their onside - kick attempt .
There was one this season , where the Jets opened the second half of the Bears with an onside kick and the Bears recovered and went on to make the first score of the game .
The press just ripped the Jets for it .
[ Editor 's note : See this piece by USA Today columnist Ian O'Connor . ]
ZEUS actually said that it was not a terrible decision it said that it was a little bit of an error the funny part about it was that the Bears recover , drive down the field , and settle for a field goal when they should have gone for the TD according to Zeus , which was a huge , multi-percent error [ Editor 's note : You can see the Bears ' drive chart at ESPN ] .
But the onside kick that the Jets did was like a fraction of a percent .
Meanwhile , the press is just focused on the fact that the Jets did the most ridiculous thing ever and they do n’t realize that in the same sequence of play , the Bears did something far worse .
The Bears won the game , though , so everyone forgets about it .
GM : You 've called out Joe Buck and Troy Aikman for not saying anything about a similar error in the Bears - Patriots game .
FF : They do n’t even notice it , which is really common .
If you win , all is forgiven .
Everybody has a short memory .
You lose , they 'll go dig through everything you did and second - guess it .
GM : Are the announcers and the media generally as misinformed as the coaches ?
FF : They 're worse .
John Madden is painful most of the time .
He says some things that are complete psychobabble .
I think the media is misinformed .
I think some coaches get it , but they 're just afraid to implement it .
Some guys refuse to believe it or do n’t want to .
GM : You guys have gotten a lot of media coverage recently ( from Wired News to Esquire ) .
Has it been accurate ?
Are you happy with it ?
FF : They all kind of want to dumb it down a bit .
One thing they always say is that we can't get too technical .
That 's really a challenge for us .
You can't really explain what our model is unless you get into the methodology behind it .
Some people get this idea that we look at a bunch of NFL historical statistics and then we give an opinion on if it was right or wrong .
I keep trying to tell people that ZEUS is not our opinion , it ’s a vehicle .
GM : What do you think has sparked all of this media interest ?
FF : I think part of it was the Super Bowl analysis we did last year .
People really love this whole idea of looking at all the critical plays in a table .
I think the fan base is really fascinated with it .
These are the types of things that people debate over a beer and they talk about over the water cooler on Monday morning .
For somebody to come out and be able to settle a wager and say , " Look , this was a boneheaded play or this was n't a boneheaded play , " that 's really interesting .
I think a lot of people have suspected that there are some strategies that are n't being fully implemented , like onside kicks , and for somebody to come out and actually put some science to it and say , " Lo and behold it is underutilized . "
It seems that it 's really gotten some people pumped up out there .
GM : In the Esquire article you say that coaches should almost always go for it on fourth and short .
FF : It 's this whole risk - aversion bias where they do n’t want to put it on the line now .
If they 're going to give up that touchdown , then they 'd rather give it up over several minutes than give it up in 10 seconds .
GM : It seems to me that that 's why many people have such trouble coming to terms with these ideas that stats suggest .
A lot of it is about delayed gratification …
FF : I think it 's totally the case .
I can't remember which behavioral psychologists gave this example , but I found it fascinating .
They were talking about how people view risk and they were saying that people will smoke cigarettes their whole lives and wo n't comprehend the gradual risk because it does n’t affect them on a day - to - day basis .
But if one in so many cigarettes has an explosive in it that will blow your head off , people will stop smoking a lot quicker .
They are viewing this catastrophic result in the short term which they have a total aversion to .
If it ’s a gradual process , they 're willing to weather it .
I think it 's a similar thing to football .
All that most coaches can think about is , " This could be a disaster right here and now .
If I punt the ball , it 's going to play out for a bit .
It 's going to dilute the effect . "
GM : Can you rank your coaches by their decisions ?
FF : One of the things we 're planning to post at the end of the season is we 're planning to look at all 16 regular season games for each team .
And we 'll come up with a coaching index with their aggregate error rates .
Courtesy Wikipedia Cowboys Coach Bill Parcells makes some of the best decisions of any NFL coach , according to ZEUS .
: But you 'd still have plenty of data to rank the coaches , right ?
Can you give us a tease of who a couple of the top coaches would be and who a couple of the bottom ones would be ?
FF : My suspicion is that you will see Belichick and Parcells perform a bit better .
And you 'll probably see guys like Nolan in San Francisco , Coughlin , and it almost sounds shameful to say it because they 're having such a good season but Lovie Smith has done some really wacko stuff .
Even the Chicago press said , " What the heck was he thinking when he did that ? "
There 's still quite a bit of parity .
If I had to speculate on what the distribution curve is going to look like , the best performers will have given up about a half - game in expectation and the worst performers will probably have given up a game - and - a- quarter to a game - and - a - half .
GM : What else can ZEUS tell us about football besides which coaches are boneheads ?
FF : We have a really interesting application for doing player evaluations , which is still going to get launched .
The really cool thing about this is that we have always had this goal of converting everything in this game to a common currency of GWC : the cost of a blunder , the cost of a turnover , the cost of a suboptimal coaching decision , and the cost of having somebody who 's better or worse at a given position in your lineup .
When they 're analyzing game film , coaches break every play down in terms of who was participating , who was an integral part of that play and who was a bystander .
Every play , a team 's GWC goes up and down .
Every increment you can see how much GWC was gained or lost .
We 're building an algorithm so that when they 're analyzing the game film , they 'll be able to assign the level of participation either positive or negative that impacted the given play on a given player .
If someone was on the sideline or not involved in the play , then he is assigned a zero .
If somebody missed a block or made a terrific pass , he could have a positive or negative relative weight on a given play .
You could have a positive or negative GWC on every given increment .
In aggregate for game or season , every player will get a positive or negative rating based upon their overall GWC impact .
It can apply to a lot of the secondary positions that do n’t have hard statistics .
When you 're breaking down game film , you can see how much impact this guy actually had .
Over the course of the season , it might really add up .
Maybe in a lot of plays with high GWC impact , this guy was playing a role in that play or he was goofing up , and it was costing us .
The idea would be to , at the end of the season , be able to line up each roster and have a positive or negative rating on a given player and be able to line up every center in the league and say , who are the guys who are really contributors and who are n't .
And it 's being done in the same objective unit that you evaluate blunders , that you evaluate coaching decisions .
[ Editor 's note : Sabermetricians have done similar work with win probability added in baseball ( Wikipedia ) . ]
You can really compare how everybody is performing and how much is at stake in their performance .
You can start to make decisions within the salary cap about how you want to distribute salary and get the best return on your investments .
GM : If every team followed ZEUS principles , kickers would be kicking a lot less , right ?
FF : Punters would be punting less .
Kickers would be kicking fewer field goals .
Courtesy Wikipedia
If the NFL followed ZEUS guidelines , there would be far fewer field goal attempts .
: Any idea how much kicking incidence would decline overall ?
FF : I could take a stab at it .
Just looking at the games that we 've analyzed , it 's not unusual for there to be at least , per team , two to three situations where they punt where ZEUS says that they should n't have .
I could see there being a magnitude of 20 to 30 fewer punts per team in a season that 's probably reasonable .
I think field goals would decrease as well .
The very biggest magnitude errors are deep in opposing territory , short yardage , like settling for the " guaranteed " points of a field goal versus going for it .
The thing that most teams do n’t appreciate which ZEUS captures is that when you fail [ on a field goal ] the resulting field position for the opposing team is pretty significant .
GM : A lot of it seems to go against what seems practical the idea that sometimes going for two at the end of the game when you 're down by one instead of trying to send it into overtime seemed crazy to me .
FF : It depends what you think your chances are on a two - point conversion and what you think your chances are in overtime .
When we met with Belichick , we gave the example of the last play of the game about going into OT or going for a two - point conversion to win the game to give him the basic decision tree .
For whatever reason , he latched onto it .
He said that he did n’t know how often he made a two - point conversion .
He said something like , " It 's subject to the conditions on the field , what I think about my team .
Sometimes I think I might make every time and sometimes I think I might not make it at all . "
It was a very strange thing to say .
I 'm not trying to disparage Belichick , I think a lot of him .
I said to him , " Surely you 've got some expectation in mind .
I 'm not telling you what your expectation has to be but you 've got to have some criteria for your decision . "
We 're not giving our opinion .
We 're providing science ; we ’re being pretty transparent about our methodology and our criteria .
It 's just like we 've witnessed in backgammon .
When you go into something very objective and you just input the basic rules , you start to see some really counterintuitive things .
Thomas Sowell wrote this opinion column a few days ago at National Review , Barack Obama , Control Freak , Fresh face , same old fallacies .
The following are some snips from the article .
Enough to give one an idea of his Sowell ’s POV and his less then factual grasp of reality ,
Senator Barack Obama recently said , “ let ’s allow our unions and their organizers to lift up this country ’s middle class again . ”
Ironically , he said it at a time when Detroit automakers have been laying off unionized workers by the tens of thousands , while Toyota has been hiring tens of thousands of non-union American automobile workers .
It is not that people do n’t want automobiles .
Toyota is selling plenty of cars made in its American factories with non-union labor .
Detroit is laying off workers because GM and Ford have been shown a remarkable ability not to adjust to market demands not because union workers are paid too much – though one could make the argument the continuing tie between workers / employers and health care is a factor – versus some kind of public health care .
Mr Sowell , being an expert and all does know that unionized companies can and have negotiated for lower wages and benefits .
Toyota is hiring workers because they make a higher quality product then Detroit and they do n’t hire union workers because they have a policy against it .
According to this NPR report from 2005 the reason that Detroit is losing market share and money is not because of union wages versus Toyota ’s non-union wages , well because they are about the same , Toyota Powers Ahead at Kentucky Plant
The United Auto Workers have tried to crack the Toyota plant since before it opened .
Last spring , they opened their own organizing office just down the road .
But Brown says that Toyota ’s wages are so close to the union ’s , she does n’t see the advantage .
That workers like Brown are n’t interested in unions is no accident .
Manufacturers like Toyota locate their plants in regions hungry for jobs with good salaries .
It ’s the result of a strategy foreign car companies have used for years to avoid unionization .
Gary Chaison , who teaches industrial relations at Clark University in Masachussetts , says Toyota and its peers also try to treat workers well , take their opinions into account and give them a stake in the plant ’s success .
Despite the wages , some Toyota workers say they need a union .
They complain the company drives them so hard that people get injured , and when they ca n’t work anymore , Toyota pays them off to leave Leonard Habermehl is a skilled repairman and makes up to $ 85,000 per year .
When he came to Toyota in 1990 , he did n’t see why he needed a union .
But after years of service in which he says he has seen people injured and forced out of their jobs , he now believes the plant should unionize .
It should also be pointed that union wages are a driving force behind Toyota ’s wages .
If union wages go up the wages at non-union plants at Toyota and Honda do also .
If unions are the reason that American car companies are tanking then why are Japanese car and electronics companies which do have unions in Japan doing well .
The disparity between American companies and Japanese companies cannot be simply because of the mere presence of unions .
Mr. Sowell is pushing the same tired hypocrisy that Republicans have been pushing for years that they honestly believe that salaries should be tied to productivity .
Conservatives like Sowell only believe that when the productivity has a blue collar .
When it comes to executives it is a whole other story – Why Are American Executives Paid So Much ?
CEOs and CFOs in the U.S. make 400 times what the average worker earns .
In 1965 , it was more like a factor of 20 .
A commenter at MyDD left this snip from a report called Executive Excess 2006 ,
“ In 2005 , average total compensation for CEOs of 350 leading U.S. corporations was $ 11.6 million . ”
A CEO making $ 10 million / year makes as much money in a month as someone working at the minimum wage makes in her lifetime .
There is no reasonable justification for one person to make as much money in a month as another earns in a lifetime .
No matter how smart , beautiful , refined , charismatic , brave , clever , educated , experienced , or hard working , no human being deserves to receive a thousand times as much money as another .
While I would n’t have worded My objections to executive pay structure quite that way the point is well made .
Executives and I have meet a few are not supermen .
They are not blessed with any special gifts in the way of management skills , marketing , sales , quality control or any other kind of business skills or acumen that warrants that kind of pay disparity .
I hate wage and price controls .
What people like me want to rely on is a sense of ethics and moral responsibility by executives and their boards .
To see their place not just as morally detached business people who only see the economy in quarterly profit reports , but as caretakers for hundreds and sometimes thousands of people and their jobs and families .
These business pros and the corporate board members that are supposed to set reasonable standards for compensation – such as linking pay to performance ( and ethics too for that matter ) .
Sowell and other conservatives say they worship the gods of pay for merit , but like so many of the other fine sound bites that slip so easily from conservative forked tongues , on close examination they always seem to fall short of the mark , unless being huge hypocrites was what they were aiming for .
This is the PDF link to that executive pay report .
From a Republican blog called STR : THE FREEDOM BLOG , Athiest troublemakers not O.K. in OK , August 26th , 2006 | Category : Liberal Democ - Rats , Christian America , STR Action Alerts , Atheism
Can somebody tell me why Athiests have to be so disruptive ?
Why do they have to break all the rules cause so much harm ?
I know a minority of STR.com readers believe that we should “ live and let live ” with athiests , but the simple fact is that an Athiest is nothing more than an intellectual terrorist .
Some terrorists attack America using bombs and guns .
Athiests attack America with their evil words and ideas .
For the the parents of kids at Hardesty School , Texas County ( Not far from my own dear Tuttle City ) , a local athiest family is becoming a serious threat .
Please read on for an example of just how much damage an athiest can cause .
I am sure after reading this article you will agree that something has to be done about the Athiest problem :
It all started when Nicole Smalkowski refused to say the Lords Prayer before a basketball match .
The United States of America is so fragile an institution that objecting to being coerced into prayer before a game of b- ball will surely mean the end of the Republic .
There is nothing worse then those basketball prayer hating atheists is there ?
Minister Arrested Charged With Cocaine Possession
Sandy - area pastor charged with 23 counts of fraud
Marin City pastor arrested in drug case in Novato
Church pastor charged with child rape
Prosecutors charged the pastor of a church here with four counts of first - degree child rape and two counts of child molestation .
Clay County Pastor Charged With Sexually Assaulting Girl
Those are just a few of the news stories about Christians that have run in the past 14 hours of doing this post .
Which reminds me of this from John 8:7 , “ So when they continued asking him , he lifted up himself , and said unto them , He that is without sin among you , let him first cast a stone at her . ” ( KJV )
The young woman that writes that blog might want to take off the blinders .
The atheists did nothing to her or her family – they did n’t steal , commit adultery , murder or commit any other serious moral violation unlike some of her fellow holier - then - thou brethren .
The atheists just think that public school events should be , as in accordance with the Constitution a neutral grounds not a place or time to turn into an improvised tent meeting .
If actual crime , harm , wrong doing consisted solely of those committed by atheists you could walk down any alleyway or street in America 24/ 7 relatively confident that you will not be sexually assaulted or defrauded .
On the other hand if you feel that not being able to coerce people into praying is one of the biggest crimes one can commit and one of the biggest challenges facing the nation maybe its time for some careful reflection and reordering of priorities .
Overheard in Australia , Bush tells minister ' we 're kicking ass ' in Iraq

Things are going well in Iraq , according to President George W. Bush .
Upon his arrival in Sydney Wednesday , Deputy Australian Prime Minister Mark Vaile " inquired politely " about his stopover in the war - torn country .
" We 're kicking ass , " Bush said .
The remark was overheard by a reporter for the Sydney Morning Herald and caught by an Australian blog .
According to the paper , Bush arrived in Australia in a " chipper mood . "
" Despite his unpopularity in " Australia , the paper said , " Bush used yesterday 's media conference with [ Prime Minister John ]
Howard to try to bolster the Prime Minister 's electoral prospects in the next poll .
Labor was quite happy at the spectre of one unpopular leader backing another but should not underestimate the defiance and polished performance Bush is able to muster .
On Iraq , climate change , Kyoto and nuclear power , he backed Howard to the hilt .
He claimed diplomatically he did not want to interfere in the Australian election and said he looked forward to today 's meeting with Kevin Rudd , " leader of the Australian Labor Party .
" Apart from his introductory remarks , Howard never spoke during the press conference , " the paper added .
" It was the George W. Bush show . "
The Herald asserted that Howard 's staunch position backing the Iraq war " is growing . "
" He implied that those who argued against the war in the first place had no role in the current debate , " the article said .
A couple of years ago I met Jason Epstein in passing and he excitedly described his new project : a machine to print On Demand Books .
The plan is finally bearing fruit : the Espresso Book Machine was demonstrated at the New York Public Library on Wednesday .
Three of the machines are out in the wild , and I suspect many more will appear if the prototypes live up to the hype .
The idea of books on demand is a little eerie but eminently efficient .
Publishers and booksellers waste millions of dollars , tons of fuel and forests of paper shipping , returning and trashing unsold books every year .
And if a machine like this is n't too expensive to run , it could revolutionize education in less accessible or wealthy parts of the world .
The real question is whether such a machine might do to bookstores what Netflix has done to video rental stores .
The Espresso machine can only print paperbacks , so for now I think Barnes and Noble is safe .
And even if the shelves are replaced with digital browsing displays one day , many customers will still want to enjoy their purchases with an overpriced latte and pastry .
The social spaces of book - reading have yet to be destroyed by Amazon.com or the blogosphere , so I think they 'll survive a new kind of espresso machine .

Two new molecules kill sperm 25 times more effectively than the most commonly used spermicide , without irritating vaginal cells .
Nonoxynol - 9 ( N9 ) is the active ingredient in most spermicidal creams and is sometimes used to lubricate condoms .
It is a detergent that kills almost all living cells by destroying their fatty membranes – in the same way that household detergent breaks up grease .
While this kills sperm , it also wipes out some of the normal vaginal bacteria that help prevent bladder and yeast infections .
N9 can also irritate cells in the cervix and vaginal wall in some women , leaving them more susceptible …
Washington - THE most widely quoted federal statistic on deprivation and need in modern America is the " poverty rate " -- a measure tracking households with annual incomes below a " poverty threshold " established at the beginning of the Johnson administration 's " war on poverty " in the 1960's and adjusted over time for inflation .
According to the latest poverty rate estimates -- released by the Census Bureau on Aug. 30 -- the total percentage of Americans living in poverty was higher in 2004 ( 12.7 percent ) than in 1974 ( 11.2 percent ) .
According to that same report , poverty rates for American families and children were likewise higher last year than three decades earlier .
On its face , this momentous story should have shocked the nation .
After all , it suggested ( among other alarming things ) that Washington 's long and expensive campaign to eliminate domestic poverty has been a colossal failure .
So why did that poverty rate report end up mostly buried deep inside daily papers ?
Maybe because many news editors , like policymakers in Washington , know the dirty little secret about the poverty rate : it just is n't any good .
Truth be told , the official poverty rate not only fails to calculate trends in impoverishment with any precision , it even gets the direction wrong .
The profound flaws in our officially calculated poverty rate are revealed by its very intimation that the poverty situation in America was " better " in 1974 than it is today .
Those of us of a certain age remember the year 1974 -- in all its recession - plagued , " stagflation " - burdened glory .
But even the most basic facts bearing on poverty alleviation confute the proposition that material circumstances in America are harsher for the vulnerable today than three decades ago .
Per capita income adjusted for inflation is over 60 percent higher today than in 1974 .
The unemployment rate is lower , and the percentage of adults with paying jobs is distinctly higher .
Thirty years ago , the proportion of adults without a high school diploma was more than twice as high as today ( 39 percent versus 16 percent ) .
And antipoverty spending is vastly higher today than in 1974 , even after inflation adjustments .

In essence , many Hispanics and Republicans said , the outcome of the legislation may be less damaging to the party than the notion that Hispanics are not welcome among them .
“ I think it ’s bloody for the Republicans , ” said Antonio Gonzalez , president of the William C. Velasquez Institute , a Latino - oriented research and policy organization with offices in San Antonio and Los Angeles .
“ The Democrats said pro-immigrant stuff , and even if they did n’t support it , it was because they said it was n’t good enough .
The Republicans said anti-immigrant stuff and so now they are going to get killed with this . ”
It is a view that many Republicans share .
Mr. McCain , who in May told Republicans that “ the Hispanic vote is turning against us in very large numbers , ” expressed similar thoughts privately this week , aides said .
In an interview on Friday , Mr. Martinez , who is chairman of the national Republican Party , called the bill ’s defeat “ a bipartisan failure . ”
To win favor with Hispanics in the future , “ We ’ve got our work cut out for us , ” he said .
“ I consider it serious . ”
Abel Maldonado , a prominent Hispanic Republican in the California State Senate , said he felt that both parties were damaged , but that “ It hurts the Republican party a little bit more in terms of bringing more minorities into the party . ”
Hispanics made up 8.6 percent of the nation ’s eligible voters in 2006 , according to the Pew Hispanic Center in Washington , up from 7.4 percent in 2000 .
In some states , like New Mexico , Texas and California , Hispanics make up well over 20 percent of eligible voters , though that number is a significantly smaller share of the overall Hispanic population than other ethnic groups , the center found .
In 2004 , according to the research group , Hispanics made up 6 percent of all votes cast .
Anyone who survived the world 's first atom bomb blast must have felt the worst was past .
But Kazuko Sadamaru was caught up in the second explosion too .
That she did so and is still alive today is perhaps the most uniquely improbable story of all .
The road north of Hiroshima , winding through rice paddies and cedar green mountains , leads to the quintessentially Japanese home of Mrs Sadamaru .
This unassuming woman , sitting cross-legged and wearing slippers on a tatami mat by the veranda , is among a handful of people alive who witnessed both the Hiroshima bomb and the obliteration of Nagasaki three days later .
' I never wanted to speak out about my experience , ' she said , breaking a 60 - year silence in an interview with The Observer .
' I have n't published anything or talked to anyone because I did n't want anyone to know .
I only became a nurse because I wanted to devote myself to patients and the country .
I never dreamt Japan would lose the war .
I worked and worked believing Japan would win .
' I cannot forget the events on 6 and 9 August 1945 .
I saw the flashes and the mushroom clouds of both A - bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
So many were exposed to the A - bomb but I am one of the few people who have experienced the two bombs , and still I am in good health .
It was fate that I was there , but I had good luck in that I survived both bombs . '
Sitting near her golden Buddhist shrine and pouring iced green tea , Mrs Sadamaru , now 80 , explained that she left her hospital in Nagasaki on 5 August 1945 to accompany a soldier to a town near Hiroshima , some 260 miles away .
The following day , she was on a train approaching the city when ' Little Boy ' exploded at 8.15 am .
' The flash came in an instant , ' she recalled .
' I remember thinking what happened ?
Why ?
What is it ?
Then we saw a mushroom cloud from the window .
No one had heard of the A - bomb .
Nobody imagined such a weapon existed .
We all screamed .
' The next day I took a train back to my work and the carriage before mine was full of injured army soldiers .
Their clothes were badly burnt and tattered , or they were barely wearing clothes at all .
Their skins were bloody and peeling and they had blisters .
There was a noise of moans and groans - the scene never goes away .
They saw me in a Red Cross nurse 's uniform and said , " Please help the injured . "
But I could do nothing .
I had no medical supplies . '
Twenty - year - old Kazuko Yamaguchi , as she then was , reached her work at the Ohmura Naval Hospital in Nagasaki to find herself presumed dead .
' I thought I would get in trouble for being late , but my friends thought I had been killed because it had been reported that the whole of Hiroshima was destroyed .
They said , " Oh , you 're alive , " and started to cry .
I cried with relief and was pleased to hear that my colleagues cared for me . '
What happened next would kill another 74,000 people - but Mrs Sadamaru was spared again .
' I saw a flash on the glass .
Then a bang came and I saw a black cloud rising into the sky .
The flash was just like the one I saw in Hiroshima .
When I heard the sound I knew it must be the bomb .
' The first survivors came on a truck .
All their clothes were tattered , they were bleeding all over and their skin was burst , swollen or peeled off .
Their clothes stuck to the burns , so we used scissors [ to cut them off ] .
They were writhing in agony , especially those who were burnt all over , and some even fell from their beds .
I heard helpless voices , crying for water .
It was difficult to identify the bodies ' ages and gender because even the name tags were burnt .
' We had to keep working all day without rest and I automatically did whatever I had to do .
There was no time to think how sorry I was to see so many miserable patients .
I tried to comfort them by saying , " Hold on , hold on .
I know how hurt you are . "
For those who had lost their children , I said , " They 'll be OK , you 'll find them , " although I knew I was lying . '
Despite being close to both bombs , she suffered only a temporary abnormal white blood cell count and loss of hair .
In 1946 she married Sadato Sadamaru , now 86 , and has a son , a daughter and four grandchildren .
The modest Mrs Sadamaru refuses to be photographed , but did permit pictures of her Red Cross cap ' because I 'm proud I was a nurse ' .
Today the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco is hearing arguments on two of the most important cases in decades dealing with the rule of law and personal privacy .
The cases are Hepting v. AT&T and Al - Haramain Islamic Foundation v. Bush .
At stake is whether the government can immunize itself from public oversight and prosecution for illegal activities by claiming that whatever actions it took were done in the name of national security .
These cases will also influence whether the government is entitled to warehouse citizen phone calls and e-mails for subsequent unsupervised searching and data mining .
( Disclosures : During the trial court proceedings , law professor Susan Freiwald and our Stanford Center for Internet and Society filed a law professors ' amicus brief on behalf of the plaintiffs in Hepting .
Wired News has also filed motions to intervene in the case and asked the court to make public evidence filed under seal of AT&T 's alleged wiretapping activities .
In September of this year , I will join Hepting plaintiffs ' counsel the Electronic Frontier Foundation as Civil Liberties Director . )
The plaintiffs in the Al - Haramain case include a charity that claims the government illegally wiretapped calls between itself and its lawyers .
During the litigation , the government turned over a document that proved , the plaintiffs say , that the charity was indeed surveilled without a warrant .
The government claimed the document was classified top secret and asked the plaintiffs to return it .
However , the lawyers still remember what the document said .
Now the government wants to prevent the lawyers from using their own memories to prove that the charity was indeed monitored and therefore has the right to sue .
The trial court in Oregon ruled in favor of the plaintiff ( .pdf ) , leading the government to appeal .
On appeal , Al - Haramain 's attorney Jon B. Eisenberg was required to write his appellate brief at government offices and was not permitted to retain a copy of his own document , nor will he be allowed to see the government 's reply to his arguments .
Hepting is a class action against AT&T claiming that the telecommunications provider diverted the entire stream of customer communications to the government .
The case makes no claims about , nor depends on what the government did with that information .
The Department of Justice has argued that merely confirming or denying that AT&T 's surveillance takes place could aid terrorists by letting them know what forms of communication are monitored .
U.S. District Court Judge Vaughn Walker rejected this argument ( .pdf ) , pointing to voluntary statements by the government and AT&T that he says are adequate to let the case go forward .
The Hepting and Al - Haramain rulings are consolidated in today 's hearing .
The appeal takes place in a strange legal climate .
The government recently convinced the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals to dismiss an ACLU lawsuit ( .pdf ) on the grounds that the plaintiffs could not prove that they were spied upon .
At the same time the government has attacked lawsuits and investigations by state government officials on the grounds that the states do not have the right to prove that the public communications carriers were monitoring on behalf of the government , because that information is a state secret .
Meanwhile , the Bush administration continues to disclose additional information about its surveillance activities when it thinks doing so helps its cause .
In late July of this year , the White House voluntarily revealed that not only was the National Security Agency intercepting phone calls and e-mails into and out of the United States , under the so - called Terrorist Surveillance Program , or TSP , but that the agency also was data mining troves of American 's phone and e-mail records .
This revelation came as the White House was trying to defend embattled Attorney General Alberto Gonzales against accusations of misleading Congress .
Gonzales had claimed that a 2004 dispute between the Justice Department and the White House over a top secret surveillance program was n't about the TSP at all .
The new information allows defenders of Gonzales to maintain that his sworn testimony was true , if legalistic .
But it also should give the 9th Circuit pause about over - crediting administration assertions of secrecy .
Last week Congress altered the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act in broad ways that purport to allow the government to collect the international communications of all Americans .
Once this information is collected , the administration receives a great deal of discretion over which of those communications it actually listens to .
Hopefully , but unlikely , Congress will allow the law to sunset in six months because it essentially removes future judicial oversight of surveillance activities conducted in the name of foreign intelligence .
This is the same result the government is seeking before the 9th Circuit today , but effectuated by statute rather than by judicial opinion .
Supporters of the Bush administration 's position on warrantless surveillance are often heard arguing that we must use any means necessary to fight terrorism .
But " any means necessary " is not the guiding principle of a civilized , democratic nation , especially when the tools we are implementing are often more distracting than effective – never mind " necessary . "
When the 9th Circuit rules in these two cases , we will find out if we are a nation at risk of losing its soul , or one that will be governed by the rule of law , and will seek to protect people from arbitrary and harmful government monitoring .

Dr Alhajouj and his colleagues were freed on Tuesday One of the medics jailed in Libya on charges of infecting children with HIV has said he was tortured in custody .
Palestinian - born Dr Ashraf Alhajouj , held for eight years along with five Bulgarian nurses , said he was given electric shocks to his genitals .
The doctor , a Bulgarian citizen , told Dutch TV how police dogs were set on him , but he was later forced to pretend that he had been treated well .
The six medics were freed on Tuesday and have been pardoned in Bulgaria .
Dr Alhajouj and the five nurses - who initially faced the death penalty before their sentences were commuted to life imprisonment - all denied the charges against them .

In an interview conducted in Arabic on Dutch TV's Eenvandaag programme , Dr Alhajouj said the Libyan authorities had drugged him and attached electrodes to his feet and genitals .
" They asked me how many days it had been since I had eaten , I said four days - I thought they were being compassionate , " he was quoted as saying by the Associated Press .
The Libyans then said " roasted chicken " , before tying his arms and legs to a metal bar and spinning him around like a chicken on a rotisserie , the doctor said .
He said some of the cells they were held in were so hot he could peel the skin from his forehead .
The six medics were arrested in Benghazi in February 1999 and eventually convicted in a Libyan court of knowingly infecting 438 children with HIV , the virus that causes Aids .
The EU's External Affairs Commissioner , Benita Ferrero - Waldner , made many trips to Libya in an attempt to secure their release .
France stepped up the diplomatic effort this month by sending Cecilia Sarkozy , the wife of President Nicolas Sarkozy .
The medics were released from Libyan custody on Tuesday and flown to Bulgaria , where they were pardoned by Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov .
Dr Alhajouj was made a Bulgarian citizen while he was in detention .

Corn ethanol and soybean biodiesel are not future energy solutions .
You can squeeze energy from corn , but not enough to displace gasoline .
© Getty
Producing biofuels such as ethanol from food crops is n't worth the effort .
That 's the conclusion of a new and painstaking study published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences1 .
Researchers should instead concentrate either on producing ethanol from indigestible plant material such as cellulose , or on synthetic hydrocarbon fuels .
The comprehensive study finds that if all the corn ( maize ) produced in the United States last year were removed from food supplies and turned into ethanol , just 12 % of US gasoline demand would be offset .
Turning soybeans into diesel would account for only 6 % of US diesel demand .
Environmentally friendly ?
Contrary to some recent studies , this review finds that corn ethanol and soybean biodiesel do supply more energy than is needed to produce them ; soybean biodiesel wins out over ethanol , providing 93 % more energy than the amount used in growing , reaping and converting the soy crop to fuel , as compared with 25 % for ethanol .
Both also reduce levels of greenhouse gas emissions over fossil fuels ; biodiesel much more so .
But neither biofuel could replace much petroleum without a serious impact on food supplies , the researchers note .
" Corn ethanol is a first - generation biofuel , " says study co-author David Tilman , of the University of Minnesota in St Paul .
" It 's as likely to realistically meet US energy demand as a Wright brothers ' plane would be to fly across the Atlantic . "
Alex Farrell , an energy expert at the University of California , Berkeley , agrees .
" Corn ethanol comes at the price of soil erosion and nutrient runoff , " he adds .
" Producing ethanol from cellulose is a much more environmentally preferable option . "
Cellulose , an inedible plant fibre , could be obtained from switchgrass , a prairie grass that could be grown on abandoned agricultural land .
This would avoid destroying natural habitats and would require small pesticide input .
Cellulosic ethanol plants are on trial in Spain and Canada , says Tilman , who also recommends investigating synthetically manufactured fuels .
ADVERTISEMENT
A US Department of Energy report released on Friday 7 July said that biofuels such as cellulosic ethanol could displace 30 % of the fuel consumed in US transportation by 2030 , which Tilman thinks is a long - term viable goal ; although it would take significant technological advances .
Visit our biofuelsgiven_thumbs.html " > newsblog to read and post comments about this story .
Corrected : Due to an error in the draft version of the PNAS paper , this article originally incorrectly stated that soybean biodiesel would account for 9 % , rather than 6 % , of US diesel demand .
Scientists in Australia are giving us another reason to drink — beer , that is , and only Foster ’s .
The brewery announced plans this week to join a team of scientists working to convert beer waste into electricity .
The experimental technology was unveiled Wednesday by scientists at Australia ’s University of Queensland , which was given a $ 115,000 state government grant to install a microbial fuel cell at a Foster ’s Group brewery near Brisbane , the capital of Queensland state .
The trash - to - treasure morph is thanks to bacteria that consume brewery waste — sugar , starch , and alcohol — and produce electricity and clean water in the process .
“ The complex technology harnesses the chemical energy that the bacteria releases from the organic material , converting it into electrical energy , ” reports the AP .
The program is slated to begin by September , and is soon to be installed in all Foster ’s breweries and wineries .
Will this solve the energy crisis ?
Probably not .
The amount of energy produced by one brewery is only enough to power one household .
But what if we drank more beer ?
Even though it ’s next to impossible to overdose on cannabis , that does n’t mean it ’s not something that people seek drug rehab facilities to assist with .
It can cause psychosis , not to mention a raft of problems within someone ’s life .
But whether you ’re a seasoned smoker or not , there may be a time when you consume too much weed .
But how do you know if you ’ve had too much ?
Find out below .
Can You Overdose on Cannabis ?
One of the most commonly asked questions relating to cannabis use is whether or not you can overdose on it .
Nearly anything you can consume can be toxic if you have too much of it , and cannabis is no exception .
For example , you can consume a lethal dose of sugar , but an everyday amount of sugar would not be toxic .
The median lethal dose ( LD ) for sugar consumption is based on body weight .
A 90kg man would need to consume 2.7 kilograms of sugar at once for it to be a toxic substance .
Author David Schmader , in his book Weed : The User ’s Guide , pointed out that you would need to consume 750 kilograms of cannabis in a quarter - hour period for it to be toxic .

How did I wind up here ?
-- Middle aged , that is , and out of work ?
Do n't get me wrong : in one sense , I have more work than I can possibly do ( especially while recuperating from knee surgery ) .
Running a household is w - o - r -k , and no end to it .
Important work at that .
But once upon a time I had a career .
It had its ups and downs , but for the most part it was a solid , respectable career , and it came with a healthy 401K , and I could look forward to years of steady employment and watching that 401K grow with my matching employer donations .
And then this thing happened : I had a baby .
I took a year off to watch her grow , because my employer was very lenient and understanding about that , and after a year I planned to come back .
But my employer also let me know that when I did come back , I 'd be doing something less interesting -- a job that looked suspiciously like the work I had been doing at the very beginning of my career , twenty years earlier .
I did n't much like that prospect , and I was getting to enjoy this mom thing .
So after much anguish , I decided to ask for another year 's leave -- immediately granted , that should have told me the gig was up right there -- and see how well I could do by freelance writing .
Which , after a slow beginning , was pretty well .
One year I made $ 30,000 as a freelancer , a number I cite not because it's so staggering ( it was just over a third of my former salary , and no benefits ) , but because I was able to make that much money without even thinking about it .
The kinds of articles the women 's magazines wanted back then were a piece of cake for someone like me : I was accustomed to working on deadline and turning out accurate prose on topics much more complicated than " how to buy a cellphone . "
I was making money and hardly realizing I was working .
My husband and I were living within our means , which meant we did not live in a fashionable part of town , but we liked where we lived and we liked our small house , and things were fine .
Then came kid number two -- a surprise , but a delightful one , and then I took some time off to be a mom to her full - time , and then , somehow , getting back in the saddle was n't so easy .
By this time , my employer and I had pretty much parted company , in a listless " see ya later " kind of way .
I had tried to find ways to fit in around my old shop on a part - time basis , but I 'd met a brick wall .
That hurt , but I decided it was okay ; pumped up on my recent $ 30,000 - in - one - year experience and kept afloat by my husband 's medical insurance , I figured I could do just fine , and I was liking my freedom .
But something was happening to the little niche of the magazine world where I had found a home : the appetite for anything that looked remotely like fact - based journalism was evaporating .
What was taking its place was celebrity interviews and , increasingly , " psychological " articles citing " experts " that purported to give the final word on spanking ( or not ) , developing empathy , the Power of Intuition ... puff pieces that made me feel fraudulent writing them because I knew how little actual information they contained .
The end came one day at Barnes and Noble , when I sat down for a cup of coffee and read an entire article in a women 's magazine before realizing I had written it .
For several months , I floundered , and then an idea I had rejected as uninteresting suddenly began to look interesting after all , and whaddya know , I turned it into a book proposal and sold it .
The day I got the word from my agent about the deal I came out of my office screaming and pumping my fists .
" What is it , mom ? " asked my oldest , who was then about six .
" MOM'S BACK IN THE GAME , BABY ! " I yelled , and we all danced around , even though the kids did n't really know what the fuss was about .
Oh , God , what a sweet moment : I was a mom , AND I had a career , on my own terms .
Life rocked .
Which brings us to the present : the book is out , it 's selling in respectable numbers , the checks from the publisher have come in ( all but one , and it wo n't be large , and it will be months and months from now before I see it ) .. and , since my book ( like most books ) has not hit the best - seller list , I know that this is pretty much all the money I will ever see from it .
Even with a nice advance , which I got , the money goes .
It gets spent on doctor 's office co-pays and kids ' clothes and summer camp and plumbing disasters and income taxes .
My huge $ 150,000 advance for this book ( in the writing world , that 's considered very nice -- million dollar advances are the ones you hear about but most writers never see that kind of money ) now consists of about $ 4,000 tucked away in a savings account .
I am one major car repair bill away from that most hateful position to be in : totally dependent on my husband 's money .
( And I do n't care how egalitarian your marriage is , both partners KNOW who is bringing in the bucks .
Nobody has to say a thing . )
So : here I am , a 51 - year - old journalist with tons of experience and awards and honors from Back in the Day ( that 1987 Pulitzer finalist thing sounds quaint now , it was so long ago ) who , if I were to show up at my old job now , might score a nice lunch with an editor but they know and I know I ain't getting hired back there .
I am Not Needed ; they are paying people my age to go away these days , because newspapers are never profitable enough for Wall Street , and Wall Street calls the shots these days .
( I remember the old days when newspapers were not supposed to be " profit centers , " when they used their unique positions as the only business in our society afforded constitutional protection to advance agendas bigger than making money .
But that was a long time ago . )
There 's always the possibility of another book -- if I can think of something marketable , which is a big if ; there 's magazine work , if I can bring myself to write the kind of article they want these days , which is so forgettable even I forget I 've done it .
I could get a part - time retail job to bring in some cash , and give up on using the skills I worked so long and hard to acquire .
I could quit complaining and settle into Middle - Aged Momhood , as so many women before me have done .
My only problem is that I have this burning desire to be Useful .
I have things I want to say , skills I want to pass on .
How to do this ?
It 's one thing when you 're 21 and have no responsibilities and nothing but time on your hands , and even though the path before you is steep there 's something exciting about tackling it .
It 's another when you 're 51 and there are college tuitions looming in your future -- and , what 's worse , the last 10 years of your working life have been largely spent doing work that our society does not value .
At 21 , you 're a hot young find ; at 51 , you 're just a mom .
You exited the fast track and now there are no " on " ramps .
And I look around me and see dozens of women my age , in a similar position to me , scrambling for piecework -- women with advanced degrees , women with priceless experience , women with superior intellects .
And I think : how wasteful can this society afford to be ?

Drinking your coffee black or decaffeinated to keep cholesterol in check ?
Think again .
Cafestol , a compound found in coffee , elevates cholesterol by hijacking a receptor in an intestinal pathway critical to its regulation , said researchers from Baylor College of Medicine in a report that appears in the July issue of the journal Molecular Endocrinology .
In fact , cafestol is the most potent dietary cholesterol - elevating agent known , said Dr. David Moore , professor of molecular and cellular biology at BCM , and Dr. Marie - Louise Ricketts , a postdoctoral student and first author of the report .
Cafetiere , or French press coffee , boiled Scandinavian brew and espresso contain the highest levels of the compound , which is removed by paper filters used in most other brewing processes .
Removing caffeine does not remove cafestol , however .
Studies by a co-author – Dr. Martijn B. Katan of Vriye Univeriteit Amsterdam , Institute for Health Sciences , The Netherlands – indicate that consuming five cups of French press coffee per day ( 30 milligrams of cafestol ) for four weeks raises cholesterol in the blood 6 to 8 percent .
However , while the cholesterol increase associated with cafestol had been identified previously , mainly through the work of Katan and his colleagues , the mechanism by which it acted remained a mystery .
It was a mystery that Moore and Ricketts decided to address in the laboratory .
For a long time , Ricketts said she was stymied because of paradoxical effects of cafestol in the liver .
However , the discovery of a gene called fibroblast growth factor 15 or FGF 15 opened the door to understanding how cafestol affects farsenoid receptor X or FXR in the intestine .
FXR was first identified as a bile acid receptor in studies in several laboratories , including Moore’s .
“ It is part of the body ’s own way of regulating levels of cholesterol , ” said Ricketts .
Through research in the test tube and in mice , she and Moore found that in the intestine , cafestol activates FXR and induces FGF15 , which reduces the effects of three liver genes that regulate cholesterol levels .
While it is still unclear whether cafestol itself reaches the liver , the finding does confirm that the effect of the compound is in the intestine , which is directly involved in the transport of bile acids .
Moore ’s interest in cafestol began several years ago when his wife read an article on coffee ’s effect on cholesterol .
She suggested that he might change his brewing method , which involved a permanent coffee filter .
The paper filters , the article suggested , removed the coffee oils , which contain cafestol .
Moore researched the problem , and found papers by co-author Katan .
He was already working on FXR , and began to think about whether cafestol might be affecting that signal in the cholesterol pathway .

The failure affected Russian computers on the ISS Russian computers controlling the International Space Station 's ( ISS ) orientation have failed , Nasa officials say .
The station 's three crew and seven visiting shuttle astronauts are not at any immediate risk ; the ISS has not lost all vital systems .
But it could force Nasa to extend the current shuttle mission by one day .
Engineers are unsure why the computers stopped working as a failure of this type has not occurred before .
The US space shuttle Atlantis docked with the orbiting outpost at the weekend to begin its latest mission .
The computer malfunctions have affected a number of systems including the Elektron oxygen generation system .
Nasa 's space station chief said he expected the problem to be fixed within the next few days .
" We have plenty of resources , so we have plenty of time to sort this out , " said Mike Suffredini , ISS programme manager for the US space agency .
Without the Russian oxygen machine running , the space station has a 56 - day supply of oxygen left .
" If we are in that position , we have an option to depart , " Mr Suffredini said .
Different scenarios
The station 's Russian segment has a network of six computers , but on Wednesday , only two were functioning .
The computers have experienced problems before , but a system - wide re-boot usually solved the problem .
This time , the system has been unable to re-boot .
Under a worst - case scenario , where the computer problem persists beyond the shuttle 's stay , and attempts to resolve it come to no avail , the station 's three crew members could be forced to return to Earth early , the website Space.com reported .
The ISS is currently relying on its four gyroscopes to maintain its orientation in space , then shifting to using thrusters aboard the shuttle Atlantis when the gyroscopes are overwhelmed .
This dependency on the shuttle has caused Nasa managers to consider an extension of one day to Atlantis ' 13 - day mission .
If this goes ahead , the crew will have to conserve supplies - the shuttle mission has already been extended by two days in order to carry out repairs on a torn thermal blanket .
The crew of space shuttle Atlantis was originally due to spend 11 days at the ISS .
Heat shield
The mission was extended to 13 days in order to carry out repairs on a 10 cm ( 4in ) section of thermal blanket which peeled back as the shuttle blasted off from Cape Canaveral on Friday .
The blanket protects the shuttle from the intense heat of re-entering the atmosphere .
The repairs could be made during a planned third spacewalk or a fourth , extra one , Nasa managers have said .
Engineers think the blanket was loosened by aerodynamic forces during lift - off , and was not hit by debris .
Damage to the shuttle Columbia in 2003 during its launch led to the vehicle 's disintegration as it returned to Earth , killing all seven crew .
This was supposed to be the second shuttle mission of 2007 , but a freak storm over the Florida launch site in late February caused hail damage to the shuttle and delayed the mid-March flight .
Despite the delays , managers are confident they will be able to complete the ISS before the shuttles ' 2010 retirement date .
Nasa plans to fly 15 more missions to the station to deliver large components , spare parts and other supplies .
In addition , one final servicing call to the Hubble Space Telescope is planned for September 2008 .

At the recent SyScan Conference in Singapore , Immunity Inc.'s CEO Justine Aitel gave a presentation with surprising statistics on so - called zero - day ( 0 - day ) exploits .
That 's the name given to security flaws in software that are discovered by " hackers " but not reported to anyone who can or will patch them .
Immunity has found that the average 0 - day exploit survives for 348 days before it is discovered and patched , less than a month short of an entire year .
One 0 - day exploit went unaddressed for over three years , while the quickest discovery and patching was completed in 99 days .
Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of Aitel 's presentation was her observation that 0 - day exploits are increasingly focused at the financial sector , including stock trading and analysis systems .
Such systems are rife with 0 - day exploits , Aitel says .
The hackers who find the exploits are eager to sell them to the highest bidder , and Immunity buys and studies such exploits but does not publicly reveal them .
The company 's experience watching the life cycle of 0 - day exploits leads
Altel to believe that too many companies are relying on public information channels to learn of new exploits when they should be hiring hackers to find them first .
The time between exploit and patch is dangerously long .
0 - day exploits are both extremely dangerous and extremely difficult to find , which means that most companies have n't been aggressive about searching their own systems for possible 0 - day exploits .
Instead , IT shops rely on notifications from developers and vendors about flaws , but Immunity 's data suggests that you might be waking up to reality almost a year too late , and in the meantime , you may have suffered serious security compromises .
At the same time , protecting yourself from exploits is n't just a matter of checking all your locks .
Senior executives have to be brought in and informed of what 's going on , as IT departments need to be cautious about reverse engineering that could land them in trouble with the DMCA or the common licensing prohibitions against hacking .
Businesses should be working with software vendors to make sure that their agreements allow for unfettered security testing , Aitel says .
Interestingly , Aitel has another set of recommendations that CEOs and CIOs may not be expecting : coddle and nurture your own hackers as employees .
Aitel says that making hackers feel safe and comfortable is the best way to get production out of them , so open up your network to IRC ( " they need IRC like a fish needs water " ) , forget about a dress code , and try to extol the benefits of working normal daylight hours .
Having hackers in house will save money in the long run , because the costs that stem from an outside intrusion are both extremely high and unable to protect you from the next incursion .
As such , preventative hacking is the way to go .
According to Aitel , the search for 0 - day exploits is popular not only among " hackers " but also university computer science departments who are in it for both the fame and the intellectual stimulation .
The growing market in 0 - day exploits does n't hurt either , as more and more hackers are looking for compensation for their time and efforts .
A new auction site for exploits claims that compensating hackers fairly for their efforts is the only way to keep such exploits out of the hands of criminals .

Google Calls For Raising H - 1B Visa Cap
Executives with the search engine testify that the current annual cap of 65,000 H - 1B visas is not enough to fulfill Google 's specialized skills requirements .
Google executives on Wednesday called on the U.S. government to raise the number of foreign worker visas -- or H - 1B status -- by illustrating the plight of one of its founders .
In congressional testimony , Google VP of people operations Laszlo Bock cited the emigration of the parents of company co-founder Sergey Brin from the Soviet Union to the United States in 1979 as evidence that admitting foreign workers into the country benefits the U.S. economy .
" We opened our doors to Sergey 's parents -- a mathematician and an economist , " said Bock .
" Our educational system served Sergey well -- he attended the University of Maryland and Stanford University .
Our free market economy supported Sergey and Larry 's entrepreneurship and rewarded it when they proved that they could turn their idea into a successful business .
And we continue to maintain an environment where entrepreneurs , regardless of where they started , want to come here to build their companies . "
Bock said that Google is not the only Silicon Valley company to benefit from immigration .
" Intel , eBay , Yahoo , Sun Microsystems , and many other companies were all founded by immigrants who were welcomed by America , " said Bock .
" In fact , over the last 15 years , foreign nationals have started 25 % of U.S. venture - backed public companies , accounting for more than $ 500 billion in market capitalization and adding significant value to our economy . "
According to Bock , some 8 % of Google 's U.S. employees are in this country on a six - year H - 1B visa because the company 's " need to find the specialized skills required to run our business successfully requires us to look at candidates from around the globe -- many of whom are already in the U.S. studying at one of our great universities . "
The current annual cap of 65,000 H - 1B visas is n't enough , according to Bock , who urged Congress to increase the cap .
In a blog post detailing Bock 's testimony , Pablo Chavez , policy counsel for Google noted , " This year , an estimated 133,000 visa applications were filed by H - 1B candidates in the first two days of the filing period for only 65,000 available spots .
Over the last year alone , the artificially low cap on H - 1B visas has prevented more than 70 Google candidates from receiving H - 1B visas . "
Bock 's opening remarks to the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration , Citizenship , Refugees , Border Security , and International Law can be seen on YouTube .

Zheng Xiaoyu headed the food and drug agency for seven years
The former head of China 's State Food and Drug Administration , Zheng Xiaoyu , has been executed for corruption , the state - run Xinhua news agency reports .
He was convicted of taking 6.5 m yuan ( $ 850,000 ; £ 425,400 ) in bribes and of dereliction of duty at a trial in May .
The bribes were linked to sub- standard medicines , blamed for several deaths .
China has been criticised over a number of recent cases involving tainted goods , and correspondents say Zheng had become a symbol of the crisis .
Zheng had appealed against his sentence , arguing that it was " too severe " and saying he had confessed his crimes and co-operated with police .
But his appeal , heard in mid-June , was rejected shortly afterwards .
Toxic chemicals Zheng , who headed the administration from 1998 to 2005 , was found guilty of accepting bribes from firms to register their products without making them undergo the necessary checks .
Following his sacking , the Chinese government announced an urgent review of about 170,000 medical licences that were awarded during his tenure at the agency .
CHINESE FOOD SCARES May 2007 China probes reports that contaminated toothpaste was sent to the Americas March 2007 Melamine is found in wheat gluten exports from China for use in pet food , prompting a recall of at least 100 pet food brands Nov 2006
A dye farmers fed to ducks to make their eggs look fresher is found to contain cancer - causing properties , and 5,000 ducks are culled August 2006 About 40 people in Beijing contract meningitis after eating partially cooked snails at a chain of restaurants
Tackling tainted food crisis
Zheng 's sentence was seen as unusually harsh for such a senior figure , but the BBC's Dan Griffiths in Beijing says the government hopes the execution shows it is getting to grips with the crisis .
However , food and drug safety standards vary widely across the country and reform will be a major challenge , our correspondent adds .
At a news conference in Beijing on Tuesday , the food and drug agency admitted it had a huge job ahead to improve its supervision of safety standards .
" As a developing country , China 's food and drug supervision work began late and its foundations are weak , " spokeswoman Yan Jiangying said .
" Therefore , the food and drug safety situation is not something we can be optimistic about . "
She said Zheng Xiaoyu 's case had " brought shame " on the department , adding that anyone who abused their power would be punished .
Chinese officials have already acknowledged that the country could face social unrest and a tarnished image abroad unless improvements are made .
Dozens of people have died in China because of poor quality or fake food and drugs , sparking widespread international fears about the safety of Chinese exports .
Thirteen babies died of malnutrition in 2005 after being fed powdered milk that had no nutritional value .
US inspectors have blamed exported Chinese pet food ingredients , contaminated with melamine , for the deaths of cats and dogs in North America .
And they recently halted shipments of toothpaste from China to investigate reports that they may be contaminated with toxic chemicals .

What are these ?
Introduction I started making this pizza after I had left over dough from my quick ciabatta recipe , ( which you can make by following the same instructions but doubling the ingredients ) .
Anyway , I like this better than the traditional olive oil enriched overnight proofed pizza doughs .
It takes only about 2 hours start to finish to make , so you can make it after work .
A kitchen aid style stand mixer is required , unless you 're comfortable working with high hydration doughs and hand mixing .
People have assured me it 's possible , but it 's much easier with a mixer .
You could also use a food processor to mix the dough , but the time will be much shorter .
Probably less than a minute .
The resulting pizza is light , delicious , and full of huge holes in the crust .
If you grow tomatoes and basil in your garden , this pizza is just the ticket .
Ingredients Crust 250 g Bread Flour ( All Purpose will also work in a pinch )
1 cup water
1 tsp yeast
7 g salt Toppings 2 Tomatoes
Handful of fresh basil
Olive Oil
Mozzarella Cheese Step 1 , make the dough
Mix the flour , yeast , salt & water in your stand mixer with the paddle on high speed , it wo n't look like it is doing anything for a while .
Then after about 10 minutes or so it will start to come together Initial Ingredients
Initial mixing , notice the dough is sticking to the sides Dough is done as soon as it stop sticking to the sides and is just coming off the bottom .
It has the consistency of rubber but is very sticky .
Step 2 , proof until triples .
I like to proof this dough in a narrow plastic container that has markings on it , it 's important that the dough triples so it 's easier to observe that then just throwing it in a bowl .
Spray the container you use with spray oil , you 'll thank me later .
Be quick moving the dough from the mixer to the proofing container .
You 'll probobly still end up with a little dough stuck to your hands , because it 's very wet .
Here 's my dough , now it will be very easy to see when it triples .
Step 3 , heat oven and shape pizza .
Place your pizza stone into the oven and preheat to 500 degrees .
Now on a heavily floured counter , pour out your dough into a nice blob .
Now turn a baking sheet upside down and cover it with parchment paper .
Not wax paper !
Parchment paper is silicone treated and wo n't melt or light on fire in your hot oven .
It will make getting this thing in the oven much easier .
I like to get the dough into a rough pizza shape while on the counter by grabbing it from underneath and stretching .
Since the dough is floured on the bottom , you wo n't stick too much .
You do n't want it paper thin , but fairly thin in the center
The next step is tricky , we need to get our pizza to the parchment paper on the baking sheet .
Spray the parchment with oil so you can slide it around .
So pick up this thing and quickly move it to the parchment , if you need to do some reshaping once it's on the parchment move fast .
It will eventually stick to the parchment , but spraying the parchment with oil will help .
Phew !
That was a close one , but I got in on the parchment .
And it resembles a pizza dough !
Now it 's time to top the pizza , I really just want some light olive oil , garlic powder , fresh tomatoes , basil and cheese .
If you want sauce , you 're on your own .
You can really do whatever you want from this point .
One thing I 've noticed with my oven though is that if I put the cheese on from the start , it 'll burn and I 'll have a raw pizza with burnt cheese .
So I usually add cheese 2/3 of the way through baking .
Step 4 , Baking
Time to bake !
I always trim the parchment so it fits the pizza since loose parchment will brown a bit and might even catch on fire in the oven .
So you can see in the photo above I 've trimmed it up .
Once your oven has hit 500 degrees , slide your cheese - less pizza on to the pizza stone using the baking sheet .
If you do n't have a stone , just leave it on the sheet .
After 5 minutes my pizza looked like this , nice oven spring !
Once the crust has just started to brown ( after about 8 minutes for me ) .
I add the cheese .
Now I just let the cheese get to the point that I like and the crust to be nice and brown and I 'm done .
The all together baking time for this pie was 14 minutes .
Finished !
Looks good to me , though maybe i put on too much olive oil since it kind of pooled in the center .
Also I probably could have put the cheese on a minute or two earlier since it 's not brown all over .
I like to brush a little melted butter & Parmesan cheese on the crust , as well .
But that 's up to you .
Yum , yum yum .
Crust is looking perfectly golden .
Once again , nice airy crust , not dense and sticky , but light and delightful .
That 's the pay off from our 100 % hydration ultra lean sticky dough .
In the Irish Sea off Wales this week , a new kind of robot is taking to the waves .
For once , this is not a military kill - droid , nor a securo - pork powered surveillance machine .
Instead , we are seeing the debut of the fully - autonomous sailboat , which uses its own software to navigate out at sea .
For now the uninhabited windjammers will stay relatively close to home , but next year their successors will race across the Atlantic .
" Roboat " of Austria : victor in '06 and frontrunner in '07 .
The salty tech challenge event is called Microtransat , and it was conceived by boffins Yves Briere of the Ensica engineering institute in Toulouse and Mark Neal of Aberystwyth Uni .
There was an inaugural 2006 meet in France , and this year teams from Wales , Toulouse , Canada and Austria are competing .
A Portuguese vessel could n't get ready in time .
The 2007 rules are still relatively relaxed , allowing entrants to use vessels remotely controlled by a computer over a comms link or even just a remote - controlled boat ; though these options lose a lot of points .
The idea is to produce a vessel no longer than 4 m ( ordinary sailing dinghy size * ) .
The boat should be able to sail itself around waypoints without human input using no primary power other than sun and wind , though batteries may be carried .
Ultimately , the goal is to produce oceanographic survey platforms that could operate at sea for up to six months , probably sailing themselves out to areas of interest .
They would send data back using satellite communications , and return periodically for repairs if possible ; but their cost would be low enough that losses would n't be catastrophic .
Existing , disposable oceanography buoys can cost $ 10,000 and last only a year or so before going out of service , apparently .
Races were carried out yesterday around triangular virtual courses off Aberystwyth , but most competitors were bedevilled by rough weather and technical snags .
Dr Neal told the Reg that the Austrian entry " performed flawlessly , " but the other windjammer - bots all succumbed to problems and had to be retrieved by chase boats .
The French " iBoat " contenders were particularly handicapped by arriving very late , after which it was found that their boat 's GPS would only work correctly when east of the Greenwich zero meridian .
It should be noted , though , that even superfighter jets costing hundreds of millions are occasionally subject to this sort of snag .
Here 's some Flash video of the iBoat in trials :
Tomorrow is the day of the " impress the judges " event , but details thus far are scanty .
Neal says that " just surviving " in tough offshore conditions in the Irish Sea will represent a good effort , but adds that the Austrian front - runners may have a few surprises in store .
" They 're playing it close to their chests so far , " he said .
A high failure rate in relatively short duration race like this might not bode well for next year 's transatlantic voyage , but Neal at least is undaunted .
" We 'll definitely enter something from Aberystwyth , " he says .
Apparently the Welsh ocean - going sail - bot in 2008 will be based on a Topper dinghy , equipped with GPS , wind sensors and actuators for rudder and sails .
There will be an Iridium satcomms modem allowing a two - way datalink , but its power requirements mean it will only be activated every few days .
Neal is confident overall regarding electrical power , saying that he plans to use flexible solar panels bonded to the decks for peak output of 60 W and an average of 6W .
The total power requirements should be only 3 - 4W , so there should be adequate juice : though it seems there are sometimes problems with seagull droppings covering the cells .
The main snags are mechanical failures in moving parts , and the risk of the tiny craft being mown down by inattentive big ships out at sea .
Regarding the latter problem , says Neal , " there is n't much you can do that is n't incredibly power hungry , " though the boats will carry radar reflectors .
How confident is Neal that the Aberystwyth robo - boat will actually make it to the Caribbean next year ?
" Not terribly , " he says frankly .
" Fifty - fifty ? " ®
* Or in approved Reg units , as long as a pair of young adult moose standing arse to antler .
Stories and Stats from The Least Populated Most Remote Rural Counties in the US
Updated April 2014
Loving County Texas
Second least populated county in America
Loving County Texas
Population : 95
County Seat : Mentone
For decades the least populated county in America was Loving County , Texas .
The reign ended when population swelled from 78 to 95 in 2013 according to the latest census bureau estimates , pushing the county to second place in our list of least populated counties in America .
Even today there is no grocery store to serve the growing population , or bank , or hospital .
Not even a cemetery .
You wo n't find any lawyers , Libertarians or foreign born immigrants in Loving County , Texas .
Residents say that 's just the way they like it .
In 2004 , The Texas Lawyer labeled Loving County the Land Without Lawyers .
" Well , goodness , " Loving County Sheriff Billy Hopper explained , " if you 've got to have rattlesnakes or lawyers , which one would you have ? "
Sheriff Hopper patrols the 673 square miles of Loving County in a pickup truck with two shotguns and an AK - 47 .
The nearest sizable city is Pecos , 20 miles to the south , with about 9,500 people .
and even they go to Odessa for big shopping trips .
But Loving County residents like things just the way they are .
" When I was little , I could n't wait to leave , " said Beverly Hanson , Loving County Clerk .
Then , she said , " I went to see the bright lights " — she became an apartment manager in Dallas — married and divorced and happily returned home .
" I knew I was safe here , " she said .
In 2005 Sheriff Hopper foiled a takeover attempt by a radical faction of the Libertarian party by calling on the Texas Rangers .
The radical Libertarian group had sworn to " free " Loving County by buying property and moving in voters .
Don Creager , the Loving County Judge for 28 years told the associated press , " The rules that apply a lot of places do n't apply here , "
" We just live a different lifestyle .
We like it the way it is , " Creager said .
( Mental Floss ) --
Remember that goofy uncle of yours who always tried to impress you by " stealing your nose " or pulling the ol ' separating - his - thumb - from - his - hand move ?
Well , those parlor tricks are nothing compared to the appendage stunts pulled by these 10 famous people .
John Wilkes Booth 's neck bones
A painting of Napoleon in His Study by Jacques - Louis - David does n't give a hint at what body part went missing .
John Wilkes Booth might have been a successful assassin , but he was a largely ineffectual escape artist .
Just 12 days after murdering President Abraham Lincoln , Booth was shot in the back of the neck and killed .
His body was ( eventually ) buried in an unmarked grave at Baltimore 's Green Mount Cemetery .
His third , fourth , and fifth vertebrae , however , were removed during the autopsy so investigators could access the bullet .
For a peek at those bits of Booth 's spinal column , just check out the display at the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Washington , D.C .
Einstein's brain
Before he died , über - genius Albert Einstein considered donating his body to science .
Unfortunately , he never put his wishes in writing .
When he passed away in 1955 , Einstein 's family and friends made plans to cremate him , but the pathologist who performed the autopsy , Dr. Thomas Harvey , had a different idea .
Instead , he opted to remove the math man 's brain and then tell the family about it .
For 30 - some years , Harvey had Al 's gray matter tucked away in his Wichita home in two Mason jars .
Naturally , Einstein 's loved ones were n't thrilled when they found out , but they eventually allowed the misappropriated mind to be sliced into 240 sections and disbursed to researchers for examination .
Today , many of the cerebral sections remain in scientific institutions , with the bulk held at Princeton Hospital .
As for Einstein 's body , that was cremated and scattered in a secret location .
" Stonewall " Jackson 's arm
Confederate General Thomas Jackson got his nickname by sitting astride his horse " like a stone wall " while bullets whizzed around him during the Civil War .
But that kind of bravery ( or foolhardiness ) did n't serve him well .
During the Battle of Chancellorsville , Jackson was accidentally shot in the arm by one of his own men .
Said arm had to be amputated , and afterward , it was buried in the nearby Virginia town of Ellwood .
Only eight days later , Stonewall was stone - cold dead of pneumonia .
The rest of his body is resting in peace in Lexington , Virginia .
Saint Francis Xavier 's hand
Francis Xavier was a saint with a few too many fans .
In the early 16th century , the Spanish missionary was sent to Asia by the king of Portugal to convert as many souls to Christianity as possible .
Turns out , he was pretty good at the job .
Francis Xavier became wildly popular , and after his death in 1552 , so did his relics .
In fact , demand out - fueled supply .
Throughout several years and multiple exhumations , his body was whittled away .
Today , half his left hand is in Cochin , India , while the other half is in Malacca , Malaysia .
One of his arms resides in Rome , and various other cities lay claim to his internal organs .
The leftovers ?
They went to Goa , India .
Napoleon 's bits and pieces
Exiled emperor Napoleon Bonaparte died on May 5 , 1821 .
The following day , doctors conducted an autopsy , which was reportedly witnessed by many people , including a priest named Ange Vignali .
Though the body was said to be largely intact at the time of the undertaking , it seems the priest took home a souvenir .
In 1916 , Vignali 's heirs sold a collection of Napoleonic artifacts , including what they claim to be the emperor 's penis .
While no one knows for sure if it really is Napoleon 's , uh , manhood , people have paid good money for the penis .
Currently , it's in the possession of an American urologist .
Oliver Cromwell 's head
Oliver Cromwell , the straight - laced Puritan who usurped the English throne , was n't exactly a wild man .
His head , however , was sometimes the life of the party .
Cromwell died in 1658 , but two years later , the reinstated English monarchy exhumed , tried , and hanged his body , then dumped it in an unmarked grave .
In addition , as a warning to would - be killers , his head was placed on a pike in Westminster Hall , where it remained for 20 years .
After a subsequent stint in a small museum , it was sold in 1814 to a man named Josiah Henry Wilkinson ( perhaps looking to parade it around as an exceptionally gruesome ice - breaker at parties ) .
Such was the ironic afterlife of the Puritan until 1960 , when his head was finally laid to rest in a chapel in Cambridge .

Today has to be a nice day for an article about something that you ca n’t possibly do with an iPhone .
Simply because it totally lacks one feature .
Namely , high quality video recording .
Disclaimer :
I take absolutely no responsibility for the damage you might cause as a result of trying to do something similar to what we have done in this article .
I just spent a week on the western coast of Denmark .
To be precise , in Klitmøller .
A very nice place .
Known for wind and great surfing in addition to nice family friendly summer homes and a fresh west coast nature .
I ’ve been pretty offline and spent the days with my family relaxing .
But there ’s always time for some important experiments .
My experiments usually include images or gadgets .
This time I had an idea about some spectacular aerial video shooting .
The combination of my brother - in - law , Dr. Jacob Torgersen with a PhD in genetics and an extended interest for windsurfing , a Nokia 6630 test unit , a Nokia N95 main unit , a kite , some wind , my degree in media engineering and a big roll of duct tape should be enough to manage some interesting tests .
The Nokia N95 has excellent video recording capabilities , so in addition to all of the other stuff it can do it is a very light weight video camera .
Of course it is a bit risky to send a $ 500 , - phone up in a $ 30 , - kite but we have a lot of duct tape .
And everything can be solved with a lot of duct tape .
First , we measured the balance of the kite and found the best place to mount the phone to avoid instabilities during flight .
Then we mounted my old Nokia 6630 as a test unit and sent it up .
Everything flying smooth until the first serious vibrations sent my 6630 down into the gravel from about 20 m .
The first result of our tests is a fact : a nokia 6630 survives a 20 meter drop with minor scratches .
Amazing .
And our first conclusion : not enough duct tape .
We ’re not very patient when it comes to experiments like this and Dr. Torgersen seems very confident in his kiting skills .
Time to mount the Nokia N95 and get some better quality video .
More duct tape this time .
The kite goes into the air .
Dr. Torgersen puts his years of experience with windsurfing and probably a bit of genetic science behind the navigation and we end up with a pretty cool video .
http://flash.revver.com/player/1.0/player.swf
He even manages to land the thing quite smooth and I am still a happy user of my undamaged Nokia N95 .
Yes .
It flies .
And you can download the original MP4 - file as it looked directly from the Nokia N95 here .
Update :
And when you watch the video on your Nokia N95 maybe you would want to connect a big screen .
Bigger than the iPhone .
First , and foremost , I request this diary be recommended so it survives a day or two in the recommended section .
I could care less that this diary is recommended because I wrote it .
I give permission to steal my diary , if necessary , by a more prominent Kos writer , if that is what is needed to bring attention to this .
I have never in my 50 years of life been more frightened then I am now .
I have seen the arrogance of this White House and the massive damage done to our country .
But the Katrina - size storm clouds are gathering folks .
If we do not wake up now and flood Congress to impeach the President and Vice President , one year from now , Daily Kos may be banned and Markos himself may be disappeared , in a federal prison somewhere .
Even as I write these words I feel like a wild - eyed nutcase .
If it were not for the OH SO REAL danger this country faces in the next 15 months or so as the people in power see their own doom and are determined to prevent their expulsion from power by suspending next year 's elections and declaring martial law WHEN the next 9/11 comes or events that can be construed as a national emergency to " justify " such actions , I would be holding my tongue and crossing my fingers .
I know that the readers on Daily Kos are all too aware of the evil intent of the Bush regime , but I fear even they , even you , are not alarmed enough .
I fear you , like me until now , are hoping we can get through the next 15 months or so and throw the bums out in the 2008 election and hope that we avoid war with Iran and another 9/11 .
If we cross our fingers hard enough and hold our breath ( and close our eyes , and tap our ruby slippers together ) maybe we 'll wake up to a beautiful new dawn January 20 , 2009 .
Maybe even Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny will help elect a Democratic White House and stronger Democratic Congress .
What will it take to wake US up , let alone the average out - of - touch - with - reality American ?
What will it take ?
I thought about martial law the other day and I never thought I would actually hope illegal militias in the United States would be our final hope against a real dictatorship - that Americans will rise up with arms against a dictatorial government .
But I fear even that hope is farfetched .
Remember 9/11 ?
Remember how most Americans were rah-rah patriotic ( including me ) and flying flags everywhere and supporting the President at 90 % approval ( including me ) ?
Now I do n't know how and if we will have a disaster equal in casualties to 9/11 or worse , but even a series of London type bombings killing " only " a few dozen Americans may be all that is needed to institute martial law and cause most Americans , in fear , to rally around a President who warned them Al Quada was after us and that he will protect us with extraordinary means .
He will say " these measures " are now needed to ensure no further attacks are done .
And maybe Washington can help precipitate a 9/11 by attacking Iran and causing groups like Hezbollah to launch attacks on American soil - the President then carries out his many executive orders and in effect suspends all Constitutional rights and effects martial law .
This is deadly serious folks .
This is not just another diary .
We ignore this threat at our own peril .
I would suggest even I in writing articles like this and the many writers at Daily Kos are personally at risk of being arrested in a future dictatorial United States .
The government will use these writings as an excuse to put us away .
Is that what you want ?
Do we just lie down and accept our fate ?
That our precious Constitutional democracy is on its deathbed ?
Are my writings the writings of a mad man , a silly alarmist ?
Do I over blow the danger ?
Is Paul Craig Roberts , a man who has been in the halls of power , a mad man ?
I say WAKE UP Daily Kos !!
If the people at Daily Kos cannot take this seriously and try and do something about it , then the United States , as a free country IS doomed .
Enjoy your freedom to read and write at such sites as Daily Kos , because that freedom will be taken away WHEN Bush declares martial law .
What can we do , you ask ?
Good question .
I myself feel helpless .
I write my Congress people ( the few possibly sympathetic , like Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio ) and realize the Senator himself will never read my letter .
That is why I write this article on Daily Kos .
I hope enough people will read this and be agitated enough to really raise this issue NON - STOP .
We need to write articles daily on this danger .
I know members of Congress read Daily Kos .
I know there is a Daily Kos convention coming up with people like Senator Clinton coming .
Yes , we need to convince Nancy Pelosi and John Conyers to put impeachment back on the table , because I am 100 % convinced that is our only remedy left .
The Republican Congress impeached Bill Clinton on much less significant issues then we can bring against Bush and Cheney .
Politicians like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and others need to be prepared for their own " Boris Yeltsin " moment when they may need to " stand on the tanks " and defy a dictatorial government .
I hope we can remove these tyrants from office before that reality comes , but if we keep holding our breath and hoping we can make it to January 2009 before such events occur , we may wake up one morning , like the people of the Soviet Union did in 1991 , and find tanks in the streets of Washington surrounding the White House and Pentagon and they wage war on their own citizens in the form of martial law and as we see many members of Congress under arrest as subversives .
Is this an Orwellian dream , a fantasy , a movie thriller ?
Or is this a cold - blooded real probability ?
Do we want to wait and see ?
I pray we do not .
UPDATE :
I truly appreciate those who have " suggested " this article is nothing more then tin-foil alarmism that gives Daily Kos a bad reputation .
My hope remains that is TRUE .
But I will emphasize that this article was not written because I raised the alarm , but because a former Reagan official raised the alarm , and he raised in it no uncertain terms .
Now , if someone can present evidence why Paul Craig Roberts is not credible , other then his former disparaging of Democrats ( my , he was a partisan , imagine that ) and if someone can specifically show why his arguments are ridiculous , that will give me and others some peace of mind .
I will also say this article was written in the context of what this White House has already done - from illegal wiretapping , torture , renditions , lying about reasons for war , arresting and jailing people without trial or attorneys , suspending Habeas Corpus , signing statements ignoring laws at will , declaring executive priviledge on EVERYTHING , refusing to audit handling of classified data , politicizing the Justice Department , etc , etc .
Obviously some of those things are worse then others , but when a President tries and take away our MOST basic right to Habeas Corpus , the non-alarmists better wake up .
TODAY , July 21
Good day all .
Keep your ears peeled during the time Richard Cheney is Acting President of the United States today .
Ordinarily such an event would be a ho - hum event , but in today 's world , maybe not so much .
Hopefully being President for only a couple of hours will limit any damage Cheney can cause .
Of course , Cheney is already the defacto President anyway .
( For those who do not know , Bush will be sedated today for a colonoscopy and will transfer the powers of the presidency to Cheney while he is sedated )

I was once sitting down to dinner with a group of people I was meeting for the first time .
Directly across the table from me was a pretty young woman who , from what I could tell , was facing difficult decisions and needed advice .
I caught on to her situation because of the questions she was being asked :
“ So have you picked a major ? ” —
“ Have you been accepted anywhere yet ? ” —
“ Have you decided where you ’re going ? ” — “ When will you be finished ? ”
She was clearly a senior in high school faced with the difficult questions that go hand - in - hand with preparing for graduation :
Which college ?
What major ?
When will I know ?
How do I choose ?
In other words : What happens next ?
I remember how stressful that time of my life was …
The number of different college programs was overwhelming …
The application process was tedious …
Applying to a college guaranteed nothing …
There was no telling when you ’d hear if you were accepted …
Enrollment deadlines and the end of senior year were approaching …
… and I remember panicking as a result of all the stress I was under .
At the time , I imagined the decision I made regarding college would be the most important decision I made in my life .
I was under the impression that my fate rested upon that single decision because the choice I made would start a life - long chain of events :
The college would affect the friends and professors I would meet .
My friends and professors would affect the quality of my education .
The quality of my education would affect my future career path .
My future career path would affect my future success .
My future success would affect my future happiness .
Note : I admit to being incredibly naive at the time .
Although I realize the extent of my naivety now , back when I was facing the different college choices these thoughts daily haunted my mind .
I was convinced that my entire future would be affected by my decision .
Consequently , I was confused , scared , and desperate for advice .
I sensed the same confused desperation in this girl seated across from me .
“ I think I ’m going to go into Communications , ” she explained , “ because my dad said it would make a lot of money . ”
I winced — the same bad advice led me into a college curriculum I disliked .
My computer talents caused people I knew to constantly make the same suggestion : “ Get a computer science degree — you ’ll make a fortune . ”
She continued , saying : “ I actually do n’t know what Communications is about , but it ’s better than listing ‘ Undecided ’ as my major . ”
I winced again — a memory of my older brother came to mind .
He went to college for only one year , majoring in Mechanical Engineering .
The problem was , he knew nothing about the subject .
His high school guidance counselor pushed him into choosing something so he would n’t have to start college “ Undecided . ”
Choosing something he knew nothing about , as it turned out , caused him to drop out within a year .
The more I heard from this girl , the more I wanted offer her some simple advice :
Do what interests you .
Doing something for money will lead you to a life you have no passion for .
Doing something because someone else told you to will lead to the same .
Here this girl was following the advice of her father , who was encouraging her to choose a major she knew nothing about with monetary incentive .
It was a recipe for disaster .
Unable to hold my tongue any longer , I suggested that she reconsider her choice of major .
I explained that it was unwise to choose a major based on money , or at someone else ’s suggestion .
“ Just do what interests you , ” I said .
“ And if you do n’t know what interests you , that ’s alright .
In fact , I think that ’s common .
Start undecided , fill your first semester schedule with intro courses , and find out what interests you . ”
When you ’re interested in something you ’re bound to do well in it .
Do n’t make the same mistake I made — if you do something in the interest of money , you ’re just wasting time .
Just do what interests you , and have fun .

MOSCOW , Aug. 8 — The Republic of Georgia presented what it called a mounting body of evidence today that a Russian warplane had entered deep into its airspace and fired an air - to - ground missile .
It said it was seeking a special session of the United Nations Security Council to address the incident .
No one was injured by the missile , which was fired Monday evening and struck near Tsitelubani , a village about 30 miles from Tbilisi , the Georgian capital .
The missile broke apart at impact , but did not explode .
The strike , the second mysterious raid with sophisticated , Russian - made weapons on Georgian soil this year , inflamed tensions anew between the two countries .
Russia has denied any role , and suggested that Georgia attacked itself .
Like Georgia , it has said it wants a comprehensive investigation of the incident .
But with Georgia marshaling its evidence and its foreign minister , Gela Bezhuashvili , rallying international support , the missile strike seemed to pose problems for Russian diplomacy in the turbulent Caucasus .
It also raised new questions about Russia ’s activities in the region and the truthfulness of its statements .

The newest revelations about the circumstances surrounding Pat Tillman 's death are horrifying enough to merit widespread media coverage .
But rather than rehashing the details , I think it 's instructive to watch two very different broadcasts , ironically , by two stations with the same parent company :
Here 's Jim Miklaszweski on Friday 's NBC Nightly News :
Download QT later ...
Now to be fair , that 's an fair and accurate reporting of facts .
However , what Miklaszewski fails to do is to connect the dots or provide any context .
Compare it to this report ( using the same footage and in fact , citing Miklaszewski's report ) on MSNBC 's Countdown with Keith Olbermann with Jon Soltz of VoteVets.org :
Download Download
Which reporting made you feel like you understood the situation better ?
UPDATE : Apparently , both MSNBC & NBC operated from AP 's report of Tillman berating a soldier in the last moments before his death , based on a second - hand account given by a chaplain who debriefed the unit after the incident .
According to MSNBC yesterday , the soldier involved said it did n't quite happen that way .
Maybe it's me , but do n't you think that AP might have wanted to confirm the events with someone who was , say , there before running the story and painting Tillman as an angry and dismissive atheist fragged by his fellow troops ?
Doctors said an antibiotic - resistant bacterium known as Klebsiella pneumoniae has killed as many as 200 patients in hospitals across Israel .
Elderly patients and people with weak immune systems are particularly vulnerable to the bacterium , Arutz Sheva reported .
Epidemiologist Yehuda Carmeli of the Sourasky Medical Center in Tel Aviv said 400 to 500 people have been infected by the bug .
" Thirty to forty percent of them have already died , " Carmeli told YNetNews .
" However , it is important to note that most of them were in a serious condition , and some were suffering from prior medical conditions . "
Infectious diseases specialist Dr. Galia Rahav told Israel 's Channel 1 that 130 patients at Sheba Hospital have become infected .
One - third of those patients have died .
YNetNews said the Israeli Health Ministry has set up a committee of experts to " determine the scope of the problem and advise hospitals on how to contain it . "

So , I was reading through comments to despam my old posts before archiving them , and came upon this old reply to this old post of mine which was a reply to this much older post .
I wo n’t reply to that post much , because it ’s mostly … well , not useful to respond to .
But people often talk about the wonders of Open Classes in Ruby .
For Python people who are n’t familiar with what that means , you can do :
# Somehow acquire SomeClassThatAlreadyExists class SomeClassThatAlreadyExists def some_method ( blahblahblah ) stuff end end
And SomeClassThatAlreadyExists has a some_method added to it ( or if that method already exists , then the method is replaced with the new implementation ) .
In Python when you do this , you ’ve defined an entirely new class that just happens to have the name SomeClassThatAlreadyExists .
It does n’t actually effect the original class , and probably will leave you confused because of the two very different classes with the same name .
In Ruby when you define a class that already exists , you are extending the class in - place .
You can change Python classes in - place , but there ’s no special syntax for it , so people either think you ca n’t do it , or do n’t realize that you are doing the same thing as in Ruby but without the syntactic help .
I guess this will be easier with class decorators , but some time ago I also wrote a recipe using normal decorators that looks like this :
@magic_set(SomeClassThatAlreadyExists ) def some_method ( self , blahblahblah ) : stuff
The only thing that is even slightly magic about the setting is that I look at the first argument of the function to determine if you are adding an instance , class , or static method to an object , and let you add it to classes or instances .
It ’s really not that magic , even if it is called magicset .
I think with class decorators you could do this :
@extend( SomeClassThatAlreadyExists ) class SomeClassThatAlreadyExists : def some_method ( self , blahblahblah ) : stuff
Implemented like this :
def extend( class_to_extend ) : def decorator ( extending_class ) : class_to_extend.__dict__.update(extending_class.__dict__ ) return class_to_extend return decorator
The files contain personal data on millions of the Nazis ' victims
The electronic transfer is part of an agreement to open up the Bad Arolsen archive , overseen by the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) .
The files , kept in Germany , were found in concentration camps and other Nazi prisons at the end of World War II .
Several countries have not yet ratified the agreement , delaying full access .
The archive will only be fully opened to the public when the 2006 protocol is ratified by Italy , France and Greece .
That is expected later this year .
The ICRC says the archive has now transferred many documents from the archive to the Holocaust Memorial Museum in the US and to the Yad Vashem Holocaust Centre in Israel .
Chilling details
The 47 million files stored in the spa town of Bad Arolsen hold meticulously recorded information on forced labourers , concentration camp victims and political prisoners .
They take up 26 km ( 16 miles ) of shelving .
Historians believe many more details about the Nazis ' murder and brutal exploitation of millions of Jews , Roma ( Gypsies ) and other victims will be revealed .
" After a long political process , we can now give researchers and the public access to the files , " said Reto Meister , director of the ICRC 's International Tracing Service ( ITS ) .
So far , 12 million documents have been digitised for electronic transfer , the ICRC says .
In grey , bureaucratic language the Nazis kept records on the smallest details - from the number of lice on a prisoner 's head to the exact moment of their execution .
The archive has been used to help people trace their relatives .
But access has been restricted to protect victims ' privacy .
The archive is controlled by an 11 - nation treaty signed in 1955 and amended by the 2006 protocol .
The countries are : Belgium , Britain , France , Germany , Greece , Israel , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , Poland and the US .
Tomorrow is my last day at Corillian / CheckFree and I like to keep things tidy and ethical ( that means I 'm not going to toast or format my hard drive on purpose . )
As you likely do as well , I had a number of " Assets " listed under my name at this company .
That means Laptops , Desktops , Monitors , etc .
For the ones that are strictly development and have only dev tools and mostly - fresh operating systems on them , I just made sure that everyone had passwords and access .
However , I did have a personal laptop , and these things tend to get reused in my experience at companies .
Here 's the checklist I used to get ready to leave .
All this assumes that you 're turning in your hardware and your IT department either :
a. might not toast / re-image your system immediately
b . they 'll stick it on a shelf and get to it whenever
c. you 're paranoid .
Just because you 're paranoid does n't mean they 're not after you .
Remember that if you 're a Domain User , someone can , and likely will , log in as you later after you 've left .
Every byte in your hard drive is theirs ( and always has been ) .
So , tidy up .
RETURN : Turn in every piece of hardware that they ever gave you .
I turned in Monitors , USB Hubs , everything .
The last thing I need is someone from IT calling me looking for crap .

Watch and learn .
Experience says it works , but how ?
University of Oregon researchers have seen the light , by imaging the brain , while test subjects watched films of others building objects with Tinker Toys .
As detailed in the Dec. 20 issue of the Journal of Neuroscience , researchers , using functional magnetic resonance imaging , found that when a person watches someone else perform a task with the intention of later replicating the observed performance , motor areas of the brain are activated in a fashion similar to that with accompanies actual movement .
" We 've been looking at the process of motor learning through observation in the context of procedures , " said principal investigator Scott H. Frey , professor of psychology and director of the Lewis Center for Neuroimaging at the University of Oregon .
Frey 's interest is geared toward improvements in rehabilitation for individuals suffering brain or bodily injury .
" Teaching a physical skill often involves someone demonstrating the essential action components after which the learner tries to reproduce what has been observed .
This is true for behaviors ranging from learning to eat with utensils , playing an instrument or performing surgery .
We wanted to know how the brain takes what is seen and translates it into a motor program for guiding skilled movements , " he said .
In the experiment , 19 college - aged , healthy adults watched a series of digital videos of another person putting together or disassembling objects using six toy parts .
In one condition , participants simply watched the activity ; in another , they observed clips with the intention to be able to reproduce the actions in the correct sequential order minutes later .
Despite lying completely still during these tasks , observing with the intention to learn actions and subsequently reproduce them engages areas of the brain known to contribute to motor learning thorough actual physical practice .
In particular , Frey said , the amount of activity occurring in the intraparietal sulcus -- when watching to learn accurately -- predicts how well these actions are reproduced minutes later .
Frey 's group and others have previously implicated that this region is involved in organizing goal - directed manual actions .
In effect , Frey said , the activity in intraparietal cortex may act as a thermometer that shows how well a person is translating what they are observing into a motor program for later performance .
" What appears vital is the intention of the observer rather than simply the visual stimulus that is being viewed , " Frey said .
" If the goal is to be able to do what you are seeing , then it appears that activity through your motor system is up - regulated substantially . "
Using fMRI , researchers are able to monitor changes in activity throughout the entire brain while people think by taking advantage of differences in the magnetic properties of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin .
These changes closely track underlying neural activity .
The findings " implicate the parieto - frontal mirror system in encoding the spatial components of observed actions and the primary motor cortex in the formation of novel motor memories through observation , " wrote Frey and research assistant Valerie E. Gerry in their conclusions .
" This study is the first in a series of several experiments that we plan to do , " Frey said .
" It tells us something about how our own motor systems can be engaged and stimulated even in the absence of overt movements .
This could prove important as a means of facilitating rehabilitation of individuals with movement impairments or paralysis . "
As I wrote about here and here , since Rep. John Murtha had the audacity to say that troops should not be sent into Iraq without proper training and equipment , the Republican hit squad has been out in force .
And today the National Review Online and Dick " Last Throes " Cheney have taken the attacks to a new high ... or low , as the case may be .
First , from NRO :
As you know , John Murtha has " said he would attach language to a war funding bill that would prohibit the redeployment of units that have been at home for less than a year , stop the extension of tours beyond 12 months and prohibit units from shipping out if they do not train with all of their equipment .
His aim , he made clear , is not to improve readiness but to ' stop the surge . ' [...]
We Marines maintain that except for Lee Harvey Oswald , there is no such thing as an " ex - Marine . "
I believe that John Murtha has just joined that small club .
And from Dick :
With respect to Iraq , I think he 's dead wrong .
I think , in fact , if we were to do what Speaker Pelosi and Congressman Murtha are suggesting , all we 'll do is validate the al Qaeda strategy .
The al Qaeda strategy is to break the will of the American people -- in fact , knowing they can't win in a stand - up fight , try to persuade us to throw in the towel and come home , and then they win because we quit .
On par with the man who assassinated John F. Kennedy , or enabling al Qaeda ?
How low are the GOP willing to go to avoid facing a vote that would actually mean supporting the troops ?
Stay tuned .
Reports of widespread fraud and waste of funds in Iraq
Bowen interview
The chief auditor assigned by Congress , Stuart Bowen , said the Iraqi government was failing to take responsibility for projects worth billions of dollars .
Mr Bowen also said his agency was investigating more than 50 fraud cases .
Meanwhile , nearly a third of Iraq 's population is in need of emergency aid , a report by Oxfam and Iraqi NGOs says .
The report said the Iraqi government was failing to provide basic essentials such as water , food , sanitation and shelter for up to eight million people .
It warned that the continuing violence was masking a humanitarian crisis that had escalated since the US - led invasion in 2003 .
On Monday , six people were killed and at least 12 injured in a car bomb attack in Baghdad .
The US military also announced the deaths of three of its soldiers in the western province of Anbar .
' Troubling '
US Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction Stuart Bowen was appointed to audit $ 44bn ( £ 22 bn ) allocated since 2003 , after reports of widespread fraud and waste .
The agency publishes quarterly reports on the situation , most of which have complained about a serious lack of progress .
Monday 's report was no different .
Millions of Iraqis have been forced to flee the violence , either to another part of Iraq or abroad - many of those are living in dire poverty
Jeremy Hobbs
Director of Oxfam International
Alarming humanitarian crisis
In an interview with the BBC , Mr Bowen said corruption was endemic and described it as " an enemy of democracy " .
He added : " We have performed 95 audits that have found instances of programmatic weakness and waste , and we 've got 57 ongoing cases right now , criminal cases , looking at fraud . "
Mr Bowen said the transfer of projects to Iraqi government control was " troubling " , and expressed concern about delays and cost overruns .
The report gave the example of the Doura power station , rebuilt with tens of millions of US dollars , which fell into disrepair once it was transferred to Iraqi control .
Mr Bowen also said Iraqi ministries were struggling to administer funds .
Last year , Prime Minister Nouri Maliki 's government only spent 22 % of its budget on vital rebuilding projects , while spending 99 % of the allocation for salaries , he said .
He said " a pathway towards potential prosperity " could be found only if oil production was brought up to optimal levels , and security and corruption effectively managed .
' Ruined by war '
The Iraqi parliament has now adjourned until 4 September , despite US calls for it to remain in session and pass already - delayed legislation .
The recess means parliament will reconvene just days before America 's top commander in Iraq , Army Gen David Petraeus , reports to Congress on the US troop " surge " strategy .

His assessment will likely provide the backdrop to the next round of war spending .
The BBC's Nicholas Witchell in Baghdad says the report by the UK - based charity and the NGO Co-ordination Committee in Iraq ( NCCI ) makes alarming reading .
The survey recognises that armed conflict is the greatest problem facing Iraqis , but finds a population " increasingly threatened by disease and malnutrition " .
It suggests that 70 % of Iraq 's 26.5 m population are without adequate water supplies , compared to 50 % prior to the invasion .
Only 20 % have access to effective sanitation .
Nearly 30 % of children are malnourished , a sharp increase on the situation four years ago .
Some 15 % of Iraqis regularly cannot afford to eat .
The report also said 92 % of Iraq 's children suffered from learning problems .
It found that more than two million people have been displaced inside the country , while a further two million have fled to neighbouring countries .
On Thursday , an international conference in Jordan pledged to help the refugees with their difficulties .
Oxfam has not operated in Iraq since 2003 for security reasons .
I ’ve have it in my head to extract / rewrite parts of Paste lately .
Tempita was one example .
The request and response functions in Paste grew very organically .
I was n’t trying to create a framework , so I studiously avoided anything that might look like a request or response object .
I felt that would be stepping on toes or something .
Eventually , though , Ben Bangert really wanted a request object for Pylons , and it went in paste.wsgiwrappers .
And at a certain point I decided that the class - based access was really just fine , and doing lots of function ( environ , ... ) was no better than Request ( environ ) .
function (... ) .
So I started WebOb .
WebOb has Request , Response , and some exceptions , incorporating the functionality of Paste ’s paste .
request , paste .
response , paste.wsgilib , paste.httpexceptions , and paste.httpheaders .
And some extra stuff .
I ’ve included a comparison with a few other framework request / response objects .
What this does n’t note , though , is that WebOb has a much larger Request and Response objects .
I ’ve taken almost all the HTTP headers and mapped them to parsed attributes .
So req.if_modified_since returns a datetime object , and req.if_none_match returns a somewhat set - like object , as a few examples .
I created a lot of view - like objects for this , representing the canonical form of the information in several other forms ( the WSGI request environment , and the status / headers / body of the response ) .
It ’s fairly well tested and includes almost everything I think it should include , but I reserve the right to change the API any way I want until 1.0 ; this means if you have any opinion on the API I have nothing to stop me from taking your opinions into account .
Oh , and it has docs , really .
They may not be the best docs , but they mention most everything and are automatically tested for accuracy .
If you just want a sense of the feel , maybe the file - serving example would be a good place to start ( though really you ’ll only read about the Response object there ) .
Pentagon hides piles of IED - shredded Humvees from public David Edwards and Will Menaker

On American military bases all across Iraq , the shredded wreckage of scores of humvees damaged by IEDs and other explosive devices lie under tarps , hidden from public view .
Much like the coffins of soldiers killed in the line of duty , the Pentagon refuses to allow images of the physical toll of battle to be seen by the public .
CNN highlights the vulnerability of the army 's most prolific vehicle , and the familiar story of the lack of pre-war planning , through the story of Army reserve Captain Allen Vaught , a Dallas trail lawyer who was deployed to Iraq in 2003 .
Vaught was stationed in both Fallujah and later Sadr city , and saw firsthand how unprepared the army was for an extended insurgency .
Vaught broke his back when an IED destroyed the poorly armored humvee he was riding in .
In a letter home to his mother during the first month of the war , Vaught expressed his fear of riding in a humvee with only canvas doors , writing , " it 's getting worse here in Fallujah and we do n't know why ... I thought we were supposed to be greeted as liberators "
Vaught has no doubts where the munitions that kill American troops come from , explaining that Iraq was littered with open bunkers filled with tank shells , RPG rounds , and other explosives that were looted because of the lack of American troops needed to secure the country in the early days of the war .
While the number of so called up - armored humvees in Iraq has increased from 235 in 2003 to over 8,000 now , the Pentagon now claims they need at least 2,000 more .
The following video clip is from CNN 's documentary Battlefield Breakdown , broadcast on July 1 .
Claim : Photograph shows a snake pulling a cow out of the water .

The Cow and the Snake The Cow and the Snake This is a snake pulling a cow out of the water .
Talk about a man eater !
Origins : Some species of snake are capable of truly impressive feats of strength and gastronomy , and the photograph displayed above is one example of such ( even though it may be mislabeled ) .
The serpent captured in this picture is an olive python , one of Australia ’s largest snakes .
What the python appears to be hauling out of the water is not a cow but a wallaby — still a very large animal in comparison to the snake itself , but a type of prey that pythons have been known to ingest before .
The Australian news outlet ABC Far North Queensland reported of this picture back in July 2005 :
It ’s not your average fishing shot but I ’m sure you ’ll agree it ’s a catch that few could ever imagine .
It ’s not your average fishing shot but I ’m sure you ’ll agree it ’s a catch that few could ever imagine .
The picture shows a large Olive python capturing dinner — a wallaroo or euro .
Note the size of the python , which if you look closely you can see disappearing out the right hand side of the frame .
How much more of it is there , curled around the escarpment it so beautifully blends with ?
It appears that the wallaby is already dead but swallowing it will require an awesome feat of strength from the python — not only to drag the ‘ roo into it ’s gut but also to hang on while it does so .
It ’s a large python but it ’s still an impressive display of the incredible physiology of these reptiles .
The pic was taken in the Kimberley region of [ Western Australia ] … the scene captured in this image holds a kind of macabre fascination for most of us who view it , as well as a tease … did the python actually manage to swallow its ambitious meal , given its precarious location ?
Or was it simply reeling in its catch , like any fisherman , to consume it in a more genial environment .
ABC also noted that someone posting as the original photographer left a message in their guestbook :
I hope you enjoyed the photo that we took recently while hiking in a gorge in northern Western Australia .
The phython was not able to lift the wallaby after trying for approximately one hour .
We left him catching his breath on a rock ledge above the pool .

House Democrats tell Cheney to butt out of Scooter Libby pardon proceedings Michael Roston
Published : Thursday June 7 , 2007 Print This Email This Two leading Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee wrote to Vice President Dick Cheney today and urged him to recuse himself from any internal proceedings on granting former top White House aide I. Lewis ' Scooter ' Libby a pardon .
On Tuesday , Libby was sentenced to 30 months in prison for perjury , obstruction of justice , and making false statement charges .
" In light of your personal involvement in the facts that gave rise to the charges against Mr. Libby , and your apparent stake in a favorable outcome for him , we strongly urge that you recuse yourself ... in any future issues that relate to his prosecution , " wrote Rep. John Conyers ( D - MI ) and Jerrold Nadler ( D - NY ) in the Thursday letter .
They continued , " It would be deeply divisive , and invite deep cynicism and disrespect for the legal process , were the American people to conclude that Mr. Libby undertook actions that subjected him to criminal liability to protect you , knowing ... that you would thereafter take steps to protect him from the consequences of his criminal conduct . "
Conyers is the chair of the House Judiciary Committee , and Nadler is chair of the subcommittee on the Constitution , Civil Rights , and Civil Liberties .
They were reacting to a recent public statement by Cheney that hinted at the need for a pardon .
" This request is prompted , in part , by your reported comments in which you stated your hope that ' our system will return a final result consistent with what we know of this fine man , ' " they wrote .
Earlier on Thursday , the Associated Press reported that Libby 's attorneys formally sought a delay of his sentence while they pursue an appeal of his conviction .
But the prospects of this request being granted seemed slim .
" [ Federal District Judge Reggie B. ]
Walton said he sees no reason to allow Libby to remain free pending appeal , " wrote Matt Apuzzo .

Doctors refusing to perform abortions .
Standard .
( The procedure is n’t even taught in medical schools . )
Doctors refusing to provide fetal tissue for stem cells , pharmacists refusing to fill prescriptions .
All of these things happen based on peoples ’ belief that providing such services threatens unborn life .
And as much as I do n’t agree with these decisions , I get it ( sort of ) .
If these people feel , really feel , that lives are threatened by their action , then following through is a difficult choice .
But how about when doctors refuse to perform , not abortions , not stem - cell procedures , but in vitro fertilization , which actually helps create life ?
The California Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case in which two doctors refused a woman IVF treatment because she ’s a lesbian .
Which means that they felt that Guadalupe Benitez and her partner ( whom Elizabeth Weil wrote about for Mother Jones last year ) did not have the right to the life they hold so dear .
The case , which began in 2001 with Benitez claiming that the doctors violated California ’s anti-discrimination laws , is seen as one of the most controversial the Court has heard in years .
The doctors were not refusing a service — they routinely performed IVF on other patients — but instead cited religious beliefs in this specific instance .
The court could find that doctors will have to take an “ all - or - nothing ” approach , which would mean loss of lucrative IVF business if such doctors stick to their religious standards .
The doctors ’ defense all along has been that they did n’t perform the procedure because Benitez is unmarried .
( Benitez has said , under oath , that the doctors told her it was because of her sexual orientation . )
Okay , so let ’s give them their defense for a sec .
Do they then support gay marriage so that newborn life can be cherished ?
And how come they have religious objection to IVF for unmarried women , but are fine with assisting in the production of up to a dozen excess embryos per woman they treat ?
These embryos now number half a million nationwide ; they ’re sitting frozen in storage and are most likely destined to be destroyed .
The Choose Life argument does n’t wash when the same moral high ground is used to deny it .
A study of 240,000 Norwegian teenagers has found that first - born children are , on average , more than two I.Q. points more intelligent than the next kid in line .
As well , study author Dr. Petter Kristensen said in an interview that each successive child is likely to be a little less smart than the one before .
A portion of Kristensen ’s study , the largest ever of its kind , appears today in the journal Science .
The research drew its data from male Norwegian army conscripts aged 18 and 19 .
In Norway , almost all male teenagers are required to perform military service and IQ tests are also mandatory for most of these .
Kristensen says earlier research showed the same intelligence differences in female siblings .
The Norwegian data does not shed any light on why the differences exist , although there are several theories , he says .
“ The most dominant hypothesis has to do with the total parental resources that are not shared with anyone but the eldest , ” says Kristensen , a professor at Norway ’s National Institute of Occupational Health .
“ When number two comes , there will be sharing of resources and less for each . ”
Those parental “ resources ” are not likely related to the material goods or money allotted to the eldest child , but the amount of time parents can spend on such things as reading and playing .
Kristensen says .
But greater access to parental attention cannot be the sole explanation for the elder child phenomenon as only children are less intelligent on average than the firstborns in larger families , he says .
“ In fact ..... it ’s quite clear that only children score lower than first children in two - or three - child families , ” he says .
“ I ’m not sure what the reasons for this are , but there have been ( theories that ) the older child gains from tutoring the younger children . ”
Birth order expert Frank Sulloway , who wrote an analysis of the Norwegian work , says the 2.3 - point IQ difference between first and second born children may appear modest , but could have significant life consequences .
He said , for example , that such a point spread could easily make the difference between getting into a first tier university or having to settle for second best .
Sulloway , a visiting scholar with the Institute of Personality and Social Research at the University of California , Berkeley , believes the IQ advantage enjoyed by older siblings finds its roots in the niche they often inhabit within the family .
In particular , he says , their frequent role as baby sitter and teacher to their younger siblings builds a mindset , both internally and among their parents , that they are more responsible and intelligent than their brothers and sisters .
This flattering mindset , in turn , translates into the elevated IQ score , Sulloway says .
Sulloway called the Norwegian paper the “ most important ” done in the field in the past 70 years and estimated its sample size was at least 50 times bigger than the next largest sibling order study .
He also said it left the theory that the IQ advantage does n’t exist “ dead as a doornail ” .
But Sulloway pointed out in an interview that the “ elegantly designed ” Norwegian research averages IQ levels out over an entire population and that younger siblings can and often do score higher than older ones in many families .
The Science paper suggests the differences in intelligence and birth order are not biological , as has been argued previously .
Some researchers , for example , have ascribed the birth order phenomenon to a growing maternal immune response to each successive child as it grows in the womb .
This heightened immune response , it was thought , may have attacked the child ’s growing brain during pregnancy .
But the Norwegian study showed children who lost an older sibling and were raised as the “ first born ” enjoyed the same I.Q. advantage as actual first born children .
“ It ’s not plausible that it ’s some biological or gestational factor , so what we ’re left with is some kind of family interaction factors , ” Kristensen says .
Sicko Administration Trumps Up Charges Against Michael Moore Posted by Pile ( 7686 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
Michael Moore 's new documentary , " Sicko " premiers next week at the Cannes Film Festival .
In honor of his expose of the problems with healthcare in the United States , the U.S. Government is trying to put him in jail for visiting Cuba .
From Michael Moore 's journal - letter to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson :
May 11 , 2007
Secretary Paulson ,
I am contacting you in light of the document sent to me dated May 2 , 2007 , which was received May 7 , 2007 indicating that an investigation has been opened up with regards to a trip I took to Cuba with a group of Americans that included some 9/11 heroes in March 2007 related to the filming of my next documentary , on the American Healthcare system .
SiCKO , which will be seen in theaters this summer , will expose the health care industry ’s greed and control over America ’s political processes .
I believe that the decision to conduct this investigation represents the latest example of the Bush Administration abusing the federal government for raw , crass , political purposes .
Over the last seven years of the Bush Presidency , we have seen the abuse of government to promote a political agenda designed to benefit the conservative base of the Republican Party , special interests and major financial contributors .
From holding secret meetings for the energy industry to re-writing science findings to cooking the books on intelligence to the firing of U.S. Attorneys , this Administration has shown time and time again that it will abuse its power and authority .
There are a number of specific facts that have led me to conclude that politics could very well be driving this Bush Administration investigation of me and my film .
First , the Bush Administration has been aware of this matter for months ( since October 2006 ) and never took any action until less than two weeks before SiCKO is set to premiere at the Cannes Film Festival and a little more than a month before it is scheduled to open in the United States .
Second , the health care and insurance industry , which is exposed in the movie and has expressed concerns about the impact of the movie on their industries , is a major corporate underwriter of President George W. Bush and the Republican Party , having contributed over $ 13 million to the Bush presidential campaign in 2004 and more than $ 180 million to Republican candidates over the last two campaign cycles .
It is well documented that the industry is very concerned about the impact of SiCKO .
They have threatened their employees if they talk to me .
They have set up special internal crises lines should I show up at their headquarters .
Employees have been warned about the consequences of participating in SiCKO .
Despite this , some employees , at great risk to themselves , have gone on camera to tell the American people the truth about the health care industry .
I can understand why that industry 's main recipient of its contributions -- President Bush -- would want to harass , intimidate and potentially prevent this film from having its widest possible audience .
And , third , this investigation is being opened in the wake of misleading attacks on the purpose of the Cuba trip from a possible leading Republican candidate for president , Fred Thompson , a major conservative newspaper , The New York Post , and various right wing blogs .
For five and a half years , the Bush administration has ignored and neglected the heroes of the 9/11 community .
These heroic first responders have been left to fend for themselves , without coverage and without care .
I understand why the Bush administration is coming after me -- I have tried to help the very people they refuse to help , but until George W. Bush outlaws helping your fellow man , I have broken no laws and I have nothing to hide .
I demand that the Bush Administration immediately end this investigation and spend its time and resources trying to support some of the real heroes of 9/11 .
Sincerely ,
Michael Moore

so what ?

They 've known about this issue for more than six months .
It 's a little convenient to make a stink about it now do n't you think ?
Posted by 2time on 2007-05 - 18 07:59:29 Seriously .
Even if you do n't like Michael Moore ( and that ai n't a short list ) , it 's an almost petulant act to start this kind of investigation right before a movie critical of the government comes out .
If they did this kind of thing in Russia , all kinds of journalists over here would be up in arms about the suppression of free speech ( of course in Russia they 'd just shoot him ) .
yeah , right

When the US government prosecutes every American citizen who travels to Cuba , I 'll think this is fair enforcement of the law .
So far , that ai n't happening .
Americans visit Cuba every day , and hardly any actions are taken against them .
Selectively enforced laws are all too often used to harass people who are n't in power .
When was the last time you saw a Wall Street executive or a politician given a ticket for loitering ?
Posted by Pile on 2007-05 - 18 16:41:47 Look at Fred Thompson , known for having a penchant for Cuban cigars , which are illegal in the U.S. Talk about hypocrisy .

My supervisors did not want to lose me .
Most of my peers knew I was gay , and that did n’t bother them .
I was always accepted as a member of the team .
And my experience was not anomalous : polls of veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan show an overwhelming majority are comfortable with gays .
Many were aware of at least one gay person in their unit and had no problem with it .
“ Do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” does nothing but deprive the military of talent it needs and invade the privacy of gay service members just trying to do their jobs and live their lives .
Political and military leaders who support the current law may believe that homosexual soldiers threaten unit cohesion and military readiness , but the real damage is caused by denying enlistment to patriotic Americans and wrenching qualified individuals out of effective military units .
This does not serve the military or the nation well .
Consider : more than 58 Arabic linguists have been kicked out since “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” was instituted .
How much valuable intelligence could those men and women be providing today to troops in harm ’s way ?
In addition to those translators , 11,000 other service members have been ousted since the “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” policy was passed by Congress in 1993 .
Many held critical jobs in intelligence , medicine and counterterrorism .
An untold number of closeted gay military members do n’t re-enlist because of the pressure the law puts on them .
This is the real cost of the ban — and , with our military so overcommitted and undermanned , it ’s too high to pay .
In response to difficult recruiting prospects , the Army has already taken a number of steps , lengthening soldiers ’ deployments to 15 months from 12 , enlisting felons and extending the age limit to 42 .
Why then wo n’t Congress pass a bill like the Military Readiness Enhancement Act , which would repeal “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” ?
The bipartisan bill , by some analysts ’ estimates , could add more than 41,000 soldiers — all gay , of course .
As the friends I once served with head off to 15 - month deployments , I regret I ’m not there to lessen their burden and to serve my country .
I ’m trained to fight , I speak Arabic and I ’m willing to serve .
No recruiter needs to make a persuasive argument to sign me up .
I ’m ready , and I ’m waiting .
I am pleased to be able to present the H. Parker Willis Lecture in Economic Policy here at Washington and Lee University .
As you may know , Willis was an important figure in the early history of my current employer , the Federal Reserve System .
While he was a professor at Washington and Lee , Willis advised Senator Carter Glass of Virginia , one of the key legislators involved in the founding of the Federal Reserve .
Willis also served on the National Monetary Commission , which recommended the creation of the Federal Reserve , and he went on to become the research director at the Federal Reserve from 1918 to 1922 .
At the Federal Reserve , Willis pushed for the development of new and better economic statistics , facing the resistance of those who took the view that too many facts only confuse the issue .
Willis was also the first editor of the Federal Reserve Bulletin , the official publication of the Fed , which in Willis 's time as well as today provides a wealth of economic statistics .
As an illustration of the intellectual atmosphere in Washington at the time he served , Willis reported that when the first copy of the Bulletin was presented to the Secretary of the Treasury , the esteemed Secretary replied , " This Government ai n't going into the newspaper business . "
Like Parker Willis , I was a professor myself before coming to the Federal Reserve Board .
One topic of particular interest to me as a researcher was the performance of the Federal Reserve in its early days , particularly the part played by the young U.S. central bank in the Great Depression of the 1930s .1
In honor of Willis 's important contribution to the design and creation of the Federal Reserve , I will speak today about the role of the Federal Reserve and of monetary factors more generally in the origin and propagation of the Great Depression .
Let me offer two caveats before I begin : First , as I mentioned , H. Parker Willis resigned from the Fed in 1922 , to take a post at Columbia University ; thus , he is not implicated in any of the mistakes that the Federal Reserve made in the late 1920s and early 1930s .
Second , the views I will express today are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System .
The number of people with personal memory of the Great Depression is fast shrinking with the years , and to most of us the Depression is conveyed by grainy , black - and - white images of men in hats and long coats standing in bread lines .
However , although the Depression was long ago -- October this year will mark the seventy - fifth anniversary of the famous 1929 stock market crash - - its influence is still very much with us .
In particular , the experience of the Depression helped forge a consensus that the government bears the important responsibility of trying to stabilize the economy and the financial system , as well as of assisting people affected by economic downturns .
Dozens of our most important government agencies and programs , ranging from social security ( to assist the elderly and disabled ) to federal deposit insurance ( to eliminate banking panics ) to the Securities and Exchange Commission ( to regulate financial activities ) were created in the 1930s , each a legacy of the Depression .
The impact that the experience of the Depression has had on views about the role of the government in the economy is easily understood when we recall the sheer magnitude of that economic downturn .
During the major contraction phase of the Depression , between 1929 and 1933 , real output in the United States fell nearly 30 percent .
During the same period , according to retrospective studies , the unemployment rate rose from about 3 percent to nearly 25 percent , and many of those lucky enough to have a job were able to work only part - time .
For comparison , between 1973 and 1975 , in what was perhaps the most severe U.S. recession of the World War II era , real output fell 3.4 percent and the unemployment rate rose from about 4 percent to about 9 percent .
Other features of the 1929 - 33 decline included a sharp deflation -- prices fell at a rate of nearly 10 percent per year during the early 1930s -- as well as a plummeting stock market , widespread bank failures , and a rash of defaults and bankruptcies by businesses and households .
The economy improved after Franklin D. Roosevelt 's inauguration in March 1933 , but unemployment remained in the double digits for the rest of the decade , full recovery arriving only with the advent of World War II .
Moreover , as I will discuss later , the Depression was international in scope , affecting most countries around the world not only the United States .
What caused the Depression ?
This question is a difficult one , but answering it is important if we are to draw the right lessons from the experience for economic policy .
Solving the puzzle of the Depression is also crucial to the field of economics itself because of the light the solution would shed on our basic understanding of how the economy works .
During the Depression years and for many decades afterward , economists disagreed sharply on the sources of the economic and financial collapse of the 1930s .
In contrast , during the past twenty years or so economic historians have come to a broad consensus about the causes of the Depression .
A widening of the geographic focus of Depression research deserves much of the credit for this breakthrough .
Before the 1980s , research on the causes of the Depression had considered primarily the experience of the United States .
This attention to the U.S. case was appropriate to some degree , as the U.S. economy was then , as it is today , the world 's largest ; the decline in output and employment in the United States during the 1930s was especially severe ; and many economists have argued that , to an important extent , the worldwide Depression began in the United States , spreading from here to other countries ( Romer , 1993 ) .
However , in much the same way that a medical researcher cannot reliably infer the causes of an illness by studying one patient , diagnosing the causes of the Depression is easier when we have more patients ( in this case , more national economies ) to study .
To explain the current consensus on the causes of the Depression , I will first describe the debate as it existed before 1980 , and then discuss how the recent focus on international aspects of the Depression and the comparative analysis of the experiences of different countries have helped to resolve that debate .
I have already mentioned the sharp deflation of the price level that occurred during the contraction phase of the Depression , by far the most severe episode of deflation experienced in the United States before or since .
Deflation , like inflation , tends to be closely linked to changes in the national money supply , defined as the sum of currency and bank deposits outstanding , and such was the case in the Depression .
Like real output and prices , the U.S. money supply fell about one - third between 1929 and 1933 , rising in subsequent years as output and prices rose .
While the fact that money , prices , and output all declined rapidly in the early years of the Depression is undeniable , the interpretation of that fact has been the subject of much controversy .
Indeed , historically , much of the debate on the causes of the Great Depression has centered on the role of monetary factors , including both monetary policy and other influences on the national money supply , such as the condition of the banking system .
Views have changed over time .
During the Depression itself , and in several decades following , most economists argued that monetary factors were not an important cause of the Depression .
For example , many observers pointed to the fact that nominal interest rates were close to zero during much of the Depression , concluding that monetary policy had been about as easy as possible yet had produced no tangible benefits to the economy .
The attempt to use monetary policy to extricate an economy from a deep depression was often compared to " pushing on a string . "
During the first decades after the Depression , most economists looked to developments on the real side of the economy for explanations , rather than to monetary factors .
Some argued , for example , that overinvestment and overbuilding had taken place during the ebullient 1920s , leading to a crash when the returns on those investments proved to be less than expected .
Another once - popular theory was that a chronic problem of " under - consumption " -- the inability of households to purchase enough goods and services to utilize the economy 's productive capacity -- had precipitated the slump .
However , in 1963 , Milton Friedman and Anna J. Schwartz transformed the debate about the Great Depression .
That year saw the publication of their now - classic book , A Monetary History of the United States , 1867 - 1960 .
The Monetary History , the name by which the book is instantly recognized by any macroeconomist , examined in great detail the relationship between changes in the national money stock -- whether determined by conscious policy or by more impersonal forces such as changes in the banking system -- and changes in national income and prices .
The broader objective of the book was to understand how monetary forces had influenced the U.S. economy over a nearly a century .
In the process of pursuing this general objective , however , Friedman and Schwartz offered important new evidence and arguments about the role of monetary factors in the Great Depression .
In contradiction to the prevalent view of the time , that money and monetary policy played at most a purely passive role in the Depression , Friedman and Schwartz argued that " the [ economic ] contraction is in fact a tragic testimonial to the importance of monetary forces " ( Friedman and Schwartz , 1963 , p. 300 ) .
To support their view that monetary forces caused the Great Depression , Friedman and Schwartz revisited the historical record and identified a series of errors -- errors of both commission and omission -- made by the Federal Reserve in the late 1920s and early 1930s .
According to Friedman and Schwartz , each of these policy mistakes led to an undesirable tightening of monetary policy , as reflected in sharp declines in the money supply .
Drawing on their historical evidence about the effects of money on the economy , Friedman and Schwartz argued that the declines in the money stock generated by Fed actions -- or inactions -- could account for the drops in prices and output that subsequently occurred .
2 Friedman and Schwartz emphasized at least four major errors by U.S. monetary policymakers .
The Fed 's first grave mistake , in their view , was the tightening of monetary policy that began in the spring of 1928 and continued until the stock market crash of October 1929 ( see Hamilton , 1987 , or Bernanke , 2002a , for further discussion ) .
This tightening of monetary policy in 1928 did not seem particularly justified by the macroeconomic environment :
The economy was only just emerging from a recession , commodity prices were declining sharply , and there was little hint of inflation .
Why then did the Federal Reserve raise interest rates in 1928 ?
The principal reason was the Fed 's ongoing concern about speculation on Wall Street .
Fed policymakers drew a sharp distinction between " productive " ( that is , good ) and " speculative " ( bad ) uses of credit , and they were concerned that bank lending to brokers and investors was fueling a speculative wave in the stock market .
When the Fed 's attempts to persuade banks not to lend for speculative purposes proved ineffective , Fed officials decided to dissuade lending directly by raising the policy interest rate .
The market crash of October 1929 showed , if anyone doubted it , that a concerted effort by the Fed can bring down stock prices .
But the cost of this " victory " was very high .
According to Friedman and Schwartz , the Fed 's tight - money policies led to the onset of a recession in August 1929 , according to the official dating by the National Bureau of Economic Research .
The slowdown in economic activity , together with high interest rates , was in all likelihood the most important source of the stock market crash that followed in October .
In other words , the market crash , rather than being the cause of the Depression , as popular legend has it , was in fact largely the result of an economic slowdown and the inappropriate monetary policies that preceded it .
Of course , the stock market crash only worsened the economic situation , hurting consumer and business confidence and contributing to a still deeper downturn in 1930 .
The second monetary policy action identified by Friedman and Schwartz occurred in September and October of 1931 .
At the time , as I will discuss in more detail later , the United States and the great majority of other nations were on the gold standard , a system in which the value of each currency is expressed in terms of ounces of gold .
Under the gold standard , central banks stood ready to maintain the fixed values of their currencies by offering to trade gold for money at the legally determined rate of exchange .
The fact that , under the gold standard , the value of each currency was fixed in terms of gold implied that the rate of exchange between any two currencies within the gold standard system was likewise fixed .
As with any system of fixed exchange rates , the gold standard was subject to speculative attack if investors doubted the ability of a country to maintain the value of its currency at the legally specified parity .
In September 1931 , following a period of financial upheaval in Europe that created concerns about British investments on the Continent , speculators attacked the British pound , presenting pounds to the Bank of England and demanding gold in return .
Faced with the heavy demands of speculators for gold and a widespread loss of confidence in the pound , the Bank of England quickly depleted its gold reserves .
Unable to continue supporting the pound at its official value , Great Britain was forced to leave the gold standard , allowing the pound to float freely , its value determined by market forces .
With the collapse of the pound , speculators turned their attention to the U.S. dollar , which ( given the economic difficulties the United States was experiencing in the fall of 1931 ) looked to many to be the next currency in line for devaluation .
Central banks as well as private investors converted a substantial quantity of dollar assets to gold in September and October of 1931 , reducing the Federal Reserve 's gold reserves .
The speculative attack on the dollar also helped to create a panic in the U.S. banking system .
Fearing imminent devaluation of the dollar , many foreign and domestic depositors withdrew their funds from U.S. banks in order to convert them into gold or other assets .
The worsening economic situation also made depositors increasingly distrustful of banks as a place to keep their savings .
During this period , deposit insurance was virtually nonexistent , so that the failure of a bank might cause depositors to lose all or most of their savings .
Thus , depositors who feared that a bank might fail rushed to withdraw their funds .
Banking panics , if severe enough , could become self - confirming prophecies .
During the 1930s , thousands of U.S. banks experienced runs by depositors and subsequently failed .
Long - established central banking practice required that the Fed respond both to the speculative attack on the dollar and to the domestic banking panics .
However , the Fed decided to ignore the plight of the banking system and to focus only on stopping the loss of gold reserves to protect the dollar .
To stabilize the dollar , the Fed once again raised interest rates sharply , on the view that currency speculators would be less willing to liquidate dollar assets if they could earn a higher rate of return on them .
The Fed 's strategy worked , in that the attack on the dollar subsided and the U.S. commitment to the gold standard was successfully defended , at least for the moment .
However , once again the Fed had chosen to tighten monetary policy despite the fact that macroeconomic conditions -- including an accelerating decline in output , prices , and the money supply - - seemed to demand policy ease .
The third policy action highlighted by Friedman and Schwartz occurred in 1932 .
By the spring of that year , the Depression was well advanced , and Congress began to place considerable pressure on the Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy .
The Board was quite reluctant to comply , but in response to the ongoing pressure the Board conducted open - market operations between April and June of 1932 designed to increase the national money supply and thus ease policy .
These policy actions reduced interest rates on government bonds and corporate debt and appeared to arrest the decline in prices and economic activity .
However , Fed officials remained ambivalent about their policy of monetary expansion .
Some viewed the Depression as the necessary purging of financial excesses built up during the 1920s ; in this view , slowing the economic collapse by easing monetary policy only delayed the inevitable adjustment .
Other officials , noting among other indicators the very low level of nominal interest rates , concluded that monetary policy was in fact already quite easy and that no more should be done .
These policymakers did not appear to appreciate that , even though nominal interest rates were very low , the ongoing deflation meant that the real cost of borrowing was very high because any loans would have to be repaid in dollars of much greater value ( Meltzer , 2003 ) .
Thus monetary policy was not in fact easy at all , despite the very low level of nominal interest rates .
In any event , Fed officials convinced themselves that the policy ease advocated by the Congress was not appropriate , and so when the Congress adjourned in July 1932 , the Fed reversed the policy .
By the latter part of the year , the economy had relapsed dramatically .
The fourth and final policy mistake emphasized by Friedman and Schwartz was the Fed 's ongoing neglect of problems in the U.S. banking sector .
As I have already described , the banking sector faced enormous pressure during the early 1930s .
As depositor fears about the health of banks grew , runs on banks became increasingly common .
A series of banking panics spread across the country , often affecting all the banks in a major city or even an entire region of the country .
Between December 1930 and March 1933 , when President Roosevelt declared a " banking holiday " that shut down the entire U.S. banking system , about half of U.S. banks either closed or merged with other banks .
Surviving banks , rather than expanding their deposits and loans to replace those of the banks lost to panics , retrenched sharply .
The banking crisis had highly detrimental effects on the broader economy .
Friedman and Schwartz emphasized the effects of bank failures on the money supply .
Because bank deposits are a form of money , the closing of many banks greatly exacerbated the decline in the money supply .
Moreover , afraid to leave their funds in banks , people hoarded cash , for example by burying their savings in coffee cans in the back yard .
Hoarding effectively removed money from circulation , adding further to the deflationary pressures .
Moreover , as I emphasized in early research of my own ( Bernanke , 1983 ) , the virtual shutting down of the U.S. banking system also deprived the economy of an important source of credit and other services normally provided by banks .
The Federal Reserve had the power at least to ameliorate the problems of the banks .
For example , the Fed could have been more aggressive in lending cash to banks ( taking their loans and other investments as collateral ) , or it could have simply put more cash in circulation .
Either action would have made it easier for banks to obtain the cash necessary to pay off depositors , which might have stopped bank runs before they resulted in bank closings and failures .
Indeed , a central element of the Federal Reserve 's original mission had been to provide just this type of assistance to the banking system .
The Fed 's failure to fulfill its mission was , again , largely the result of the economic theories held by the Federal Reserve leadership .
Many
Fed officials appeared to subscribe to the infamous " liquidationist " thesis of Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon , who argued that weeding out " weak " banks was a harsh but necessary prerequisite to the recovery of the banking system .
Moreover , most of the failing banks were relatively small and not members of the Federal Reserve System , making their fate of less interest to the policymakers .
In the end , Fed officials decided not to intervene in the banking crisis , contributing once again to the precipitous fall in the money supply .
Friedman and Schwartz discuss other episodes and policy actions as well , such as the Federal Reserve 's misguided tightening of policy in 1937 - 38 which contributed to a new recession in those years .
However , the four episodes I have described capture the gist of the Friedman and Schwartz argument that , for a variety of reasons , monetary policy was unnecessarily tight , both before the Depression began and during its most dramatic downward phase .
As I have mentioned , Friedman and Schwartz had produced evidence from other historical periods that suggested that contractionary monetary policies can lead to declining prices and output .
Friedman and Schwartz concluded therefore that they had found the smoking gun , evidence that much of the severity of the Great Depression could be attributed to monetary forces .
Friedman and Schwartz 's arguments were highly influential but not universally accepted .
For several decades after the Monetary History was published , a debate raged about the importance of monetary factors in the Depression .
Opponents made several objections to the Friedman and Schwartz thesis that are worth highlighting here .
First , critics wondered whether the tightening of monetary policy during 1928 and 1929 , though perhaps ill advised , was large enough to have led to such calamitous consequences .
3
If the tightening of monetary policy before the stock market crash was not sufficient to account for the violence of the economic downturn , then other , possibly nonmonetary , factors may need to be considered as well .
A second question is whether the large decline in the money supply seen during the 1930s was primarily a cause or an effect of falling output and prices .
As we have seen , Friedman and Schwartz argued that the decline in the money supply was causal .
Suppose , though , for the sake of argument , that the Depression was the result primarily of nonmonetary factors , such as overspending and overinvestment during the 1920s .
As incomes and spending decline , people need less money to carry out daily transactions .
In this scenario , critics pointed out , the Fed would be justified in allowing the money supply to fall , because it would only be accommodating a decline in the amount of money that people want to hold .
The decline in the money supply in this case would be a response to , not a cause of , the decline in output and prices .
To put the question simply , we know that both the economy and the money stock contracted rapidly during the early 1930s , but was the monetary dog wagging the economic tail , or vice versa ?
The focus of Friedman and Schwartz on the U.S. experience ( by design , of course ) raised other questions about their monetary explanation of the Depression .
As I have mentioned , the Great Depression was a worldwide phenomenon , not confined to the United States .
Indeed , some economies , such as that of Germany , began to decline before 1929 .
Although few countries escaped the Depression entirely , the severity of the episode varied widely across countries .
The timing of recovery also varied considerably , with some countries beginning their recovery as early as 1931 or 1932 , whereas others remained in the depths of depression as late as 1935 or 1936 .
How does Friedman and Schwartz 's monetary thesis explain the worldwide nature of the onset of the Depression , and the differences in severity and timing observed in different countries ?
That is where the debate stood around 1980 .
About that time , however , economic historians began to broaden their focus , shifting from a heavy emphasis on events in the United States during the 1930s to an increased attention to developments around the world .
Moreover , rather than studying countries individually , this new scholarship took a comparative approach , asking specifically why some countries fared better than others in the 1930s .
As I will explain , this research uncovered an important role for international monetary forces , as well as domestic monetary policies , in explaining the Depression .
Specifically , the new research found that a complete understanding of the Depression requires attention to the operation of the international gold standard , the international monetary system of the time .
4
As I have already mentioned , the gold standard is a monetary system in which each participating country defines its monetary unit in terms of a certain amount of gold .
The setting of each currency 's value in terms of gold defines a system of fixed exchange rates , in which the relative value of ( say ) the U.S. dollar and the British pound are fixed at a rate determined by the relative gold content of each currency .
To maintain the gold standard , central banks had to promise to exchange actual gold for their paper currencies at the legal rate .
The gold standard appeared to be highly successful from about 1870 to the beginning of World War I in 1914 .
During the so - called " classical " gold standard period , international trade and capital flows expanded markedly , and central banks experienced relatively few problems ensuring that their currencies retained their legal value .
The gold standard was suspended during World War I , however , because of disruptions to trade and international capital flows and because countries needed more financial flexibility to finance their war efforts .
( The United States remained technically on the gold standard throughout the war , but with many restrictions . )
After 1918 , when the war ended , nations around the world made extensive efforts to reconstitute the gold standard , believing that it would be a key element in the return to normal functioning of the international economic system .
Great Britain was among the first of the major countries to return to the gold standard , in 1925 , and by 1929 the great majority of the world 's nations had done so .
Unlike the gold standard before World War I , however , the gold standard as reconstituted in the 1920s proved to be both unstable and destabilizing .
Economic historians have identified a number of reasons why the reconstituted gold standard was so much less successful than its prewar counterpart .
First , the war had left behind enormous economic destruction and dislocation .
Major financial problems also remained , including both large government debts from the war and banking systems whose solvency had been deeply compromised by the war and by the periods of hyperinflation that followed in a number of countries .
These underlying problems created stresses for the gold standard that had not existed to the same degree before the war .
Second , the new system lacked effective international leadership .
During the classical period , the Bank of England , in operation since 1694 , provided sophisticated management of the international system , with the cooperation of other major central banks .
This leadership helped the system adjust to imbalances and strains ; for example , a consortium of central banks might lend gold to one of their number that was experiencing a shortage of reserves .
After the war , with Great Britain economically and financially depleted and the United States in ascendance , leadership of the international system shifted by default to the Federal Reserve .
Unfortunately , the fledgling Federal Reserve , with its decentralized structure and its inexperienced and domestically focused leadership , did not prove up to the task of managing the international gold standard , a task that lingering hatreds and disputes from the war would have made difficult for even the most - sophisticated institution .
With the lack of effective international leadership , most central banks of the 1920s and 1930s devoted little effort to supporting the overall stability of the international system and focused instead on conditions within their own countries .
Finally , the reconstituted gold standard lacked the credibility of its prewar counterpart .
Before the war , the ideology of the gold standard was dominant , to the point that financial investors had no doubt that central banks would find a way to maintain the gold values of their currencies no matter what the circumstances .
Because this conviction was so firm , speculators had little incentive to attack a major currency .
After the war , in contrast , both economic views and the political balance of power had shifted in ways that reduced the influence of the gold standard ideology .
For example , new labor - dominated political parties were skeptical about the utility of maintaining the gold standard if doing so increased unemployment .
Ironically , reduced political and ideological support for the gold standard made it more difficult for central banks to maintain the gold values of their currencies , as speculators understood that the underlying commitment to adhere to the gold standard at all costs had been weakened significantly .
Thus , speculative attacks became much more likely to succeed and hence more likely to occur .
With an international focus , and with particular attention to the role of the gold standard in the world economy , scholars have now been able to answer the questions regarding the monetary interpretation of the Depression that I raised earlier .
First , the existence of the gold standard helps to explain why the world economic decline was both deep and broadly international .
Under the gold standard , the need to maintain a fixed exchange rate among currencies forces countries to adopt similar monetary policies .
In particular , a central bank with limited gold reserves has no option but to raise its own interest rates when interest rates are being raised abroad ; if it did not do so , it would quickly lose gold reserves as financial investors transferred their funds to countries where returns were higher .
Hence , when the Federal Reserve raised interest rates in 1928 to fight stock market speculation , it inadvertently forced tightening of monetary policy in many other countries as well .
This tightening abroad weakened the global economy , with effects that fed back to the U.S. economy and financial system .
Other countries ' policies also contributed to a global monetary tightening during 1928 and 1929 .
For example , after France returned to the gold standard in 1928 , it built up its gold reserves significantly , at the expense of other countries .
The outflows of gold to France forced other countries to reduce their money supplies and to raise interest rates .
Speculative attacks on currencies also became frequent as the Depression worsened , leading central banks to raise interest rates , much like the Federal Reserve did in 1931 .
Leadership from the Federal Reserve might possibly have produced better international cooperation and a more appropriate set of monetary policies .
However , in the absence of that leadership , the worldwide monetary contraction proceeded apace .
The result was a global economic decline that reinforced the effects of tight monetary policies in individual countries .
The transmission of monetary tightening through the gold standard also addresses the question of whether changes in the money supply helped cause the Depression or were simply a passive response to the declines in income and prices .
Countries on the gold standard were often forced to contract their money supplies because of policy developments in other countries , not because of domestic events .
The fact that these contractions in money supplies were invariably followed by declines in output and prices suggests that money was more a cause than an effect of the economic collapse in those countries .
Perhaps the most fascinating discovery arising from researchers ' broader international focus is that the extent to which a country adhered to the gold standard and the severity of its depression were closely linked .
In particular , the longer that a country remained committed to gold , the deeper its depression and the later its recovery ( Choudhri and Kochin , 1980 ; Eichengreen and Sachs , 1985 ) .
The willingness or ability of countries to remain on the gold standard despite the adverse developments of the 1930s varied quite a bit .
A few countries did not join the gold standard system at all ; these included Spain ( which was embroiled in domestic political upheaval , eventually leading to civil war ) and China ( which used a silver monetary standard rather than a gold standard ) .
A number of countries adopted the gold standard in the 1920s but left or were forced off gold relatively early , typically in 1931 .
Countries in this category included Great Britain , Japan , and several Scandinavian countries .
Some countries , such as Italy and the United States , remained on the gold standard into 1932 or 1933 .
And a few diehards , notably the so - called gold bloc , led by France and including Poland , Belgium , and Switzerland , remained on gold into 1935 or 1936 .
If declines in the money supply induced by adherence to the gold standard were a principal reason for economic depression , then countries leaving gold earlier should have been able to avoid the worst of the Depression and begin an earlier process of recovery .
The evidence strongly supports this implication .
For example , Great Britain and Scandinavia , which left the gold standard in 1931 , recovered much earlier than France and Belgium , which stubbornly remained on gold .
As Friedman and Schwartz noted in their book , countries such as China - - which used a silver standard rather than a gold standard -- avoided the Depression almost entirely .
The finding that the time at which a country left the gold standard is the key determinant of the severity of its depression and the timing of its recovery has been shown to hold for literally dozens of countries , including developing countries .
This intriguing result not only provides additional evidence for the importance of monetary factors in the Depression , it also explains why the timing of recovery from the Depression differed across countries .
The finding that leaving the gold standard was the key to recovery from the Great Depression was certainly confirmed by the U.S. experience .
One of the first actions of President Roosevelt was to eliminate the constraint on U.S. monetary policy created by the gold standard , first by allowing the dollar to float and then by resetting its value at a significantly lower level .
The new President also addressed another major source of monetary contraction , the ongoing banking crisis .
Within days of his inauguration , Roosevelt declared a " bank holiday , " shutting down all the banks in the country .
Banks were allowed to reopen only when certified to be in sound financial condition .
Roosevelt pursued other measures to stabilize the banking system as well , such as the creation of a deposit insurance program .
With the gold standard constraint removed and the banking system stabilized , the money supply and the price level began to rise .
Between Roosevelt 's coming to power in 1933 and the recession of 1937 - 38 , the economy grew strongly .
I have only scratched the surface of the fascinating literature on the causes of the Great Depression , but it is time that I conclude .
Economists have made a great deal of progress in understanding the Great Depression .
Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz deserve enormous credit for bringing the role of monetary factors to the fore in their Monetary History .
However , expanding the research focus to include the experiences of a wide range of countries has both provided additional support for the role of monetary factors ( including the international gold standard ) and enriched our understanding of the causes of the Depression .
Some important lessons emerge from the story .
One lesson is that ideas are critical .
The gold standard orthodoxy , the adherence of some Federal Reserve policymakers to the liquidationist thesis , and the incorrect view that low nominal interest rates necessarily signaled monetary ease , all led policymakers astray , with disastrous consequences .
We should not underestimate the need for careful research and analysis in guiding policy .
Another lesson is that central banks and other governmental agencies have an important responsibility to maintain financial stability .
The banking crises of the 1930s , both in the United States and abroad , were a significant source of output declines , both through their effects on money supplies and on credit supplies .
Finally , perhaps the most important lesson of all is that price stability should be a key objective of monetary policy .
By allowing persistent declines in the money supply and in the price level , the Federal Reserve of the late 1920s and 1930s greatly destabilized the U.S. economy and , through the workings of the gold standard , the economies of many other nations as well .

We will try to answer the following questions :
Which should we focus on when first designing a product ?

How do they complement each other ?
What is the purpose of the two ?
I will begin by explaining the basic concepts , there are many results that can help to create a solution that is useful and enjoyable for customers .
With the definition alone , you may not be able to make a clear distinction between them .
L -et ’s get started 🙂
User Flow
Move around freely , how far can you go ?
What is a user flow ?
Unlike user journeys , user flows display the user interface or wireframe of each step .
It can help see through the process , and it ’s also a great tool to show developers how the product works .
The user flow is very similar to the user journey , but is more like a flowchart of screens .

We create flows after we have at least some sketches of the screens .
We also create them before handing them over to the developers .
User flows usually mark the clickable areas and connect them to the next screen design , which shows what happens when we click there .

Understanding the difference between user flow and user journey helps you better understand what your customers want and how they can improve the user experience .
When describing the user flow , consider the following :
What is important to the user ?
What is the user trying to achieve ?
What additional info does the user need to reach their goal ?
What will make the user keep going ?
What are the obstacles for the user to reach his final destination ?
By finding the answers to these questions , you can focus on designing a website that focuses on what the user needs to achieve their ultimate goal and how to do it most effectively .
On the other hand , user flow describes the actual ways users go – how to reach their goals within the product .
So it ’s more about an actual interaction than a potential interaction .

User Flows , in a nice , neat statement , is a set of steps a user takes to reach a meaningful goal .
They are used to communicate the intended flow of a user through a product or service ( this can be done through various pages of an app or website or through various processes in a service ) .
It can also be called a customer journey and refers to the scenarios in which the user interacts with the product .
Normally , the scenarios consist of 4 to 12 steps .
Its main function is to adopt and demonstrate the current and possible ways in which the user can interact with the product .

What is a user journey ?
We usually design user journeys for key user goals and determine how people will achieve those goals .
User Journey is the flow that users go through while they use your product .
We can also use the user journey map to address different feelings and thoughts of the users , so that we can later think about the design .
The user experience helps us to think in terms of processes rather than standalone screens when developing the product .
The user journey is the scenario in which the user interacts with both the products and the services of a company .
The user journey itself is a diagram on which no screens are displayed , only boxes and the information we collect .

The user journey usually consists of 4 to 12 steps and helps to develop a customer - oriented design approach .
Discover patterns by examining the behavior and interactions of your customers across multiple channels .
Understanding and analyzing these patterns can reveal important user touch points , pain points , ups and downs of experiences , intentions , and more .
Create a user journey card Understand who uses your website .
Create a customer personality to understand your user .
Conduct user searches .
Your research should focus on goals , motivation , pain points and context .
Plan the user journey .
Each user goal must be determined using your current website or application to identify any frustrations or obstacles .
The user journey describes the situations in which a customer would interact with a product – the steps that cover those interactions .
For example , the user may be directed to a login page for a browser - based app , followed by user onboarding tutorials .
User Journey indicates how a user can interact with a product .
If you ’ve set up Google Analytics for your website , a Behavior History and Goal History report is useful for mapping the User journey Map .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
About eight million Iraqis -- nearly a third of the population -- are without water , sanitation , food and shelter and need emergency aid , a report by two major relief agencies says .
Oxfam and the Non-Governmental Organization ( NGO ) Coordination Committee in Iraq have issued a briefing paper that says violence in Iraq is masking a humanitarian crisis that has worsened since the U.S. - led invasion in 2003 .
The paper , called " Rising to the Humanitarian Challenge in Iraq , " is the latest documentation of the misery faced by Iraqis .
" Eight million people are in urgent need of emergency aid ; that figure includes over two million who are displaced within the country , and more than two million refugees .
Many more are living in poverty , without basic services , and increasingly threatened by disease and malnutrition , " said the relief agencies ' report .
The population of Iraq is 26 million .
It said that not addressing the needs of Iraqis in urgent need of water , sanitation , food and shelter would further create more unrest in the country .
" Despite the constraints imposed by violence , the government of Iraq , the United Nations , and international donors can do more to deliver humanitarian assistance to reduce unnecessary suffering .
If people 's basic needs are left unattended , this will only serve to further destabilize the country . "
The report found that about 43 percent of Iraq 's population endure " absolute poverty , " and that more than half " are now without work . "

Child malnutrition rates have jumped from 19 percent before the invasion four years ago to 28 percent now , and there are two million internally displaced people , many of whom have no or little access to food rations .
The number of Iraqis " without access to adequate water supplies " is 70 percent , up from 50 percent since 2003 .
The country continues to suffer a " brain drain . "
While ending the warfare is the biggest priority , Iraq 's government , the coalition nations , U.N. agencies and international donors can do more to deal with this problem , the report said .
It made a number of recommendations including suggesting that those in need deserve greater help from local authorities , that households headed by widows need a payment increase and that there should be new I.D. cards to enable displaced people to get food rations .
The briefing paper also stressed that Iraqi security forces should be ordered not to " harm civilian life , property , or infrastructure , and should respect the population 's right to assistance . "
The relief groups called on countries not involved in the Iraq war to increase funding to the country .
" Since many humanitarian organizations will not accept money from governments engaged in the conflict , it is important that donors from other countries , such as Belgium , Canada , France , Germany , Sweden , and Switzerland , increase their funding for humanitarian action . " the report said .

All About Oxfam International • Iraq War • Iraq
America has been involved in wars large and small since before the founding of the nation .
The first such war , sometimes called Metacom ’s Rebellion or King Philip 's War , lasted 14 months and destroyed 14 towns .﻿﻿
The war , tiny by today 's standards , ended when Metacom ( the Pokunoket chief called " King Philip " by the English ) , was beheaded .
The most recent war , America 's engagement in Afghanistan , is the most protracted war in U.S. history .
A response to devastating coordinated terrorist attacks on American soil on Sept. 11 , 2001 , this war began the following month when the U.S. invaded Afghanistan in search of Taliban forces and members of al - Qaeda .
U.S. troops remain there to this day .
Wars over the years have changed dramatically , and American involvement in them has varied as well .
For example , many of the earliest American wars were fought on American soil .
Twentieth - century wars such as World Wars I and II , by contrast , were fought overseas ; few Americans on the homefront saw any type of direct engagement during these .
While the attack on Pearl Harbor during World War II and the attack on the World Trade Center in 2001 resulted in thousands of American deaths , the most recent war fought on American soil was the Civil War , which ended in 1865 .
Chart of Wars With American Involvement
In addition to the following named wars and conflicts , members of the American military ( and some civilians ) have played small but active roles in many other international conflicts over the years .
· Cosmetic giant fined for recruitment campaign · First big French firm to be convicted of racial bias
Part of the cosmetics giant L'Oréal was yesterday found guilty of racial discrimination after it sought to exclude non-white women from promoting its shampoo .
In a landmark case , the Garnier division of the beauty empire , along with a recruitment agency it employed , were fined € 30,000 ( £ 20,300 ) each after they recruited women on the basis of race .
The historic ruling - the first time a major company has been found guilty of systematic race discrimination in France - saw a senior figure at the agency given a three - month suspended prison sentence .
The French campaign group SOS Racisme brought the case against L'Oréal , the world 's largest cosmetics firm , over the campaign in 2000 .
Garnier France sought saleswomen to demonstrate the shampoo line Fructis Style in supermarkets outside Paris .
They sought young women to hand out samples and discuss hairstyling with shoppers .
In July 2000 , a fax detailing the profile of hostesses sought by L'Oréal stipulated women should be 18 to 22 , size 38 - 42 ( UK size 10 - 14 ) and " BBR " , the initials for bleu , blanc , rouge , the colours of the French flag .
Prosecutors argued that BBR , a shorthand used by the far right , was also a well - known code among employers to mean " white " French people and not those of north African , African and Asian backgrounds .
Christine Cassan , a former employee at Districom , a communications firm acting for Garnier , told the court her clients demanded white hostesses .
She said that when she had gone ahead and presented candidates " of colour " a superior in her own company had said she had " had enough of Christine and her Arabs " .
One woman working in the recruitment firm involved said foreign - sounding names or photos showing a candidate was of Moroccan , Algerian , Tunisian or other African origin would ensure candidates were eliminated .
Another said : " I once had a good woman candidate but she was non-white .
I had to ask someone to pretend that our list was full .
It was hard . "
One experienced candidate said she realised she was not eligible because she was of mixed race .
In a normal sample of women recruited for similar sales work , around 40 % would be non-white .
For the Fructis project , less than 4 % were of " non-European " origin .
SOS Racisme said hundreds of jobs had been subject to discrimination in the case .
Garnier and the recruitment company were initially acquitted last year , but the appeal court yesterday overturned the ruling .
A former Garnier head and a senior recruitment agency executive were acquitted .
Anti-racism campaigners in France hailed the ruling .
Racial discrimination in employment is a huge problem in France with a recent survey finding three out of four firms preferred white workers .
President Nicolas Sarkozy 's new justice minister , Rachida Dati , the first woman of north African origin to hold a ministerial post , has ruled that special departments in prosecutors ' offices should be set up to deal with race discrimination .
Samuel Thomas of SOS Racisme told the Guardian : " This ruling is an enormous victory for everyone currently suffering race discrimination in France .
It shows that economic interests cannot be put before the law and morality .
Companies here clearly thought that racism was in their financial interest . "
He said consumers of L'Oréal products in the UK and the US would be horrified to learn about the racial discrimination .
L'Oréal owns brands ranging from Lancôme to the Body Shop , which it bought last year .
It said yesterday it would immediately appeal against the decision , which it found " incomprehensible " .
" We believe that diversity and difference are a source of richness and we do not tolerate any form of racism or discrimination , " the statement said .
The company was hoping for an altogether different type of publicity in France this weekend when it created a special lipstick for the Paris wedding of Desperate Housewives ' star Eva Longoria to the French basketball player Tony Parker .
Century of beauty
L'Oréal was founded in 1907 by a French chemist who invented one of the first synthetic hair dyes .
It is the world 's biggest beauty products company and owns brands from Maybelline to Helena Rubinstein and the Body Shop .
In the 90s L'Oréal was hit by claims over past links to fascism , anti-semitism and the giving of jobs to Nazi collaborators after the second world war .
It went some way to satisfy its critics with a boardroom change and other measures .
Liliane Bettencourt , L'Oréal 's major shareholder , is the wealthiest woman in France .
Two years ago L'Oréal 's slogan was softened from " Because I 'm worth it " to " Because you 're worth it " after concerns in France that the original appeared too money - oriented .
In a moment we 've been waiting for since the first time we saw The Jetsons , the first flying car has finally gone on sale .
Just like the car George uses to drop off the kids , the Moller M200G Volantor is shaped like a saucer .
To avoid the need to pass FAA regulations , the civilian version of the Volantor is restricted to heights of 10 feet , but can travel as fast as 50 mph and fly for up to 90 minutes .
Military or rescue versions could be unencumbered by such limitations .
Depending on the number of orders , prices could be as low as $ 90,000 .

Moller , better known for the yet - to - reach - production Skycar , have already started work on the 67 orders received so far .
They envision uses including extreme off roading - the Volantor is unencumbered by any ground - based obstacles - or as a ferry between a yacht and the land .
In the long run , they 'd like to see the vehicle used as the ultimate congestion busting commuter .
Maximum payload is 250 pounds , so you 'll need to buy one for each adult member of the family .
The company is actively seeking military or government clients , who they suggest could use the vehicle for anything from skyscraper rescues to fire fighting .

MOLLER INTERNATIONAL LAUNCHES PRODUCTION OF JETSONS -LIKE GROUND-EFFECT
VEHICLE
Davis , CA , [ June 28 , 2007 ] — Moller International ( OTCBB : MLER ) has completed tooling and has begun producing parts for its Jetsons - like M200G volantor , a small airborne two passenger saucer - shaped vehicle that is designed to take - off and land vertically ( see www.moller.com).
The M200G is the size of a small automobile and is powered by eight of the Company 's Rotapower® rotary engines .
This vehicle is intended for operation continuously in " ground effect " up to approximately 10 feet altitude .
Dr. Moller calls the M200G , " the ultimate off - road vehicle " able to travel over any surface .
" It 's not a hovercraft , although its operation is just as easy .
You can speed over rocks , swampland , fences , or log infested waterways with ease because you 're not limited by the surface .
The electronics keep the craft stabilized at no more than 10 feet altitude , which places the craft within ground effect where extra lift is obtained from operating near the ground .
This lets you glide over terrain at 50 mph that would stop most other vehicles " he continued .
While the Company does not foresee the requirement for significant training or licensing to operate the vehicle , it is prepared to offer demonstration sessions in Davis , California once the vehicle is ready for market .
Production on the initial six airframes started earlier this week using hard - tooled molds with the capability of producing one fuselage per day .
Depending upon engine production volume the M200G price could start as low as $ 90,000 .
The key component in determining the M200G production price is the cost of its Rotapower® engines .
The Company is working with a strategic partner to produce this engine for a number of different applications in order to obtain the cost benefits of high volume production .
Persons interested in purchasing a M200G volantor may reserve a delivery position by making a refundable escrowed deposit .

Expanding rapidly as the nation ’s largest home mortgage company , Countrywide Home Loans quietly promised investors who bought its loans that it would repurchase some if homeowners got into financial difficulties .
But now that Countrywide itself is struggling , it may not be able to do so , making it even harder for troubled borrowers to reduce their interest rates or make other changes to their loans to avoid foreclosure .
The possibility that Countrywide may have to buy back mortgages that it sold comes on the heels of its announcement last week that the tightening credit markets had forced it to draw on its $ 11.5 billion line of credit from a consortium of banks , a move that sent the market plummeting .
But yesterday , Bank of America agreed to invest $ 2 billion in Countrywide , buying preferred shares that carry an interest rate of 7.25 percent and can be converted into common stock at $ 18 each .
" Sixteen thousand and twelve in this Centre , " Mr. Foster replied without hesitation .
He spoke very quickly , had a vivacious blue eye , and took an evident pleasure in quoting figures .
" Sixteen thousand and twelve ; in one hundred and eighty - nine batches of identicals .
But of course they 've done much better , " he rattled on , " in some of the tropical Centres .
Singapore has often produced over sixteen thousand five hundred ; and Mombasa has actually touched the seventeen thousand mark .
But then they have unfair advantages .
You should see the way a negro ovary responds to pituitary !
It 's quite astonishing , when you 're used to working with European material .
Still , " he added , with a laugh ( but the light of combat was in his eyes and the lift of his chin was challenging ) , " still , we mean to beat them if we can .
I 'm working on a wonderful Delta - Minus ovary at this moment .
Only just eighteen months old .
Over twelve thousand seven hundred children already , either decanted or in embryo .
And still going strong .
We 'll beat them yet . "
" That 's the spirit I like ! " cried the Director , and clapped Mr. Foster on the shoulder .
" Come along with us , and give these boys the benefit of your expert knowledge . "
Mr. Foster smiled modestly .
" With pleasure . "
They went .
In the Bottling Room all was harmonious bustle and ordered activity .
Flaps of fresh sow's peritoneum ready cut to the proper size came shooting up in little lifts from the Organ Store in the sub - basement .
Whizz and then , click !
the lift - hatches hew open ; the bottle - liner had only to reach out a hand , take the flap , insert , smooth - down , and before the lined bottle had had time to travel out of reach along the endless band , whizz , click !
another flap of peritoneum had shot up from the depths , ready to be slipped into yet another bottle , the next of that slow interminable procession on the band .
Next to the Liners stood the Matriculators .
The procession advanced ; one by one the eggs were transferred from their test - tubes to the larger containers ; deftly the peritoneal lining was slit , the morula dropped into place , the saline solution poured in … and already the bottle had passed , and it was the turn of the labellers .
Heredity , date of fertilization , membership of Bokanovsky Group–details were transferred from test - tube to bottle .
No longer anonymous , but named , identified , the procession marched slowly on ; on through an opening in the wall , slowly on into the Social Predestination Room .
" Eighty - eight cubic metres of card - index , " said Mr. Foster with relish , as they entered .
" Containing all the relevant information , " added the Director .
" Brought up to date every morning . "
" And co-ordinated every afternoon . "
" On the basis of which they make their calculations . "
" So many individuals , of such and such quality , " said Mr. Foster .
" Distributed in such and such quantities . "
" The optimum Decanting Rate at any given moment . "
" Unforeseen wastages promptly made good . "
" Promptly , " repeated Mr. Foster .
" If you knew the amount of overtime I had to put in after the last Japanese earthquake ! "
He laughed goodhumouredly and shook his head .
" The Predestinators send in their figures to the Fertilizers . "
" Who give them the embryos they ask for . "
" And the bottles come in here to be predestined in detail . "
" After which they are sent down to the Embryo Store . "
" Where we now proceed ourselves . "
And opening a door Mr. Foster led the way down a staircase into the basement .
The temperature was still tropical .
They descended into a thickening twilight .
Two doors and a passage with a double turn insured the cellar against any possible infiltration of the day .
" Embryos are like photograph film , " said Mr. Foster waggishly , as he pushed open the second door .
" They can only stand red light . "
And in effect the sultry darkness into which the students now followed him was visible and crimson , like the darkness of closed eyes on a summer 's afternoon .
The bulging flanks of row on receding row and tier above tier of bottles glinted with innumerable rubies , and among the rubies moved the dim red spectres of men and women with purple eyes and all the symptoms of lupus .
The hum and rattle of machinery faintly stirred the air .
" Give them a few figures , Mr. Foster , " said the Director , who was tired of talking .
Mr. Foster was only too happy to give them a few figures .
Two hundred and twenty metres long , two hundred wide , ten high .
He pointed upwards .
Like chickens drinking , the students lifted their eyes towards the distant ceiling .
Three tiers of racks : ground floor level , first gallery , second gallery .
The spidery steel - work of gallery above gallery faded away in all directions into the dark .
Near them three red ghosts were busily unloading demijohns from a moving staircase .
The escalator from the Social Predestination Room .
Each bottle could be placed on one of fifteen racks , each rack , though you could n't see it , was a conveyor traveling at the rate of thirty - three and a third centimetres an hour .
Two hundred and sixty - seven days at eight metres a day .
Two thousand one hundred and thirty - six metres in all .
One circuit of the cellar at ground level , one on the first gallery , half on the second , and on the two hundred and sixty - seventh morning , daylight in the Decanting Room .
Independent existence–so called .
" But in the interval , " Mr. Foster concluded , " we 've managed to do a lot to them .
Oh , a very great deal . "
His laugh was knowing and triumphant .
" That 's the spirit I like , " said the Director once more .
" Let 's walk around .
You tell them everything , Mr. Foster . "
Mr. Foster duly told them .
Told them of the growing embryo on its bed of peritoneum .
Made them taste the rich blood surrogate on which it fed .
Explained why it had to be stimulated with placentin and thyroxin .
Told them of the corpus luteum extract .
Showed them the jets through which at every twelfth metre from zero to 2040 it was automatically injected .
Spoke of those gradually increasing doses of pituitary administered during the final ninety - six metres of their course .
Described the artificial maternal circulation installed in every bottle at Metre 112 ; showed them the reservoir of blood - surrogate , the centrifugal pump that kept the liquid moving over the placenta and drove it through the synthetic lung and waste product filter .
Referred to the embryo's troublesome tendency to anæmia , to the massive doses of hog 's stomach extract and foetal foal 's liver with which , in consequence , it had to be supplied .
Showed them the simple mechanism by means of which , during the last two metres out of every eight , all the embryos were simultaneously shaken into familiarity with movement .
Hinted at the gravity of the so - called " trauma of decanting , " and enumerated the precautions taken to minimize , by a suitable training of the bottled embryo , that dangerous shock .
Told them of the test for sex carried out in the neighborhood of Metre 200 .
Explained the system of labelling–a T for the males , a circle for the females and for those who were destined to become freemartins a question mark , black on a white ground .
" For of course , " said Mr. Foster , " in the vast majority of cases , fertility is merely a nuisance .
One fertile ovary in twelve hundred –that would really be quite sufficient for our purposes .
But we want to have a good choice .
And of course one must always have an enormous margin of safety .
So we allow as many as thirty per cent of the female embryos to develop normally .
The others get a dose of male sex - hormone every twenty - four metres for the rest of the course .
Result : they 're decanted as freemartins –structurally quite normal ( except , " he had to admit , " that they do have the slightest tendency to grow beards ) , but sterile .
Guaranteed sterile .
Which brings us at last , " continued Mr. Foster , " out of the realm of mere slavish imitation of nature into the much more interesting world of human invention . "
He rubbed his hands .
For of course , they did n't content themselves with merely hatching out embryos : any cow could do that .
" We also predestine and condition .
We decant our babies as socialized human beings , as Alphas or Epsilons , as future sewage workers or future … "
He was going to say " future World controllers , " but correcting himself , said " future Directors of Hatcheries , " instead .
The D.H.C. acknowledged the compliment with a smile .
They were passing Metre 320 on Rack 11 .
A young Beta - Minus mechanic was busy with screw - driver and spanner on the blood - surrogate pump of a passing bottle .
The hum of the electric motor deepened by fractions of a tone as he turned the nuts .
Down , down … A final twist , a glance at the revolution counter , and he was done .
He moved two paces down the line and began the same process on the next pump .
" Reducing the number of revolutions per minute , " Mr. Foster explained .
" The surrogate goes round slower ; therefore passes through the lung at longer intervals ; therefore gives the embryo less oxygen .
Nothing like oxygen - shortage for keeping an embryo below par . "
Again he rubbed his hands .
" But why do you want to keep the embryo below par ? " asked an ingenuous student .
" Ass ! " said the Director , breaking a long silence .
" Has n't it occurred to you that an Epsilon embryo must have an Epsilon environment as well as an Epsilon heredity ? "
It evidently had n't occurred to him .
He was covered with confusion .
" The lower the caste , " said Mr. Foster , " the shorter the oxygen . "
The first organ affected was the brain .
After that the skeleton .
At seventy per cent of normal oxygen you got dwarfs .
At less than seventy eyeless monsters .
" Who are no use at all , " concluded Mr. Foster .
Whereas ( his voice became confidential and eager ) , if they could discover a technique for shortening the period of maturation what a triumph , what a benefaction to Society !
" Consider the horse . "
They considered it .
Mature at six ; the elephant at ten .
While at thirteen a man is not yet sexually mature ; and is only full - grown at twenty .
Hence , of course , that fruit of delayed development , the human intelligence .
" But in Epsilons , " said Mr. Foster very justly , " we do n't need human intelligence . "
Did n't need and did n't get it .
But though the Epsilon mind was mature at ten , the Epsilon body was not fit to work till eighteen .
Long years of superfluous and wasted immaturity .
If the physical development could be speeded up till it was as quick , say , as a cow's , what an enormous saving to the Community !
" Enormous ! " murmured the students .
Mr. Foster 's enthusiasm was infectious .
He became rather technical ; spoke of the abnormal endocrine co-ordination which made men grow so slowly ; postulated a germinal mutation to account for it .
Could the effects of this germinal mutation be undone ?
Could the individual Epsilon embryo be made a revert , by a suitable technique , to the normality of dogs and cows ?
That was the problem .
And it was all but solved .
Pilkington , at Mombasa , had produced individuals who were sexually mature at four and full - grown at six and a half .
A scientific triumph .
But socially useless .
Six - year - old men and women were too stupid to do even Epsilon work .
And the process was an all - or - nothing one ; either you failed to modify at all , or else you modified the whole way .
They were still trying to find the ideal compromise between adults of twenty and adults of six .
So far without success .
Mr. Foster sighed and shook his head .
Their wanderings through the crimson twilight had brought them to the neighborhood of Metre 170 on Rack 9 .
From this point onwards Rack 9 was enclosed and the bottle performed the remainder of their journey in a kind of tunnel , interrupted here and there by openings two or three metres wide .
" Heat conditioning , " said Mr. Foster .
Hot tunnels alternated with cool tunnels .
Coolness was wedded to discomfort in the form of hard X - rays .
By the time they were decanted the embryos had a horror of cold .
They were predestined to emigrate to the tropics , to be miner and acetate silk spinners and steel workers .
Later on their minds would be made to endorse the judgment of their bodies .
" We condition them to thrive on heat , " concluded Mr. Foster .
" Our colleagues upstairs will teach them to love it . "
" And that , " put in the Director sententiously , " that is the secret of happiness and virtue–liking what you 've got to do .
All conditioning aims at that : making people like their unescapable social destiny . "
In a gap between two tunnels , a nurse was delicately probing with a long fine syringe into the gelatinous contents of a passing bottle .
The students and their guides stood watching her for a few moments in silence .
" Well , Lenina , " said Mr. Foster , when at last she withdrew the syringe and straightened herself up .
The girl turned with a start .
One could see that , for all the lupus and the purple eyes , she was uncommonly pretty .
" Henry ! "
Her smile flashed redly at him–a row of coral teeth .
" Charming , charming , " murmured the Director and , giving her two or three little pats , received in exchange a rather deferential smile for himself .
" What are you giving them ? " asked Mr. Foster , making his tone very professional .
" Oh , the usual typhoid and sleeping sickness . "
" Tropical workers start being inoculated at Metre 150 , " Mr. Foster explained to the students .
" The embryos still have gills .
We immunize the fish against the future man 's diseases . "
Then , turning back to Lenina , " Ten to five on the roof this afternoon , " he said , " as usual . "
" Charming , " said the Director once more , and , with a final pat , moved away after the others .
On Rack 10 rows of next generation 's chemical workers were being trained in the toleration of lead , caustic soda , tar , chlorine .
The first of a batch of two hundred and fifty embryonic rocket - plane engineers was just passing the eleven hundred metre mark on Rack 3 .
A special mechanism kept their containers in constant rotation .
" To improve their sense of balance , " Mr. Foster explained .
" Doing repairs on the outside of a rocket in mid-air is a ticklish job .
We slacken off the circulation when they 're right way up , so that they 're half starved , and double the flow of surrogate when they 're upside down .
They learn to associate topsy - turvydom with well - being ; in fact , they 're only truly happy when they 're standing on their heads .
" And now , " Mr. Foster went on , " I 'd like to show you some very interesting conditioning for Alpha Plus Intellectuals .
We have a big batch of them on Rack 5 .
First Gallery level , " he called to two boys who had started to go down to the ground floor .
" They 're round about Metre 900 , " he explained .
" You can't really do any useful intellectual conditioning till the foetuses have lost their tails .
Follow me . "
But the Director had looked at his watch .
" Ten to three , " he said .
" No time for the intellectual embryos , I 'm afraid .
We must go up to the Nurseries before the children have finished their afternoon sleep . "
Mr. Foster was disappointed .
" At least one glance at the Decanting Room , " he pleaded .

A combination of coffee drinking and regular exercise may help to lower the risk of developing skin cancer , according to scientists in the US .
The two are thought to work together to kill off precancerous cells whose DNA has been damaged by ultraviolet - B radiation from the sun .
If the cells are left to divide , they can form malignant skin cancers and ultimately become fatal .
Rates of skin cancer in the UK have quadrupled for men and tripled for women in the past 25 years .
The disease is the fastest growing cancer in the UK , partly because more people are taking sunshine holidays abroad .
More than 8,000 cases of malignant melanoma , the most dangerous form of skin cancer , are diagnosed in the UK every year , leading to almost 2,000 deaths .
At least 75,000 cases of non-melanoma skin cancer , a much milder and less harmful disease , occur each year in the UK .
Previous studies have suggested that exercise and coffee may each play a small role in protecting against skin cancer , but the latest research shows for the first time that when combined , the two may offer far more protection .
Scientists led by Allan Conney at Rutgers University , New Jersey , examined the effect of ultraviolet light on mice bred to be hairless , and so particularly vulnerable to the effects of sunlight .
Four groups of mice were exposed to UV - B radiation , but were given different diets and exercise regimes .
One group drank caffeinated water , giving them a caffeine intake equivalent to one to two cups of coffee a day .
A second group was fed pure water but allowed to exercise on a running wheel .
The third group was given caffeine and access to a running wheel , while the fourth did no exercise and had no caffeine .
The scientists later took samples and checked for signs of UV - induced genetic damage .
They also looked for evidence of a natural survival mechanism called apoptosis , in which damaged and potentially cancerous cells are forced to commit suicide before they can form tumours .
The tests showed that caffeine alone led to a 95 % increase in programmed cell death and there was a 120 % increase from exercise alone .
But when combined , exercise and caffeine led to a four - fold increase in cell death , suggesting the body was able to rid itself of pre-cancerous cells much more effectively .
Details of the study appear in the US journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The team plans to investigate the underlying reasons for its findings before organising a clinical trial in humans .

Scientists at Carnegie Mellon University have discovered that our ears use the most efficient way to process the sounds we hear , from babbling brooks to wailing babies .
These results represent a significant advance in our understanding of how sound is encoded for transmission to the brain , according to the authors , whose work is published with an accompanying " News and Views " editorial in the Feb. 23 issue of Nature .
The research provides a new mathematical framework for understanding sound processing and suggests that our hearing is highly optimized in terms of signal coding -- the process by which sounds are translated into information by our brains -- for the range of sounds we experience .
The same work also has far - reaching , long - term technological implications , such as providing a predictive model to vastly improve signal processing for better quality compressed digital audio files and designing brain - like codes for cochlear implants , which restore hearing to the deaf .
To achieve their results , the researchers took a radically different approach to analyzing how the brain processes sound signals .
Abstracting from the neural code at the auditory nerve , they represented sound as a discrete set of time points , or a " spike code , " in which acoustic components are represented only in terms of their temporal relationship with each other .
That 's because the intensity and basic frequency of a given feature are essentially " kernalized , " or compressed mathematically , into a single spike .
This is similar to a player piano roll that can reproduce any song by recording what note to press when the spike code encodes any natural sound in terms of the precise timings of the elemental acoustic features .
Remarkably , when the researchers derived the optimal set of features for natural sounds , they corresponded exactly to the patterns observed by neurophysiologists in the auditory nerves .
" We 've found that timing of just a sparse number of spikes actually encodes the whole range of nature sounds , including components of speech such as vowels and consonants , and natural environment sounds like footsteps in a forest or a flowing stream , " said Michael Lewicki , associate professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon and a member of the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition ( CNBC ) .
" We found that the optimal code for natural sounds is the same as that for speech .
Oddly enough , cats share our own optimal auditory code for the English language . "
" Our work is the only research to date that efficiently processes auditory code as kernalized spikes , " said Evan Smith , a graduate student in psychology at the CNBC .
Until now , scientists and engineers have relied on Fourier transformations -- initially discovered 200 years ago -- to separate and re-constitute parameters like frequency and intensity as part of traditional sound signal processing .
" Our new signal processing framework appears far more efficient , effective and concise in conveying a rich variety of natural sounds than anything else , " Lewicki said .
The approach by Smith and Lewicki dissects sound based only on the timing of compressed " spikes " associated with vowels ( like cat vocalizations ) , consonants ( like rocks hitting one another ) and sibilants ( ambient noise ) .
To gather sounds for their research , the scientists traipsed through the woods and recorded cracking branches , crunching leaves and wind rustling through leaves before returning to the laboratory to de-code the information contained in this rich set of sounds .
They also discovered what they consider the most " natural " sound : if they play back a random set of spikes , it sounds like running water .
" We 're very excited about this work because we can give a simple theoretical account of the auditory code which predicts how we could optimize signal processing to one day allow for much more efficient data storage on everything from DVDs to iPods , " Lewicki said .
" For instance , if we could use a cochlear implant to ' talk ' to the auditory nerve in a more natural way via our discovered coding , then we could quite possibly design implants that would convey sounds to the brain that are much more intelligible , " he said .

Circumcision of Children
E DITOR — We are all adult men who believe that we have been harmed by circumcision carried out in childhood by doctors in Britain .
We are concerned about the ethics of this surgery on children and that it is commonly carried out when it is not essential .
We have read the BMA 's ethical guidelines which give no guidance to practitioners who are faced with a boy who has been referred for circumcision .
1
The possible future wishes of the patient should be considered .
Although it was shown 28 years ago that preputial development continues to the age of 17 and that only three of 1968 boys needed surgery , 2 many British doctors still seem to be ignorant of this research .
3
The European charter for children in hospital states that every child must be protected from unnecessary medical treatment .
The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child states that children have rights to self determination , dignity , respect , integrity , and non-interference and the right to make informed personal decisions .
Unnecessary circumcision of boys violates these rights .
A non-retractile foreskin in a boy can be managed conservatively .
4,5 Circumcision should therefore rarely be necessary .
It would be helpful if paediatric urologists could produce guidelines to advise doctors how foreskin problems can be managed .
Preferably , circumcisions should not be done until the patient is adult or at least old enough to understand what is intended ; then he has a right to a full , illustrated explanation of the nature of the operation and the reasons for it in advance , with the opportunity to ask questions , and help in coming to terms with the alteration of his anatomy afterwards .
If the patient is not satisfied with the explanations his views should be taken into consideration .
It can not be ethical for a doctor to amputate normal tissue from a normal child .
In the case of disease , circumcision should be used only when there is evidence that conservative treatment is unlikely to be effective or that is it has failed .
Avoiding surgery may be cheaper for purchasers of health care .
Doctors should approach the child 's foreskin with a combination of good ethics , a recognition of the rights of children .
and advice based on evidence .

There is perhaps no greater act of denial in modern life than sticking a plug into an electric outlet .
No thinking person can eat a hamburger without knowing it was once a cow , or drink water from the tap without recognizing , at least dimly , that its journey began in some distant reservoir .
Electricity is different .
Fully sanitized of any hint of its origins , it pours out of the socket almost like magic .
In his new book , Jeff Goodell breaks the spell with a single number : 20 .
That 's how many pounds of coal each person in the United States consumes , on average , every day to keep the electricity flowing .
Despite its outdated image , coal generates half of our electricity , far more than any other source .
Demand keeps rising , thanks in part to our appetite for new electronic gadgets and appliances ; with nuclear power on hold and natural gas supplies tightening , coal 's importance is only going to increase .
As Goodell puts it , " our shiny white iPod economy is propped up by dirty black rocks . "
Coal has become near - synonymous with electricity because it is cheap and abundant .
A pile of coal containing one million B.T.U.'s worth of energy costs $ 1.70 .
The equivalent amount of natural gas runs about $ 9 .
All electricity looks the same , so why pay more ?
Even by Goodell 's explicitly conservative estimates , America has enough coal to keep its power plants humming for decades to come .
And compared with prospecting for oil , finding the black rock is a snap .
In Wyoming 's Powder River basin the coal seams run 50 to 100 feet thick and lie so close to the surface they can be scoured in open - pit mines .
Unfortunately , coal is also dirty and dangerous .
One of the highlights of " Big Coal " is Goodell 's outraged account of the catastrophic 2002 flooding of a mine in Quecreek , Pa. , run by PBS Coals .
His story follows Randy Fogle and Blaine Mayhugh , two of nine workers who survived .
Mayhugh , shattered by the experience , left to become a maintenance engineer at a wind farm .
Fogle , who came from a long line of miners , returned to the work that had already taken the lives of his grandfather and his wife 's grandfather .
PBS Coals eventually paid a $ 14,100 fine for negligence that may have triggered the accident while receiving more than $ 500,000 from the state for costs associated with the rescue operation .
The United States , Israel and the European Union consider Hamas , which seeks Israel ’s destruction , a terrorist group .
But it may be very difficult for the United States and the European Union to stop aiding the 1.5 million Palestinians in Gaza , no matter who their rulers , and divert all aid through Mr. Abbas , who would have little influence in Gaza .
Some on the Israeli right suggest Gaza is lost and should be treated like southern Lebanon , where Hezbollah rules another kind of mini , semi-state .
But some Palestinians believe that Fatah and Hamas may also come together again .
Mr. Abbas says the emergency government will rule until new elections are possible — but Hamas will not accept early elections .
And it may be that another Arab government , like Egypt or Saudi Arabia , will soon step in to try to patch together the nascent Palestinian state , which is in danger of collapsing .
Palestinians are unlikely to want to give up the idea of a Palestinian nation in both areas , with East Jerusalem as its capital .
And Hamas has a significant number of followers in the West Bank , too , even if its fighters are far less well equipped and largely stay underground because of the Israeli occupation .
Hamas argues that it has purged the security forces of “ corrupted elements ” who were in league with Israel and the United States to harm the group .
Hamas wants a restored unity government where the security forces would all report to the interior minister , effectively meaning Fatah would give up much of its remaining power .
In Gaza , Hamas began to settle scores .
Its men executed a senior Fatah commander in the north , Samih al - Madhoun , who had vowed on the radio to kill scores of Hamas members .
He was captured in an exchange of fire , brought to the house of a Hamas fighter killed in the exchange and executed , Hamas said .

More evident was the lack of Fatah leaders or commanders on the ground .
The Gaza strongman Muhammad Dahlan , the former chief of Gaza ’s Preventive Security who is now Mr. Abbas ’s national security adviser , has been abroad for weeks for medical treatment .
He returned to Ramallah on Thursday .
His close ally , Gen. Rashid Abu Shbak , another former Preventive Security chief , is also outside the Gaza Strip , and the current Preventive Security head , Yussef Issa , was nowhere to be seen as the compound fell .

HALF of all women would lie to their husbands or partners to keep their relationship going if they became pregnant by another man , a survey said today .
Figures showed one woman in two would not tell her man that the baby she was carrying was not his - if she wanted to stay with him .
They also said four out of ten ( 42 % ) would lie about contraception in order to get pregnant , in spite of the wishes of their partner .
The new survey of women 's attitudes to truth , relationships , and behaviour , said the overwhelming majority ( 96 % ) admit to lying .
Almost half ( 45 % ) of the 5,000 questioned told the researchers for That 's Life !
magazine they tell " little white lies " most days .
The favourite fib told by women was " Of course you do n't look fat " with " These shoes were only é10 " in second place .
One bizarre finding was that a third of women ( 33 % ) said they would stay with their husband if they found out he was a " secret transvestite " , but only half that number ( 17 % ) would put up with him if he refused to wash .
The National Scruples and Lies Survey 2004 also found plenty of porkies were told over the Christmas period .
Eight in ten ( 78 % ) would pass off a second - hand gift as a brand new present , while 50 % have claimed a festive card was " lost in the post " .
Feelings
Jo Checkley , editor of That 's Life !
magazine , said : " Modern women just can't stop lying , but they do it to stop hurting other people 's feelings .
" It could be argued that these little white lies simply make the world go round a little more smoothly .
" But to tell a man a baby is his when it 's not or to deliberately get pregnant when your partner does n't want a baby is playing Russian roulette with other people 's lives . "
Eight out of ten women ( 83 % ) admit to telling " big , life - changing lies " , with 13 % saying they do so frequently .
Partners ( 70 % ) are most likely to be lied to by women , with friends ( 65 % ) , parents ( 64 % ) , customers and clients ( 58 % ) and bosses ( 57 % ) also being deceived .
Women will also lie to save people 's feelings , with only 27 % saying they would tell a man if he was hopeless in bed ( although 36 % would tell their friends all about it ) .
Meanwhile 54 % would flatter a man if he asked them about his looks and only 46 % would give the " brutal truth " .
Despite this , most women ( 61 % ) want their partners to be " brutally honest " if they ask them " Do I look fat ? " or " Do you think my best friend 's attractive ? "
Elsewhere the survey showed women 's sweet teeth could often override their honesty , with more than half ( 54 % ) admitting to stealing sweets or chocolates .
Six out of ten ( 57 % ) admitted to stealing something , while one in four had taken from their parents .
A quarter ( 23 % ) would " sneak a bottle or two " home if they were invited to a party by a well - off friend .
Half ( 49 % ) would " kiss and tell " to the media for é25,000 if they had a one - night stand with a celebrity , and 38 % say they would marry purely for money .
23 % would allow their man to sleep with another woman for é50,000 .
Meanwhile , some 79 % have got drunk at the office Christmas party , while a third admit to " getting off with someone they do n't fancy " and 5 % have ended up having sex with the boss .
An alarming 31 % of all women say they would not tell a future partner if they had a sexual disease .
This rises for 65 % for single women .
Sex
Nearly half ( 46 % ) fake orgasms and more than half ( 55 % ) claim they are tired , have a headache , or feel ill to " get out of lovemaking " .
A fifth of women with a long - term partner ( 19 % ) say they have cheated on him by having an affair , while 30 % of all women have had an affair with a married man .
Most women ( 68 % ) do not trust their partner .
Members of the Royal Family come behind showbiz stars in terms of their integrity as far as many of those questioned are concerned .
The Queen comes only fourth in a list of famous women with " the most honest face " , behind This Morning presenter Fern Britton in first , singer Kerry Katona ( formerly McFadden ) , and even The X Factor 's Sharon Osbourne .
The " most honest male face " was jointly allocated to Ant and Dec , presenters of I'm A Celebrity ... Get Me Out Of Here ! , with Prince William beaten into second .
* The survey questioned 5,000 women , average age 38 , across England , Wales , Scotland , and Northern Ireland .
The statue dates to the early period of Hadrian 's reign
In pictures
The original statue would have stood 4 m - 5 m in height , experts estimate .
His achievements include the massive wall built across the width of northern Britain which bears his name .
Ruling Rome from AD117 to AD138 , he was known as a great military administrator and is one of the so - called " five good emperors " .
So far , the excavators have unearthed the head , foot and part of a leg .
But they are hopeful other parts of the statue may be uncovered in coming weeks .
The foot is 80 cm ( 31.5 ins ) long ; the leg - from just above the knee to the ankle - is nearly 70 cm ( 27ins ) long .
The head , which is almost intact save for its broken nose , also measures 70 cm ( 27 ins ) .
' Beautiful depiction '
The pieces of this giant monument to Hadrian were found about 5 m below ground , among the buried ruins of a bath house on the site of Sagalassos , an ancient mountaintop town in southern Turkey .
The statue dates to the early part of Hadrian 's reign .
The elaborate decoration on the sandal suggest he was depicted in military garb .
The statue is buried about 5 m below the ground

Marc Waelkens , director of the excavation , said this was one of the " most beautiful depictions " of the emperor ever found .
Born in AD76 into a well - to - do family in Italica , near modern Seville , Spain , Hadrian presided over a period of relative peace and prosperity in the Roman Empire .
He erected permanent fortifications along the empire 's borders in order to consolidate Roman power .
The northernmost extent of this frontier is still standing : Hadrian 's Wall runs across the width of northern Britain , from Wallsend to the Solway Firth .
It was built to repel attacks by Caledonian tribes .
Imperial cult
The bath house in which the statue was found was destroyed by a major earthquake sometime between the late sixth and early seventh centuries AD .
The statue was originally created in pieces , which were then slotted into place to create an imposing monument to the emperor .
It is these constituent parts that are now lying on the floor of the wrecked bath house : when the building collapsed , the statue fell apart along its joins .
Hadrian 's
Wall runs all the way from Wallsend to the Solway Firth
The inhabitants of Sagalassos had special affection for Hadrian .
He officially recognised it as the " first city " of the Roman province of Pisidia and made it the centre for an official cult in the region which worshipped the emperor .
These administrative changes attracted thousands of visitors during imperial festivals , boosted trade and , in turn , prosperity .
" As a kind of thanks to the emperor , there were private and public monuments to Hadrian erected throughout the city , " Marc Waelkens told the BBC News website .
A sanctuary , or temple , to Hadrian was built in the southern part of Sagalassos .
And in a monumental fountain next to the bath house , archaeologists have found part of a gilded bronze statue of the emperor , paid for by one of Sagalassos ' most prominent families .
Fruits , Veggies Not as Vitamin - Rich as in Past , Says New Data
March 1 , 2006  --
Fruits and veggies are n't what they used to be , new data suggests .
Of the 13 major nutrients found in fruits and vegetables , six have declined substantially , according to a study by Donald Davis , a biochemist at the University of Texas at Austin .
Using data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture , Davis concludes that recently grown crops have shown decreases of up to 38 percent in protein , calcium , vitamin C , phosphorus , iron and riboflavin when compared with produce from past decades .
What accounts for this negative trend ?
Like any other competitive industry , farmers ' attempts to drive up profits have led them to use new techniques to increase production , Davis said .
The faster - grown fruits do n't have as much time to develop the nutrients .
" Farmers get paid by the weight of a crop , not by amount of nutrients , " Davis said .
He called this the " dilution effect " :
As fruits and vegetables grown in the United States become larger and more plentiful , they provide fewer vitamins and minerals .
" It 's a simple inverse relationship :
The higher the yield , the lower the nutrients , " he said .
Davis said this happens because slower - growing crops have more time to absorb nutrients from both the sun and the soil .
" Lots of agricultural scientists do n't know about this , and the public does n't know about this , " he said .
Wheat Also Being Examined
Jeff Cronin , at the Center for Science in the Public Interest , said scientists and the USDA often overlook farming practices .
" Breeding plants to improve crop yield at the expense of all other things seems to be the problem , as well as depleting soil and not rotating crops properly , " he said .
While Davis is not pleased about the decreasing levels of nutrients in produce , he still encourages people to eat plenty of fruits and vegetables .
" Even though amounts of nutrients have declined , fruits and vegetables are still the richest source of protective nutrients , much better than eating highly refined foods such as white flour , sugars and fatty foods , " he said .
Davis is currently researching the dilution effect in 14 varieties of wheat .
His findings already suggest that , once again , the larger the yield of wheat , the lower the nutrients .

GEOFFREY MILLER is a man with a theory that , if true , will change the way people think about themselves .
His idea is that the human brain is the anthropoid equivalent of the peacock 's tail .
In other words , it is an organ designed to attract the opposite sex .
Of course , brains have many other functions , and the human brain shares those with the brains of other animals .
But Dr Miller , who works at the University of New Mexico , thinks that mental processes which are uniquely human , such as language and the ability to make complicated artefacts , evolved originally for sexual display .
One important difference between peacocks ' tails and human minds , of course , is that the peahen 's accoutrement is a drab affair .
No one could say the same of the human female psyche .
That , Dr Miller believes , is because people , unlike peafowl , bring up their offspring in families where both sexes are involved in parenting .
It thus behoves a man to be as careful about choosing his wife as a woman is about choosing her husband .
Both sexes , therefore , have reason to show off .
But men and women will have different criteria for making their choices , and so the sexual - display sides of their minds may differ in detail .
Testing this hypothesis will be a long haul .
But in a paper he has just published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology , in collaboration with Vladas Griskevicius of Arizona State University , Dr Miller goes some way towards it .
He , Dr Griskevicius and their colleagues look into two activities — conspicuous consumption and altruism towards strangers — to see if these support the “ mating mind ” hypothesis , as Dr Miller has dubbed his idea .
Their conclusion is that they do .
Things are seldom what they seem
Altruism , according to the text books , has two forms .
One is known technically as kin selection , and familiarly as nepotism .
This spreads an individual 's genes collaterally , rather than directly , but is otherwise similar to his helping his own offspring .
The second form is reciprocal altruism , or “ you scratch my back and I 'll scratch yours ” .
It relies on trust , and a good memory for favours given and received , but is otherwise not much different from simultaneous collaboration ( such as a wolf pack hunting ) in that the benefit exceeds the cost for all parties involved .
Humans , however , show a third sort of altruism — one that has no obvious pay - off .
This is altruism towards strangers , for example , charity .
That may enhance reputation .
But how does an enhanced reputation weigh in the Darwinian balance ?
To investigate this question , the researchers made an interesting link .
At first sight , helping charities looks to be at the opposite end of the selfishness spectrum from conspicuous consumption .
Yet they have something in common : both involve the profligate deployment of resources .
That is characteristic of the consequences of sexual selection .
An individual shows he ( or she ) has resources to burn — whether those are biochemical reserves , time or , in the human instance , money — by using them to make costly signals .
That demonstrates underlying fitness of the sort favoured by evolution .
Viewed this way , both conspicuous consumption and what the researchers call “ blatant benevolence ” are costly signals .
And since they are behaviours rather than structures , and thus controlled by the brain , they may be part of the mating mind .
There is , of course , a lot of evidence for the first part of this conjecture .
Everybody knows that fast cars attract fast women .
The second , though , may come as a surprise .
So the team did an experiment to compare them .
They divided a bunch of volunteers into two groups .
Those in one were put into what the researchers hoped would be a “ romantic mindset ” by being shown pictures of attractive members of the opposite sex .
They were each asked to write a description of a perfect date with one of these people .
The unlucky members of the other group were shown pictures of buildings and told to write about the weather .
The participants were then asked two things .
The first was to imagine they had $ 5,000 in the bank .
They could spend part or all of it on various luxury items such as a new car , a dinner party at a restaurant or a holiday in Europe .
They were also asked what fraction of a hypothetical 60 hours of leisure time during the course of a month they would devote to volunteer work .
The results were just what the researchers hoped for .
In the romantically primed group , the men went wild with the Monopoly money .
Conversely , the women volunteered their lives away .
Those women continued , however , to be skinflints , and the men remained callously indifferent to those less fortunate than themselves .
Meanwhile , in the other group there was little inclination either to profligate spending or to good works .
Based on this result , it looks as though the sexes do , indeed , have different strategies for showing off .
Moreover , they do not waste their resources by behaving like that all the time .
Only when it counts sexually are men profligate and women helpful .
That result was confirmed by the second experiment which , instead of looking at the amount of spending and volunteering , looked at how conspicuous it was .
After all , there is little point in producing a costly signal if no one sees it .
As predicted , romantically primed men wanted to buy items that they could wear or drive , rather than things to be kept at home .
Their motive , therefore , was not mere acquisitiveness .
Similarly , romantically primed women volunteered for activities such as working in a shelter for the homeless , rather than spending an afternoon alone picking up rubbish in a park .
For both sexes , however , those in an unromantic mood were indifferent to the public visibility of their choices .
These two studies support the idea , familiar from everyday life , that what women want in a partner is material support while men require self - sacrifice .
Conspicuous consumption allows men to demonstrate the former .
Blatant benevolence allows women to demonstrate the latter .
There is , however , a confounding observation .
The most blatant benevolence of all , that of billionaires giving away their fortunes and heroes giving away ( or at least risking ) their lives , is almost entirely a male phenomenon .
To examine this , the team did another experiment .
They found that when requests for benevolence were financial , rather than time - consuming , romantically primed men were happy to chip in extravagantly .
Giving money to charity is thus more akin to conspicuous consumption than it is to blatant benevolence .
The primed men were also willing ( or at least said they were willing ) to act heroically as well as spend — but only if the action suggested was life - threatening .
Women , romantically primed or not , were n't .
Heroism , of course , is a pretty high - risk strategy .
But if you survive , you really have proved the quality of your genes .
As the old saw has it , faint heart never won fair lady .
On the other hand a soft heart , it appears , wins a gentleman .

" Comfortable ” -- that is -- with saying about Iraq , again quoting the President , " stay ... longer . "
And there it is , Sir .
We 've caught you .
Your goal is not to bring some troops home -- maybe -- if we let you have your way now ;
Your goal is not to set the stage for eventual withdrawal ;
You are , to use your own disrespectful , tone - deaf word , playing at getting the next Republican nominee to agree to jump into this bottomless pit with you , and take us with him , as we stay in Iraq for another year , and another , and another , and anon .
Everything you said about Iraq yesterday , and everything you will say , is a deception , for the purpose of this one cynical , unacceptable , brutal goal -- perpetuating this war indefinitely .
War today , war tomorrow , war forever !
And you are playing at it !
Playing !
A man with any self - respect , having inadvertently revealed such an evil secret , would have already resigned and fled the country !
You have no remaining credibility about Iraq , Sir .
snip
While the reality is , we know from what he told Draper , that the President 's true hope is that they will not come home ; but that they will stay there , because he is keeping them there now , in hope that those from his political party fighting to succeed him , will prolong this unendurable disaster into the next decade .
snip
As if , Sir , you listened to all the " calm assessments " of our military commanders -- rather than firing the ones who dared say The Emperor Has No Clothes , and The President , No Judgment ;
As if , Sir , your entire presidency was not a " nervous reaction " , and you yourself , nothing but a Washington politician ;
As if , Sir , " the media " does not largely divide into those parts your minions are playing , and those others who unthinkingly and uncritically serve as your echo chamber , at a time when the nation 's future may depend on the airing of dissent .
And as if , Sir , those polls were not so overwhelming , and not so clearly reflective of the nation 's agony ... and the nation 's insistence .
But this President has ceased to listen .
snip ---
In the context of all that … now , consider … these next 500 days .
Mr. Bush , our presence in Iraq must end .
Even if it means your resignation .
Even if it means your impeachment .
Even if it means a different Republican to serve out your term .
Even if it means a Democratic Congress -- and those true Patriots among the Republicans -- standing up and denying you another ** penny ** for Iraq , other than for the safety and the safe conduct home of our troops .
This country cannot run the risk of what you can still do to this country ... in the next 500 days …
Not while you , Sir ... are playing .
This is “ Good Night Kids ” TV - show , one of the most popular and the oldest kids tv - show in Russia , back since Soviet Times .
It ’s being conducted by a lady surrounded with two or three moving and speaking dolls .
Since 2003 there is Miss Universe 2002 Oxana Fedorova works on constant basis .
But less people and kids know how the show is being made .
It stays so since its early time of Soviet television , still stays unchanged .
On the photo below you can see how do they animate the dolls .
If you could n’t make it to Cool Britannia ( otherwise known as London ) for the launch of the Kate Moss for TopShop capsule , then we have the next best thing – video footage .
Shot by a keen - eyed observer you the video captures the mass crowds along with plenty of interviews , Miss Moss ’ fleeting window appearance , and the general feeling of something quite large taking place .
Harry Reid created a frenzied storm amongst the Beltway bloviators when he made these remarks :
" This is the message I took to the president , " Reid said at a news conference .
" Now I believe myself ... that this war is lost , and that the surge is not accomplishing anything , as indicated by the extreme violence in Iraq yesterday , " said Reid , of Nevada .
" I know I was like the odd guy out yesterday at the White House , but at least I told him what he needed to hear , not what he wanted to hear , " he added ....
Reid said he did not think more U.S. troops could help .
" I think it 's failed , I say that without any question , " he said of the troop increase .
Some have questioned his rhetoric and his choice of words , calling it a gaffe .
But what if Reid had carefully chosen his words ?
What if his intention was to spur debate , or even further , to forward the debate beyond the question of this supplemental funding bill and the squabbling over it ?
The situation we face now is , as Paul Krugman describes in his NYT column tomorrow :
a hostage situation , in which a beleaguered President Bush , barricaded in the White House , is threatening dire consequences for innocent bystanders — the troops — if his demands are n’t met ....
The whole situation brings to mind what Abraham Lincoln said , in his great Cooper Union speech in 1860 , about secessionists who blamed the critics of slavery for the looming civil war : " A highwayman holds a pistol to my ear , and mutters through his teeth , ‘ Stand and deliver , or I shall kill you , and then you will be a murderer ! ’ "
Perhaps what Reid is doing is trying to create awareness that President Bush is holding our troops hostage in Iraq for a lost cause , the Iraq war .
Harry Reid obviously can read a poll .
And the polls are saying , as William Schneider points out ( via Atrios ) , that the American people want the occupation of Iraq to end .
SCHNEIDER : Do Americans believe the U.S. is winning the war in Iraq ?
Last month they said no by better than two to one .
Do Americans believe the U.S. will win ?
No. Do Americans believe the U.S. can win ?
The public is split .
They 're not sure .
So Reid said -- REID : But there 's still a chance to change course and we must change course .
SCHNEIDER : Which side does the public take in this standoff ?
It 's not even close .
Sixty percent of Americans say they side with the Democrats in Congress , thirty - seven percent with the president .
Harry Reid knows this , and is laying the groundwork for the inevitable confrontation with Bush over Iraq .
As Krugman says :
Everyone talks about the political risks of confrontation , recalling the backlash when Newt Gingrich shut down the federal government in 1995 .
But there ’s a big difference between trying to force a fairly popular president to accept deep cuts in Medicare — which is what the 1995 confrontation was about — and trying to get a deeply unpopular , distrusted president to set some limits on an immensely unpopular war .
Meanwhile , there are big political risks on the other side .
If Congress responds to a presidential veto by offering an even weaker bill , voters may well react with disgust , concluding that the whole debate over the war was nothing but political theater .
Anyway , never mind the political calculations .
Confronting Mr. Bush on Iraq has become a patriotic duty ....
If nothing is done to wind down this war during the 21 months — 21 months ! — Mr. Bush has left , the damage may be irreparable .
Maybe what Harry Reid is doing is his job as Senate Majority Leader .
Maybe Harry Reid is forcing the Iraq debate into what the pundits will call politically risky territory because it's where the debate has to go .
Maybe , Harry Reid is doing the bidding of the American people , and his patriotic duty , and is trying to lead the way out of Iraq .
Nonetheless , for all his pessimism , in Saramago ’s most powerful novels there remains a stubborn sprig of utopianism , flickers of “ what if ? ” and “ why not ? ”
In “ The History of the Siege of Lisbon , ” published in 1989 , Saramago redevises the past .
His hero , Raimundo Silva , is a lonely , impoverished proofreader who , like Melville ’s Bartleby , finds himself inexplicably driven to an act of quiet sabotage .
Correcting a manuscript on the Reconquista of Lisbon in the 12th century , Silva inserts one word in the text that he imagines will change the course of history .
In the original text , an army of crusaders on their way to the Holy Land are asked to join King Alfonso ’s attack on Lisbon : after Silva ’s amendment , they decide “ not ” to help .
The Iberian Peninsula thus presumably remains Muslim , and the world is spared the Inquisition , as well as the discovery of America .
“ The Gospel According to Jesus Christ , ” published in 1991 , is Saramago ’s most tetchily subversive work .
Saramago is the kind of old - fashioned atheist who is hopping mad at a God who he believes does not exist .
His novel ’s starting point is the Massacre of the Innocents , when Herod , the Roman king of Judea , learns that the future king of the Jews has just been born in Bethlehem and orders that all the baby boys in that village be slaughtered .
In Saramago ’s telling , Joseph , husband of Mary , overhears the collective death sentence by chance and manages to hide his own son while leaving the others to perish .
It is therefore in atonement for his earthly father ’s sin in indirectly colluding with Herod ’s iniquity , as well as for God ’s in allowing the massacre to occur , that Jesus is later forced to give his life .
( The amateur Freudian may wonder if there is n’t an echo here of a Communist son ’s guilt at his father ’s serving as a policeman under Salazar . )
On the cross , Saramago ’s Jesus asks humankind to forgive God his sins .
“ The Gospel ” polarized readers , both in Portugal and abroad , and led to Saramago ’s self - imposed symbolic exile in the Canary Islands .
The effect on Saramago ’s work has been stark .
His Canary Island novels are denuded of all the aching particularity , the clamor , reek and clutter of his Portugal works : austere and monitory parables , they often take place in an allegorical urban landscape as stylized as a computer game .
In a book like “ As Intermitências da Morte , ” which will be published in the United States in the spring , his subject is nothing less than the folly of man ’s search for eternal life .
To some observers , Saramago ’s exile has made him less relevant than other contemporary Portuguese greats like Antonio Lobo Antunes , who , using the polyphonic techniques of high modernism , continues to explore the psychic wounds left by Portugal ’s recent political history .
To others , Saramago has taken on the role of a more universal conscience , giving his literary fables about the failures of democracy or the tyranny of corporations a broader reach .
For the director Fernando Meirelles , who is making the film of “ Blindness , ” this universalism was the great achievement of that work .
“ It ’s an allegory about the fragility of civilization , ” Meirelles told me .
“ Ten years ago , I wanted to make my first feature film from the book — I was attracted by the paradox of making something visual about sightlessness — but Saramago said no .
Whoopi Goldberg and Gael García Bernal both tried to buy the rights ; he refused .
Finally , my producer and screenwriter came to the Canary Islands and spent two days with Saramago and talked him into it . ”
Saramago acknowledged to me that many people approached him about filming “ Blindness . ”
“ I always resisted , ” he said , “ because it ’s a violent book about social degradation , rape , and I did n’t want it to fall into the wrong hands . ”
Today saramago is planning his next novel .
“ Maybe it ’s my last book , ” he ventured during our conversation in Lisbon .
“ When I finish a book , I wait for the next idea , and sometimes it takes a long time , and I get worried .
When I finished ‘ Pequenas Memórias , ’ I wondered if the cycle was now complete .
I had for the first time in my life a sense of finitude , and it was not a pleasant feeling .
Everything seemed little , insignificant .
I ’m 84 .
I could live perhaps another three , four years .
The worst that death has is that you were here , and now you ’re not . ”

Iz stališča blogerja je najboljši seveda tisti , ki mu prinese največ obiskovalcev .
Enostavno .
Pa poglejmo moje podatke .

V tem času sem stisnil skupaj 5 objav .
Ni ne vem kaj .
Res je tudi , da nisem ravno mainstream in tudi ne najbolj reden pisec , ampak vseeno .
Največ obiska pride preko , ki v bistvu agregira samo splet 2.0 usmerjene bloge , kamor očitno sodim .
Bolj majhna , mikro skupnost , a sem zato dalj časa na prvi strani in verjetno je tole moja ciljna publika ...

Starting tomorrow December 31st 2006 , reading a DVD protected with CSS ( as most DVD are ) is illegal in France when it is done with a software allowing to circumvent the protection , such as VLC or mplayer which can both use the libdvdcss library .
Today ’s Journal Officiel ( where laws and executive orders are published ) says that you may be fined 750 € ( around $ 985 ) for doing so .
This includes watching any DVD that you have legally purchased .
Edit 2007 - 02 - 21 : the fine is 750 € , not 135 € as I wrote earlier !
Thanks to the two people who pointed at this mistake in the comments .
MIT Technology Review Online on March 21 retracted two stories written in whole or in part by Michelle Delio , citing the publication 's inability to confirm a source .
On April 4 , InfoWorld edited four articles by Delio to remove anonymous quotes .
Wired News has published more than 700 news stories written by Delio ( under the names Michelle Delio and Michelle Finley ) since 2000 .
In April , we assigned journalism professor and Wired News columnist Adam Penenberg to review recent articles written by Delio for Wired News .
Penenberg and his staff of graduate students at New York University reviewed 160 articles , largely from 2004 , but some earlier stories were also checked .
Penenberg provided Wired News with a list of 24 stories that contained sources he could not confirm ( links are included at the end of this story ) .
Penenberg 's report to Wired News can be downloaded here ( PDF ) .
Delio , in communications with Penenberg and Wired News , stands by her reporting and the existence and accuracy of her sources .
Most of Delio 's sources were in fact located and confirmed by Penenberg .
The unconfirmed sources affect the content of these stories to varying degrees .
For example , the Florida network tax story contains only one quote from a source Penenberg could not confirm , but the quote does not materially affect the rest of the story .
However , there are four articles in which unconfirmed sources arguably play a more prominent role .
• " Spyware on My Machine ?
So What ? "
The premise of the article is that general users do n't care all that much about spyware .
However , Penenberg cannot confirm any of the quotes from the users in the story .
• " Searching for Life Amid Rubble "
In this article about the 9/11 rescue efforts , Penenberg was unable to trace several of the people quoted , and an apocryphal survival anecdote is included ( which other reporters apparently wrote about at the time as well ) .
• " Meet the Nigerian E - Mail Grifters "
This article is based completely on sources whom Penenberg was unable to identify .
• " Nasty Malware Fouls PCs With Porn "
The anecdote at the beginning of this article features a family Penenberg was unable to contact .
The family 's experience was used to illustrate the extent of the problem caused by the malware .
In addition , a quote in " Patron Saint of the Nerds " is attributed to the Rev. Michael Amesse .
According to Penenberg 's report , Amesse says he never spoke with a reporter from Wired News .
We therefore have removed the quote from the story .
Wired News is not retracting any of these stories .
Rather , we are appending notes to the stories , indicating what we have been unable to confirm about them and editing them , as noted , where appropriate .
By keeping these stories posted and clearly marked , we hope that our readers can help identify any sources whom we cannot track down .
In addition , Wired News will now require freelance reporters to submit contact information for all named sources .
Also , anonymous sources will be used only with appropriate justification .
Wired News will continue to review the remaining Delio stories in its archive and post notes and report findings as appropriate .
If you have any information about the sources in these stories , please contact us at sourceinfo [ at] wired.com .
Problems found in an audit of Diebold tabulation records from an Ohio November 2006 election raise questions about whether the database got corrupted during the tabulation of election results , says a report released today ( pdf ) .
The document , from a team of researchers tasked with auditing the November election in troubled Cuyahoga County , have called for a thorough examination of the database to determine if corruption did occur and the extent to which it may have affected the election results .
( A note on the report : the version I 'm publishing here is a draft version that says " not for distribution . "
Two people distributed the report to me separately with the only instructions being I should not publish it until 11 am eastern time .
The draft version contains numerous appendices that do n't appear in the final version .
For info on the corrupt database , see p. 66 of the report . )
Among the report findings :
Vote totals in two separate databases that should have been identical had different totals .
Although Diebold explained that this was part of the system design for separate vote tables to get updated at different times during the tabulation process , the team questioned the wisdom of a design that creates non-identical vote totals .
Tables in the database contained elements that were missing date and time stamps that would indicate when information was entered .
Entries that did have date / time stamps showed a January 1 , 1970 date .
The database is built from Microsoft 's Jet database engine .
The engine , according to Microsoft , is vulnerable to corruption when a lot of concurrent activity is happening with the database , such as what occurs on an election night when results are uploaded and various servers are interacting with the database simultaneously .
This is why Microsoft advises against using the Jet engine in a complex environment :
Because multiple client processes are reading and writing to the same database and because Jet does not use a transaction log ( as do the more advanced database systems , such as SQL Server ) , it is not possible to reliably prevent any and all database corruption .
If you need a database system to run 24 hours a day , seven days a week in a multi-user environment , Microsoft recommends that you use a true client / server database system that supports durable transactions , such as Microsoft SQL Server .
The report mentions that election staff had trouble with the server crashing and freezing on election night .
The audit team , composed of representatives from the two major parties as well as three election advocacy groups , found other problems with the Diebold system as well :
The current generation optical scan hardware ( and firmware ) design . . . does not include features that are essential to determining whether all optical scan ballots have been counted and included in the tabulated results .
The report notes that with punch card machines election officials used to be able to determine definitively if all ballots had been counted in the results .
With the adoption of this new generation of voting equipment , however , the report says " we have reduced rather than increased the accuracy and reliability of our elections results . "
The audit found that the Diebold system also does n't produce report results at the machine level , only at the precinct level , which makes it difficult to trace faulty results back to a specific machine .
According to the report , Election Director Michael Vu initially denied the audit team access to the raw vote data to examine because he said Diebold had asserted trade secrets protection over the data .
By vote data , they 're referring to the vote totals and election reports , not the machine source code .
It 's unclear why he believed the company had a right to assert such claims over such essential public records data .
The audit found more problems with the way the election was administered – some optical scan ballots were scanned twice while others were n't scanned at all .
This kind of problem is n't new to Cuyahoga .
Two audit reports on last year 's May primary in the county revealed severe data tracking problems by the election staff .
And two Cuyahoga election workers were convicted in January of tampering with a recount in the 2004 presidential election by cherry - picking precincts for recount that they knew would match the election results .
They were concerned they'd have to work overtime if the recount did n't match the results .
All of these issues led to the resignation of Election Director Michael Vu and the four members of Cuyahoga 's board of elections .
Vu's problems in Ohio have n't affected his job prospects , however .
He was recently hired as assistant registrar of voters in San Diego .
Socially artful responses emerge largely in the neural chatter between the orbitofrontal cortex and emotional centers like the amygdala that generate impulsivity .
But the cortex needs social information — a change in tone of voice , say — to know how to select and channel our impulses .
And in e-mail there are no channels for voice , facial expression or other cues from the person who will receive what we say .
True , there are those cute , if somewhat lame , emoticons that cleverly arrange punctuation marks to signify an emotion .
The e-mail equivalent of a mood ring , they surely lack the neural impact of an actual smile or frown .
Without the raised eyebrow that signals irony , say , or the tone of voice that signals delight , the orbitofrontal cortex has little to go on .
Lacking real - time cues , we can easily misread the printed words in an e-mail message , taking them the wrong way .
And if we are typing while agitated , the absence of information on how the other person is responding makes the prefrontal circuitry for discretion more likely to fail .
Our emotional impulses disinhibited , we type some infelicitous message and hit “ send ” before a more sober second thought leads us to hit “ discard . ”
We flame .
Flaming can be induced in some people with alarming ease .
Consider an experiment , reported in 2002 in The Journal of Language and Social Psychology , in which pairs of college students — strangers — were put in separate booths to get to know each other better by exchanging messages in a simulated online chat room .
While coming and going into the lab , the students were well behaved .
But the experimenter was stunned to see the messages many of the students sent .
About 20 percent of the e-mail conversations immediately became outrageously lewd or simply rude .
And now , the online equivalent of road rage has joined the list of Internet dangers .
Last October , in what The Times of London described as “ Britain ’s first ‘ Web rage ’ attack , ” a 47 - year - old Londoner was convicted of assault on a man with whom he had traded insults in a chat room .
He and a friend tracked down the man and attacked him with a pickax handle and a knife .
Video : US ' head shot ' kills British camera man RAW STORY
Published : Thursday October 12 , 2006 Print This Email
This A shot to the head from US forces has killed a British camera man , according to this report filed by the UK's Channel 4 .
Spock , a search engine for finding people , mixes search with social - networking tools like personal profiles and tagging .
But you do n't have to join to have a profile on Spock .
In fact , you may be shocked to see what your profile says about you .
For example : Mike X. is a fat , retarded pimp who likes screwing prostitutes .
Mary Y. works in a strip club downtown and owns a vibrator .
Joe Z. is a man - whore who hangs out at stranger 's houses and drinks rum and coke .
If you searched Spock using the real names of these high school teenagers , those are the kind of tags you 'd find .
These kids have a few things in common :
They , along with 12,000 other people , recently downloaded a " Mad Libs " - like Facebook application and wrote stories about themselves and their friends , filling the blanks with scandalous terms .
But they did n't realize the application was created by Spock , which debuted last week .
And they were horrified to discover that Spock used the terms they supplied to build public profiles on them and other Facebook members .
( After being contacted by Wired News , Spock erased the tags from many of these profiles , but some were still visible at press time . )
It 's not just fun and games .
If you searched Spock for the tag " pedophile " last week , blogger John Aravosis ' profile would have shown up near the top .
The proprietor of the popular Americablog has written extensively about former Congressman Mark Foley .
The profile was automatically created by the Spock bot , which crawled sites associated with Aravosis .
In an e-mail , Aravosis says the discovery of his profile on Spock was " terribly disturbing ... and bizarre . "
" It 's certainly great lawsuit material , " he says .
" It 's still possible that ( Spock ) picked up on our coverage of the Foley scandal – we were one of the top sites covering it – so perhaps their search engine just screwed up . "
After being contacted by Aravosis , Spock removed the offending tag .
CEO Jaideep Singh claims
Spock is no different than Google , indexing and aggregating information already available elsewhere on the web .
Spock spiders major social networks and public sites , culling text and photos and adding descriptive tags to build your profile .
If you 've got a page on MySpace , Hi5 , Friendster or Wikipedia , odds are good you 've also got one in Spock 's 100 - million - profile database .
But when databases are built by bots and not by humans , mistakes happen .
False or malicious profiles set up on other sites will be indexed along with the real ones .
Divorced from their original context , tags can take on a life all their own .
Once your content is on Spock it 's no longer strictly yours .
For example , you can't make your Spock profile private or limit who can contribute to it .
Anyone registered with Spock can vote on the tags or photos on your profile .
If the ' no ' votes outnumber the ' yes ' votes , the new content is removed .
Otherwise , you 'll have to ask Spock 's customer service to remove it for you .
" The best way to ensure that Spock will not index web documents about you is to remove all documents about you from the web , " notes Singh in an e-mail .
" This is no different than Google or other leading search engines . "
The potential for using Spock to harass someone or poison their online reputation is real , though not likely to happen frequently , says Greg Sterling , a correspondent for the Search Engine Land news site .
" It 's unlikely you 'll be subject to defamation or that someone will maliciously tag you , " he says .
" But it is a possibility .
It all goes to the issue of privacy and who 's got control . "
Singh says the service has built - in safeguards to prevent abuse .
For example , Spock sends you an e-mail when your profile has been modified , so you can quickly vote down objectionable items .
( If you 've never visited the site and claimed your profile , however , you wo n't get this e-mail . )
You can also see which Spock members posted content on your page , and Singh says his customer service team is working hard to identify and remove fake user profiles .
" It is the web , so some people will always try to spam you and do malicious things , " he admits .
" But the value of people adding tags and content about you is enormous .
We want to make sure that the 99.9 percent of content that 's valuable to users is n't washed away by the 0.1 percent that 's spam . "
Over the next few weeks , Singh says Spock will roll out an internal reputation system that identifies users whose tags and photos are consistently voted down ; as their reputation declines , they will lose the ability to add new content .
Spock users can also flag abusive users and report them to customer service .
Singh believes a combination of automated tools , customer support and community policing will keep Spock relatively clean .
But just as big corporations regularly scour the web to gauge whether their brands are being abused , individuals will need to become more aware of how they are portrayed on people - search engines like Spock , Wink and Pipl , adds Sterling .
If Spock succeeds in becoming the Google for people search , you may have no choice but to sign on .
Your reputation may depend on it .
Lots of assertions , some pass , some fail
On the back of my last article about saving on your gas , I thought of going one better .
How about not paying for your car at all ?
Yup , there are ways to get a free car and the catches are quite minor .
Or , if you prefer , you can keep your own car and get paid $ 400 a month to drive it .
Now that 's what I call motoring .
I first discovered this site called FreeCarMedia a few months ago while I was researching a project for a client .
There are two ways to go with this program .
First , you can get a free car that 's wrapped in a company - sponsored ad .
All you pay for is gas and insurance ( and I 've already told you how to cut down on those gas costs ) .
Or , you can get your own car wrapped in an ad and receive a nice , handsome check for as much as $ 400 every month .
First , Your Very Own FREE Car
Just fill out an application and play the waiting game .
All you need is a clean drivers license .
The more info you give the advertisers , the more likely you 'll be matched to a suitable offer .
This takes a little time , but if you are chosen ( and many people are ) you 'll get a brand new car to use for two years .
Of course , the big catch is that you 're driving around in a humungous ad for something .
It could be sneakers , coffee , a magazine , anything .
If you do n't like the offer you 're matched with , you simply say no .
But if you really do n't fancy that idea , maybe you 'd prefer the easier option ... wrapping your own car .
Turn Your Car Into a Mobile Ad for Up to $ 400 a Month
This certainly seems to be the more popular option .
Simply fill out the application and when you 're chosen you can opt to wrap your own car ( and if your current motor looks like it could use a little TLC , it 's not such a bad thing ) .
Again , you do become a mobile ad .
But for that kind of money , you 'll more than cover the costs of gas and wear and tear .
If you 're worried about what the wrap process will do to your lovely car , they have that covered .
The Wrapping Process
I was concerned about this too .
What if they rip this thing off and half the paintwork comes with it ?
Here 's what the site has to say about wrapping your vehicle .
Using a digital template of the car ’s exterior , a graphic artist designs how the advertisement will look on the car .
The image is then printed on a high quality 3 M vinyl material in sheets in a similar way you would see wallpaper .
A solid material is used for the surface of the car and a perforated “ one way ” material is printed to cover the rear windshield and rear side windows .
Workers then affix the vinyl sheets in the proper places , overlapping the sheets slightly to cover the surface of the car .
The vinyl is flexible enough to conform to curved surfaces of the car , such as fenders and doors .
The vinyl can also be trimmed as necessary to fit around windows , lights , etc .
Once the graphics are placed on the vehicle you are all set to go !
The graphics will last up to three years in any weather conditions and can be washed just like your normal car either by hand or at a powerful car wash .
When the program is over , we will have one of our certified installers remove the wrap .
The exterior of the vehicle is then returned to normal .
Other " Car Wrap " Sources
I 'm familiar with FreeCarMedia , but there are others you may want to check out .
They include AdsOnWheels and AdWraps .
However , do your research well with any of these sites , and be wary of anyone asking for any kind of sign - up fee .
So , you know the catches , you know the rewards .
All you have to do now is decide if a free car or free cash is something you want in exchange for being a big ol ' ad .
As Michael B. Nifong , the disgraced former prosecutor in the Duke lacrosse rape case , reported to jail in Durham , N.C. , today to serve 24 hours for criminal contempt , the three students he accused were in talks with the city for a settlement of $ 30 million and a package of law enforcement reforms .
A person familiar with the negotiations confirmed the details of the demand , first reported by The Herald - Sun of Durham .
If the city refuses , the students are threatening to file a civil rights lawsuit .
The changes requested by the students and their lawyers include police department oversight by an independent commission , stricter procedures and videotaping of witness identifications conducted by the police , and the passage of a City Council resolution calling on the state to establish ombudsmen for district attorney ’s offices and require the transcription of grand jury proceedings .
“ These families are absolutely adamant ” that the settlement must include reforms , said the person , who spoke on condition of anonymity because the negotiations are continuing .
Beverly B. Thompson , a spokeswoman for the city , declined to discuss the talks .

Colbert offers Attorney General tips for his upcoming testimony
David Edwards and Mike Sheehan
Published : Tuesday April 17 , 2007 Print This Email This
Stephen Colbert took a sardonic swing at embattled Attorney General Gonzales in last night 's episode of his popular Comedy Central show The Colbert Report .
" All Alberto Gonzales did was possibly lie to Congress about his involvement in the firing of U.S. Attorneys who got in the way of the president 's agenda to cement a stranglehold on all branches of government , " quips Colbert .
" Let 's not make a federal case out of it . "
Gonzales ' upcoming testimony before a Senate panel prompted this advice from Colbert in his popular " The Wørd " segment .
Most religions have one or two unusual practices or devices but occasionally you find one which is just completely weird .
This list contains ten of the more unusual things found in modern religions .
10 Mormom Temple Garments
In some denominations of the Latter Day Saint movement , the temple garment ( or the Garment of the Holy Priesthood , or informally , the garment or garments ) is a set of sacred underclothing worn by adult adherents who have taken part in a ritual ceremony known as washing and anointing ordinance , usually in a temple as part of the Endowment ceremony .
Adherents consider them to be sacred and may be offended by public discussion of the garments .
Anti-Mormon activists have publicly displayed or defaced temple garments to show their opposition to the LDS Church .
According to generally - accepted Mormon doctrine , the marks in the garments are sacred symbols ( Buerger 2002 , p. 58 ) .
One proposed element of the symbolism , according to early Mormon leaders , was a link to the “ Compass and the Square ” , the symbols of freemasonry ( Morgan 1827 , pp. 22-23 ) , to which Joseph Smith ( creator of Mormonism ) had been initiated about seven weeks prior to his introduction of the Endowment ceremony .
9 Scientology E-Meter
Advertisement
An E-meter is an electronic device manufactured by the Church of Scientology at their Gold Base production facility .
It is used as an aid by Dianetics and Scientology counselors and counselors - in - training in some forms of auditing , the application of the techniques of Dianetics and Scientology to another or to oneself for the express purpose of addressing spiritual issues .
E-meter sessions are conducted by church employees known as auditors .
Scientology materials traditionally refer to the subject as the “ preclear , ” although auditors continue to use the meter well beyond the clear level .
The preclear holds a pair of cylindrical electrodes ( “ cans ” ) connected to the meter while the auditor asks the preclear a series of questions and notes both the verbal response and the activity of the meter .
Auditor training describes many types of needle movements , with each having their own special significance .
A 1971 ruling of the United States District Court , District of Columbia ( 333 F. Supp. 357 ) , specifically stated , “ The E - meter has no proven usefulness in the diagnosis , treatment or prevention of any disease , nor is it medically or scientifically capable of improving any bodily function . ”
8 Exorcism
Exorcism is the practice of evicting demons or other evil spiritual entities from a person or place which they are believed to have possessed ( taken control of ) .
The practice is quite ancient and still part of the belief system of many religions , though it is seen mostly in the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches .
Solemn exorcisms , according to the Canon law of the church , can only be exercised by an ordained priest ( or higher prelate ) , with the express permission of the local bishop , and only after a careful medical examination to exclude the possibility of mental illness .
The Catholic Encyclopaedia ( 1908 ) enjoined : “ Superstition ought not to be confounded with religion , however much their history may be interwoven , nor magic , however white it may be , with a legitimate religious rite ” .

7 Jewish Kaparot
Kaparot is a traditional Jewish religious ritual that takes place around the time of the High Holidays .
Classically , it is performed by grasping a live chicken by the sholder blades and moving around one ’s head three times , symbolically transferring one ’s sins to the chicken .
The chicken is then slaughtered and donated to the poor , preferably eaten at the pre-Yom Kippur feast .
In modern times , Kapparos is performed in the traditional form mostly in Haredi communities .
The ritual is preceded by the reading of Psalms 107:17 - 20 and Job 33:23 - 24 .
On the eve of Yom Kippur 2005 , more than 200 caged chickens were abandoned in rainy weather as part of a Kaparot operation in Brooklyn , NY ; some of these starving and dehydrated chickens were subsequently rescued by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals .
Jacob Kalish , an Orthodox Jew from Williamsburg , was charged with animal cruelty for the drowning deaths of 35 of these chickens .
In response to such reports of the mistreatment of chickens , animal rights organizations have begun to picket public observances of kaparot , particularly in Israel .
6 Shamanism
Shamanism refers to a range of traditional beliefs and practices concerned with communication with the spirit world .
There are many variations in shamanism throughout the world , though there are some beliefs that are shared by all forms of shamanism .
Its practitioners claim the ability to diagnose and cure human suffering and , in some societies , the ability to cause suffering .
This is believed to be accomplished by traversing the axis mundi and forming a special relationship with , or gaining control over , spirits .
Shamans have been credited with the ability to control the weather , divination , the interpretation of dreams , astral projection , and traveling to upper and lower worlds .
Shamans were used in Tibetan Buddhism as a form of divination by which the Dalai Lama was given prophesies of the future and advice .
5 Dowry
This is a cultural practice rather than a religious one .
The practice of dowry exists across India .
Despite laws against it , the practice continues .
The girl child ’s dowry and wedding expenses often sends her family into a huge debt trap .
As consumerism and wealth increase in India , dowry demands are growing .
In rural areas , families sell their land holdings , while the urban poor sell their houses .
To curb the practice of dowry , the government of India made several laws detailing severe punishment to anyone demanding dowry and a law in Indian Penal Code ( Section 498A ) has been introduced .
While it gives boost to a woman and her family , it in the same time also put a man and his family in a great disadvantage .
Misuse of this law by women in urban India and many incidents of extortion of money from the husband done by the wife and her family ( this is called sowry ) have come to light .
4 Mormon Baptism of the Dead
Baptism for the dead , vicarious baptism or proxy baptism is a religious practice of baptising a living person on behalf of an individual who is dead ; the living person is acting as the deceased person ’s proxy .
It has been practiced since 1840 in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints where it is also called temple baptism because it is performed only in dedicated temples .
In the practice of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , a living person , acting as proxy , is baptized by immersion on behalf of a deceased person of the same gender .
The baptism ritual is as follows : after calling the living proxy by name , the person performing the baptism says , “ Having been commissioned of Jesus Christ , I baptize you for and in behalf of [ full name of deceased person ] , who is dead , in the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost .
Amen . ”
The proxy is then immersed briefly in the water .
Baptism for the dead is a distinctive ordinance of the church and is based on the belief that baptism is a required ordinance for entry into the Kingdom of God .
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints vicariously baptizes people regardless of race , sex , or creed .
This includes both victims and perpetrators of genocide .
Some Jewish survivors of the Holocaust and their supporters have objected to this practice .
3 Jainist Digambaras
Digambar also spelled Digambara is one of the two main sects of Jainism .
Senior Digambar monks wear no clothes , following the practice of Lord Mahavira .
They do not consider themselves to be nude — they are wearing the environment .
Digambaras believe that this practice represents a refusal to give in to the body ’s demands for comfort and private property — only Digambara ascetics are required to forsake clothing .
Digambara ascetics have only two possessions : a peacock feather broom and a water gourd .
The native Jain communities of Maharashta , Bundelkhand ( MP/ UP ) , Karnataka , Tamil Nadu are all Digambaras .
In north India , the Saravagis and the Agrawals are also Digambaras .
In Gujarat and Southern Rajasthan , the majority of Jains follow the Svetambara tradition , although some Jain communities of these regions like the Humad are also Digambaras .
2 Islamic Niqab
A niqab is a veil which covers the face , worn by some Muslim women as a part of sartorial hijab .
It is popular in the Arab countries of the Persian Gulf but it can also be found in North Africa , Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent .
The niqab is regarded differently by the various schools of Islamic jurisprudence known as madhahab .
Some see it as obligatory , or fard , while others see it as recommended , or mustahab , and a few see it as forbidden .
The majority of scholars believe hijab is required , but only a few see niqab as required , although this is not the common perception among the general population .
1 Jehovah ’s Witnesses Refusal of Blood Transfusions
A fundamental doctrine of the Jehovah ’s Witnesses teaches that the Bible prohibits consumption , storage and transfusion of blood , including in cases of emergency .
This doctrine was introduced in 1945 , and has been elaborated upon since then .
Although accepted by a majority of Jehovah ’s Witnesses , evidence indicates a minority does not wholly endorse this doctrine .
Facets of the doctrine have drawn praise and criticism from both members of the medical community and Jehovah ’s Witnesses alike .
In 1964 , Jehovah ’s Witnesses were prohibited from obtaining transfusions for pets , from using fertilizer containing blood , and were even encouraged to write to dog food manufacturers to verify that their products were blood - free .
Later that year , Jehovah ’s Witnesses doctors and nurses were instructed to withhold blood transfusions from fellow Jehovah ’s Witnesses .
As to administering transfusions to non-members , The Watchtower stated that such a decision is “ left to the Christian doctor ’s own conscience . ”
" The prohibition on obtaining private health insurance is not constitutional where the public system fails to deliver reasonable services , " the court ruled .
In response , the Quebec premier , Jean Charest , proposed this month to allow private hospitals to subcontract hip , knee and cataract surgery to private clinics when patients are unable to be treated quickly enough under the public system .
The premiers of British Columbia and Alberta have suggested they will go much further to encourage private health services and insurance in legislation they plan to propose in the next few months .
Private doctors across the country are not waiting for changes in the law , figuring provincial governments will not try to stop them only to face more test cases in the Supreme Court .
One Vancouver - based company launched a large for - profit family medical clinic specializing in screening and preventive medicine here last November .
It is planning to set up three similar clinics Â in Toronto , Ottawa and London , Ontario
Â next summer and nine more in several other cities by the end of 2007 .
Private diagnostic clinics offering MRI tests are opening around the country .
Canadian leaders continue to reject the largely market - driven American system , with its powerful private insurance companies and 40 million people left uninsured , as they look to European mixed public - private health insurance and delivery systems .
" Why are we so afraid to look at mixed health care delivery models when other states in Europe and around the world have used them to produce better results for patients at a lower cost to taxpayers ? " the premier of British Columbia , Gordon Campbell , asked in a speech two weeks ago .
While proponents of private clinics say they will shorten waiting lists and quicken service at public institutions , critics warn that they will drain the public system of doctors and nurses .
Canada has a national doctor shortage already , with 1.4 million people in the province of Ontario alone without the services of a family doctor .
Somebody pinch me , because I still ca n’t believe this is going forward .
The world ’s first commercial spaceport took the next step today , releasing new plans and illustrations to the public today .
With a building that looks like the Millennium Falcon with wings , the spaceport , and its main tenant , Virgin Galactic , are taking this whole “ space is cool ” concept very , very seriously .
Spaceport America will be a 9,300 square metre ( 100,000 square foot ) hanger and terminal facility located in Las Cruces , New Mexico .
Construction is expected to begin in 2008 , and is expected to be completed by 2009 or 2010 .
It was designed by a partnership between the American firm URS Corporation and the British architectural agency Foster + Partners , which has plenty of experience designing airports .
Virgin ’s chief , Sir Richard Branson , clearly had a hand in setting some of the environmental requirements of the facility .
It was designed to meet the standards of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Platinum Certification , which is the highest rating you can get from the US Green Building Council .
It ’ll have solar panels for electricity , a water recycling system and natural earth to provide passive energy for heating and cooling .
The terminal and hanger facility are expected to cost about $ 31 million , and will also serve as a tourist attraction .
It will include Virgin Galactic ’s pre-flight and post - flight training facilities , and contain a maintenance hanger for two White Knight 2 aircraft and five Spaceship 2s .
Branson revealed more details about Spaceship 2 ’s testing as well , saying , “ next year will see the first test flights of Spaceship 2 and it is fantastic that we will now have a permanent home to go to , which will be every bit as inspiring for the astronauts of the future as Burt Rutanâ€™s groundbreaking technology . ”
So , Spaceship 2 tests next year , and a spaceport completed as early as 2009 .
Like I said … pinch me .

The president said his administration had completed a review of its Afghan strategy , and would work to increase the size of the Afghan army from 32,000 troops to 70,000 by the end of next year , and to bring in additional allied troops to support the fledgling army .
“ When there is a need , when the commanders on the ground say to our respective countries , ‘ We need additional help , ’ our NATO countries must provide it in order to be successful in the mission , ” Mr. Bush said .
He promised to build new roads that would help spur economic development , to battle an increase in the opium trade and to try to forge better ties between Afghanistan and its neighbor , Pakistan .
At the same time , Mr. Bush pledged to work with President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan to root out Taliban and Qaeda fighters who hide in that country ’s remote mountainous regions — a situation he described as “ wilder than the Wild West . ”
And , echoing his lament that 2006 was a difficult and disappointing year for Iraq , the president said the same had been true in Afghanistan .
Some critics of the administration ’s handling of Afghanistan said Mr. Bush was still understating the difficulties there .
“ We underfinanced , undermanned and under - resourced the war in Afghanistan for the last four years , and now we face a serious threat that the Taliban will succeed in destabilizing the country enough in 2007 to make the Karzai government collapse at some point , ” said Bruce Riedel , a scholar at the Saban Center for Middle East Studies at the Brookings Institution , a liberal - leaning research organization in Washington .
He called the speech “ a long overdue recognition that we need to do a lot more . ”
Both Mr. Riedel and Rick Barton , an expert in Afghanistan reconstruction at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington , said Mr. Bush ’s new strategy did not do enough to promote security and economic development .
Mr. Barton , who published a report in 2005 measuring progress in Afghanistan in that year , is about to publish another , and said the situation has turned measurably worse since his first study .
“ You start getting famous for being famous , ” Dr. Tao said .
“ The Paris Hilton effect . ”
Not that any of that has noticeably affected him .
His campus office is adorned with a poster of “ Ranma ½ , ” a Japanese comic book .
As he walks the halls of the math building , he might be wearing an Adidas sweatshirt , blue jeans and scruffy sneakers , looking much like one of his graduate students .
He said he did not know how he would spend the MacArthur money , though he mentioned the mortgage on the house that he and his wife , Laura , an engineer at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory , bought last year .
After a childhood in Adelaide , Australia , and graduate school at Princeton , Dr. Tao has settled into sunny Southern California .
“ I love it a lot , ” he said .
But not necessarily for what the area offers .
“ It ’s sort of the absence of things I like , ” he said .
No snow to shovel , for instance .
A deluge of media attention following his Fields Medal last summer has slowed to a trickle , and Dr. Tao said he was happy that his fame might be fleeting so that he could again concentrate on math .
One area of his research — compressed sensing — could have real - world use .
Digital cameras use millions of sensors to record an image , and then a computer chip in the camera compresses the data .
“ Compressed sensing is a different strategy , ” Dr. Tao said .
“ You also compress the data , but you try to do it in a very dumb way , one that does n’t require much computer power at the sensor end . ”

With Emmanuel Candès , a professor of applied and computational mathematics at the California Institute of Technology , Dr. Tao showed that even if most of the information were immediately discarded , the use of powerful algorithms could still reconstruct the original image .
PILEUS : The Internet Umbrella
Pileus is an umbrella connected to the Internet to make walking in rainy days fun .
Pileus has a large screen on the top surface , a built - in camera , a motion sensor , GPS , and a digital compass .
The current prototype has two main functions : photo- sharing and 3D map navigation .
The photo function is connected to a major web service : Flickr API .
A user can take photo with a camera on the umbrella , and pictures are uploaded to Flickr in two minutes with context tags via a wireless Internet connection .
User can also enjoy theirselves watching photo - streams downloaded from Flickr with simple operation of wrist snapping .
It also has a function of 3D Map .
Detecting a location data from GPS , it shows a 3D bird view around the user .
User can walk - through a city comparing the 3D views and real sights , and the map is always updated by GPS and a digital compass .
It aims to create natural augmented reality with a large informatin screen on the umbrella .
These two functions can be switched by simply fliping a switch .
As a future direction of its development , putting a context data on the Internet ( e.g. geo - tags on photos ) , it will be able to provide social local - navigations and real - time in - place communications .
The product aims to provide an augmentation of everyday life synchronizing information on the Internet and the real place .

The design process of Pileus started from concept creations of an ethnographical approach .
The concept was drawn on a scenario to enhance our urban experiences with the interactive umbrella .
The design is gradually updated by a lot of prototype experiments .
We thank your supports !
" Pileus " is an ancient Latin word originally meaning skullcap , and now used as technical worlds for a cloud that appear above a cumulus at meteorology [ 1 ] and a cap of mushrooms at mycology [ 2 ] .
The project uses this word for the name with double metaphors as a physical umbrella ( mushroom cap ) and cyber network services ( overlaid cloud ) .
This project was started as a academic research of Media Design at Keio University SFC Okude Lab in Spring 2006 .
The umbrella is a only prototype currently .
We are open for offers and inquiries to the project .

From Apple 's iPhone to Microsoft 's Surface , multi - touch user interfaces are becoming all the rage .
The only trouble is that our fingers are both a tool and a hindrance ; whatever we 're interacting with on the display is momentarily blocked by our finger and our hands .
Microsoft , Mitsubishi , and the University of Toronto are working on a solution , and it 's called LucidTouch .
Ars spoke with Daniel Wigdor , one of the researchers at the Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs ( MERL ) , to get the inside scoop on what LucidTouch is , what problems the team has run into along the way , and what 's coming in the future .
LucidTouch is currently the name for a prototype device that allows users to interact with an 800x480 pixel screen without having to touch the front surface .
Instead , users can choose to manipulate objects by touching a sensor pad on the back of the device ; this allows users to resize images and text , as well as navigate around any graphical user interface without their hands getting in the way of the display .
To achieve this , LucidTouch displays a transparent version of your hands on its screen so that you know where your fingers are but can also see through them .
If you want , you can touch the front surface for some tasks through a resistive touch screen and also use the back surface for others .
LucidTouch in action : the 2.0 prototype
LucidTouch is currently limited by technology , however .
In order to display hands and fingers in a semi- translucent fashion , Wigdor told Ars that the device currently needs a " boom cam " attached to the back on a small arm .
The device sends data back to a computer through USB , where the desktop does all of the information processing .
As you can tell , the prototype is thus tethered to a PC , limiting the portability of the device .
As a solution , Wigdor told Ars , " We have a few ideas about how the sensing could be done with technologies embedded in the back of the LCD ... such as with a capacitive array or with an array of LEDs to both illuminate and sense . "
MERL and Microsoft are both already well versed in multi - touch technology .
In fact , MERL has a similar technology to Microsoft 's Surface called " DiamondTouch . "
Instead of cameras below the surface , however , users sit in different chairs and are connected capacitively with receivers that interact with the multi - touch display .
One hundred models are already in use by universities and research organizations around the world , according to MERL .
While MERL looks and seems almost exactly like Surface , it does n't appear to offer the same ability to interact with consumer electronics like cameras or PDAs and seems to be better - suited for sharing multi- touch applications for maps , photo applications , and blueprints .
Since LucidTouch is still limited by current technology and requires a camera boom and PC , it 's not apparent when it will hit the mainstream market .
However , when and if it does , it will likely be used in larger tablet PCs and most useful for those who rely heavily on screen real estate , such as engineers and architects .
We also think it would be a killer feature on small web browsing devices , such as future versions of the Nokia N800 or the iPhone / iPod Touch .
That 's a long way away , however .
On Friday , the prototype version 2.0 of LucidTouch was completed .
The new prototype is " much more usable than [ the ] first prototype , " with a thinner 1 cm thick LCD screen .
There will be a live demonstration of LucidTouch 2.0 as well as a discussion of a research paper ( LucidTouch : A See - Through Mobile Device ) at the 2007 ACT User Interface Software and Technology ( UIST ) symposium in Newport , RI , from October 7 - 10 .
We 'll be there to check it out .
Linus Torvalds included patches into the mainline tree which implement a stable userspace driver API into the Linux kernel .
The stable driver API was already announced a year ago by Greg Kroah - Hartman .
Now the last patches where uploaded and the API was included in Linus ’ tree .
The idea of the API is to make life easier for driver developers :
This interface allows the ability to write the majority of a driver in userspace with only a very small shell of a driver in the kernel itself .
It uses a char device and sysfs to interact with a userspace process to process interrupts and control memory accesses .
Since future drivers using this API will run mainly in userspace there is no need to open up the source code for these parts .
Also , drivers can be re-used even after kernel changes because the API will remain stable .
The background motivation for the inclusion of such a stable API comes form the embedded world : there embedded drivers are often closed source and just developed for a single kernel version and are not maintained over time .
Using the new API these drivers could be used for a longer time .
And in fact such an API has already been developed by people from the embedded industry to make their life easier .
But it was just developed for a single device and not as a generic interface .
Such developments are now unnecessary .
However , DMA transfer between userspace and kernelspace is not yet implemented .
This means essentially that drivers which involve high traffic are not an option yet .
So graphic drivers as well as file system drivers and similar cannot use this API at the moment .
Some people might ask now why not simply allow closed source kernel drivers directly in the kernel , since they are allowed in userspace now anyway .
But there is a huge difference between these two types of drivers – while userspace drivers can be controlled in a certain way and cannot trash the kernel kernelspace drivers could do that .
A quite good explanation about the topic can be read at LWN .
The other way around one could ask if this will mean the end for Linux ( for example according to the LWN article ) .
But again , kernelspace and userspace is very different – an d with the new API the important part ( the kernelaspace part ) still has to be Open Source !
Besides , this API does not introduce anything which was not possible before : as already mentioned such an API was already developed quite some time ago , and was actively used .
But I must also admit that while I see the need for such an API I still prefer hardware vendors who simply make the drivers Open Source and bring them upstream .
Thanks to German heise .de for a detailed article about the topic .
It is known as the Google dance , a delicate struggle between technicians at the world 's largest internet search engine and the spin doctors who manipulate the worldwide web for commercial ends .
Every day one group tries to prevent the other from abusing Google 's index of more than 8bn web pages .
The stakes are high .
As Britain 's online shoppers spend £ 150 m every day in the run-up to Christmas , the value of a high ranking on Google is potentially worth millions to retailers , website owners and criminals alike .
Web search has become the focus for a legion of marketers over the past decade , and their tactics - known as search engine optimisation ( SEO ) - are the basis of a multibillion pound worldwide industry .
Most are legitimate businesses , but some so - called " black hat " SEOs use unethical strategies to boost their clients .
Spoof site
To test the effectiveness of these tactics , the Guardian created a spoof site and tried to force it up Google 's rankings .
Over one week , a number of tricks - some similar to those used by black - hat firms - were used to successfully push it to the top .
The spoof site was set up to promote eco-friendly flip - flops , a bogus product promising zero harmful emissions .
The simple page featured a disclaimer to make the nature of the experiment clear , and a picture of the goods .
At the start of the experiment , there were more than 11,500 results for " eco-friendly flip - flops " on Google , and the spoof site did not feature .
Within two days of creating the site , Google 's spider - the program that explores the web - had discovered the site and included it in its main index , but it appeared within the lowest 100 pages .
The first attempt to boost the ranking was a series of basic instructions intended to manipulate Google , including overloading the page with words that would improve the site 's ranking , and adding invisible data intended to boost it even further .
This had little effect , however , and the spoof site remained static in Google 's index .
Another trick was then used to mimic black - hat behaviour .
A second site was created which contained a large number of links to the first .
Because Google rates the authority of a site partly by how many times they have been linked to , this ploy can makes a site appear popular .
Within hours , the effect was apparent - the spoof site was now the top result in our test search , trumping the other 11,500 sites within days .
Our experiment was small scale and limited in scope , but in the real world the value of success is higher than ever .
Black - hat companies offer a range of services at different prices , all aimed at unfairly manipulating search engines .
One website found by the Guardian offered customers the chance to download a program to spam Google for $ 99 ( £ 56 ) , while another - posing as a legitimate SEO - charged several thousand pounds .
Commercial power Customers trust the results of search engines , which rely on advertising to generate profit and have much to gain from keeping the results clean and everything to lose if they fail .
Almost a fifth of all visits to online shopping sites are the direct result of an internet search , according to data monitor Hitwise - and more than half of those come straight from Google .
This places an astonishing level of commercial power in the hands of one company .
Google says it takes this very seriously , but it is an almost impossible task given the amount of information concerned .
" There is a lot of ongoing algorithmic work to improve the relevancy of our results in general , " said Marcus Sandberg , a Google engineer .
" Many SEOs do a great job at helping site owners improve their content for users and search engines alike .
But some do use methods that we consider manipulative . "
Behind Google 's legendary algorithm - an immense secret mathematical formula for ranking websites - are a series of well - known principles that can be faked , hoaxed or otherwise influenced .
" What 's grey and what 's not depends on your point of view , " said Danny Sullivan , editor of the Search Engine Watch website .
He said the relationship with SEOs is an awkward but vital one for search engines - and that some search manipulation is done by people " who do n't know what they 're doing " .
" They buy tools just like people buy guns who do n't know what they 're doing , " he said .
Google made headlines last week after a $ 1bn ( £ 560 m ) deal to buy a stake in internet service provider AOL .
Reports suggesting the company could include more intrusive adverts on its site have angered those who believe its clean approach is integral to its success .
Five ways to get to the top
Status on Google is determined by a number of factors , all of which can be faked
Key words
Good practitioners will make sure sites contain clear information that is relevant to a user search .
Others will use misleading but popular keywords - such as " Britney Spears " - to try to capitalise on somebody else 's fame .
Some even attempt to hide fake keywords on a page so that they can be read by search engines but not by people
Popularity
The more people that link to a site , the more popular it is in Google 's mind .
By carefully choosing who to link to and where to place those links , SEOs can push a target website up the rankings .
Some shady operators even create a fake ecology of websites which all point at each other
Spam
Spamming is a tactic employed by unscrupulous SEOs , and attempts to raise profile and popularity by leaving fake messages pointing towards the target across thousands of other sites and weblogs .
While unpopular with surfers , it often boosts the ranking of the site in question
Regular updates
Sites which seem new are often considered more important , because they are more likely to contain relevant information .
Unscrupulous operators will often steal content from other pages to create the appearance of movement
Metadata
Each web page carries a selection of unseen information that tells other programs what its contents are .
While most SEOs simply include correct information about a given page , crooked operators will use unrelated terms to try to direct unwitting surfers
Sri Lankan SEP letter to JVP demanding end to threats of violence
28 August 2007
The following letter has been sent by the Socialist Equality Party ( SEP ) in Sri Lanka to the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna ( JVP ) to demand an end to threats of violence against the International Students for Social Equality ( ISSE ) at Peradeniya University .
The incident was reported in full on the World Socialist Web Site ( see “ Sri Lanka : JVP student leader physically threatens ISSE campus team ” ) .
Mr. Tilvin Silva ,
Secretary , Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna ( JVP )
I am writing to you regarding threats of violence made by students belonging to your Inter University Students ’ Federation ( IUSF ) against the members of the Socialist Equality Party ( SEP ) and the International Students for Social Equality ( ISSE ) at Peradeniya University on August 7 .
The incident took place while SEP and ISSE members were holding a book exhibition at the senate building of Peradeniya University and campaigning among students against the US - led military occupation of Iraq and the renewed civil war in Sri Lanka .
The ISSE had applied for and received written permission from the university authorities to conduct its campaign .
As the campaign proceeded , a group of more than a dozen IUSF members gathered nearby and watched for nearly one and a half hours .
At about 10.30 a.m. , several student leaders — including Chinthaka Thuduwage , Dushmantha Abesinghe and Rangana Jayakody — all IUSF members , approached the stall and demanded to know on whose authority it had been set up .
When told of the university registrar ’s permission , Chinthaka falsely claimed that the ISSE only had a permit to display books , not to “ agitate ” among students .
He ordered ISSE and SEP members to “ get out forthwith ” or “ the situation and consequences will get worse . ”
Asked if he were making a threat , Chinthaka boasted : “ Yes we are .
Ca n’t we make a threat !
If you do not go , we will forcibly eject you . ”
Naming a particular ISSE member , he also warned : “ If he enters this campus again , we will beat him up . ”
These threats are unacceptable — and the SEP is obliged to take them very seriously .
As you know , similar threats , made in the period of 1989 - 1990 , were followed by the assassination of three of our members — Comrades R.A. Pitawela , P.H. Gunapala and Greshan Geekiyanage — by members of the JVP .
We must assume that Chinthaka Thuduwage , Dushmantha Abesinghe and Rangana Jayakody , as members of the IUSF , act under the authority of your organisation .
As secretary , it is your responsibility to call them to order .
If the threats are repeated , rest assured we will hold you politically and legally accountable .
Wije Dias ,
General Secretary ,
Socialist Equality Party ( Sri Lanka )
It is a question I am faced with at every public event I participate in :
What are my views on the impeachment of President Bush and others in his administration ?
Generally , the question is preceded by an emotional statement listing the “ crimes ” which Mr. Bush is accused of committing , and the questioner has already found him guilty .
Whether it is the war in Iraq , conspiracy theories about 9/11 , Hurricane Katrina , or any given variation of the theme of constitutional abuse of power , the one thing all of the questioners have in common ( besides the desirable outcome ) is their singular conviction that the president is guilty .
I have considerable sympathy for this stance .
I myself have stated on more than one occasion that I believe President Bush has lied to Congress and the American people about the reasons for going to war with Iraq ( i.e. , the whole WMD / al - Qaida intelligence fabrication / misrepresentation fiasco ) .
I also believe that the president ’s sanctioning of warrantless wiretapping , along with a litany of other abuses of power stemming from the Patriot Act approved by Congress after Sept. 11 , 2001 , likewise constitutes grounds for impeachment .
Several Democrats in Congress are actually discussing the possibility of impeachment of President Bush , and the irrepressible Congressman Dennis Kucinich has actually introduced articles of impeachment for Vice President Dick Cheney .
Even some Republicans are getting on board the impeachment bandwagon , although with caveats .
“ Any president who says ‘ I do n’t care ’ or ‘ I will not respond to what the people of this country are saying about Iraq or anything else ’ or ‘ I do n’t care what the Congress does , I am going to proceed ’ — if a president really believes that , then there are … ways to deal with that , ” Sen .
Chuck Hagel , a Republican from Nebraska , said of President Bush in obvious reference to impeachment .
Hagel is correct : Impeachment is the constitutional remedy for a unilateral president whose governance is an insult to traditional American democratic norms and values .
However , impeachment alone is simply a measure which addresses the symptoms of a larger malaise that has stricken America .
The arrogance associated with the concept of the unitary executive is prevalent throughout mainstream American political life .
The passivity of the legislative branch is one byproduct of the dominance of the unitary executive .
It is also an indicator that the will of the people , as expressed through their election of the people ’s representatives to the Congress of the United States , no longer has the weight and bearing long associated with the American democratic experience .
Any effort to impeach Bush and any of his administration found to be engaged in activities classifiable as “ high crimes and misdemeanors ” would fail to rein in the unitary executive core of any successor .
One only has to listen to the rhetoric of the Democratic candidates for president to understand that this trend is as deeply rooted among them as it is with President Bush .
Americans today look for leaders without recognizing the absolute necessity of electing team players .
The Founding Fathers deliberately designed the executive branch to be strong and independent , but also made sure , through an elaborate system of checks and balances , that it operated merely as one of three separate but equal branches of government .
The “ in your face ” efforts of the Bush administration to minimize the role of Congress and to achieve political control of the judiciary are simply more public manifestations of trends that occurred in a more quiet fashion in past administrations , Republican and Democratic alike .
When America elects a leader who states clearly that he or she will work with their equal partners in governance , the Congress , for the good of the country , and who will acknowledge the supremacy of law set forth in the form of binding legislation passed by the will of Congress , void of any limiting or contradicting “ presidential signing statement , ” then we will finally have a leader who is truly worthy of the title “ President of the United States of America . ”
But this will not happen of its own volition .
The impeachment of President Bush would not in and of itself terminate executive unilateralism .
It would only limit its implementation on the most visible periphery , driving its destructive designs back into the shadows of government , away from the public eye , and as such , public accountability .
Impeach President Bush , yes , if in fact he can be charged with the commission of acts which meet the constitutional standard for impeachment ( and I believe he could , if Congress only had the will to do its job ) .
But to truly heal America , we must repudiate everything President Bush stands for , in terms of not only public and foreign policy , but also in terms of his style of governance , since the former is derived from the latter .
Repudiation is a strong term , defined as “ rejecting as having no authority or binding force , ” to “ cast off or disown , ” or to “ reject with disapproval or condemnation . ”
In my opinion , the complete repudiation of the presidency of George W. Bush is the only recourse we have collectively as a people to not only seek redress for the wrongs committed by the Bush administration , but also to purge society of this cancer that threatens to consume and destroy us as a whole , and which would continue to manifest itself in our system of governance even after any impeachment proceedings .
Like any cancerous growth , the Bush administration has attached its malignancy to the American nation in a cruel fashion , its poisonous tentacles stretching deep into our national fabric in a manner that makes difficult the task of culling out the healthy from the diseased .
But we cannot truly repudiate something without its complete and utter elimination from our midst .
As such , there must be a litmus test to help us differentiate the good from the bad , that which must be restored from that which must be eliminated .
For me , there is only one true test : that of constitutionality .
There will be those who argue , and have argued , that the time is well past for an oppressed people ( and one would be a fool not to comprehend that under the Bush administration , the American people have in fact been oppressed ) to rely on the niceties of legal argument , especially when the system of law we seek to use in our defense has been so thoroughly corrupted by those who seek to impose tyranny .
I was recently in Ireland , where I delivered a presentation on the current situation in the Middle East .
In criticizing the Bush administration ’s policies , I launched into a staunch defense of the Constitution of the United States and decried what I believed to be the inadequacies of Congress and the American people in defending their constitutional inheritance .
Afterward , I was confronted by an Irishman who challenged me on the validity of our Constitution .
As he pointed out , none other than President Thomas Jefferson himself , the author of the Declaration of Independence and a proponent of constitutional law , is famously quoted as saying , “ The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants .
It is its natural manure . ”
If , as I maintained , the Bush administration was deviating so far off course from the ideals and values set forth in the Constitution , was it not time for a new American Revolution to “ refresh ” liberty with “ the blood of patriots and tyrants ? ”
There can be no doubt that Jefferson was a promoter of resistance to the forces of tyranny .
It was he who , after all , who penned the famous words proclaiming the need for American independence from the tyranny of British rule : “ That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new Government , laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form , as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness … when a long train of abuses and usurpations , pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism , it is their right , it is their duty , to throw off such Government , and to provide new Guards for their future security . ”
If faced with a situation today in which the American people felt that our current form of government sought to imprison them “ under absolute Despotism , ” would we not be obligated to apply “ natural manure ” in an effort to refresh the “ tree of liberty ? ”
Short of a complete and total abdication on the part of the Congress , the collapse of the judiciary system , and a shocking decision by those men and women who wear the uniform of the armed forces of the United States to lend force of arms to the will of a dictatorial president , I cannot ever envision a time in which conditions in these United States could deteriorate to the point that a violent revolution “ of the people and by the people ” would be required to restore constitutional legitimacy and authority .
Having said that , I remind the reader that with so few Americans professing any working understanding of the Constitution , it is difficult to speak of people defending that which they remain ignorant of .
While I reject violence as a means of redressing social wrongs , especially when applied to issues of governance , and instead rely on the rule of law as manifested by the Constitution and those legitimate bodies empowered by the Constitution to remedy every situation , I cannot help but fear the moment when the foundation of legitimacy which defines who we are and what we are as a nation fades away into irrelevance amidst a sea of complacency and ignorance .
There is no greater breeding ground for the forces of tyranny than the surrender of civic responsibility on the part of those entrusted with the defense of liberty .
And in this I do not mean the Congress of the United States , but rather the people of the United States , the duly elected representatives of whom constitute the Congress .
I fear not the bloody rebellion of an outraged citizenry , but rather the passive submission of a shameful mass which betrays the cause of liberty and freedom through the abandonment of the Constitution , and the obligations of citizenship derived thereof , in favor of the narcotic of consumerism .
Such a mass , foreswearing blind obedience to those who profess how to best construct a cocoon that immerses the occupant in transitory comfort , is the most pressing problem facing America today .
In a nation whose defining document begins , “ We the People , ” I find that it is we the people who constitute the greatest threat to the future of America .
It is not through the force of our actions , but rather the vacuum created by our inaction and apathy , a vacuum all too readily filled by those who would have us exchange our hard - fought freedoms for a gilded cage of market - driven consumerism .
This is the main reason why I am not a proponent of the “ impeach now ” mentality so prevalent in political circles that oppose George W. Bush .
The expediency of impeachment simply replaces one source of tyranny ( President Bush ) with another ( whoever replaces him ) .
It is not the failures of an individual that have gotten us to where we are today , but rather the failure of the collective .
So before we speak of impeachment and the notion of executive accountability , I would like to address the issue of repudiation and the necessity of civic responsibility .
Whatever field I endeavored to participate in — whether as a football player in college , an officer in the Marines or a firefighter today — whenever the going got tough , it was always pounded into my head to fall back on “ the basics . ”
That is to say , a foundation of norms from which everything else was derived .
By adhering to these “ basics , ” I and others were able to navigate whatever treacherous course we were attempting , more often than not with success .
As such , in formulating a coherent response to the challenge put to me by the Irishman concerning the need to “ fertilize the tree of liberty , ” I find myself falling back on the “ basics ” of citizenship , to seek out the fundamentals of individual responsibility in the American democratic experiment .
And there is no better source for these fundamentals than the most strident defender of the individual American — Thomas Jefferson himself .
Jefferson was in France during the drafting of the Constitution , and did not play a direct role in negotiating its content .
But such was his heft as a founder of America that his opinion was sought by many of those who were so engaged .
One of these critical players , James Madison ( who later became the fourth president of the United States , following Jefferson ) , wrote a letter to Jefferson shortly after the Constitutional Convention finished its work in September 1787 , and prior to ratification , interpreting critical aspects of the Constitution .
I view Madison ’s words to be worthy of consideration when addressing the issue of citizenship and responsibility .
“ In the American Constitution , ” he wrote on Oct. 24 , 1787 , “ the general authority will be derived entirely from the subordinate authorities .
The Senate will represent the States in their political capacity ; the other House will represent the people of the States in their individual capacity .
The former will be accountable to their constituents at moderate , the latter at short periods .
The President also derives his appointment from the States , and is periodically accountable to them .
This dependence of the General on the local authorities seems effectually to guard the latter against any dangerous encroachments of the former ; whilst the latter , within their respective limits , will be continually sensible of the abridgement of their power , and be stimulated by ambition to resume the surrendered portion of it . ”
In short , Madison underscored the fundamental role of the people in the chain of accountability , and the necessity of their informed involvement if the system of American constitutional governance was to work .
A breakdown on the part of the “ general authority ” would lead to chaos and anarchy .
Likewise , the failure of the “ subordinate authority , ” inclusive of the people , to hold the “ general authority ” in check would facilitate a slide toward tyranny and oppression .
Jefferson himself , before the convening of the Constitutional Convention , had long reflected on the issues of constitutional government .
Just as his rendering of the Declaration of Independence drew from his earlier work , “ A Summary View of the Rights of British America , ” so , too , were his views on the American Constitution drawn from his earlier writings on issues pertaining to the Constitution of Virginia , which are contained in a collection of work dating from 1781 - 82 known as “ Notes on Virginia . ”
The purpose of a Constitution , Jefferson wrote , was ” … to bind up the several branches of government by certain laws , which , when they transgress , their acts shall become nullities ; to render unnecessary an appeal to the people , or in other words a rebellion , on every infraction of their rights , on the peril that their acquiescence shall be construed into an intention to surrender those rights . ”
Here Jefferson himself answers the question of the need to “ fertilize ” the “ tree of liberty ” with the blood of rebellion :
It is not required , nor desired , so long as a system of rule by law ( i.e. , a Constitution ) is present and adhered to .
The importance of a Constitution in preserving the character of a nation through perpetuity was paramount , in Jefferson ’s view .
“ It is true , ” he argued in his “ Notes on Virginia , ” that “ we are as yet secured against tyrannical laws by the spirit of the times . …
But is the spirit of the people an infallible , a permanent reliance ?
Is it government ?
Is this the kind of protection we receive in return for the rights we give up ?
Besides , the spirit of the times may alter , will alter .
Our rulers will become corrupt , our people careless . ”
Today one need only observe the corruption of our rulers and the carelessness of our people to understand the significance of the Constitution when it comes to preserving these United States of America .
The nefarious nature of the Bush cancer is that , in its infection of the American system , it seeks to draw legitimacy for its tyrannical actions by citing the very same Constitution it seeks to destroy .
The promoters of this point of view cite the academic term “ Unitary Executive Theory ” when defining their philosophy .
To me , it is nothing less than treason .
The Founding Fathers , in discussing the concept of a “ unitary executive , ” made use of the term in a manner reflective of their desire to restrain executive power , versus the extreme interpretation embraced by counsels to President Bush and Vice President Cheney , who seek to expand executive power and authority to near dictatorial levels , especially during a time of war .
The tendency on the part of President Bush to obviate the role of Congress is well documented , in matters pertaining to governance in times of peace as well as war .
The unprecedented number of “ presidential signing statements ” issued by Bush speaks volumes to this trend .
These signing statements , historically a device used by executives to protect presidential prerogative when it comes to how a bill might be interpreted in a court of law , have been used by the Bush administration to negate the legal impact of a given piece of legislation by clearly stating the intent of the president to act in a manner inconsistent with the letter of the law .
That the president believes he has a right to conduct himself in this manner is the height of hubris ; that Congress continues to facilitate this behavior unchallenged represents the depth of legislative depravity .
It would be interesting to have a national debate on the concept of a “ unitary executive , ” where the proponents would cite the “ vesting clause ” ( Article II , Section 1 ) of the Constitution , which states , “ The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America . ”
The advocates of a “ unitary executive ” combine the “ vesting clause ” with Article II , Section 3 , Clause 4 , the “ take care ” clause , which states that the president must “ take care that the laws be faithfully executed ” to make a case for a seamless hierarchy of power solely vested in the executive .
Stephen Calabrisi and Kevin Rhodes staked out this argument in their 1992 article , “ The Structural Constitution : Unitary Executive , Plural Judiciary , ” in the Harvard Law Review ( Issue 105 , 1992 ) .
The foundation of their argument is drawn from a backwards reading of the Constitution , which addresses the issue of “ Mandatory Jurisdiction ” as set forth in the “ vesting clause , ” not of the executive , but rather the judiciary , in Article III of the Constitution .
By establishing a link between the exclusive authority of the courts derived from the “ vesting clause ” of Article III , Calabrisi and Rhodes argue that a similar exclusive authority , this time for the executive , is derived from the “ vesting clause ” of Article II .
Of course , the Constitution was not written from back to front , and should neither be read nor interpreted from back to front .
Missing from the entire dynamic of the underlying theory of the proponents of a “ unitary executive ” is the pressing reality of the Constitution itself , in particular the “ vesting clause ” of Article I , Section 1 , which states that “ All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States , which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives . ”
Likewise , Calabrisi and Rhodes ignore Article I , Section 8 , which enumerates the powers of Congress , and Article I , Section 8 , Clause 18 ( the “ necessary and proper ” clause ) , which states that Congress shall have all the power “ to make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers , and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States , or in any Department or Officer thereof . ”
The “ necessary and proper ” clause gained preeminence with the landmark case of “ McCulloch v. Maryland , ” decided by the Supreme Court in 1819 .
The decision by Chief Justice Marshall clearly established the principle that that the Constitution grants to Congress implied powers for implementing the Constitution ’s express powers , in order to create a functional national government .
Marshall noted that the “ necessary and proper ” clause “ purport[s ] to enlarge , not to diminish the powers vested in the government .
It purports to be an additional power , not a restriction on those already granted . ”
Marshall went on :
This government is acknowledged by all , to be one of enumerated powers .
The principle , that it can exercise only the powers granted to it , would seem too apparent , to have required to be enforced by all those arguments , which its enlightened friends , while it was depending before the people , found it necessary to urge ; that principle is now universally admitted .
That Chief Justice Marshall was speaking about the Congress of the United States when addressing the issue of the expansion of enumerated power should not be missed by those who seek to invalidate the theory and practice of a “ unitary executive . ”
The sad fact is , however , there are far too few Americans who are equipped and / or prepared to engage in a constitutional discussion , not to mention one of this magnitude .
Having failed to read and comprehend this vital cornerstone of America , they are poorly positioned to come to its defense in this , the Constitution ’s time of need .
You cannot defend that which you remain ignorant of .
Thomas Jefferson , in an 1802 letter to his friend and confidant , Joseph Priestly , noted that , “ Though written constitutions may be violated in moments of passion or delusion , yet they furnish a text to which those who are watchful may again rally and recall the people .
They fix , too , for the people the principles of their political creed . ”
Thus , an American people ignorant of their Constitution remain a people collectively void of principle or creed .
Given the state of affairs that is the American body politic today , this is a harsh yet far too accurate indictment of the state of American citizenship .
Those who espouse the nobility of patriotism by extolling Article II , Section 4 of the Constitution , which addresses the issue of impeachment of the president and vice president , are all too mute about the remainder of that great document .
Whether this silence is derived from negligence or ignorance , or a combination thereof , is not the point .
What lies at the heart of this issue is that void of a solid foundation of “ creed , ” as Jefferson put it , to fall back on in times of constitutional crisis derived from the abuse of power and authority .
The American people have only a bottomless pit as their support , and that is no support at all .
Impeach President Bush ?
Maybe , if due process dictates .
Repudiate President Bush ?
Absolutely , especially if one aspires for an America that truly matches the visions and ideals set forth by the Founding Fathers .
Repudiate the notion of a “ unitary executive . ”
Repudiate presidential signing statements .
Repudiate executive violation of Article 6 of the Constitution , which binds municipal law in America with binding treaty obligations incurred when the Senate ratifies a treaty or agreement by a two - thirds majority or better .
Repudiate “ faith - based initiatives ” pushed by any branch of government .
Repudiate a weak Congress .
Repudiate weak senators or representatives , especially those with a track record of abrogating their constitutional mandate .
Repudiate ignorance , especially that of the American citizen who knows little or nothing about the Constitution which empowers him or her .
Repudiate consumerism , especially the virulent form it takes in the selfish framework of American - centric capitalism .
Repudiate pre-emptive wars of aggression .
Repudiate American Empire .
Instead , embrace the empowerment of education .
Embrace active citizenship .
Embrace the rule of law , as set forth by the Constitution .
Do all of this and , in the end , if conditions and circumstance warrant , impeach President Bush and any of those in his administration so deserving .
Thomas Jefferson was prescient in his musings to another confidant , Moses Robinson , in 1801 when he wrote , “ I sincerely wish … we could see our government so secured as to depend less on the character of the person in whose hands it is trusted .
Bad men will sometimes get in and with such an immense patronage may make great progress in corrupting the public mind and principles .
This is a subject with which wisdom and patriotism should be occupied . ”
That wise American patriots would be so occupied today is my wish and dream .
Scott Ritter was a Marine Corps intelligence officer from 1984 to 1991 and a United Nations weapons inspector in Iraq from 1991 to 1998 .
He is the author of numerous books .
His latest is “ Waging Peace : The Art of War for the Antiwar Movement ” ( Nation Books , April 2007 ) .
There are bands that shuffle humbly onto the stage of Madison Square Garden , happy to be there and nervous about filling the room with sound .
( And with fans . )
Then there is Muse .
Muse , a famously bombastic trio from Britain , is now established as one of the biggest bands in Europe .
American fans are coming around too : “ Black Holes and Revelations ” ( Warner Brothers ) , the most recent Muse album , has sold about 350,000 copies in the United States .
So Monday ’s concert at the Garden made sense :
It was an impressive , cheerfully overblown performance by a band that has never pretended to think small .
The set began with a whooshing ride through “ Knights of Cydonia , ” in which a long overture gives way to Matthew Bellamy ’s crooned invitation : “ Come ride with me through the veins of history . ”
In Muse ’s world , this counts as idle banter .
Mr. Bellamy ’s voice is often compared to the operatic moan of Thom Yorke , from Radiohead , although Mr. Yorke might beg to differ .
At times , Muse sounds like what Radiohead has strenuously avoided becoming : a theatrical arena - rock juggernaut , unafraid of ridiculous lyrics or huge space - age riffs .

NASHVILLE - The American Civil Liberties Union and the Office of the Tennessee Post - Conviction Defender today urged the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals to reverse the conviction and death sentence of Richard Taylor , who is severely mentally ill .
“ Richard Taylor ’s trial was fraught with error and injustice , ” said Cassandra Stubbs , the attorney with the ACLU ’s Capital Punishment Project who is representing Taylor on the appeal .
“ Our client was not competent to stand trial and was denied several fundamental rights .
We hope the Court of Criminal Appeals will do the just and humane thing and right this grave wrong . ”
In 2003 , Taylor , who was schizophrenic , delusional and heavily sedated by forced medication , faced his two - day capital trial alone – representing himself without even standby counsel to help him .
Wearing prison garb and sunglasses , Taylor called no witnesses , introduced no evidence , and presented no defense .
The few cross-examination questions he posed during the guilt - innocence phase of his trial were delusional , and he was completely silent during the sentencing phase of the proceedings .
The jury that sentenced Taylor to death was never presented with compelling evidence of Taylor 's difficult childhood , suicide attempts , psychiatric hospitalizations or severe mental illness .
Taylor ’s appeal raises numerous legal challenges to the trial and proceedings leading up to it , including the judge ’s failure to hold a competency hearing during the trial when it was obvious that Taylor was incapable of standing trial and representing himself , said the ACLU .
In addition , the appeal challenges the trial judge ’s failure to question Taylor adequately about whether he wanted to waive his right to have the jury consider mitigating circumstances in his life , the judge 's failure to appoint standby counsel , and the judge 's ruling that Taylor could be forcibly medicated at trial .
Richard Taylor is represented on appeal by the ACLU ’s Stubbs and Kelly Gleason of the Office of the Tennessee Post - Conviction Defender .

A tiny reason , if you need one :
California has threatened to sue the feds for blocking efforts to raise fuel efficiency standards .
The Bush administration is accused of leaning on EPA and colluding with automakers in order to strangle California ’s attempt to get rid of their huge fucking smog problem .
Dear Bushie :
Thanks for the fucking help .
Ah , joy .
The Bush administration … which , not that long ago , was proclaiming their love for the environment … and some fucking stupid people out there actually seemed to believe them !!
Get some eyes , people , and put them in your head .
The adminstration says one thing and does another : do you need a goddamn map to a clue ?!
Sorry , I ’m just frustrated that we have n’t impeached the fucking fratboy clown and his evil puppetmaster , Cheney , yet .
What the fucking are we waiting for ?
A fucking sign from heaven that these assholes are up to no good ?!
The writings on the fucking wall , man .
Some people just too blind to see .
But seriously … what the fuck are we waiting for ? … for Dick Cheney to reveal that he eats skewered eight year old girls for breakfast every morning ?!! ….
We ’ve already guessed that !!!!
We ’re beyond the , “ Oh my goodness … the Bush adminstration seems to have violated a few teensy laws , and maybe launched ** oopsies !** a war that looks based on fraudulant reasons …
Leapin ’ Lords to Betsy !
He might be … ( gasp ! ) … a liar …. even a… a… villain ! ” phase , are n’t we ?
If somebody reading this just realized , YESTERDAY , that Bush is an asshole and a liar and a warmonger and a phony , then I would like to be the first to welcome you to planet Earth .
Welcome .
How was your stay in Lollypop Land ?
So why are n’t we impeaching the fucker yet ?
Gary Kamiya at Salon takes a stab at it .
You might not like what he finds …
But there ’s a deeper reason why the popular impeachment movement has never taken off — and it has to do not with Bush but with the American people .
Bush ’s warmongering spoke to something deep in our national psyche .
The emotional force behind America ’s support for the Iraq war , the molten core of an angry , resentful patriotism , is still too hot for Congress , the media and even many Americans who oppose the war , to confront directly .
It ’s a national myth .
It ’s John Wayne .
To impeach Bush would force us to directly confront our national core of violent self - righteousness — come to terms with it , understand it and reject it .
And we ’re not ready to do that .
If he ’s right then we ’d better come to grips with our problem — quick .
We do n’t have much time .
We ’re spiraling more each day into a the war - like fascist society the Bushies so desperately want to create .
They are programming us for war , for service and fealty , for unquestioning belief in their essential decency .
We do n’t want to dig too deep lest the knowledge prove too painful , right ?
Just sit back and watch some TV , citizen .
How many of you are prepared to go all the way ?
How far down into the abyss are you willing to go ? …
What if you ’re already in the abyss but you believe you ’re in a happier place , fresh like a green field in the summer .
Instead of putting a fragrant purple flower to your nose you ’ve actually got a tentacle of media infusion jammed down your throat and you ’re wallowing in a slimy , dark , nightmare pit of fear and frenzy .
You ’re Neo in the Matrix .
Once you take that red pill there ’s no going back .
You ca n’t really see the world the same way again .
Once you wake up you ’re simultaneously horrified and relieved , somehow .
Knowing the truth is not as hard as some make it seem .
But looking back at your actions may scare you more than anything .
Looking back at the zombie , so deluded , believing what they ’re saying …
What would you have done had you not become aware ?
People are at different levels of awareness .
Some people scoff when somebody brings up the Bush family ’s Nazi- associated past . …
Others see a pattern .
I urge you not to think of World War II as some distant , bronzed history which was most defintely a one - time deal , and which exists outside the normal flow of time as an idealized war faught against a horrific , satanic demigod .
Far from being the exception , Hitler is the norm .
Many world leaders are megalomaniacs .
It can happen here .
It has .
When you look at the similarities , its clear the neocons belong in the same camp as the Nazis .
Calling them Nazis is not some cheap smear or baseless insult .
It ’s God ’s honest truth .
As we awake to the potential of the world — the grand potential of a post - impeachment world — let ’s not be afraid of the darkness that lurks within .
The horrible truth should not be denied .
It must be embraced despite its terrible core .
May whatever deity you believe in grant you the strength to look into the gaping maw of refined , practiced and fully self - aware … evil .
… ( atheists should invest in some adult diapers )
Too many “ alternative fuels ” are just 21st century alchemy .
Alchemy was a wide ranging subject , but it is best known for the search for how to turn lead into gold .
While that may seem ridiculous today , it ’s not as moronic as it at first seems .
Both lead and gold are dense , malleable metals .
Lead can even take on a shine .
Without basic atomic theory , there ’s no way to know that they are both elements and therefore immutable in non-nuclear reactions .
But the heart of the quest was , in the end , a search for the “ trick . ”
There was some “ trick ” that would let you turn lead into gold , and transform your life into one of fame and riches .
This belief in the “ trick ” has lived on long after alchemy was dissolved by modern chemistry ( and that minor branch of physical chemistry known as “ physics ” ) .
It lives on in get - rich - quick schemes and easy weight - loss plans .
And in a lot of alternative fuel proposals .
Recent reddit submissions that have gotten some momentum include one to use boron to fuel our cars , and another that proposes aluminum .
Both proposals have the same flaw–how do you get the boron and aluminum in the first place ?
But those kinds of proposals gain attention and support because they buy into the “ trick ” ethos .
The “ trick ” is to use something other than oil–as long as we do that , we ’ll come out ahead !
Energy comes from one place and one place only : nuclear fusion .
Every energy source you can name can eventually be tracked back to nuclear fusion , either occurring inside a nuclear plant , or some star .
People need to stop worrying about new “ sources ” of energy .
There ’s only one .
It ’s just a question of how efficiently you convert that energy from the primal source into one you can use .
And forget about freakin’ cars , people !
The majority of energy you consume is not the gasoline you burn in your car .
It ’s all the electrical appliances , computers and various toys in your home .
Do n’t believe me ?
Go buy a gasoline - powered generator and try to run your home on it with one tank of gas .
A tank of gas probably lasts you almost a week in your car .
It wo n’t last a day running your house .
Efficient electricity with minimal environmental impact is the goal .
Once you have that , the rest is simply a straight - forward problem of how to covert that into a usable form for any application you may have .
Give up on the alchemy of “ alternative fuels . ”
Do n’t be fooled by the use of exotic materials , or big words , or good - old - fashioned PR bullshit like “ The hydrogen economy . ”
Repeat after me : “ Efficient electricity with minimal environmental impact . ”
If the solution someone ’s trying to sell you does n’t solve that problem , they ’re wasting your time , energy and money .

Philosophers have become interested in connectionism because it promises to provide an alternative to the classical theory of the mind : the widely held view that the mind is something akin to a digital computer processing a symbolic language .
Exactly how and to what extent the connectionist paradigm constitutes a challenge to classicism has been a matter of hot debate in recent years .
Connectionism is a movement in cognitive science that hopes to explain intellectual abilities using artificial neural networks ( also known as “ neural networks ” or “ neural nets ” ) .
Neural networks are simplified models of the brain composed of large numbers of units ( the analogs of neurons ) together with weights that measure the strength of connections between the units .
These weights model the effects of the synapses that link one neuron to another .
Experiments on models of this kind have demonstrated an ability to learn such skills as face recognition , reading , and the detection of simple grammatical structure .
A neural network consists of large number of units joined together in a pattern of connections .
Units in a net are usually segregated into three classes : input units , which receive information to be processed , output units where the results of the processing are found , and units in between called hidden units .
If a neural net were to model the whole human nervous system , the input units would be analogous to the sensory neurons , the output units to the motor neurons , and the hidden units to all other neurons .
Here is a simple illustration of a simple neural net :
Each input unit has an activation value that represents some feature external to the net .
An input unit sends its activation value to each of the hidden units to which it is connected .
Each of these hidden units calculates its own activation value depending on the activation values it receives from the input units .
This signal is then passed on to output units or to another layer of hidden units .
Those hidden units compute their activation values in the same way , and send them along to their neighbors .
Eventually the signal at the input units propagates all the way through the net to determine the activation values at all the output units .
The pattern of activation set up by a net is determined by the weights , or strength of connections between the units .
Weights may be either positive or negative .
A negative weight represents the inhibition of the receiving unit by the activity of a sending unit .
The activation value for each receiving unit is calculated according a simple activation function .
Activation functions vary in detail , but they all conform to the same basic plan .
The function sums together the contributions of all sending units , where the contribution of a unit is defined as the weight of the connection between the sending and receiving units times the sending unit ’s activation value .
This sum is usually modified further , for example , by adjusting the activation sum to a value between 0 and 1 and / or by setting the activation to zero unless a threshold level for the sum is reached .
Connectionists presume that cognitive functioning can be explained by collections of units that operate in this way .
Since it is assumed that all the units calculate pretty much the same simple activation function , human intellectual accomplishments must depend primarily on the settings of the weights between the units .
The kind of net illustrated above is called a feed forward net .
Activation flows directly from inputs to hidden units and then on to the output units .
More realistic models of the brain would include many layers of hidden units , and recurrent connections that send signals back from higher to lower levels .
Such recurrence is necessary in order to explain such cognitive features as short - term memory .
In a feed forward net , repeated presentations of the same input produce the same output every time , but even the simplest organisms habituate to ( or learn to ignore ) repeated presentation of the same stimulus .
Connectionists tend to avoid recurrent connections because little is understood about the general problem of training recurrent nets .
However Elman ( 1991 ) and others have made some progress with simple recurrent nets , where the recurrence is tightly constrained .
Finding the right set of weights to accomplish a given task is the central goal in connectionist research .
Luckily , learning algorithms have been devised that can calculate the right weights for carrying out many tasks ( see Hinton 1992 for an accessible review ) .
These fall into two broad categories : supervised and unsupervised learning .
Hebbian learning is the best known unsupervised form .
As each input is presented to the net , weights between nodes that are active together are increased , while those weights connecting nodes that are not active together are decreased .
This form of training is especially useful for building nets that can classify the input into useful categories .
The most widely used supervised algorithm is called backpropagation .
To use this method , one needs a training set consisting of many examples of inputs and their desired outputs for a given task .
This external set of examples “ supervises ” the training process .
If , for example , the task is to distinguish male from female faces , the training set might contain pictures of faces together with an indication of the sex of the person depicted in each one .
A net that can learn this task might have two output units ( indicating the categories male and female ) and many input units , one devoted to the brightness of each pixel ( tiny area ) in the picture .
The weights of the net to be trained are initially set to random values , and then members of the training set are repeatedly exposed to the net .
The values for the input of a member are placed on the input units and the output of the net is compared with the desired output for this member .
Then all the weights in the net are adjusted slightly in the direction that would bring the net ’s output values closer to the values for the desired output .
For example , when male ’s face is presented to the input units the weights are adjusted so that the value of the male output unit is increased and the value of the female output unit is decreased .
After many repetitions of this process the net may learn to produce the desired output for each input in the training set .
If the training goes well , the net may also have learned to generalize to the desired behavior for inputs and outputs that were not in the training set .
For example , it may do a good job of distinguishing males from females in pictures that were never presented to it before .
Training nets to model aspects of human intelligence is a fine art .
Success with backpropagation and other connectionist learning methods may depend on quite subtle adjustment of the algorithm and the training set .
Training typically involves hundreds of thousands of rounds of weight adjustment .
Given the limitations of computers in the past , training a net to perform an interesting task took days or even weeks .
More recently , the use of massively parallel dedicated processors ( GPUs ) has helped relieve these heavy computational burdens .
But even here , some limitations to connectionist theories of learning will remain to be faced .
Humans ( and many less intelligent animals ) display an ability to learn from single examples ; for example , a child shown a novel two - wheeled vehicle and given the name “ Segway ” , knows right away what a Segway is ( Lake , Zaremba et al. 2015 ) .
Connectionist learning techniques such as backpropagation are far from explaining this kind of “ one shot ” learning .
Connectionists have made significant progress in demonstrating the power of neural networks to master cognitive tasks .
Here are three well - known experiments that have encouraged connectionists to believe that neural networks are good models of human intelligence .
One of the most attractive of these efforts is Sejnowski and Rosenberg ’s 1987 work on a net that can read English text called NETtalk .
The training set for NETtalk was a large data base consisting of English text coupled with its corresponding phonetic output , written in a code suitable for use with a speech synthesizer .
Tapes of NETtalk ’s performance at different stages of its training are very interesting listening .
At first the output is random noise .
Later , the net sounds like it is babbling , and later still as though it is speaking English double - talk ( speech that is formed of sounds that resemble English words ) .
At the end of training , NETtalk does a fairly good job of pronouncing the text given to it .
Furthermore , this ability generalizes fairly well to text that was not presented in the training set .
Another influential early connectionist model was a net trained by Rumelhart and McClelland ( 1986 ) to predict the past tense of English verbs .
The task is interesting because although most of the verbs in English ( the regular verbs ) form the past tense by adding the suffix “ - ed ” , many of the most frequently verbs are irregular ( “ is ” / “ was ” , “ come ” / “ came ” , “ go ” / “ went ” ) .
The net was first trained on a set containing a large number of irregular verbs , and later on a set of 460 verbs containing mostly regulars .
The net learned the past tenses of the 460 verbs in about 200 rounds of training , and it generalized fairly well to verbs not in the training set .
It even showed a good appreciation of “ regularities ” to be found among the irregular verbs ( “ send ” / “ sent ” , “ build ” / “ built ” ; “ blow ” / “ blew ” , “ fly ” / “ flew ” ) .
During learning , as the system was exposed to the training set containing more regular verbs , it had a tendency to overregularize , i.e. , to combine both irregular and regular forms : ( “ break ” / “ broked ” , instead of “ break ” / “ broke ” ) .
This was corrected with more training .
It is interesting to note that children are known to exhibit the same tendency to overregularize during language learning .
However , there is hot debate over whether Rumelhart and McClelland ’s is a good model of how humans actually learn and process verb endings .
For example , Pinker and Prince ( 1988 ) point out that the model does a poor job of generalizing to some novel regular verbs .
They believe that this is a sign of a basic failing in connectionist models .
Nets may be good at making associations and matching patterns , but they have fundamental limitations in mastering general rules such as the formation of the regular past tense .
These complaints raise an important issue for connectionist modelers , namely whether nets can generalize properly to master cognitive tasks involving rules .
Despite Pinker and Prince ’s objections , many connectionists believe that generalization of the right kind is still possible ( Niklasson & van Gelder 1994 ) .
Elman ’s 1991 work on nets that can appreciate grammatical structure has important implications for the debate about whether neural networks can learn to master rules .
Elman trained a simple recurrent network to predict the next word in a large corpus of English sentences .
The sentences were formed from a simple vocabulary of 23 words using a subset of English grammar .
The grammar , though simple , posed a hard test for linguistic awareness .
It allowed unlimited formation of relative clauses while demanding agreement between the head noun and the verb .
So for example , in the sentence
Any man that chases dogs that chase cats … runs .
the singular “ man ” must agree with the verb “ runs ” despite the intervening plural nouns ( “ dogs ” , “ cats ” ) which might cause the selection of “ run ” .
One of the important features of Elman ’s model is the use of recurrent connections .
The values at the hidden units are saved in a set of so called context units , to be sent back to the input level for the next round of processing .
This looping back from hidden to input layers provides the net with a rudimentary form of memory of the sequence of words in the input sentence .
Elman ’s nets displayed an appreciation of the grammatical structure of sentences that were not in the training set .
The net ’s command of syntax was measured in the following way .
Predicting the next word in an English sentence is , of course , an impossible task .
However , these nets succeeded , at least by the following measure .
At a given point in an input sentence , the output units for words that are grammatical continuations of the sentence at that point should be active and output units for all other words should be inactive .
After intensive training , Elman was able to produce nets that displayed perfect performance on this measure including sentences not in the training set .
The work of Christiansen and Chater ( 1999a ) and Morris , Cottrell , and Elman ( 2000 ) extends this research to more complex grammars .
For a broader view of progress in connectionist natural language processing see summaries by Christiansen and Chater ( 1999 b ) , and Rohde and Plaut ( 2003 ) .
Although this performance is impressive , there is still a long way to go in training nets that can process a language like English .
Furthermore , doubts have been raised about the significance of Elman ’s results .
For example , Marcus ( 1998 , 2001 ) argues that Elman ’s nets are not able to generalize this performance to sentences formed from a novel vocabulary .
This , he claims , is a sign that connectionist models merely associate instances , and are unable to truly master abstract rules .
On the other hand , Phillips ( 2002 ) argues that classical architectures are no better off in this respect .
The purported inability of connectionist models to generalize performance in this way has become an important theme in the systematicity debate .
( See Section 7 below . )
A somewhat different concern about the adequacy of connectionist language processing focuses on tasks that mimic infant learning of simple artificial grammars .
Data on reaction time confirms that infants can learn to distinguish well - formed from ill - formed sentences in a novel language created by experimenters .
Shultz and Bale ( 2001 ) report success in training neural nets on the same task .
Vilcu and Hadley ( 2005 ) object that this work fails to demonstrate true acquisition of the grammar , but see Shultz and Bale ( 2006 ) for a detailed reply .
Philosophers are interested in neural networks because they may provide a new framework for understanding the nature of the mind and its relation to the brain ( Rumelhart & McClelland 1986 : Chapter 1 ) .
Connectionist models seem particularly well matched to what we know about neurology .
The brain is indeed a neural net , formed from massively many units ( neurons ) and their connections ( synapses ) .
Furthermore , several properties of neural network models suggest that connectionism may offer an especially faithful picture of the nature of cognitive processing .
Neural networks exhibit robust flexibility in the face of the challenges posed by the real world .
Noisy input or destruction of units causes graceful degradation of function .
The net ’s response is still appropriate , though somewhat less accurate .
In contrast , noise and loss of circuitry in classical computers typically result in catastrophic failure .
Neural networks are also particularly well adapted for problems that require the resolution of many conflicting constraints in parallel .
There is ample evidence from research in artificial intelligence that cognitive tasks such as object recognition , planning , and even coordinated motion present problems of this kind .
Although classical systems are capable of multiple constraint satisfaction , connectionists argue that neural network models provide much more natural mechanisms for dealing with such problems .
Over the centuries , philosophers have struggled to understand how our concepts are defined .
It is now widely acknowledged that trying to characterize ordinary notions with necessary and sufficient conditions is doomed to failure .
Exceptions to almost any proposed definition are always waiting in the wings .
For example , one might propose that a tiger is a large black and orange feline .
But then what about albino tigers ?
Philosophers and cognitive psychologists have argued that categories are delimited in more flexible ways , for example via a notion of family resemblance or similarity to a prototype .
Connectionist models seem especially well suited to accommodating graded notions of category membership of this kind .
Nets can learn to appreciate subtle statistical patterns that would be very hard to express as hard and fast rules .
Connectionism promises to explain flexibility and insight found in human intelligence using methods that cannot be easily expressed in the form of exception free principles ( Horgan & Tienson 1989 , 1990 ) , thus avoiding the brittleness that arises from standard forms of symbolic representation .
Despite these intriguing features , there are some weaknesses in connectionist models that bear mentioning .
First , most neural network research abstracts away from many interesting and possibly important features of the brain .
For example , connectionists usually do not attempt to explicitly model the variety of different kinds of brain neurons , nor the effects of neurotransmitters and hormones .
Furthermore , it is far from clear that the brain contains the kind of reverse connections that would be needed if the brain were to learn by a process like backpropagation , and the immense number of repetitions needed for such training methods seems far from realistic .
Attention to these matters will probably be necessary if convincing connectionist models of human cognitive processing are to be constructed .
A more serious objection must also be met .
It is widely felt , especially among classicists , that neural networks are not particularly good at the kind of rule based processing that is thought to undergird language , reasoning , and higher forms of thought .
( For a well known critique of this kind see Pinker and Prince 1988 . )
We will discuss the matter further when we turn to the systematicity debate .
There has been a cottage industry in developing more biologically - plausible algorithms for error - driven training that can be shown to approximate the results of backpropagation without its implausible features .
Prominent examples include O’Reilly ’s Generalized Error Recirculation algorithm ( O’ Reilly 1996 ) , using randomized error signals rather than error signals individually computed for each neuron ( Lillicrap , Cownden , Tweed , & Akerman 2016 ) , and modifying weights using spike - timing dependent plasticity -- the latter of which has been a favorite of prominent figures in deep learning research ( Bengio et al. 2017 ) .
( For more on deep learning see section 11 below . )
The last forty years have been dominated by the classical view that ( at least higher ) human cognition is analogous to symbolic computation in digital computers .
On the classical account , information is represented by strings of symbols , just as we represent data in computer memory or on pieces of paper .
The connectionist claims , on the other hand , that information is stored non-symbolically in the weights , or connection strengths , between the units of a neural net .
The classicist believes that cognition resembles digital processing , where strings are produced in sequence according to the instructions of a ( symbolic ) program .
The connectionist views mental processing as the dynamic and graded evolution of activity in a neural net , each unit ’s activation depending on the connection strengths and activity of its neighbors .
On the face of it , these views seem very different .
However many connectionists do not view their work as a challenge to classicism and some overtly support the classical picture .
So - called implementational connectionists seek an accommodation between the two paradigms .
They hold that the brain ’s net implements a symbolic processor .
True , the mind is a neural net ; but it is also a symbolic processor at a higher and more abstract level of description .
So the role for connectionist research according to the implementationalist is to discover how the machinery needed for symbolic processing can be forged from neural network materials , so that classical processing can be reduced to the neural network account .
However , many connectionists resist the implementational point of view .
Such radical connectionists claim that symbolic processing was a bad guess about how the mind works .
They complain that classical theory does a poor job of explaining graceful degradation of function , holistic representation of data , spontaneous generalization , appreciation of context , and many other features of human intelligence which are captured in their models .
The failure of classical programming to match the flexibility and efficiency of human cognition is by their lights a symptom of the need for a new paradigm in cognitive science .
So radical connectionists would eliminate symbolic processing from cognitive science forever .
The controversy between radical and implementational connectionists is complicated by the invention of what are called hybrid connectionist architectures .
Here elements of classical symbolic processing are included in neural nets ( Wermter & Sun 2000 ) .
For example , Miikkulainen ( 1993 ) champions a complex collection of neural net modules that share data coded in activation patterns .
Since one of the modules acts as a memory , the system taken as a whole resembles a classical processor with separate mechanisms for storing and operating on digital “ words ” .
Smolensky ( 1990 ) is famous for inventing so called tensor product methods for simulating the process of variable binding , where symbolic information is stored at and retrieved from known “ locations ” .
More recently , Eliasmith ( 2013 ) has proposed complex and massive architectures that use what are called semantic pointers , which exhibit features of classical variable binding .
Once hybrid architectures such as these are on the table , it becomes more difficult to classify a given connectionist model as radical or merely implementational .
This opens the interesting prospect that whether symbolic processing is actually present in the human brain may turn out to be a matter of degree .
The disagreement concerning the degree to which human cognition involves symbolic processing is naturally embroiled with the innateness debate — whether higher level abilities such as language and reasoning are part of the human genetic endowment , or whether they are learned .
The success of connectionist models at learning tasks starting from randomly chosen weights gives heart to empiricists , who would think that the infant brain is able to construct intelligence from perceptual input using a simple learning mechanism ( Elman et al. 1996 ) .
On the other hand , nativists in the rationalist tradition argue that at least for grammar - based language , the poverty of perceptual stimulus ( Chomsky 1965 : 58 ) entails the existence of a genetically determined mechanism tailored to learning grammar .
However , the alignment between connectionism and non-nativism is not so clear - cut .
There is no reason that connectionist models cannot be interpreted from a nativist point of view , where the ongoing “ learning ” represents the process of evolutionary refinement from generation to generation of a species .
The idea that the human brain has domain specific knowledge that is genetically determined can be accommodated in the connectionist paradigm by biasing the initial weights of the models to make that knowledge easy or trivial to learn .
Connectionist research makes best contact with the innateness debate by providing a new strategy for disarming poverty of stimulus arguments .
Nativists argue that association of ideas , the mechanism for learning proposed by the traditional empiricist , is too slender a reed to support the development of higher level cognitive abilities .
They suppose that innate mechanisms are essential for learning ( for example ) a grammar of English from a child ’s linguistic input , because the statistical regularities available to “ mere association ” massively underdetermine that grammar .
Connectionism could support an empiricism here by providing a proof - of - concept that such structured knowledge can be learned from inputs available to humans using only learning mechanisms found in non-classical architectures .
Of course it is too soon to tell whether this promise can be realized .
Connectionist models provide a new paradigm for understanding how information might be represented in the brain .
A seductive but naive idea is that single neurons ( or tiny neural bundles ) might be devoted to the representation of each thing the brain needs to record .
For example , we may imagine that there is a grandmother neuron that fires when we think about our grandmother .
However , such local representation is not likely .
There is good evidence that our grandmother thought involves complex patterns of activity distributed across relatively large parts of cortex .
It is interesting to note that distributed , rather than local representations on the hidden units are the natural products of connectionist training methods .
The activation patterns that appear on the hidden units while NETtalk processes text serve as an example .
Analysis reveals that the net learned to represent such categories as consonants and vowels , not by creating one unit active for consonants and another for vowels , but rather in developing two different characteristic patterns of activity across all the hidden units .
Given the expectations formed from our experience with local representation on the printed page , distributed representation seems both novel and difficult to understand .
But the technique exhibits important advantages .
For example , distributed representations , ( unlike symbols stored in separate fixed memory locations ) remain relatively well preserved when parts of the model are destroyed or overloaded .
More importantly , since representations are coded in patterns rather than firings of individual units , relationships between representations are coded in the similarities and differences between these patterns .
So the internal properties of the representation carry information on what it is about ( Clark 1993 : 19 ) .
In contrast , local representation is conventional .
No intrinsic properties of the representation ( a unit ’s firing ) determine its relationships to the other symbols .
This self - reporting feature of distributed representations promises to resolve a philosophical conundrum about meaning .
In a symbolic representational scheme , all representations are composed out of symbolic atoms ( like words in a language ) .
Meanings of complex symbol strings may be defined by the way they are built up out of their constituents , but what fixes the meanings of the atoms ?
Connectionist representational schemes provide an end run around the puzzle by simply dispensing with atoms .
Every distributed representation is a pattern of activity across all the units , so there is no principled way to distinguish between simple and complex representations .
To be sure , representations are composed out of the activities of the individual units .
But none of these “ atoms ” codes for any symbol .
The representations are sub-symbolic in the sense that analysis into their components leaves the symbolic level behind .
The sub-symbolic nature of distributed representation provides a novel way to conceive of information processing in the brain .
If we model the activity of each neuron with a number , then the activity of the whole brain can be given by a giant vector ( or list ) of numbers , one for each neuron .
Both the brain ’s input from sensory systems and its output to individual muscle neurons can also be treated as vectors of the same kind .
So the brain amounts to a vector processor , and the problem of psychology is transformed into questions about which operations on vectors account for the different aspects of human cognition .
Sub -symbolic representation has interesting implications for the classical hypothesis that the brain must contain symbolic representations that are similar to sentences of a language .
This idea , often referred to as the language of thought ( or LOT ) thesis may be challenged by the nature of connectionist representations .
It is not easy to say exactly what the LOT thesis amounts to , but van Gelder ( 1990 ) offers an influential and widely accepted benchmark for determining when the brain should be said to contain sentence - like representations .
It is that when a representation is tokened one thereby tokens the constituents of that representation .
For example , if I write “ John loves Mary ” I have thereby written the sentence ’s constituents : “ John ” “ loves ” and “ Mary ” .
Distributed representations for complex expressions like “ John loves Mary ” can be constructed that do not contain any explicit representation of their parts ( Smolensky 1990 ) .
The information about the constituents can be extracted from the representations , but neural network models do not need to explicitly extract this information themselves in order to process it correctly ( Chalmers 1990 ) .
This suggests that neural network models serve as counterexamples to the idea that the language of thought is a prerequisite for human cognition .
However , the matter is still a topic of lively debate ( Fodor 1997 ) .
The novelty of distributed and superimposed connectionist information storage naturally causes one to wonder about the viability of classical notions of symbolic computation in describing the brain .
Ramsey ( 1997 ) argues that though we may attribute symbolic representations to neural nets , those attributions do not figure in legitimate explanations of the model ’s behavior .
This claim is important because the classical account of cognitive processing , ( and folk intuitions ) presume that representations play an explanatory role in understanding the mind .
It has been widely thought that cognitive science requires , by its very nature , explanations that appeal to representations ( Von Eckardt 2003 ) .
If Ramsey is right , the point may cut in two different ways .
Some may use it to argue for a new and non-classical understanding of the mind , while others would use it to argue that connectionism is inadequate since it cannot explain what it must .
However , Haybron ( 2000 ) argues against Ramsey that there is ample room for representations with explanatory role in radical connectionist architectures .
Roth ( 2005 ) makes the interesting point that contrary to first impressions , it may also make perfect sense to explain a net ’s behavior by reference to a computer program , even if there is no way to discriminate a sequence of steps of the computation through time .
The debate concerning the presence of classical representations and a language of thought has been clouded by lack of clarity in defining what should count as the representational “ vehicles ” in distributed neural models .
Shea ( 2007 ) makes the point that the individuation of distributed representations should be defined by the way activation patterns on the hidden units cluster together .
It is the relationships between clustering regions in the space of possible activation patterns that carry representational content , not the activations themselves , nor the collection of units responsible for the activation .
On this understanding , prospects are improved for locating representational content in neural nets that can be compared in nets of different architectures , that is causally involved in processing , and which overcomes some objections to holistic accounts of meaning .
In a series of papers Horgan and Tienson ( 1989 , 1990 ) have championed a view called representations without rules .
According to this view classicists are right to think that human brains ( and good connectionist models of them ) contain explanatorily robust representations ; but they are wrong to think that those representations enter in to hard and fast rules like the steps of a computer program .
The idea that connectionist systems may follow graded or approximate regularities ( “ soft laws ” as Horgan and Tienson call them ) is intuitive and appealing .
However , Aizawa ( 1994 ) argues that given an arbitrary neural net with a representation level description , it is always possible to outfit it with hard and fast representation - level rules .
Guarini ( 2001 ) responds that if we pay attention to notions of rule following that are useful to cognitive modeling , Aizawa ’s constructions will seem beside the point .
The major points of controversy in the philosophical literature on connectionism have to do with whether connectionists provide a viable and novel paradigm for understanding the mind .
One complaint is that connectionist models are only good at processing associations .
But such tasks as language and reasoning cannot be accomplished by associative methods alone and so connectionists are unlikely to match the performance of classical models at explaining these higher - level cognitive abilities .
However , it is a simple matter to prove that neural networks can do anything that symbolic processors can do , since nets can be constructed that mimic a computer ’s circuits .
So the objection can not be that connectionist models are unable to account for higher cognition ; it is rather that they can do so only if they implement the classicist ’s symbolic processing tools .
Implementational connectionism may succeed , but radical connectionists will never be able to account for the mind .
Fodor and Pylyshyn ’s often cited paper ( 1988 ) launches a debate of this kind .
They identify a feature of human intelligence called systematicity which they feel connectionists cannot explain .
The systematicity of language refers to the fact that the ability to produce / understand / think some sentences is intrinsically connected to the ability to produce / understand / think others of related structure .
For example , no one with a command of English who understands “ John loves Mary ” can fail to understand “ Mary loves John . ”
From the classical point of view , the connection between these two abilities can easily be explained by assuming that masters of English represent the constituents ( “ John ” , “ loves ” and “ Mary ” ) of “ John loves Mary ” and compute its meaning from the meanings of these constituents .
If this is so , then understanding a novel sentence like “ Mary loves John ” can be accounted for as another instance of the same symbolic process .
In a similar way , symbolic processing would account for the systematicity of reasoning , learning and thought .
It would explain why there are no people who are capable of concluding P from P & ( Q & R ) , but incapable of concluding P from P & Q , why there are no people capable of learning to prefer a red cube to green square who cannot learn to prefer a green cube to the red square , and why there is n’t anyone who can think that John loves Mary who ca n’t also think that Mary loves John .
Fodor and McLaughlin ( 1990 ) argue in detail that connectionists do not account for systematicity .
Although connectionist models can be trained to be systematic , they can also be trained , for example , to recognize “ John loves Mary ” without being able to recognize “ Mary loves John . ”
Since connectionism does not guarantee systematicity , it does not explain why systematicity is found so pervasively in human cognition .
Systematicity may exist in connectionist architectures , but where it exists , it is no more than a lucky accident .
The classical solution is much better , because in classical models , pervasive systematicity comes for free .
The charge that connectionist nets are disadvantaged in explaining systematicity has generated a lot of interest .
Chalmers ( 1993 ) points out that Fodor and Pylyshyn ’s argument proves too much , for it entails that all neural nets , even those that implement a classical architecture , do not exhibit systematicity .
Given the uncontroversial conclusion that the brain is a neural net , it would follow that systematicity is impossible in human thought .
Another often mentioned point of rebuttal ( Aizawa 1997 b ; Matthews 1997 ; Hadley 1997b ) is that classical architectures do no better at explaining systematicity .
There are also classical models that can be programmed to recognize “ John loves Mary ” without being able to recognize “ Mary loves John , ” for this depends on exactly which symbolic rules govern the classical processing .
The point is that neither the use of connectionist architecture alone nor the use of classical architecture alone enforces a strong enough constraint to explain pervasive systematicity .
In both architectures , further assumptions about the nature of the processing must be made to ensure that “ Mary loves John ” and “ John loves Mary ” are treated alike .
A discussion of this point should mention Fodor and McLaughlin ’s requirement that systematicity be explained as a matter of nomic necessity , that is , as a matter of natural law .
The complaint against connectionists is that while they may implement systems that exhibit systematicity , they will not have explained it unless it follows from their models as a nomic necessity .
However , the demand for nomic necessity is a very strong one , and one that classical architectures clearly cannot meet either .
So the only tactic for securing a telling objection to connectionists along these lines would be to weaken the requirement on the explanation of systematicity to one which classical architectures can and connectionists cannot meet .
A convincing case of this kind has yet to be made .
As the systematicity debate has evolved , attention has been focused on defining the benchmarks that would answer Fodor and Pylyshyn ’s challenge .
Hadley ( 1994a , 1994b ) distinguishes three brands of systematicity .
Connectionists have clearly demonstrated the weakest of these by showing that neural nets can learn to correctly recognize novel sequences of words ( e.g. , “ Mary loves John ” ) that were not in the training set .
However , Hadley claims that a convincing rebuttal must demonstrate strong systematicity , or better , strong semantical systematicity .
Strong systematicity would require ( at least ) that “ Mary loves John ” be recognized even if “ Mary ” never appears in the subject position in any sentence in the training set .
Strong semantical systematicity would require as well that the net show abilities at correct semantical processing of the novel sentences rather than merely distinguishing grammatical from ungrammatical forms .
Niklasson and van Gelder ( 1994 ) have claimed success at strong systematicity , though Hadley complains that this is at best a borderline case .
Hadley and Hayward ( 1997 ) tackle strong semantical systematicity , but by Hadley ’s own admission it is not clear that they have avoided the use of a classical architecture .
Boden and Niklasson ( 2000 ) claim to have constructed a model that meets at least the spirit of strong semantical systematicity , but Hadley ( 2004 ) argues that even strong systematicity has not been demonstrated there .
Whether one takes a positive or a negative view of these attempts , it is safe to say that no one has met the challenge of providing a neural net capable of learning complex semantical processing that generalizes to a full range of truly novel inputs .
Research on nets that clearly demonstrate strong systematicity has continued .
Jansen and Watter ( 2012 ) provide a good summary of more recent efforts along these lines , and propose an interesting basis for solving the problem .
They use a more complex architecture that combines unsupervised self - organizing maps with features of simple recurrent nets .
However , the main innovation is to allow codes for the words being processed to represent sensory - motor features of what the words represent .
Once trained , their nets displayed very good accuracy in distinguishing the grammatical features of sentences whose words never even appeared in the training set .
This may appear to be cheating since the word codes might surreptitiously represent grammatical categories , or at least they may unfairly facilitate learning those categories .
Jansen and Watter note however , that the sensory - motor features of what a word represents are apparent to a child who has just acquired a new word , and so that information is not off - limits in a model of language learning .
They make the interesting observation that a solution to the systematicity problem may require including sources of environmental information that have so far been ignored in theories of language learning .
This work complicates the systematicity debate , since it opens a new worry about what information resources are legitimate in responding to the challenge .
However , this reminds us that architecture alone ( whether classical or connectionist ) is not going to solve the systematicity problem in any case , so the interesting questions concern what sources of supplemental information are needed to make the learning of grammar possible .
Kent Johnson ( 2004 ) argues that the whole systematicity debate is misguided .
Attempts at carefully defining the systematicity of language or thought leaves us with either trivialities or falsehoods .
Connectionists surely have explaining to do , but Johnson recommends that it is fruitless to view their burden under the rubric of systematicity .
Aizawa ( 2014 ) also suggests the debate is no longer germane given the present climate in cognitive science .
What is needed instead is the development of neurally plausible connectionist models capable of processing a language with a recursive syntax , which react immediately to the introduction of new items in the lexicon without introducing the features of classical architecture .
The “ systematicity ” debate may have already gone as Johnson advises , for Hadley ’s demand for strong semantical systematicity may be thought of as the requirement that connectionists exhibit success in that direction .
Recent work ( Loula , Baroni , & Lake 2018 ) sheds new light on the controversy .
Here recurrent neural nets were trained to interpret complex commands in a simple language that includes primitives such as “ jump ” , “ walk ” , “ left ” , “ right ” , “ opposite ” and “ around ” .
“ Opposite ” is interpreted as a request to perform a command twice , and “ around ” to do so four times .
So “ jump around left ” requests a left jump four times .
The authors report that their nets showed very accurate generalization at tasks that qualify for demonstrating strong semantic systematicity .
The nets correctly parsed commands in the test set containing “ jump around right ” even though this phrase never appeared in the training set .
Nevertheless the net ’s failures at more challenging tasks point to limitations in their abilities to generalize in ways that would demonstrate genuine systematicity .
The nets exhibited very poor performance when commands in the test set were longer ( or even shorter ) , than those presented in the training set .
So they appeared unable to spontaneously compose the meaning of complex expressions from the meanings of their parts .
New research is needed to understand the nature of these failures , whether they can be overcome in non-classical architectures , and the extent to which humans would exhibit similar mistakes under analogous circumstances .
It has been almost thirty years since the systematicity debate first began , with over 3,000 citations to Fodor and Pylyshyn ’s original paper .
So this brief account is necessarily incomplete .
Aizawa ( 2003 ) provides an excellent view of the literature , and Calvo and Symons ( 2014 ) serves as another more recent resource .
One of the attractions of distributed representations in connectionist models is that they suggest a solution to the problem of providing a theory of how brain states could have meaning .
The idea is that the similarities and differences between activation patterns along different dimensions of neural activity record semantical information .
So the similarity properties of neural activations provide intrinsic properties that determine meaning .
However , when it comes to compositional linguistic representations , Fodor and Lepore ( 1992 : Ch. 6 ) challenge similarity based accounts , on two fronts .
The first problem is that human brains presumably vary significantly in the number of and connections between their neurons .
Although it is straightforward to define similarity measures on two nets that contain the same number of units , it is harder to see how this can be done when the basic architectures of two nets differ .
The second problem Fodor and Lepore cite is that even if similarity measures for meanings can be successfully crafted , they are inadequate to the task of meeting the desiderata which a theory of meaning must satisfy .
Churchland ( 1998 ) shows that the first of these two objections can be met .
Citing the work of Laakso and Cottrell ( 2000 ) he explains how similarity measures between activation patterns in nets with radically different structures can be defined .
Not only that , Laakso and Cottrell show that nets of different structures trained on the same task develop activation patterns which are strongly similar according to the measures they recommend .
This offers hope that empirically well defined measures of similarity of concepts and thoughts across different individuals might be forged .
On the other hand , the development of a traditional theory of meaning based on similarity faces severe obstacles ( Fodor & Lepore 1999 ) , for such a theory would be required to assign sentences truth conditions based on an analysis of the meaning of their parts , and it is not clear that similarity alone is up to such tasks as fixing denotation in the way a standard theory demands .
However , most connectionists who promote similarity based accounts of meaning reject many of the presupposition of standard theories .
They hope to craft a working alternative which either rejects or modifies those presuppositions while still being faithful to the data on human linguistic abilities .
Calvo Garzón ( 2003 ) complains that there are reasons to think that connectionists must fail .
Churchland ’s response has no answer to the collateral information challenge .
That problem is that the measured similarities between activation patterns for a concept ( say : grandmother ) in two human brains are guaranteed to be very low because two people ’s ( collateral ) information on their grandmothers ( name , appearance , age , character ) is going to be very different .
If concepts are defined by everything we know , then the measures for activation patterns of our concepts are bound to be far apart .
This is a truly deep problem in any theory that hopes to define meaning by functional relationships between brain states .
Philosophers of many stripes must struggle with this problem .
Given the lack of a successfully worked out theory of concepts in either traditional or connectionist paradigms , it is only fair to leave the question for future research .
Another important application of connectionist research to philosophical debate about the mind concerns the status of folk psychology .
Folk psychology is the conceptual structure that we spontaneously apply to understanding and predicting human behavior .
For example , knowing that John desires a beer and that he believes that there is one in the refrigerator allows us to explain why John just went into the kitchen .
Such knowledge depends crucially on our ability to conceive of others as having desires and goals , plans for satisfying them , and beliefs to guide those plans .
The idea that people have beliefs , plans and desires is a commonplace of ordinary life ; but does it provide a faithful description of what is actually to be found in the brain ?
Its defenders will argue that folk psychology is too good to be false ( Fodor 1988 : Ch. 1 ) .
What more can we ask for the truth of a theory than that it provides an indispensable framework for successful negotiations with others ?
On the other hand , eliminativists will respond that the useful and widespread use of a conceptual scheme does not argue for its truth ( Churchland 1989 : Ch. 1 ) .
Ancient astronomers found the notion of celestial spheres useful ( even essential ) to the conduct of their discipline , but now we know that there are no celestial spheres .
From the eliminativists ’ point of view , an allegiance to folk psychology , like allegiance to folk ( Aristotelian ) physics , stands in the way of scientific progress .
A viable psychology may require as radical a revolution in its conceptual foundations as is found in quantum mechanics .
Eliminativists are interested in connectionism because it promises to provide a conceptual foundation that might replace folk psychology .
For example Ramsey , Stich , & Garon ( 1991 ) have argued that certain feed - forward nets show that simple cognitive tasks can be performed without employing features that could correspond to beliefs , desires and plans .
Presuming that such nets are faithful to how the brain works , concepts of folk psychology fare no better than do celestial spheres .
Whether connectionist models undermine folk psychology in this way is still controversial .
There are two main lines of response to the claim that connectionist models support eliminativist conclusions .
One objection is that the models used by Ramsey et al. are feed forward nets , which are too weak to explain some of the most basic features of cognition such as short term memory .
Ramsey et al. have not shown that beliefs and desires must be absent in a class of nets adequate for human cognition .
A second line of rebuttal challenges the claim that features corresponding to beliefs and desires are necessarily absent even in the feed forward nets at issue ( Von Eckardt 2005 ) .
The question is complicated further by disagreements about the nature of folk psychology .
Many philosophers treat the beliefs and desires postulated by folk psychology as brain states with symbolic contents .
For example , the belief that there is a beer in the refrigerator is thought to be a brain state that contains symbols corresponding to beer and a refrigerator .
From this point of view , the fate of folk psychology is strongly tied to the symbolic processing hypothesis .
So if connectionists can establish that brain processing is essentially non-symbolic , eliminativist conclusions will follow .
On the other hand , some philosophers do not think folk psychology is essentially symbolic , and some would even challenge the idea that folk psychology is to be treated as a theory in the first place .
Under this conception , it is much more difficult to forge links between results in connectionist research and the rejection of folk psychology .
As connectionist research has matured from its “ Golden Age ” in the 1980s , the main paradigm has radiated into a number of distinct approaches .
Two important trends worth mention are predicative coding and deep learning ( which will be covered in the following section ) .
Predictive coding is a well - established information processing tool with a wide range of applications .
It is useful , for example , in compressing the size of data sets .
Suppose you wish to transmit a picture of a landscape with a blue sky .
Since most of the pixels in the top half of your image are roughly the same shade , it is very inefficient to record the color value ( say Red : 46 Green : 78 Blue : FF in hexadecimal ) over and over again for each pixel in the top half of the image .
Since the value of one pixel strongly predicts the value of its neighbor , the efficient thing to do is record at each pixel location , the difference between the predicted value ( an average of its neighbors ) and the actual value for that pixel .
( In the case of representing an even shaded sky , we would only need to record the blue value once , followed by lots of zeros . )
This way , major coding resources are only needed to keep track of points in the image ( such as edges ) where there are large changes , that is points of “ surprise ” or “ unexpected ” variation .
It is well known that early visual processing in the brain involves taking differences between nearby values , ( for example , to identify visual boundaries ) .
It is only natural then to explore how the brain might take advantage of predictive coding in perception , inference , or even action .
( See Clark 2013 for an excellent summary and entry point to the literature . )
There is wide variety in the models presented in the predictive coding paradigm , and they tend to be specified at a higher level of generality than are connectionist models so far discussed .
Assume we have a neural net with input , hidden and output levels that has been trained on a task ( say face recognition ) and so presumably has information about faces stored in the weights connecting the hidden level nodes .
Three features would classify this net as a predictive coding ( PC ) model .
First , the model will have downward connections from the higher levels that are able to predict the next input for that task .
( The prediction might be a representation of a generic face . )
Second , the data sent to the higher levels for a given input is not the value recorded at the input nodes , but the difference between the predicted values and the values actually present .
( So in the example , the data provided tracks the differences between the face to be recognized and the generic face . )
In this way the data being received by the net is already preprocessed for coding efficiency .
Third , the model is trained by adjusting the weights in such a way that the error is minimized at the inputs .
In other words , the trained net reduces as much as possible the “ surprise ” registered in the difference between the raw input and its prediction .
In so doing it comes to be able to predict the face of the individual to be recognized to eliminate the error .
Some advocates of predictive coding models suggest that this scheme provides a unified account of all cognitive phenomena , including perception , reasoning , planning and motor control .
By minimizing prediction error in interacting with the environment , the net is forced to develop the conceptual resources to model the causal structure of the external world , and so navigate that world more effectively .
The predictive coding ( PC ) paradigm has attracted a lot of attention .
There is ample evidence that PC models capture essential details of visual function in the mammalian brain ( Rao & Ballard 1999 ; Huang & Rao 2011 ) .
For example , when trained on typical visual input , PC models spontaneously develop functional areas for edge , orientation and motion detection known to exist in visual cortex .
This work also raises the interesting point that the visual architecture may develop in response to the statistics of the scenes being encountered , so that organisms in different environments have visual systems specially tuned to their needs .
It must be admitted that there is still no convincing evidence that the essential features of PC models are directly implemented as anatomical structures in the brain .
Although it is conjectured that superficial pyramidal cells may transmit prediction error , and deep pyramidal cells predictions , we do not know that that is how they actually function .
On the other hand , PC models do appear more neurally plausible than backpropagation architectures , for there is no need for a separate process of training on an externally provided set of training samples .
Instead , predictions replace the role of the training set , so that learning and interacting with the environment are two sides of a unified unsupervised process .
PC models also show promise for explaining higher - level cognitive phenomena .
An often - cited example is binocular rivalry .
When presented with entirely different images in two eyes , humans report an oscillation between the two images as each in turn comes into “ focus ” .
The PC explanation is that the system succeeds in eliminating error by predicting the scene for one eye , but only to increase the error for the other eye .
So the system is unstable , “ hunting ” from one prediction to the other .
Predictive coding also has a natural explanation for why we are unaware of our blind spot , for the lack of input in that area amounts to a report of no error , with the result that one perceives “ more of the same ” .
PC accounts of attention have also been championed .
For example , Hohwy ( 2012 ) notes that realistic PC models , which must tolerate noisy inputs , need to include parameters that track the desired precision to be used in reporting error .
So PC models need to make predictions of the error precision relevant for a given situation .
Hohwy explores the idea that mechanisms for optimizing precision expectations map onto those that account for attention , and argues that attentional phenomena such as change blindness can be explained within the PC paradigm .
Predictive coding has interesting implications for themes in the philosophy of cognitive science .
By integrating the processes of top - down prediction with bottom - up error detection , the PC account of perception views it as intrinsically theory - laden .
Deployment of the conceptual categorization of the world embodied in higher levels of the net is essential to the very process of gathering data about the world .
This underscores , as well , tight linkages between belief , imaginative abilities , and perception ( Grush 2004 ) .
The PC paradigm also tends to support situated or embodied conceptions of cognition , for it views action as a dynamic interaction between the organism ’s effects on the environment , its predictions concerning those effects ( its plans ) , and its continual monitoring of error , which provides feedback to help ensure success .
It is too early to evaluate the importance and scope of PC models in accounting for the various aspects of cognition .
Providing a unified theory of brain function in general is , after all , an impossibly high standard .
Clark ’s target article ( 2013 ) provides a useful forum for airing complaints against PC models and some possible responses .
One objection that is often heard is that an organism with a PC brain can be expected to curl up in a dark room and die , for this is the best way to minimize error at its sensory inputs .
However , that view may take too narrow a view of the sophistication of the predictions available to the organism .
If it is to survive at all , its genetic endowment coupled with what it can learn along the way may very well endow it with the expectation that it go out and seek needed resources in the environment .
Minimizing error for that prediction of its behavior will get it out of the dark room .
However , it remains to be seen whether a theory of biological urges is usefully recast in PC terminology in this way , or whether PC theory is better characterized as only part of the explanation .
Another complaint is that the top - down influence on our perception coupled with the constraint that the brain receives error signals rather than raw data would impose an unrealistic divide between a represented world of fantasy and the world as it really is .
It is hard to evaluate whether that qualifies as a serious objection .
Were PC models actually to provide an account of our phenomenological experience , and characterize the relations between that experience and what we count as real , then skeptical conclusions to be drawn would count as features of the view rather than objections to it .
A number of responders to Clark ’s target article also worry that PC - models count as overly general .
In trying to explain everything they explain nothing .
Without sufficient constraints on the architecture , it is too easy to pretend to explain cognitive phenomena by merely redescribing them in a story written in the vocabulary of prediction , comparison , error minimization , and optimized precision .
The real proof of the pudding will come with the development of more complex and detailed computer models in the PC framework that are biologically plausible , and able to demonstrate the defining features of cognition .
One of the most dramatic features in the Wysession et. al global mantle shear - wave attenuation model is a very high - attenuation anomaly at the top of the lower mantle beneath eastern Asia .
This anomaly is believed due to water that has been pumped into the lower mantle via the long history of the subduction of oceanic lithosphere — crust and upper mantle — in this region .
The left figure is a slice through the earth , showing the attenuation anomalies within the mantle .
The location of the slice — red line in the upper right figure — is a map of the seismic attenuation at a depth of roughly 620 miles .
In both images , red shows unusually soft and weak rock , and blue shows unusually stiff rock ( yellow and white show near - average values ) .
The two figures in the lower right are resolution tests to see if the data have the resolution to retrieve Earth structure in these parts of the Earth .
The sharper the black - white transitions are , the better the resolution is .

A seismologist at Washington University in St. Louis has made the first 3 - D model of seismic wave damping — diminishing — deep in the Earth 's mantle and has revealed the existence of an underground water reservoir at least the volume of the Arctic Ocean .
It is the first evidence for water existing in the Earth 's deep mantle .
Michael E. Wysession , Ph.D. , Washington University professor of earth and planetary sciences in Arts & Sciences , working with former graduate student Jesse Lawrence ( now at the University of California , San Diego ) , analyzed 80,000 shear waves from more than 600,000 seismograms and found a large area in Earth 's lower mantle beneath eastern Asia where water is damping out , or attenuating , seismic waves from earthquakes .
The traditional method seismologists use to image the Earth below us is to measure the speed of seismic waves .
This will provide a sort of CAT scan of the Earth 's core and mantle .
Using wave speeds alone is a problem , however , because they cannot distinguish between temperature and composition variations .
The research is described in a forthcoming monograph , Earth 's Deep Water Cycle , which is in press to be published by the American Geophysical Union .
Analyzing damped - out waves
An increasingly popular method , which Wysession used , is to analyze the way waves damp out from their source .
If you take a hammer and pound it hard on a desk , waves will go from the source to the end of the table with the mass of the table lessening , or attenuating , the power of waves .
A picture near the striking point might topple , but a stapler two feet away might not even budge .
Attenuation data tell seismologists how stiff a region is , which is a function of how hot it is and how much water it contains .
Looking at the seismic wave speeds and attenuation at the same time can tell whether an anomaly is due to temperature or water .
In analyzing the data , Wysession first saw large patterns associated with known areas where the ocean floor is sinking down into the earth .
Beneath Asia , the fallen Pacific sea floor piles up at the base of the mantle .
Right above that he observed an " incredibly highly attenuating region , that is both very damping and slightly slow , " he said .
" Water slows the speed of waves a little .
Lots of damping and a little slowing match the predictions for water very well . "
Previous predictions calculated that a cold ocean slab sinking into the earth at 1,200 to 1,4000 kilometers beneath the surface would release water in the rock that would escape the rock and rise up to a region above it , but this was never previously observed .
Beijing anomaly
" That is exactly what we show here , the exact depth and high attenuation amounts right above it , " Wysession said .
" I call it the Beijing anomaly .
Water inside the rock goes down with the sinking slab and it's quite cold , but it heats up the deeper it goes , and the rock eventually becomes unstable and loses its water .
The water then rises up into the overlying region , which becomes saturated with water .
" If you combine the volume of this anomaly with the fact that the rock can hold up to about 0.1 percent of water , that works out to be about an Arctic Ocean 's worth of water . "
In recent years , seismologists have become excited at the possibility of a feature like the Beijing anomaly .
The availability of vast amounts of digital seismograms made possible the discovery by Wysession and Lawrence , who wrote many thousands of lines of computer codes to do the analyses .
Seventy percent of the earth is covered by water , which is very important for the earth 's geology , serving as a lubricant that allows efficient convection and plate tectonics and the continental collisions that form mountains .
" Water is like a lubricant , constantly oiling the machine of mantle convection which then drives plate tectonics and causes the continents to move about Earth 's surface , " Wysession said .
" Look at our sister planet , Venus .
It is very hot and dry inside Venus , and Venus has no plate tectonics .
All the water probably boiled off , and without water , there are no plates .
The system is locked up , like a rusty Tin Man with no oil . "

WHITE PLAINS  Jeffrey Deskovic walked free for the first time in nearly 16 years yesterday after his conviction was thrown out in the rape and murder of a Peekskill High School classmate .
The 32 - year - old was cleared in the death of Angela Correa because another man confessed to the crime after more sophisticated DNA testing linked him to the girl 's death .
Authorities would not identify the suspect but said he is serving a life sentence for his conviction in an unrelated Westchester County homicide .
" There was a long time that I felt this day would never come , " Deskovic said after leaving the Westchester County Courthouse .
" It has n't hit me yet .
I 'm still waiting to wake up . "
Deskovic 's conviction and 15 - year - to - life prison sentence were vacated in a brief court hearing by acting state Supreme Court Justice Richard Molea at the request of lawyers from the Innocence Project , a legal clinic of Benjamin N. Cardozo Law School that has now exonerated 184 inmates through DNA testing .
" We are here today to correct , as best we can , a terrible injustice that was done to Jeffrey Deskovic 17 years ago , " said one of the lawyers , Nina Morrison .
" We are humbled by what Mr. Deskovic has gone through . "
Assistant District Attorney Patricia Murphy said prosecutors joined in the motion " unequivocally " when it was clear the evidence pointed to someone else , and they planned to charge the new suspect .
The gallery of relatives and law school students associated with the Innocence Project broke into loud applause when Molea then ordered Deskovic 's release .
The former inmate , wearing a full beard he has grown since converting to Islam , slumped in his chair , hugged Morrison and sat back down before spending a few moments with his mother , aunts and uncles .
Deskovic then walked outside and spoke to the media for nearly two hours , seemingly offering all the things he wanted to say when reporters were ignoring his pleas from prison .

I 'm standing here in front of you despite the system , " he said .
He expressed resentment at police who forced him to falsely confess , a prosecutor who did not drop the case when DNA results suggested he should , jurors who ignored the forensic evidence and the judge who could have set aside the verdict but did n't .
And he remained frustrated by the years of failure at the appellate level that ended only after the Innocence Project took on his case .
" I hit a wall and became very depressed , " he said .
He was asked if he was angry .
" The people I considered to be friends all left me .
Prison is isolating .
My family has become strangers to me , " he said , adding that he lost the chance to marry a woman he loved .
" I do n't need to answer .
Just answer yourself .
Would any of you be angry ? "
He said he invented defense mechanisms for dealing with prison life , played lots of chess and wrote much of a book , " Inside the Mind of the Wrongfully Convicted . "
And after years of lousy prison food , he was looking forward to his first meal on the outside  mussels in fra diavolo sauce .
At Graziella 's a few blocks from the courthouse later , he got his seafood and a Neopolitan for dessert  improvised because it was n't on the menu .
Surrounded by his family and several Innocence Project lawyers , he found one vestige of prison life he could not shake .
They wanted to put him in the center of the room , but Deskovic chose the end of the table where his back would be against the window so nobody could walk up on him from behind .
His mother , Linda McGarr , said she expects it will take some time for him to get acclimated .
" My prayers were answered .
I never gave up hope because I knew he was innocent , " she said .
" I 'm just so happy to have him back .
He 's gone through so much , and so have I . "
Deskovic spoke of never getting back the years he lost , though he managed to get an associate degree and was working toward a bachelor 's degree in psychology .
He is considering going to law school but only if he can work for the Innocence Project , and might also try to become a psychotherapist .
He was looking forward to sitting on a porch last night to watch the sunset , without having to worry about " lights - out " time or where he had to be in prison .
And Deskovic gave condolences to Correa 's family , and thanked family members for never rushing to judgment about him , as others had .
" I lost a large part of my life , which makes me a victim .
They lost a daughter , my heart goes out to them . "
The girl 's partially clad body was discovered Nov. 17 , 1989 , under leaves and twigs in the woods behind Peekskill 's Hillcrest Elementary School .

They claimed he constantly went to them , offering information , and knew some key details that had not been disclosed .

WHITE PLAINS  Jeffrey Deskovic walked free for the first time in nearly 16 years yesterday after his conviction was thrown out in the rape and murder of a Peekskill High School classmate .
The 32 - year - old was cleared in the death of Angela Correa because another man confessed to the crime after more sophisticated DNA testing linked him to the girl 's death .
Authorities would not identify the suspect but said he is serving a life sentence for his conviction in an unrelated Westchester County homicide .
"
There was a long time that I felt this day would never come , " Deskovic said after leaving the Westchester County Courthouse .
" It has n't hit me yet .
I 'm still waiting to wake up .
" Deskovic 's conviction and 15 - year - to - life prison sentence were vacated in a brief court hearing by acting state Supreme Court Justice Richard Molea at the request of lawyers from the Innocence Project , a legal clinic of Benjamin N. Cardozo Law School that has now exonerated 184 inmates through DNA testing .
" We are here today to correct , as best we can , a terrible injustice that was done to Jeffrey Deskovic 17 years ago , " said one of the lawyers , Nina Morrison .
" We are humbled by what Mr. Deskovic has gone through .
" Assistant District Attorney Patricia Murphy said prosecutors joined in the motion " unequivocally " when it was clear the evidence pointed to someone else , and they planned to charge the new suspect .
The gallery of relatives and law school students associated with the Innocence Project broke into loud applause when Molea then ordered Deskovic 's release .
The former inmate , wearing a full beard he has grown since converting to Islam , slumped in his chair , hugged Morrison and sat back down before spending a few moments with his mother , aunts and uncles .
Deskovic then walked outside and spoke to the media for nearly two hours , seemingly offering all the things he wanted to say when reporters were ignoring his pleas from prison .
" I 'm not standing here before you because the system worked .
I 'm standing here in front of you despite the system , " he said .
He expressed resentment at police who forced him to falsely confess , a prosecutor who did not drop the case when DNA results suggested he should , jurors who ignored the forensic evidence and the judge who could have set aside the verdict but did n't .
And he remained frustrated by the years of failure at the appellate level that ended only after the Innocence Project took on his case .

An article published by theof White Plains , New York identifies the interrogator who extracted a false confession from Jeffrey Mark Deskovic as Thomas McIntyre .
It is not clear whether McIntyre was himself the polygrapher involved :
Female mice apparently become as randy as males after their sense of smell gets tampered with , aggressively trying to mount any mouse that moves , research now reveals .
These findings open the question as to whether circuits for male behavior exist dormant in females and vice versa elsewhere — including humans .
In many animals , the vomeronasal organ often helps detect scents .
In mice , it especially helps detect [ OU1 ] pheromones , molecules used to attract the opposite sex and to communicate other signals linked with social behavior , such as parenting or aggression .
The organ is found in the noses of practically all land animals with a backbone , except humans and other higher primates .
Key to helping signals from this organ travel up neurons to reach the brain is a gene called Trpc2 .
After they knocked out this gene in mice , Harvard molecular neuroscientist Catherine Dulac and her colleagues found that females displayed uniquely masculine sexual behaviors , such as chasing , mounting and thrusting pelvises against mice , both male and female , as well as giving out ultrasonic mating calls and sniffing derrieres .
" These results are flabbergasting , " Dulac said .
" Nobody had imagined that a simple mutation like this could induce females to behave so thoroughly like males . "
As to whether or not this applies to humans , especially since humans lack vomeronasal organs , " my guess is as good as yours , " Dulac told LiveScience .
Rodents are driven by smell , while " humans and higher primates are mostly visual — hence pornography ! "
The effect if female mutants was also seen when the researchers surgically removed the vomeronasal organs of normal mice .
The female rodents who had their sense of smell genetically or surgically short - circuited also abandoned typically maternal behaviors .
For instance , after giving birth , normal female mice spend about 80 percent of their time in their nest nursing their newborns , but the altered females readily wandered away after some two days of motherhood , eventually leaving the nest altogether .
While nursing mice ordinarily attack male intruders and reject their sexual advances , the mutant females were docile toward males and seemed highly receptive to their overtures .
Often the differences in behavior seen between the sexes in mammals are attributed to chemicals such as hormones .
These new findings suggest otherwise — the researchers found that female mice that had their sense of smell genetically or surgically hampered showed normal estrogen levels , testosterone levels and fertility cycles .
Dulac and her colleagues described their findings online August 5 in the journal Nature .
" Our work suggests that neuronal circuits underlying male - specific behaviors develop and persist in the female mouse brain , but are repressed by the normal activity of the vomeronasal organ , " Dulac said .
" In fact , our research suggests a new model where exactly the same neural circuitry exists in males and females , " she added .
" You only have to build one brain in a species and that the one brain is built , more or less , the same in the male and the female . "
The only thing that differs between the sexes in mice when it comes to sexual behavior is due to how the vomeronasal organ works , Dulac suggested .
" While male and female bodies are strikingly different physiologically , it appears the same cannot be said for the brain , " she said .
These findings might open up new avenues for investigation into the brain origins of sex - specific human behavior .
Dulac and her colleagues are now studying male mice with genetically disabled vomeronasal organs to see if they display feminine traits .

YouTube , the popular video - sharing Web site that has yet to celebrate its first anniversary or its first profit , is quickly becoming the must - have prize for media and technology giants .
Google is in discussions to acquire YouTube for $ 1.6 billion , people involved in the talks said yesterday .
While the talks are in the early stages , and may fall apart , the size of Google ’s offer may push YouTube closer to a deal .
Other companies have also expressed interest and could swoop in with a higher offer .
Microsoft , Yahoo , Viacom and the News Corporation , among others , have all visited YouTube ’s headquarters in San Mateo , Calif. , in recent months to inquire about buying the company .
The frenzied hunt to acquire the next hot Internet property — MySpace last year and now YouTube — has become reminiscent of the first Internet boom , as companies bid up prices of sites whose ability to generate profits is the subject of much debate .
Most people do n’t realize that it is n’t diet or exercise that is going to help them but a combination of both .
In order for your body to burn fat you must be taking in less calories then what you expend .
Yes , for some , diet modification will help in the beginning , but in the long run it is going to require regular exercise to continue to burn the fat and to actually build muscle tone .
Not body builder muscle tone just normal healthy muscle tone .
So eating healthily is a vital component to weight loss .
The other component is exercise .
What are the best ways to burn fat and tone up ?
Cardios ’ Role in Fat Loss
We can start by telling you that the less cardio you do in your workout routine the fewer calories that you are going to burn per workout .
As I have already stated that weight loss , or the amount of fat you burn , depends largely on calories .
You need to be burning more calories then you take in .
So here is an example for you .
A 30 minute cardio routine burns about 150 – 300 calories .
Talk to a nutritionist or trainer and they are going to tell you that we know that in order to burn one pound of fat we need to burn 3500 calories .
The USDA has guidelines that suit all people .
They recommend that all people should get 60 – 90 minutes a day of accumulated moderate to intense physical activity most days out of the week .
Note that is accumulated , so if you ca n’t get it all in at once then break it up through the day .
Here are a couple of the best cardio workouts :
1. Running does n’t require expensive equipment and can be done anywhere .
Burns serious calories especially if done on sprints or up hills .
The average person weighing 145lbs. can burn up to 300 calories at 5.2 mph in 30 minutes .
2. Boxing for cardio strength is considered the best cardio workout .
This workout requires the heart rate range to be 50 - 70 % of a person ’s maximum heart rate .
3 . Swimming is the also one of the best workouts .
Involves nearly all major muscles and therefore is the best whole body workout .
Aquatic exercise can help and has become very popular as an exercise program .
Weights and Fat Burn and Tone
Yes , you need to include the use of weights in your routine to really see your body tone up .
There are principles , 3 of them to be exact , that need to be adhered to in order for you to build muscle and tone up .
Following these three synergistic principles will help you make continuous gains any time you want .
These three principles are :
smart weight lifting
quality nutrition ( there is the diet again )
quality rest
Keeping these in balance will optimize your muscle building and toning .
So how do we fit the cardio and the weights together ?
You should do your cardio after your weight lifting .
Yes , you need to warm up for 5 - 7 minutes prior to your weight lifting , but your main cardio workout should be done after you lift weights .
This will help you burn two to three times more fat during your cardio routine because your metabolic rate will already have sky rocketed .
This next suggestion is one that causes great controversy .
Your weight lifting routine , when it comes to toning and fat burn , should be a light weight lifting routine .
[ ad #banner - text ]
This is because you need to have the energy to do the cardio as well .
So a good 20 minutes of weights and then your cardio will super charge your metabolism and heart rate .
Make sure you snack prior to your workout , primarily on fruits .
A combination of cardio and weight lifting is the key to burning fat and toning up .
As well as having a balanced healthy diet .

I was doing some research with Google ’s Image Search and ran over a picture that amazed me .
Google ’s homepage in 78 years from now .
There ’s no way to prove that , but the picture above is funny as hell , at least .
2084 will be in 78 years for me .
According to the picture , Google has 78 years to conquer the world .
Literally .
The real world .
And by all means , they ’ve got all the odds in favor , for crying out loud .
At the moment , they ’re the best quoted search engine , they ’re developing the most popular Internet Services ( mail , maps , music , images , etc ) and they ’re most likely gathering fans as each day ’s passing by .
Today , Google announced they ’re going to publish 30 - seconds commercials on TV , probably to attract people that are not Internet fans , to actually use the Internet .
Also , since today , they ’ve been in radio business as well , by broadcasting their Audio Ads service .
I am not going to spoil you the fun of enjoying every feature on the image and just imagine the fun .
We can assure you we have all been laughing our arse out every time we remember that image .
With Google in 2084 , finding your lost keys will be an easy task ;)

I suppose it ’s all just a coincidence that Arnold Schwarzenegger selected a belt buckle to wear — on the cover of a mass circulation news magazine — that features a human skull .
Sure , Arnold ’s dad was a Nazi and Arnold denies that he admired Hitler and liked to pretend to be an SS officer , despite eyewitness accounts to the contrary , and yeah , the skull and crossbones ( Totenkopf ) happened to be associated with the Schutzstaffel - Totenkopf , or SS Death ’s Head units , the Nazis responsible for the operation of the Third Reich ’s concentration camps …
But that ’s all just got to be a coincidence .
Pick up a copy of the June 25 , 2007 Time Magazine and check it out for yourself .
( I actually had to get a friend of mine to verify this for me by looking at an actual copy of the magazine .
There ’s not enough resolution in the online image of the Time cover to be useful .

When two cartoonists go to war , the lead will fly .
In his first six years in office , and joined at the hip with a Republican Politburo Rubber Stamp Congress so completely faithless to the Constitution that it ceded every possible power to the president , George W. Bush found it necessary to veto a grand total of one bill : stem - cell research .
Everything else he wanted deep - sixed ( and there was plenty , despite Congress having prostrated itself before Zod Bush ) was sent to the Phantom Zone via the now - infamous " signing statements . "
Back in May , Bush issued the second veto of his presidency , to kill the supplemental Iraq occupation spending bill he 'd requested , because it actually demanded he fish or cut bait .
Turns out that vetoes and threats of vetoes are a habit Bush has taken a shine to :
Bush Is Prepared to Veto Bill to Expand Child Insurance
By ROBERT PEAR WASHINGTON , July 14 — The White House said on Saturday that President Bush would veto a bipartisan plan to expand the Children ’s Health Insurance Program , drafted over the last six months by senior members of the Senate Finance Committee .
The vow puts Mr. Bush at odds with the Democratic majority in Congress , with a substantial number of Republican lawmakers and with many governors of both parties , who want to expand the popular program to cover some of the nation ’s eight million uninsured children .
Tony Fratto , a White House spokesman , said : " The president ’s senior advisers will certainly recommend a veto of this proposal .
And there is no question that the president would veto it . "
Sure , but that 's just one bill .
Right ?
Well , let 's put it in context :
Faced with a Congress working to take America in a new direction , President Bush — who vetoed nothing during his first five and a half years in office — has now vetoed 2 bills and threatened to veto 16 more .
The Democratic - led House of Representatives has passed legislation to address the toughest challenges we face — working together to defend our country , restore accountability , grow our economy , strengthen our families , and preserve our planetmost with a bi-partisan majority .
Unfortunately , the President has been a stubborn opponent of progress for the American people on these key issues .
He opposes or has threatened to veto 60 percent of the House 's work .
[ Emphasis added . ]
The Children 's Health Insurance Program bill makes 17 .
What else is on the block ?
The College Cost Reduction Act - H.R. 2669 Homeland Security Appropriations - H.R. 2638 State - Foreign Operations Appropriations - H.R. 2764 Interior - Environment Appropriations - H.R. 2643 The Energy Price Gouging Act – H.R. 1252 The No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels ( NOPEC ) Act - H.R. 2264 FY 2008 Defense Authorization Bill - H.R. 1585 FY 2008 Homeland Security Authorization - H.R. 1684 Hate Crimes Prevention Act – H.R. 1592 D.C. Voting Rights Act – H.R. 1905 Rail and Mass Transit Security Act - H.R. 1401 Presidential Records Act Amendments of 2007 - H.R. 1255 Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2007 - H.R. 985 Reauthorizing Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund - H.R. 720 Employee Free Choice Act - H.R. 800 Requiring Medicare to Negotiate Lower Prescription Drug Prices - H.R. 4
[ Note : This -- the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act -- makes 18 .
For more on which , see the very last link , below . ]
Not good .
Now , there are a few easy shots that can be taken here .
One is that these bills represent all the " oxygen " impeachment advocates were told they would be " sucking up " if the Congress were to put that option " on the table . "
So , everyone , how 's your breathing ?
But look , there 's still time .
Who knows what will happen , right ?
Bush could change his mind .
He could find himself somehow so politically weakened and isolated that he can't afford to follow through on his vow to veto these bills .
It could happen .
Another shot would have to be aimed directly at those who , I think , underestimated Bush 's intransigence .
Back in March of 2006 , I had an exchange with someone who , I think it 's fair to say , represented the views of a good number of people both here and around the country .
The gist of the challenge to me was that the president to that point had never vetoed anything .
Was he really going to start vetoing popular bills in the sixth year of his presidency , just as he became a lame duck ?
That , it was thought , was giving his brazenness too much respect .
Now , that 's offered not to call that particular person to account .
I only bring it up to the extent that it was necessary to illustrate the point with a direct example , and I 'm sorry to have to put anyone in particular on the spot .
It 's surely something less than fair to do , on the front page in particular .
And we should recognize that it was surely , at least at the time , a view not completely unfounded in reality , and he could hardly be blamed for taking it .
But with the benefit of 16 months of hindsight , I think we may be starting to see the outlines of an answer taking shape , do n't you think ?
That 's the important thing .
And the reason it 's important is that it also gives us a window into one of the other hot issues of the moment : how far will Bush go to stonewall Congressional oversight ?
That 's an issue in which , once again , most Congressional Democrats assume that the game will be played within the confines of the old rules , and that the president " would n't dare " instruct the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia not to prosecute anyone the Congress voted to hold in contempt for failure to comply with its subpoenas , for instance .
Or that he " would n't dare " pardon ( for all intents and purposes ) Scooter Libby so far in advance of the end of his term .
Or that he " would n't dare " to simply " defy " an Act of Congress .
I think that makes it a fair question for those of us who are concerned to ask whether there 's a " Plan B " -- not for Iraq , but for Congress , in the event that Bush should " dare " to do any of these things the old rules of politics made us so sure he would n't .
And if you do n't want to talk about it in terms of the contentious questions concerning oversight and / or impeachment , what other crisis can we see looming here ?
Looking at the list above , we can see that Bush has threatened to veto the Homeland Security , State - Foreign Operations , Financial Services , and Interior - Environment appropriations bills .
That 's one third of the year 's 12 regular appropriations bills , and two - thirds of the appropriations bills that have managed to pass the House so far ( 5 out of 7 if you include the first Iraq supplemental ) .
Now , consider what happened with that Iraq supplemental .
Anyone observing closely could see that the Congress provided the funding , and Bush rejected it .
And yet , Bush successfully convinced even many Congressional Democrats that they would be blamed for not " funding the troops in the field . "
With Bush already threatening to veto half of the FY08 appropriations bills , who do you think will be blamed for that other thing Americans supposedly hate more than anything , the government shutdown ?
So , what 's the " Plan B , " folks ?
What are we doing differently to avoid taking the blame for these vetoes ?
What are we doing differently to avoid having to bend to Bush 's increasingly ridiculous demands in exchange for his signature ?
UPDATE : Note , too , that if Bush vetoes half the appropriations bills , that creates a rather serious raft of busy work for Congress right about ... oh , I 'd say , September or so .
Gee , I hope nothing important is coming up in September that should have more of our attention than this .
UPDATE II : The count goes to 19 -- with the FY08 Energy and Water Appropriations bill under veto threat , too .
That 's five of twelve regular appropriations bills facing vetoes .
UPDATE III : Twenty .
Add Labor - HHS - Education appropriations .
Fully half of the regular appropriations agenda .

The U.S. service sector grew much more slowly in July , according to a report by the Institute for Supply Management .
“ Crude futures are down as the stock markets are selling off a little bit because the latest U.S. unemployment numbers are weaker than expected , ” said Phil Flynn , analyst at Alaron Trading .
“ It ’s Friday and people are also taking a little profit from the recent highs . ”
The losses came as Colorado State University trimmed its forecast for the 2007 Atlantic storm season on Friday and predicted 15 tropical storms , with eight growing to hurricane strength , including four major hurricanes .
The updated forecast was lower than the team ’s May 31 forecast for the six - month storm season that runs through November 30 , which had predicted 17 tropical storms , nine hurricanes and five major hurricanes .
The formation of Atlantic storms this week reminded traders of the approaching peak of the hurricane season , but a tropical wave in the eastern Caribbean now appears less likely to become a cyclone .
OPEC SUPPORTS
Prices have been supported this week by comments from OPEC ministers who said the producer group would not increase output when it next meets in September .
Some analysts have forecast prices could spike as high as $ 95 a barrel later this year unless OPEC opens the taps .
Top consumer the United States is worried that as refiners returning from outages ramp up runs , crude stocks will drain rapidly and tighten supplies .
U.S. Energy Secretary Sam Bodman on Thursday warned that oil prices have placed the world ’s largest economy in a “ danger zone ” and urged OPEC to raise output .
“ People are concerned about overall crude and product stocks globally , as demand ’s still strong , ” said Gerard Rigby of Fuel First Consulting in Sydney .
OPEC officials are also concerned by oil at $ 80 , but with U.S. crude inventories still well above historical norms the group is hesitant to increase output .
Qatari Oil Minister Abdullah al - Attiyah said OPEC can do nothing about high prices as there was no shortage of crude .

So , the White House is asserting they " lost " some email , huh ?
You 've got to be kidding me .
Is this a joke ?
As an IT guy , I know all too well that most emails are nearly impossible to " lose , " especially if one really wants to find them .
In fact , if the emails in question really are gone for good it probably means that there was a tremendously expensive , concerted effort to destroy them ( and , if so , it should be very easy to prove that they were intentionally destroyed ) .
Even so , I find it very difficult to believe that copies of these little devils are n't lurking on various electronic devices hither and thither throughout the country ( if not the world ) .
Unless a Department of Defense grade hard drive wipe was initiated on every single workstation or device that came in contact with the emails in question , they can be found .
And that 's not even mentioning the multiple email archives and backup files that doubtless exist .

Two Ohio researchers have discovered that some of the state ’s e-voting machines put a timestamp on each ballot , which severely erodes the secrecy of ballots .
The researchers , James Moyer and Jim Cropcho , used the state ’s open records law to get access to ballot records , according to Declan McCullagh ’s story at news.com .
The pair say they have reconstructed the individual ballots for a county tax referendum in Delaware County , Ohio .
Timestamped ballots are a problem because polling - place procedures often record the time or sequence of voter ’s arrivals .
For example , at my polling place in New Jersey , each voter is given a sequence number which is recorded next to the voter ’s name in the poll book records and is recorded in notebooks by Republican and Democratic poll watchers .
If I ’m the 74th voter using the machine today , and the recorded ballots on that machine are timestamped or kept in order , then anyone with access to the records can figure out how I voted .
That , of course , violates the secret ballot and opens the door to coercion and vote - buying .
Most e-voting systems that have been examined get this wrong .
In the recent California top - to - bottom review , researchers found that the Diebold system stores the ballots in the order they were cast and with timestamps ( report pp. 49 - 50 ) , and the Hart ( report pp. 59 ) and Sequoia ( report p. 64 ) systems “ randomize ” stored ballots in an easily reversible fashion .
Add in the newly discovered ES&S system , and the vendors are 0 - for - 4 in protecting ballot secrecy .
You ’d expect the vendors to hurry up and fix these problems , but instead they ’re just shrugging them off .
An ES&S spokeswoman at the Fleishman - Hillard public relations firm downplayed concerns about vote linking .
“ It ’s very difficult to make a direct correlation between the order of the sign - in and the timestamp in the unit , ” said Jill Friedman - Wilson .
This is baloney .
If you know the order of sign - ins , and you can put the ballots in order by timestamp , you ’ll be able to connect them most of the time .
You might make occasional mistakes , but that wo n’t reassure voters who want secrecy .
You know things are bad when questions about a technical matter like security are answered by a public - relations firm .
Companies that respond constructively to security problems are those that see them not merely as a PR ( public relations ) problem but as a technology problem with PR implications .
The constructive response in these situations is to say , “ We take all security issues seriously and we ’re investigating this report . ”
Diebold , amazingly , claims that they do n’t timestamp ballots – even though they do :
Other suppliers of electronic voting machines say they do not include time stamps in their products that provide voter - verified paper audit trails … .
A spokesman for Diebold Election Systems ( now Premier Election Solutions ) , said they do n’t for security and privacy reasons : “ We ’re very sensitive to the integrity of the process . ”
You have to wonder why e-voting vendors are so much worse at responding to security flaw reports than makers of other products .
Most software vendors will admit problems when they ’re real , will work constructively with the problems ’ discoverers , and will issue patches promptly .
Companies might try PR bluster once or twice , but they learn that bluster does n’t work and they ’re just driving away customers .
The e-voting companies seem to make the same mistakes over and over .
Allow me to make a bold claim : that the method of conceptual analysis , employed in much of analytic philosophy , is flawed .
But first , what is conceptual analysis ?
In the simplest possible terms conceptual analysis is the process of picking apart a concept ( such as mind , good , ect ) in order to determine all that we can about it a priori .
Often this conceptual analysis is accomplished by proposing better and better definitions of the word in question ( meaningful definitions of course , not like the ones you would find in a dictionary , which define a word in terms of near synonyms ) .
How do we know if one definition better approximates the concept than another ?
By showing how one of the definitions leads to contradiction or to applications that are clearly not what we mean by the concept in question .
For example , when analyzing “ good ” in this way we may point out that certain properties are intuitively part of our notion of good , and we argue against other definitions by showing how they label as “ good ” situations that are intuitively just the opposite ( for example the case of killing one patient to save five ) .
The problem with conceptual analysis is two - fold .
The obvious objection is simply that not everyone has exactly the same understanding of the concept in question , and hence situations that seem intuitive or unintuitive to one person may seem just the opposite to another .
The more serious problem is that our concepts may not align with the real world , and thus may mislead us .
For example consider the concept of gold as understood by one of our distant ancestors .
That person ’s concept of gold probably is just any rock that looks like gold .
But what about pyrite ( fool ’s gold ) ?
It seems that their conceptual analysis would lead them to conclude that was gold as well .
The conceptual analysist can of course respond by arguing that gold ’s density is also part of the concept .
But what then about white gold , which looks more like silver or platinum than gold ?
Perhaps it is only the density that defines the concept of gold , but , again , in that case an alloy of lead and some lighter metal would be considered gold .
No matter how they analyzed their concept of gold it would n’t come to the right conclusion about what gold really is , since they have no understanding of the atomic nature of matter , or even how the metals are properly distinguished from one another .
Yes , the concept of gold that this person has may be coherent , and it may be a priori knowledge , but it does n’t match up with anything actually in the world .
There are two ways to defend conceptual analysis against such an attack .
One is to argue that the concepts that are being investigated in this way are not supposed to align with the real world ( they are not natural kinds ) .
If that is true it seems hard to understand why we should care about them then .
The concept of “ ethics ” , for example , surely cannot be divorced from reality so easily .
After all what is it that can be good or bad besides real people and real actions ?
It seems obvious to me at least that ethics is simply a way of diving acts into two categories , just as gold and not - gold divide rocks into two categories .
I hope that the connection between other concepts and reality is likewise obvious ( at least if we expect them to be relevant to life in any way ) .
The other possible response is to argue that the concept held initially and the concept that results after an investigation are really two different concepts .
This might be a consistent way of looking at things , but if this is really the case I am forced to ask why the initial concept should n’t simply be discarded .
After all there is nothing it corresponds with in reality , and we have a new concept that does which can take its place , and perform the role in our discourse and thoughts that it used to .
Even if we accept that conceptual analysis is flawed the papers published as part of such an investigation have not been in vain , as they can almost all be useful to a different kind of investigation .
Let me then describe the kind of investigation that should replace conceptual analysis .
The first part of the investigation is to establish the relevant features of the subject of your investigation , and this is where our tools of conceptual analysis are useful .
We want to achieve a rough idea of what role the concept under investigation plays in life and in discourse .
We also want to make sure that we do n’t accidentally label irrelevant properties as essential , omit essential ones , or claim that it must have properties that come into conflict with each other ; and this is where tools such as examples and counter examples , and of course intuition pumps , become useful .
( For example our minds control our actions , a role in life , and have a first person ontology , an essential property .
Note that this is not a complete first step , just an example . )
The next step is to go beyond this rough sketch and through investigation discover what causes those properties , what explains them .
Of course I make it sound easy here , but this second stage is at least as difficult as the first , and we may have to revise the rough outline we are working from as we go along .
It may turn out that our initial concept aligned very closely with the real subject of our investigation , or it may be that the concept really includes much more or much less than we initially thought ( or possibly even that there are really two or more real things that we have both been describing with a single concept , just as jade is really composed of two distinct types of stone ) .
Again , we can turn to our simpler example of gold in order to understand how this process could work .
First our inquisitive ancestor accumulates many rocks that he or she thinks of as gold .
They then examine these rocks closely for common properties .
It is likely that most of them do share a few common features , and those that do not share those features are discarded as being not gold , but something that is simply very similar to gold .
Eventually he or she ( possibly several revolutions in physics later ) comes up with an explanation of why they all have those properties ; because they are made up of the same element .
Of course for something as complex as “ mind ” the investigation is unlikely to be so simple .
And , even though the investigation of gold was a matter purely for scientists , philosophers still can have a role to play in the investigation of “ good ” and “ mind ” ( and other concepts ) .
Specifically there still remains a lot to be done in developing a rough outline of the essential features of these concepts , as well as determining how the facts science has uncovered ( neuroscience , sociology , and psychology ) explain these features .
Finally I would like to point out that I did employ some of the tools of conceptual analysis here , specifically the investigation of gold used as an intuition pump , which just goes to show that the tools may still be useful .
If I ’m not basing my claims on conceptual analysis then where do they come from ?
Well the first step , deciding what a successful investigation into a concept is fairly easy , it is one that reveals truths .
Fortunately history has already done the second step for me .
In the course of other investigations methods like conceptual analysis have rarely led to the truth ( or even close approximation to it , consider Descartes ’ physics for example ) .
On the other hand investigations of the type I have proposed as a replacement often have been , thus my confidence in endorsing them for philosophy as well .
Physicistsare now foretelling the death of cosmology , or the study of our universe , as weknow it .
Thankfully , cosmologists won ?t be jobless for a couple trillion years .
Theuniverse is rapidly expanding ? perhaps not rapidly enough to rip to shreds , but enough that distant galaxies will eventually be moving away faster than thespeed of light .
This much has been known for a few years .
Once allthese galaxies blink outof existence , scientists ask in an upcoming issue of The Journal ofRelativity and Gravitation , how will future intelligent beings study spaceif the human race 's knowledge is long gone ?
Will they be able to figure out ifthe Big Bang happened ?
Or rediscover relativity ?
Island universe
For themost part , said Lawrence Krauss , a theoretical physicist at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland , Ohio , and co-author of the journal article , future observers will be out of luck .
" They 'll bestuck in an endless black void , " Krauss said , noting that any galaxies outsideof our own cluster will disappear in about 100 billion years .
" They 'll feelvery special after that happens , because our tiny cluster of galaxies will bethe observable universe to them . "
Without acosmological frame of reference , Krauss explained , future observers will be cluelessthat their universe is still expanding .
" It will be a sort of twistedsituation , where thinking returns to what it was at the turn of the 20thcentury , " he said .
In otherwords , observers will think the universe is just a static ?
ornon - expanding ?
cluster of galaxies just as scientists thought until the 1920s .
" Thestatic universe , " as the journal article states , " will have returned with avengeance . "
Nobackground material
Anadditional issue for future observers will be the disappearance of cosmicmicrowave background radiation ?
the fingerprintof the Big Bang 's occurrence ? in about 250 billion years .
Without it , Krausssaid , observers can't be certain about how the universe was created , not tomention when .
The problemrelates to the Doppler effect :
When a speeding train approaches , the soundwaves from its whistle are squished together to make a higher pitch .
As itpasses , the sound waves are stretched out like a slinky and become lower inpitch and fainter .
Similarly , as the universe expands outward , the " pitch " oflight will lengthen and fade away .
" The wavelength of light will be so large itwill eventually reach the size of our galaxy , " Krauss said .
" It will just beabsorbed . "
Krauss , however , is confident that someone ( presumably human in form ) will be the nextEinstein and rediscover generalrelativity .
He ?s also hopeful that future observers will be able to explainthe creation of the solar system by studying stars within the galaxy .
And , saidKrauss , there 's a positive side to not knowing the universe 's true history : " There ?ll be almost no static on their TV screens , " Krauss said , explaining that if there are no distant galaxies around to emit cosmic rays , the airwayswill be a lot cleaner .
In many developing countries , where bank branches and A.T.M.’s are few or nonexistent in rural areas , cellphones may finally make financial services practical such places , fitting in the palm of one ’s hand .
Mobile devices have the potential to take financial markets outside urban areas , allowing banks to provide services like loans and savings accounts in rural regions , according to a report by Vodafone and Nokia , published last week .
Microfinance institutions provide small loans and other services to the poor .
But many businesses in the industry operate with outdated equipment like paper ledgers , complicating efforts to extend into areas where roads are inadequate and communication is expensive and unreliable .
When Vodafone began a pilot cellphone project in Kenya , Nick Hughes , the company ’s head of international payments , said , “ the idea was to reduce the cost of loan disbursal and recovery , but what we found was that customers were using it for person - to - person transfers . ”

And the most disgusting sight : George Bush in a playful mood sitting on his chair in St. Petersburg , with his loyal servant Tony Blair leaning over him , and solving the problem : “ See …what they need to do is get Syria to get Hezbollah to stop doing that shit , and it ’s over . ”
Thus spake the leader of the world , and the seven dwarfs  “ the great of the world ”  say Amen .
Syria ?
But only a few months ago it was Bush  yes , the same Bush  who induced the Lebanese to drive the Syrians out of their country .
Now he wants them to intervene in Lebanon and impose order ?
Thirty - one years ago , when the Lebanese Civil War was at its height , the Syrians sent their army into Lebanon ( invited , of all people , by the Christians ) .
At the time , then - Minister of Defense Shimon Peres and his associates created hysteria in Israel .
They demanded that Israel deliver an ultimatum to the Syrians , to prevent them from reaching the Israeli border .
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin told me then , that it was sheer nonsense , because the best that could happen to Israel was for the Syrian army to spread out along the border .
Only thus could calm be assured , the same calm that reigned along our border with Syria .
However , Rabin gave in to the hysteria of the media and stopped the Syrians far from the border .
The vacuum thus created was filled by the PLO .
In 1982 , Ariel Sharon pushed the PLO out , and the vacuum was filled by Hezbollah .
All that has happened there since then would not have happened if we had allowed the Syrians to occupy the border from the beginning .
The Syrians are cautious ; they do not act recklessly .
What was Hassan Nasrallah thinking of , when he decided to cross the border and carry out the guerilla action that started the current Witches ’ Sabbath ?
Why did he do it ?
And why at this time ?
Everybody agrees that Nasrallah is a clever person .
He is also prudent .
For years he has been assembling a huge stockpile of missiles of all kinds to establish a balance of terror .
He knew that the Israeli army was only waiting for an opportunity to destroy them .
In spite of that , he carried out a provocation that provided the Israeli government with a perfect pretext to attack Lebanon with the full approval of the world .
Why ?
Possibly he was asked by Iran and Syria , who had supplied him with the missiles , to do something to divert American pressure from them .
And indeed , the sudden crisis has shifted attention away the Iranian nuclear effort , and it seems that Bush ’s attitude towards Syria has also changed .
But Nasrallah is far from being a marionette of Iran or Syria .
He heads an authentic Lebanese movement , and calculates his own balance sheet of pros and cons .
If he had been asked by Iran and / or Syria to do something  for which there is no proof  and he saw that it was contrary to the aims of his movement , he would not have done it .
Perhaps he acted because of domestic Lebanese concerns .
The Lebanese political system was becoming more stable and it was becoming more difficult to justify the military wing of Hezbollah .
A new , armed incident could have helped .
( Such considerations are not alien to us either , especially before budget debates . )
But all this does not explain the timing .
After all , Nasrallah could have acted a month before or a month later , a year before or a year later .
There must have been a much stronger reason to convince him to enter upon such an adventure at precisely this time .
And indeed there was : Palestine .
Two weeks before , the Israeli army had started a war against the population of the Gaza Strip .
There , too , the pretext was provided by a guerrilla action , in which an Israeli soldier was captured .
The Israeli government used the opportunity to carry out a plan prepared long before : to break the Palestinians ’ will to resist and to destroy the newly elected Palestinian government , dominated by Hamas .
And , of course , to stop the Qassams .
The operation in Gaza is an especially brutal one , and that is how it looks on the world ’s TV screens .
Terrible pictures from Gaza appear daily and hourly in the Arab media .
Dead people , wounded people , devastation .
Lack of water and medicaments for the wounded and sick .
Whole families killed .
Children screaming in agony .
Mothers weeping .
Buildings collapsing .
The Arab regimes , which are all dependent on America , did nothing to help .
Since they are also threatened by Islamic opposition movements , they looked at what was happening to Hamas with some Schadenfreude .
But tens of millions of Arabs , from the Atlantic Ocean to the Persian Gulf , saw , got excited and angry with their government , crying out for a leader who would bring succor to their besieged , heroic brothers .
Fifty years ago , Gamal Abd-el - Nasser , the new Egyptian leader , wrote that there was a role waiting for a hero .
He decided to be that hero himself .
For several years , he was the idol of the Arab world , symbol of Arab unity .
But Israel used an opportunity that presented itself and broke him in the Six - day war .
After that , the star of Saddam Hussein rose in the firmament .
He dared to stand up to mighty America and to launch missiles at Israel , and became the hero of the Arab masses .
But he was routed in a humiliating manner by the Americans , spurred on by Israel .
A week ago , Nasrallah faced the same temptation .
The Arab world was crying out for a hero , and he said : Here am I !
He challenged Israel , and indirectly the United States and the entire West .
He started the attack without allies , knowing that neither Iran nor Syria could risk helping him .
Perhaps he got carried away , like Abd - el - Nasser and Saddam before him .
Perhaps he misjudged the force of the counterattack he could expect .
Perhaps he really believed that under the weight of his rockets the Israeli rear would collapse .
( As the Israeli army believed that the Israeli onslaught would break the Palestinian people in Gaza and the Shiites in Lebanon . )
One thing is clear : Nasrallah would not have started this vicious circle of violence , if the Palestinians had not called for help .
Either from cool calculation , or from true moral outrage , or from both  Nasrallah rushed to the rescue of beleaguered Palestine .
The Israeli reaction could have been expected .
For years , the army commanders had yearned for an opportunity to eliminate the missile arsenal of Hezbollah and destroy that organization , or at least disarm it and push it far , far from the border .
They are trying to do this the only way they know : by causing so much devastation , that the Lebanese population will stand up and compel its government to fulfill Israel ’s demands .
Will these aims be achieved ?
Hezbollah is the authentic representative of the Shiite community , which makes up 40 % of the Lebanese population .
Together with the other Muslims , they are the majority in the country .
The idea that the weakling Lebanese government  which in any case includes Hezbollah  would be able to liquidate the organization is ludicrous .
The Israeli government demands that the Lebanese army be deployed along the border .
This has by now become a mantra .
It reveals total ignorance .
The Shiites occupy important positions in the Lebanese army , and there is no chance at all that it would start a fratricidal war against them .
Abroad , another idea is taking shape : that an international force should be deployed on the border .
The Israeli government objects to this strenuously .
A real international force  unlike the hapless UNIFIL , which has been there for decades  would hinder the Israeli army from doing whatever it wants .
Moreover , if it were deployed there without the agreement of Hezbollah , a new guerilla war would start against it .
Would such a force , without real motivation , succeed where the mighty Israeli army was routed ?
At most , this war  with its hundreds of dead and waves of destruction  will lead to another delicate armistice .
The Israeli government will claim victory and argue that it has “ changed the rules of the game . ”
Nasrallah ( or his successors ) will claim that their small organization has stood up to one of the mightiest military machines in the world and written another shining chapter of heroism in the annals of Arab and Muslim history .
No real solution will be achieved , because there is no treatment of the root of the matter : the Palestinian problem .
Many years ago , I was listening on the radio to one of the speeches of Abd - el - Nasser before a huge crowd in Egypt .
He was holding forth on the achievements of the Egyptian revolution , when shouts arose from the crowd : “ Filastine , ya Gamal ! ” ( “ Palestine , oh Gamal ! ” )
Whereupon Nasser forgot what he was talking about and started on Palestine , getting more and more carried away .
Since then , not much has changed .
When the Palestinian cause is mentioned , it casts its shadow over everything else .
That ’s what has happened now , too .
Whoever longs for a solution must know :
There is no solution without settling the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
And there is no solution to the Palestinian problem without negotiations with their elected leadership , the government headed by Hamas .
If one wants to finish , once and for all , with this shit  as Bush so delicately put it  that is the only way .
How much money do you spend on your hair ?
Are you worth it ?
The woman on the hair - dye commercial says , with great certainty ( that annoys me for some reason ) that she ’s worth it , but I wanted to find out if I am .
Curious , I walked into my bathroom to get an accurate picture of how much of my paycheck was sitting around in brightly colored tubes and bottles of hair care and hair removal products .
I consider myself low - maintenance , so I did n’t think it would be much .
In contrast to some women who wo n’t go to the grocery store without lipstick and a fresh coat of Aqua Net , my friends will tell you that my attitude about my hair is , “ I do n’t have to look at it , you do . ”
It therefore came as a huge surprise to realize that I had 16 hair products and 7 pieces of hair care equipment ( including an industrial strength nose - hair trimmer ) and that I spend a total of $ 844 per year on products , cuts , color and waxing – a hefty sum for a woman who claims not to care .
That weekend , still reeling from this revelation , I decided to tackle my biggest expense – waxing .
Bikini waxing is big business because , as those of you who have tried it at home know , only a professional – meaning someone who can keep a straight face and act like it ’s all very normal that you are contorted in a way that would make even your gynecologist blush – can remove hair from there .
Unfortunately , though I have been told otherwise , it is physically impossible to wax yourself .
I respond to people who tell me they successfully wax themselves the same way I do to those who tell me about UFO sightings .
I listen politely because I respect their beliefs , but I know that it will never happen to me .
Luckily , my husband , good sport that he is , agreed to embark on this journey of frugality with me .
Friends of ours , a husband and wife , had told us they bought their own waxing kit and that the husband was able to wax his wife with great results .
With such a convincing first - hand account , we decided to give it try .
What could go wrong ?
Since my husband was new at it , and an engineer by training , he worked to apply the first smear of wax with great precision .
But , after the first halting riiiiiip – which , by the way , makes it infinitely more excruciating – and a primal roar from me that rivaled Sigourney Weaver in Ghostbusters , I sent him to the kitchen to fetch me a large shot glass of tequila which I threw back like a sorority girl at Myrtle Beach .
We waited a few minutes and let the liquor work its magic but when , during the second attempt , he lost his grip and the rip became two – rip-rip – I kicked him – an innocent reflex , I swear – full in the chest and he flew backwards , wide - eyed and still gripping the scrap of waxing paper , because I had told him that a good , firm grip is very important – across the bed .
After a few tense moments and profuse apologies on my part , we decided we would stay married instead of continuing the experiment .
A week later , still determined to save a few bucks , I cancelled my appointment with the hairdresser , wrapped a towel around my shoulders and began to cut my own hair .
It had been years since I ’d done it and one quick minute later , as I stared at the little Amish boy in the mirror – Oh , wait , that ’s me !
– I remembered why .
Note to self :
Never wet your bangs and stretch them waaaay down before you cut them .
Fortunately , however , after a disappointing initial attempt to dye my own hair – my sister called me Roy Orbison – I now save over $ 30 every six weeks that way .
I also found that less frequent haircuts and waxing greatly reduce expenses without producing vastly different results .
So , am I worth it ?
Yes , I am worth the effort it took to evaluate my budget and decide what is reasonable to spend .
And though I do n’t recommend that you recreate every step of my research , for fear of a personal injury lawsuit , I encourage you to take a few minutes to calculate how much you are spending and decide for yourself .
Quantifying this expense may motivate you to find creative ways to reduce it , but remember …some things are best left to the professionals .

The EC is in the final stages of agreeing a new Passenger Name Record system with the US which will allow American officials to access detailed biographical information about passengers entering international airports .
The information sharing system with the US Department of Homeland Security , which updates the previous three - year - old system , is designed to tackle terrorism but civil liberty groups warn it will have serious consequences for European passengers .
And it has emerged that both the European parliament and the European data protection supervisor are alarmed at the plan .
In a strongly worded document drawn up in response to the plan that will affect the 4 million - plus Britons who travel to the US every year , the EU parliament said it ' notes with concern that sensitive data ( ie personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin , political opinions , religious or philosophical beliefs , trade union membership , and data concerning the health or sex life of individuals ) will be made available to the DHS and that these data may be used by the DHS in exceptional cases ' .
Under the new agreement , which goes live at the end of this month , the US will be able to hold the records of European passengers for 15 years compared with the current three year limit .
The EU parliament said it was concerned the data would lead to 'a significant risk of massive profiling and data mining , which is incompatible with basic European principles and is a practice still under discussion in the US congress . '
Peter Hustinx , the European Data Protection Supervisor , has written to the EC expressing his ' grave concern ' at the plan , which he describes as ' without legal precedent ' and one that puts ' European data protection rights at risk ' .
Hustinx warns : ' Data on EU citizens will be readily accessible to a broad range of US agencies and there is no limitation to what US authorities are allowed to do with the data . '
He expresses concern about ' the absence of a robust legal mechanism that enables EU citizens to challenge misuse of their personal information ' .
Hustinx concludes : ' I have serious doubts whether the outcome of these negotiations will be fully compatible with European fundamental rights , which both the Council and the Commission have stated are non negotiable . '
The new agreement will see US authorities gain access to detailed passenger information , from credit card details to home addresses and even what sort of food may have been ordered before a flight .
In addition , US authorities will be free to add other information they have obtained about a passenger , leading to concerns about how the information will be shared .
It has emerged that neither Hustinx nor the European parliament were aware of the final draft of the plan .
' If you are going to have this kind of agreement it should involve parliament and the data protection supervisor , ' said Tony Bunyan of Statewatch , the civil liberties organisation that campaigns against excessive surveillance .
He warned that under the new system the data will be shared with numerous US agencies .
' The data protection supervisor and the European parliament are angry that they were not consulted , ' Bunyan said .
' But they are also angry with a number of elements of the plan such as giving the US the absolute right to pass the data on to third parties . '
Simon Davies , director of Privacy International , another group that campaigns against state surveillance , said the new agreement gave huge powers to the US authorities .

The photograph captures two boys , about 6 or 7 years old , cavorting naked on a beach .
One of the boys looks coyly over his shoulder .
The other has an erection .
Child pornography or art ?
Definitely art , according to a growing number of websites charging up to $ 40 a month for subscribers to gain access to images of naked children as young as 4 years old .
" Only the youngest and sweetest virgin boys ! " reads the introduction to Nude Boys World ( See editor 's note below ) , which contains photos and movies of boys in the buff posing in shower stalls and unmade beds .
Likewise , Sunny Lolitas , which shows naked pre-pubescent girls playing with stuffed animals or stretched out pin-up style against hot red backgrounds , advertises its models as " only cutest and ( sic ) the youngest ! "
Experts say the sites – which are easily found using Internet search engines – fall into a murky category known as " child erotica , " which includes images of naked children that do n't meet the strict legal definitions of child pornography .
U.S. law defines kiddie porn as depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct , such as intercourse and masturbation , or that show " lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area . "
" These sites thinly skirt the line between legal and illegal , " said Ruben Rodriguez , the director of the Exploited Child Unit of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children , which works with the FBI to investigate Internet child porn .
" It 's very frustrating for us .
They 're making money exploiting children and there 's nothing we can do to shut them down . "
Most of the child erotica sites link to the same legal boilerplate , which characterizes the sites ' content as art and manifests a " vehement " opposition to child pornography .
The disclaimers published by Little - Boyz – which boasts of being " the biggest nude boys site " with 20,000 photos and hundreds of movies – is typical of other child erotica pages :
" Every photo honors the purity and innocence of youth and contains no sexually explicit conduct in accordance with United States Law ! " asserts the site .
" In the time honored tradition and within the laws of the United States of America and most states and municipalities , the visual depiction and appreciation of the male form , including the pubescent male form , has been and is legal .
Little Boyz supports the laws of the United States of America and gladly and willingly conforms to these laws ... Little Boyz , in accordance with the Constitution , believes that the right to view and appreciate nude images of minors in an artistic and aesthetic manner is guaranteed . "
For good measure , many of the sites provide a direct link to the U.S. code defining child pornography .
But even if the sites do n't show minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct , they could be charged for lascivious intent , said Ken Lanning , a retired FBI agent who spent 30 years researching crimes against children and now serves as an expert witness in court cases .
However , proving lascivious intent in court is extremely difficult .
The prosecutor would have to demonstrate that the producer of the material intended to elicit a sexual response with the images or that the subscriber viewed the images for sexual arousal .
Unless the images are in a folder called something like , " hot little kids I 'd like to have sex with , " it would be hard for prosecutors to argue that the subscriber had lewd interest in the material .
The material could also prove damaging in cases where a defendant has previous convictions for child pornography or molestation , he added .
In the 1995 landmark case , U.S. v. Stephen Knox , a known pedophile was sentenced to jail for possessing tapes of young girls in leotards whose dancing the court qualified as " lascivious . "
But such convictions are few and far between , said Lanning , who predicted that child erotica sites will proliferate as the government continues to break up hard - core child pornography rings .
" The reality is , there 's so much hard - core stuff out there that prosecutors do n't want to get bogged down with these kinds of sites , " he said .
" It 's a fuzzy area of the law . "
The line between art and illegal porn has perplexed law enforcement authorities for decades .
Take the controversial work of Jock Sturges , whose photographs depict naked adolescent girls .
Despite an FBI raid , protests by angry mobs and a grand jury investigation , his coffee table art books continue to sell .
But a closer look at the child erotica sites suggest that their content is n't aimed at art connoisseurs .
First , there are the site names : Lolitas For Sale , Boy Erection , and Pedo Art ( pedophile art ) , among others .
Second , there 's the content :
Some of the images available on the preview tour seem blatantly suggestive , such as a photograph of a pair of young boys in a shower , with one boy directing the water nozzle at the other 's buttocks .
Then there are the rules .
One site prohibited U.S. law enforcement agents from joining and forbade members from holding the site owners responsible for breaking laws .
Most of the sites are registered in foreign countries .
But they are written in English and billed through American bill processors .
Two of the billing companies that process charges for the child erotica sites , iHasp and BillCards , offer anonymous debit card services to webmasters , allowing them to receive payments without being directly linked to such seamy - sounding sites as Lusty - Lolitas.com .
Perhaps the most damning evidence can be found in the introduction of a website called Boys Mania , where the Russian photographer explains how he recruits his models :
" I always have a possibility to find secluded places where kids are trying to hide from their parents and teachers ....
Sometimes I manage to talk to them and invite them to my house , show them pictures , videos and other stuff with lots of naked boys and girls .
When being with them I try to undress myself first and then offer them to do the same .
I like their smooth skin , their fascinated looks , the way they play together and with themselves .
I feel excited when they are turning on . "
E-mails to the webmasters of this and several other sites went unanswered .
The child erotica sites are often a gateway to illegal material , said Cate Donoghue , the director of Online Guardians , a group that monitors the Internet for pedophiles and indecent images of children .
Subscribers may find that the site contains hard - core child pornography or that their e-mail address has been sold to mailing lists that bombard them with offers to join illegal sites , she said .
One spam her organization detected at the end of April , for example , directed recipients to a page containing graphic images of sexual activity involving toddlers .
The site , which authorities have tried to close for more than a year , keeps hopping from one IP address to another .
Another site featuring hard - core photos of " tiny little girls " brags : " Our server was closed 21 times , but we have risen from the ashes again . "
For Donoghue and other cyber-vigilantes , keeping up tabs on cyber smut is a full - time job .
" Sites that exploit children persist because there are enough perverts out there willing to pay big bucks to see them , " said Donoghue .
" We have yet to find a way to keep them offline . "
( Editor 's note :
An unwritten but conventional Wired News policy is to provide links to websites covered in our stories .
However , we have made an exception in this case .
Because of the nature of the content of these websites , we have serious reservations about directing our readers to the images that can be found there . )

Sharing Space German Town Scraps Road Signs to Increase Safety
You wo n't have to worry about getting a ticket for running a red light in the German town of Bohmte any more -- the town is abolishing all its road signs and traffic regulations .
We ’ve scoured the net for two game rooms that could quite possibly be worth more than your house .
Which one is your favorite ?

Peter Hirschberg built this incredible gameroom inside of his house — encompassing two large rooms , it measures approx .
500 sq. feet and features black light carpeting .
The main section is 19 ′ x 18′ , and a railed elevated section measures 22 ′ x 7 ′ .
The extended gameroom is about 11 ′ x 26 ′ ( 286 sq.ft . ) and has checkered vinyl flooring and rope lighting .
All games are dedicated originals – no conversions .
Not all the machines are depicted in the gameroom photos .
There ’s just not room for all of them in the gameroom , and some are in another room awaiting refurbishing .

Dodd called him on it , and O’Reilly , as always , denied saying exactly what he actually said .
Here is what O’Reilly actually said about al Qaeda and San Francisco :
And if Al Qaeda comes in here and blows you up , we ’re not going to do anything about it .
We ’re going to say , look , every other place in America is off limits to you , except San Francisco .
You want to blow up the Coit Tower ?

It is a truth universally acknowledged that many of us who claim to have read a classic novel are telling porkies .
Or have simply watched the film version instead .
This even applies , it seems , to literary agents and publishers .
For when a budding author sent typed chapters of Jane Austen 's novels to 18 of them , changing just the titles and characters ' names , only one recognised her words .
Scroll down for more
Another managed to recognise they were ' a really original read ' .
But the rest simply rejected them or never responded , according to the man who posted the manuscripts , David Lassman .
" It was unbelievable , " he said .
" If the major publishers can't recognise great literature , who knows what might be slipping through the net ?
" Here is one of the greatest writers that has lived , with her oeuvre securely fixed in the English canon and yet only one recipient recognised them as Austen 's work . "
Mr Lassman , 43 , submitted opening chapters of three of Austen 's classic works - Northanger Abbey , first published in 1798 , Pride and Prejudice ( 1813 ) and Persuasion ( 1818 ) .
He typed them out himself , and signed them Alison Laydee after Austen 's early pseudonym A Lady .
To offer a few more hints , he called Pride and Prejudice ' First Impressions ' , the original title for the story , and wrote a return address of the Jane Austen Centre in Bath , where he works as the director of the Jane Austen Festival .
In response , the literary agency Christopher Little , which represents JK Rowling , said it was ' not confident of placing this material with a publisher ' .
Scroll down for more
Penguin , which currently publishes Pride and Prejudice , responded that First Impressions ' seems like a really original and interesting read ' .
But there was no request to see the rest of the book .
Others to turn the works down included Bloomsbury , Random House , Harper Collins and Hodder & Stoughton .
The only one who emerged with any credit was Alex Bowler , assistant editor at Jonathan Cape publishers .
His reply read : " I suggest you reach for your copy of Pride and Prejudice , which I 'd guess lives in close proximity to your typewriter and make sure that your opening pages do n't too closely mimic the book 's opening .
After all , there is such a thing as plagiarism . "
Mr Lassman came up with the experiment when struggling to have his own novel published .
He said it highlighted the flaws in the publishing process .
" Getting a novel accepted is very difficult today unless you have an agent first , but I had no idea of the scale of rejection poor old Jane suffered .
BOSTON , June 20 — For several years , the Maine Troop Greeters have welcomed soldiers from every military transport plane that has landed at Bangor International Airport with hugs , handshakes , cookies and homemade goodies .
But the visits , and the soldiers ’ bellies , have been a bit emptier since airport officials asked the greeters to stop serving food last month because of concern about liability and food safety .
“ We just say , ‘ We ’re sorry , we ca n’t give out any cookies , ’ ” said Bill Knight , a World War II veteran who founded the group .
“ I knew it would be coming down the pike one day . ”
Mr. Knight and Tony Caruso , assistant director of the airport , said the greeters were told not to hand out food in 2004 , when the airport let the group use a small room in the terminal without charge .
Paul tops onetime - frontrunner McCain in campaign cash Nick Juliano

Ron Paul 's Republican presidential campaign raised $ 2.4 million in the second quarter of this year and currently has that much money in the bank , topping onetime - frontrunner John McCain 's $ 2 million cash on hand , ABC News reported .
The campaign 's most recent haul is nearly quadruple its first quarter fundraising total , which the campaign attributes to Paul 's explosive success online .
Paul 's YouTube channel has 2.1 million page views -- three times the number of the next closest Republican , Mitt Romney , who has 700,000 , The Hill reported .
And the Texas Congressman has more than 41,000 MySpace friends .
" I think some candidates are on the down - slope , and we 're on the up - slope , " Paul said , referring to McCain , in an interview with George Stephanopoulos to be aired Sunday on ABC's " This Week . "
Paul 's campaign has not said how much of its donations were raised online this quarter .
A campaign spokesman did not immediately respond to RAW STORY 's request for comment Friday .
McCain has far out - raised Paul this year , with a total haul of $ 24 million including $ 11.2 million in the last three months .
But McCain also has a much larger campaign infrastructure to maintain , which has eaten up much of the campaign 's cash so far .
The Arizona Senator 's campaign manager will be working without a paycheck for the next few months and dozens of staffers have been laid off as part of a campaign restructuring , campaign advisers said in a conference call with reporters this week .
The McCain campaign did not immediately return a call seeking comment Friday .
Republican frontrunners Rudy Giuliani and Romney have $ 18 million and $ 12 million in the bank , respectively .
For seven years 36 - year - old Khaled Shawish has evaded arrest by Israeli security forces , making the prominent al - Aqsa Martyr 's Brigades commander one of the most wanted figures in the West Bank .
But on Monday afternoon a joint IDF , Police Counter - Terrorism and Shin Bet operation led a Special Forces team to arrest him in his private vehicle in Ramallah .
Originally from Jenin , Shawish has spent the past several years hiding in the Muqata compound in central Ramallah and was one of the many who barricaded themselves inside the compound during Operation Defensive Shield in 2002 .
Israeli security forces have linked Shawish with dozens of terror attacks and attempted attacks inside Israel , all of which resulted in the murders of eight Israelis and the wounding of dozens more .
In December 2000 Shawish was involved in the attack on the car of Benjamin Kahane , son of Rabbi Meir Kahane , near the settlement of Ofra .
Benjamin and his wife were shot dead and their five daughters were seriously wounded in the attack .
Wounded in shootout with IDF troops
Among the more well - known attacks Shawish is charged with directing are : the 2002 suicide bombing of King George Street in Jerusalem , a second suicide bombing in 2002 carried out by a female bomber at a checkpoint along a main traffic route outside Jerusalem and a shooting attack at the French Hill neighborhood in northern Jerusalem .
Shawish was wounded in a shootout with IDF troops during an arrest attempt in 2001 but managed to escape .
His injuries eventually rendered him handicapped and he cut back on active operations .
Security officials said however that Shawish continued to be heavily involved in planning new attacks .
On several occasions Palestinian Authority officials attempted to strike a deal with Israel which would allow Shawish to exit the country for surgery abroad but the talks never progressed .

Unicorn love is a beautiful thing
by Tenshi Vielle , Fabulous Fashionista
Unicorn babies need love
What ’s the latest trend among the elite Fashionista groups of SL this week ?
I ’ll give you a hint .
It ’s not bubble hemmed sleeves .
It ’s not scarves , nor Shai ’s plaid jackets .
No , no – this time we ’re talking unicorns .
Tiny , adorable baby unicorns that you can hold and cuddle … but they come with a price .
You can only get them by having sex with an adult unicorn ( although the unicorn is n’t age verified ) located at the bel Highland sim in a shop called Sensual Stoneworks .
This week pictures of baby unicorns ( and some pictures of the sexual act ! ) have been popping up on Snapzilla .
[ WARNING : both super - cute unicorn babies - and not - safe - for - work unicorn sex after the jump -- the Editrix ]
Nylon Pinkney and Toast Bard are gentle mothers to their unicorn babies
I took a short trip to Tableau , origin of this fad , to interview a few of the Unicorn baby caretakers .
They were hard to find – because each of them denied having heard of such a thing .
An avatar gets nailed by the Nightmare
“ I think …. that unicorn love is a beautiful thing ” says bystander Moisie Swindlehurst , one resident I found in tableau who was willing to talk about the fad .
“ … and that if you find a spicy sexy unicorn stud muffin and want to let him fill you with his magical glittering seed , that is just fantastic .
And i support it .
100 % ”
After much digging and several dead leads , I came upon Marcelle DeCuir , famed originator of this cult by way of Snapzilla .
“ I was hanging out with Polyester ( Partridge ) one day and she had the baby , so I asked her where she got it .
She pointed me towards Sensual Stoneworks , and I was shamelessly raped by a unicorn .
I do n’t mind ” .
Marcelle DeCuir conceives her first unicorn prim baby
But how many tries did it take you , Marcelle ?
I heard the unicorn does n’t knock you up every time .
" It does it on the first try if you make sure the poseball is set to ‘ mounted ’ , " says Marcelle .
" That whole place is creepy . "
The sexual statues are marvelously crafted at Sensual Stoneworks .
One of the griffin - bugs actually reaches out to grab you if you sit on him , and he holds you in place as he rams you from behind .
It ’s frightening , morally wrong , and yet you just ca n’t look away for appreciation at how many hours it must have taken to get the programming just right .
be careful near the stone demon
The stone demon reached out and grabbed me without warning .
I can not say what happened next .
It ’s just … it ’s too painful .
Minx Mousehold , creator of Sensual Stoneworks , says that people are now holding contests to see who can get the most prim unicorn babies in a row the " right " way .
It ’s truly become an underground movement ; one of the most demented kind .
She also says that out of the statues in the shop , only the unicorn ( the white horse ) , the nightmare ( the black horse ) and the spider ( currently down for repairs ) will give you miniatures .
The Xen statue , found in the main room , will give you a cute ( and hideous ) little larvae to keep .
Xen grabbed me by surprise – do n’t make the same mistake by glancing into the gaping well !
I ’d definetely put " Sensual Stoneworks " on your must - see list .
However , for this fashionista reporter … she ’ll be sitting at home in the corner of her attic , rocking back and forth with her painful memories .
Over half of the Jewish population in Israel believes the marriage of a Jewish woman to an Arab man is equal to national treason , according to a recent survey by the Geocartography Institute .
The survey , which was conducted for the Center Against Racism , also found that over 75 percent of participants did not approve of apartment buildings being shared between Arabs and Jews .
Sixty percent of participants said they would not allow an Arab to visit their home .
Five hundred Jewish men and women participated in the poll , which was published Tuesday .
According to the survey , racism against Arabs in Israel has seen a sharp rise since a similar survey was conducted two years ago .
In 2006 , 247 racist acts against Arabs were reported , as opposed to 225 one year prior .
About 40 percent of participants agreed that “ Arabs should have their right to vote for Knesset revoked ” .
The number was 55 percent lower in the previous survey .
Also , over half of the participants agreed that Israel should encourage its Arab citizens to immigrate from the country .
Over half of the participants said they would not want to work under the direct management of an Arab , and 55 percent said “ Arabs and Jews should be separated at entertainment sites ” .
‘ Arab culture inferior ’
Participants were asked what they felt when they overheard someone speaking Arabic .
Thirty - one percent said they felt hatred , while 50 percent said they felt fear .
Over 56 percent of participants said they believed that Israel ’s Arab citizens posed both a security and a demographic threat to the country .
When asked what they thought of Arab culture , over 37 percent replied , “ The Arab culture is inferior . ”
“ The Center Against Racism has set itself a goal to monitor all racial incidents against Arab citizens , and to fight racism as much as possible under the law through public action , ” the center ’s annual report said .
Bachar Ouda , the center 's director , said the survey ’s findings were worrisome , and urged the government to intervene in the situation .
“ We call on the education minister to take the gloves off and deal with the issue seriously , because it is dangerous to coexistence .
We call on the state prosecutions office , and the attorney general to take action , ” Ouda said .
Fun with IronPython and Cecil Monday , April 2 , 2007
Do n't miss
Part II of this tutorial
What is Cecil :
" Cecil is a library written by Jb Evain ( http://evain.net/blog/) to generate and inspect programs and libraries in the ECMA CIL format .
It has full support for generics , and support some debugging symbol format .
In simple English , with Cecil , you can load existing managed assemblies , browse all the contained types , modify them on the fly and save back to the disk the modified assembly . "
Pasted from < http://www.mono-project.com/Cecil>
In this tutorial , I spent a couple of hours playing around Cecil 's functionality using IronPython .
Basically , I am trying to use Cecil to find different methods that are called from a given method .
Sounds interesting ?
Then pelase read ahead .
Download and Install IronPython and Cecil before going any further .
Although you can get away with just downloading IronPython as I have included the Cecil dll inside the solution .
The first thing we 'll do is to create a simple Class Library project in C# which we 'll inspect using Cecil .
The source code for CecilCase.dll is pretty simple and listed below .
You can download the whole solution .
We start with a couple of classes named : MainCase.cs and SecondCase.cs .
Ignore the method names :)
// MainCase.cs
public class MainCase
{
public void PublicMethod ( )
{
Console. WriteLine ( " Hello " ) ;
PrivateMethod ( ) ;
new SecondCase ( ) .
Help ( " Help me " ) ;
}
public void AddMethod ( )
{
}
private void PrivateMethod ( )
{
}
public void MethodWithArgument ( string name )
{
Console. WriteLine( name ) ;
}
}
// SecondCase.cs
class SecondCase
{
public void Help ( string message )
{
Console. WriteLine( message ) ;
}
}
Compile and Build the dll .
Now Open IronPython shell .
Make sure that you are in the same directory where you have CecilCase. dll output .
Also remember to copy Mono .
Cecil.dll which you have downloaded earlier in the same directory .
We start with adding CLR support and adding Reference to the Mono .
Cecil dll .
>> import clr
>> clr.AddReference ( " Mono. Cecil " )
As we are testing therefore import all types .
>> from Mono .
Cecil import *
Use the dir ( ) command to see the currently loaded types .
>> dir ( )
The next thing we need to do is to load the assembly .
From the FAQ , you can see that we need to use the Assembly Factory class to load the target assembly .
>> myAsm = AssemblyFactory.GetAssembly ( " CecilCase.dll " )
>> myAsm
< Mono.Cecil.AssemblyDefinition object at 0x000000000000002B [ CecilCase , Version=1.0.0.0 , Culture=neutral , PublicKeyToken=null ] >
Types :
Now we get all the types in that assembly .
Count ??
>>> myAsm.MainModule .Types.Count
3
3 types ???.
I thought I created only two .
Let 's see what are these
>>> for caseType in myAsm.MainModule .
Types :
... print caseType
...
< Module >
CecilCase .MainCase
CecilCase .SecondCase
So < Module > was the hidden type .
We 'll ignore it from now on .
>>> for caseType in myAsm.MainModule .
Types :
... if caseType . Name != '< Module > ':
... print caseType .
Name
...
MainCase
SecondCase
Methods :
Getting the methods of a particular type is also easy .
Starting with MainCase class .
>>> mainCaseType = myAsm.MainModule.Types [ 1 ]
>>> mainCaseType
< Mono.Cecil.TypeDefinition object at 0x000000000000002D [ CecilCase.MainCase ] >
Remember the [ 0 ] type is the < Module > .
So now we have the MainCase type definition .
>>> mainCaseType.Methods .Count
4
>>> for met in mainCaseType .
Methods :
... print met .
Name
...
PublicMethod
AddMethod
PrivateMethod
MethodWithArgument
To get the full method definition :
>>> for met in mainCaseType .
Methods :
... print met
...
System .Void CecilCase.MainCase:: PublicMethod ()
System .
Void CecilCase.MainCase :: AddMethod ()
System .
Void CecilCase.MainCase :: PrivateMethod ()
System .
Void CecilCase.MainCase:: MethodWithArgument( System.String )
Method Body :
To see inside the method , we 'll start with the first method which is MainCase .
PublicMethod ()
>>> pMet = mainCaseType.Methods [0 ]
>>>
pMet
< Mono.Cecil.MethodDefinition object at 0x000000000000002F [ System .
Void CecilCase
. MainCase :: PublicMethod ( ) ] >
To see the different methods , properties that pMet supports , try dir ()
>>> dir( pMet )
[' Accept ' , ' Attributes ' , ' Body ' , ' CallingConvention ' , ' Cctor ' , ' Clone ' , ' Ctor ' ,
' CustomAttributes ' , ' DeclaringType ' , ' Equals ' , ' Explicit This ' , ' Finalize ' , ' Gene
ricParameters ' , ' GetHashCode ' , ' GetSentinel ' , ' GetType ' , ' HasBody ' , ' Has This ' , '
ImplAttributes ' , ' IsAbstract ' , ' IsConstructor ' , ' IsFinal ' , ' IsHideBySignature ' ,
' IsInternalCall ' , ' IsNewSlot ' , ' IsRuntime ' , ' IsRuntimeSpecialName ' , ' IsSpecialNa

' ToString ' , ' __class__ ' , ' __doc__ ' , ' __init__ ' , ' __module__ ' , ' __new__ ' , ' __redu
ce__ ' , ' __reduce_ex__ ' , ' __repr__ ' , ' __str__ ' ]
The one we are interested now is the Body .
>>> pMet.Body
< MethodBody object at 0x0000000000000034 >
>>> dir( pMet.Body )
[' Accept ' , ' CilWorker ' , ' CodeSize ' , ' Equals ' , ' ExceptionHandlers ' , ' Finalize ' , '
GetHashCode ' , ' GetType ' , ' InitLocals ' , ' Instructions ' , ' MakeDynamicType ' , ' MaxSt
ack ' , ' MemberwiseClone ' , ' Method ' , ' Reduce ' , ' ReferenceEquals ' , ' Scopes ' , ' Simpl

' __new__ ' , ' __reduce__ ' , ' __reduce_ex__ ' , ' __repr__ ' ]
Now we are getting into the instructions , which is a collection object .
So looping through it we will get :
>>> for ins in pMet.
Body .
Instructions :
... print ins
...
Mono.Cecil.Cil.Instruction
Mono.Cecil.Cil.Instruction
Mono.Cecil.Cil.Instruction
Mono.Cecil.Cil.Instruction
Mono.Cecil.Cil.Instruction
Mono.Cecil.Cil.Instruction
Mono.Cecil.Cil.Instruction
Mono.Cecil.Cil.Instruction
Mono.Cecil.Cil.Instruction
Mono.Cecil.Cil.Instruction
Mono.Cecil.Cil.Instruction
Mono.Cecil.Cil.Instruction
Ok , it prints out the object name as expected .
If you 're trying it out yourself then you 'll find that the intellisense is not working for ins as it is from Mono .
Cecil .
Cil namespace .
So lets add all types from this namespace now .
>>> from Mono .
Cecil .
Cil import *
>>> for ins in pMet.
Body .
Instructions :
... print ins.OpCode .

Comparing it with the output from Reflector :
Cool .
We are getting there .
In the above scenario we have 3 call statements which we are going to focus on from here .
>>> for ins in pMet.
Body .
Instructions :
... if ins.OpCode .
Name == ' call ' :
... ins. Operand
...
< Mono.Cecil.MethodReference object at 0x000000000000003F [ System .
Void System.Console :: WriteLine( System. String ) ] >
< Mono.Cecil.MethodDefinition object at 0x0000000000000031 [ System.Void CecilCase.MainCase :: PrivateMethod ( ) ] >
< Mono.Cecil.MethodDefinition object at 0x000000000000003D [ System .
Void CecilCase.SecondCase:: Help ( System.String ) ] >
So the Operand method gives all the details .
Now , we need to get the method definition objects so that we can recursively go through the child methods .
For that , we define a method which we pass a MethodDefinition object and that prints the child call elements in it .
>>> def parseMethodBody( methodDef ) :
... for ins in methodDef.
Body .
Instructions :
... if ins.OpCode .
Name == ' call ' :
... print ins.
Operand
...
From above , we know the ins .
Operand returns MethodDefinition / MethodReference .
We do n't know the different between MethodDefinition / MethodReference yet .
>>> for ins in pMet.
Body .
Instructions :
... if ins.OpCode .
Name == ' call ' :
... parseMethodBody ( ins .
Operand )
...
Traceback ( most recent call last ) :
File , line 0 , in < stdin >##168
File , line 0 , in parseMethodBody
AttributeError : ' MethodReference ' object has no attribute ' Body '
So , we now know that MethodReference does n't have a Body there we 'll ignore it for now by changing the parseMethodBody method .
>>> def parseMethodBody( mDef ) :
... if isinstance ( mDef , MethodDefinition ) :
... for ins in mDef.Body .
Instructions :
... if ins.OpCode .
Name == ' call ' :
... print ins.
Operand
...
>>> for ins in pMet.
Body .
Instructions :
... if ins.OpCode .
Name == ' call ' :
... parseMethodBody ( ins .
Operand )
...
By running the code , we did n't get any results because stupidly I did n't add the required code in the SecondCase .
Help ( ) method .
Lets add it now .
// SecondCase.cs after adding another method
class SecondCase
{
public void Help ( string message )
{
Console. WriteLine( message ) ;
HelpMeToo( message ) ;
}
public void HelpMeToo( string message2 )
{
Console.WriteLine( message2 ) ;
}
}
You 'll again need to add the assembly by using the Assembly Factory and come to the point where we were before adding the HelpMeToo method .
Let 's Recap here to test your memory .
Load the assembly using Assembly Factory after adding reference to Mono .
Cecil
Get the required Type Get the required Method Get the Instructions ( only call )
Get the Operand of each call statement .
Continuing from where we were :
>>> for inst in pMet.
Body .
Instructions :
... if inst.OpCode .
Name == ' call ' :
... parseMethodBody ( inst.Operand )
...
System .
Void System.Console :: WriteLine ( System .
String )
System .
Void CecilCase.SecondCase:: HelpMeToo( System.String )
You can see that we have the list of methods which are called from SecondCase : : Help ( ) method
Similarly , we can develop a recursive function to iterate through the methods .
But I think this is enough for now and
maybe I 'll try that in the next exercise .
The code above is also available as a ironpython script which can run through the command line to get the same result .

Part II of this tutorial
Take HBO's hit documentary series , Cathouse , which features the most famous of the Nevadan brothels , the Moonlight Bunny Ranch .
Tune in and you'd be forgiven for thinking that all prostitutes in Nevada are on to a good thing .
The women speak coyly about loving their work , their customers , their bosses .
" The series sheds light not only on the numerous joys and challenges of working at a legal brothel , " says the HBO website , " but on the therapeutic benefits that customers take with them after a stint at the Ranch . "
Given such great PR , a new book - Prostitution and Trafficking in Nevada : Making the Connections - makes interesting reading .
During a two - year investigation , the author , Melissa Farley , visited eight legal brothels in Nevada , interviewing 45 women and a number of brothel owners .
Far from enjoying better conditions than those who work illegally , the prostitutes she spoke to are often subject to slave - like conditions .
Described as " pussy penitentiaries " by one interviewee , the brothels tend to be in the middle of nowhere , out of sight of ordinary Nevadans .
( Brothels are officially allowed only in counties with populations of fewer than 400,000 , so prostitution remains an illegal - though vast - trade in conurbations such as Las Vegas . )
The brothel prostitutes often live in prison - like conditions , locked in or forbidden to leave .
" The physical appearance of these buildings is shocking , " says Farley .
" They look like wide trailers with barbed wire around them - little jails . "
The rooms all have panic buttons , but many women told her that they had experienced violent and sexual abuse from the customers and pimps .
" I saw a grated iron door in one brothel , " says Farley .
" The women 's food was shoved through the door 's steel bars between the kitchen and the brothel area .
One pimp starved a woman he considered too fat .
She made a friend outside the brothel who would throw food over the fence for her . "
Another pimp told Farley matter - of - factly that many of the women working for him had histories of sexual abuse and mental ill - health .
" Most , " he said , " have been sexually abused as kids .
Some are bipolar , some are schizophrenic . "
Then there is the fact that legal prostitutes seem to lose the rights ordinary citizens enjoy .
From 1987 , prostitutes in Nevada have been legally required to be tested once a week for sexually transmitted diseases and monthly for HIV .
Customers are not required to be tested .
The women must present their medical clearance to the police station and be finger - printed , even though such registration is detrimental : if a woman is known to work as a prostitute , she may be refused health insurance , face discrimination in housing or future employment , or endure accusations of unfit motherhood .
In addition , there are countries that will not permit registered prostitutes to settle , so their movement is severely restricted .
Those who support the system claim that the regulations may help prevent pimping , which they see as a worse form of exploitation to that which occurs in brothels .
According to Farley 's research though , most women in legal brothels have pimps outside anyway , be they husbands or boyfriends .
And , as Chong Kim , a survivor of prostitution who has worked with Farley , says , some of the legal brothel owners " are worse than any pimp .
They abuse and imprison women and are fully protected by the state . "
The women are expected to live in the brothels and to work 12 - to 14 - hour shifts .
Mary , a prostitute in a legal brothel for three years , outlines the restrictions .
" You are not allowed to have your own car , " she notes .
" It 's like [ the pimp 's ] own little police state . "
When a customer arrives , a bell rings , and the women immediately have to present themselves in a line - up , so he can choose who to buy .
Sheriffs in some counties of Nevada also enforce practices that are illegal .
In one city , for example , prostitutes are not allowed to leave the brothel after 5 pm , are not permitted in bars , and , if entering a restaurant , must use a back door and be accompanied by a man .
So how did Farley gain access to her interviewees ?
Those in control of the women were confident that they would not be honest about the conditions , she says .
" Pimps love to brag , and I know how to listen , " she adds .
Although left alone with the women during interviews , Farley noted that they were all very nervous , constantly looking out for the brothel owners .
Investigating the sex industry - even the legal part - can be dangerous .
During one visit to a brothel , Farley asked the owner what the women thought of their work .
" I was polite , " she writes in her book , " as he condescendingly explained what a satisfying and lucrative business prostitution was for his ' ladies ' .
I tried to keep my facial muscles expressionless , but I did n't succeed .
He whipped a revolver out of his waistband , aimed it at my head and said : ' You do n't know nothing about Nevada prostitution , lady .
You do n't even know whether I will kill you in the next five minutes . ' "
Farley found that the brothel owners typically pocket half of the women 's earnings .
Additionally , the women must pay tips and other fees to the staff of the brothel , as well as finders ' fees to the cab drivers who bring the customers .
They are also expected to pay for their own condoms , wet wipes , and use of sheets and towels .
It is rare , the women told Farley , to refuse a customer .
One former Nevada brothel worker wrote on a website : " After your airline tickets , clothing , full - price drinks and other miscellaneous fees you leave with little .
To top it off , you are ... fined for just about everything .
Fall asleep on your 14 - hour shift and get $ 100 [ £ 50 ] fine , late for a line - up , $ 100 - 500 in fines . "
( The women generally negotiate directly with the men over the money ; what they get depends on the quality of the brothel .
It can be anything from $ 50 for oral sex to $ 1,000 for the night , but that does n't take account of the brothel 's cut . )
Farley found a " shocking " lack of services for women in Nevada wishing to leave prostitution .
" When prostitution is considered a legal job instead of a human rights violation , " says Farley , " why should the state offer services for escape ? "
More than 80 % of those interviewed told Farley they wanted to leave prostitution .
The effect of all this on the women in the brothels is " negative and profound , " according to Farley .
" Many were suffering what I 'd describe as the traumatic effects of ongoing sexual assaults , and those that had been in the brothels for some time were institutionalised .
That is , they were passive , timid , compliant , and deeply resigned . "
" No one really enjoys getting sold , " says Angie , who Farley interviewed .
" It 's like you sign a contract to be raped . "
Meanwhile , illegal brothels are on the increase in Nevada , as they are in other parts of the world where brothels are legalised .
Nevada 's illegal prostitution industry is already nine times greater than the state 's legal brothels .
" Legalising this industry does not result in the closing down of illegal sex establishments , " says Farley , " it merely gives them further permission to exist . "
Farley found evidence , for example , that the existence of state - sanctioned brothels can have a direct effect on attitudes to women and sexual violence .
Her survey of 131 young men at the University of Nevada found the majority viewed prostitution as normal , assumed that it was not possible to rape a prostitute , and were more likely than young men in other states to use women in both legal and illegal prostitution .
The solution , Farley believes , is to educate people about the realities of legalised abuse of women .
" Once the people of Nevada learn of [ prostitutes ' ] suffering and emotional distress , and their lack of human rights , they , like me , will be persuaded that legal prostitution is an institution that just can't be fixed up or made a little better .
It has to be abolished . "
The prevailing attitude in Nevada remains as it was a few centuries back though - that men have sexual " needs " that they have a right to fulfil .
Outside one of the legal brothels a sign reads : " He who hesitates , masturbates . "

Bear Stearns told clients in its two battered hedge funds late yesterday that their investments , worth an estimated $ 1.5 billion at the end of 2006 , are almost entirely gone .
In phone calls to anxious investors , Bear Stearns brokers reported yesterday that May and June had been devastating months for the portfolios .
The more conservative fund , the High - Grade Structured Credit Strategies Fund , was down 91 percent by the end of June , investors were told .
The High - Grade Structured Credit Strategies Enhanced Leverage Fund , which used extensive borrowings and assumed more risk , has no investor capital left , the firm said .
“ In light of these returns , we will seek an orderly wind - down of the funds over time , ” a letter to Bear Stearns clients said .
Overseen by Bear Stearns Asset Management , the hedge funds had been stellar performers until this spring when the mortgage securities market began to falter .
Delinquencies on loans made to risky borrowers , known as subprime mortgages , started climbing in February ; since then the value of the securities have spiraled downward .

Protesting Bush Outlawed At APEC
by Paul Joseph Watson
Authorities turn Sydney into a prison camp and refuse “ permission ” for main organizations to march , characterizing protest as “ an unlawful act ”
Authorities have effectively outlawed protest at the APEC summit in Sydney Australia by refusing to grant “ permission ” for groups to march anywhere in the city , while quarantining part of the central business district within a 3 - mile wide security fence .
Around 100 protesters were able to stage a demonstration outside Sydney ’s main railway station today , but they were heavily outnumbered by police and media .
New South Wales ( NSW ) state Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione characterized the protests as “ an unlawful act ” during a press conference and urged others not to get involved .
The Stop Bush Coalition , which promises to bring around 20,000 protesters to the summit , have repeatedly been rebuffed by the authorities in their attempts to get “ permission ” to stage a march on their planned route , which is still several city blocks away from where the summit leaders will be meeting .

Early humans successfully fended off a virus that infected chimpanzees by evolving a protein capable of neutralizing it , according to a new study .
But what goes around comes around , evolutionarily speaking :
Four million years later , the same protein seems to have left us more vulnerable than other primates to the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) .
When researchers sequenced the chimpanzee genome in 2005 , the biggest difference between it and the human genome was the extinct PtERV1 retrovirus , which inserted its DNA into the cells it infected like HIV does today .
Chimps had 130 copies of PtERV1 , but humans had none .
" The question is : Why did our sister species get infected and not humans ? " says virologist Michael Emerman of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle .
Looking for an answer , Emerman and colleagues homed in on the immune protein TRIM5α , one of several proteins involved in innate immunity , the body 's first line of defense against viral infection .
The TRIM5α gene varies widely among primates and has changed the most between chimps and humans , suggesting that it evolved to combat some virus humans were susceptible to , Emerman says .
Rhesus monkey TRIM5α protects against HIV - 1 , but the only modern virus that the human protein has any effect on is one that causes leukemia in mice — which happens to be closely related to PtERV1 .
TRIM5α seems to neutralize the mouse virus 's inner core protein after it has entered a cell .
So Emerman and colleagues resurrected the analogous protein from PtERV1 , based on its remnants in chimpanzees , and inserted it into a defective version of the mouse virus , which could infect cells but not reproduce .
The altered virus was unable to infect feline cells engineered to produce human TRIM5α , the group reports online today in Science .
Unexpectedly , however , the researchers found that no version of TRIM5α from any primate could neutralize both PtERV1 and HIV — it was either one or the other , Emerman says .
What that implies , he says , is " humans are susceptible to HIV today because of a response to something else we had in the past . "
HIV researcher Beatrice Hahn of the University of Alabama at Birmingham calls the study a " fabulous piece of molecular sleuthing " and says that understanding innate immune proteins may eventually lead to new HIV treatment strategies .
TRIM5α is not the final word on HIV susceptibility , she adds .
None of the proteins protect against HIV - 2 , which came to us from apes like HIV - 1 did , she says , but humans have apparently fended off nearly 40 other monkey retroviruses , so our innate immunity " was n't quite as bad as you thought . "
The first is this passage :
" If a state wants to set its income limit above 250 percent of the poverty level ( $ 51,625 for a family of four ) , Mr. Smith said , ' the state must establish a minimum of a one - year period of uninsurance for individuals ' before they can receive public coverage . "
So basically , the pro-devolution and pro-" states rights " Republican
Party is now on record saying that if a state legislature wants to extend coverage to a family of four making over $ 51,625 , the legislature must insist that the family go without health insurance for a year .
Wonderful .
The other nugget is this :
" In his letter , Mr. Smith said the new standards would apply to states that previously received federal approval to cover children with family incomes exceeding 250 percent of the poverty level .
Such states should amend their state plans to meet federal expectations within 12 months , or the Bush administration ' may pursue corrective action , ' Mr. Smith said .
This is threatening , deliberately intimidating Big Brother - style language .
The federal government " may pursue corrective action ? "
Against who ?
In states that expand their CHIP programs , are federal agents going to swarm in and revoke publicly subsidized health insurance from working - class families and force those families to retroactively pay back the aid they received ?
Is that " corrective action ? "
If not , what is ?
I 'm not even joking around here - these are very legitimate questions that we have to ask .
Lyndon Johnson engaged in a " War On Poverty " - a war to try to end poverty .
George W. Bush is embarking on a " War For Poverty " - and this move represents the final attempt to solidify his legacy as the most ardent reverse - Robin - Hood class warrior ever to hold the White House .

Exxon Mobil is the world 's largest listed oil company
Last week Exxon posted a quarterly profit of $ 9.9bn ( £ 5.55 bn ) , the largest in US corporate history , on the back of record oil and gas prices .
King Win Laurel has filed papers with the Securities and Exchange Commission offering to buy the firm in a dollars and yuan deal worth $ 70 a share .
Exxon said it did not believe King was " financially capable " of such an offer .
A Reuters reporter visited King Win Laurel 's registered address in China , and found it to be a 14th - floor flat in a tower block on the outskirts of Beijing - apparently inhabited by a man in his mid-20s .
SEC documents included both the Beijing contact address and one in Auckland , New Zealand .
Documents needed
Texas - based Exxon is the world 's biggest publicly - traded oil company .
It has been benefiting from the rising cost of oil , brought on by the two hurricanes which hit the Gulf of Mexico in late summer , disrupting output .
King Win Laurel , which said it was incorporated in New Zealand on 21 October , said the offer was subject to financing and included incentives for shareholders if the price of oil kept on rising .
But Exxon said it had received no communications from China .
" We do not believe that King Win Laurel Limited is financially capable of making such a tender offer , " Exxon spokesman Dave Gardner said in a statement .
It is not out of the realm of possibility that the Chinese government could fund a bid for Exxon
Jon Cartwright , BOSC
The Chinese outfit would have needed to submit documentation to get access to the SEC 's electronic filing system and provide a sworn statement verifying its identity .
" Any person who meets requirements and certifies that they are who they say they are can file , " said SEC spokesman John Heine .
" Of course there are all sorts of possible consequences if someone is abusing the system . "
The booming Chinese economy is in need of increasing oil supplies , and earlier this year its oil producer CNOOC withdrew an $ 18.5 bn ( £ 10.4bn ) bid for US firm Unocal , after American political opposition .
" It is not out of the realm of possibility that the Chinese government could fund a bid for Exxon , so we can't ignore it entirely , even though that 's my initial inclination , " said debt analyst Jon Cartwright of BOSC .
Previous attempt
This is not the first time the owners of King Win Laurel have tried to get into the acquisitions business .
In 2003 , they started a company in New Zealand with almost exactly the same name - King Win Laurel International - and the same registered address in Auckland .
That time , the target was a fast food company called Restaurant Brands , and the bid was thrown out because New Zealand 's Takeover Panel said it did not comply with takeover rules .
The previous company was run by Ying Wang and Xiufeng Zhang - the registered director of the current King Win - with part of the ownership lodged in a UK - registered company , Kingwin Holding ( UK ) .
Both the UK and New Zealand firms were dissolved in early 2005 .
UK company documents say that Mr Wang is 25 years old , while Mr Zhang is 33 .
Each day at StepForth Placement we view dozens of websites that request a SEO Review and a vast majority of these sites have fundamental usability problems .
Often times neglecting this important element of a website can lead online visitors to become lost , frustrated and / or confused .
All it takes for a visitor to decide to stay , explore or leave a site is 0.4 of a second .
Attracting visitors to your website is a formidable challenge ; it is yet another to build a fast connection with them and keep them there .
With this in mind , here are some simple measures that can be taken to remedy these mistakes and help promote your online conversions .
Having great search engine placements is one thing but to create a usable website environment is just as important .
What good can come from " being found " if users quickly exit your site ?
A solid search engine friendly and usable website should be your answer to both of these major components for your online success .
Editorial Note : A firestorm of controversy erupted last Wednesday following a brief press conference at SES in Chicago about rampant click fraud , criminal bot networks and Google .
Webmaster Radio followed up by airing an explosive interview with Clarence Briggs , CEO of AIT.com and the lead proponent in the class action lawsuit against Google earlier this year .
Pro and con posts on the story can be found at Search Engine Journal .
We 'll continue to track the story as it develops and keep you posted .
There are a variety of standards still in place when it comes to designing a usable website .
This is not to say that the uniqueness and creativity of your website has to suffer , rather by following some simple guidelines visitors know where to go to find the information they need .
The process of developing a usable interface can be a balancing act .
Some core elements need to be assessed prior to any actual design work being done .
Attention to content creation , search engine friendly design tactics , and the face you put on your design each have to be blended into this usable environment .
This is a timely subject for us at StepForth as we are in the early stages of revamping our own websites based on customer / client feedback , recent trends in the design world , and our ever increasing need to develop a scalable website solution .
Needless to say we will be following the same guidelines outlined below to ensure we have a website that " works " .
I would highly recommend referring to the related links located at the bottom of this article for more details on this subject .
Here is a snap shot of the most common design mistakes we see with websites .
Content
Formatting Linking Text
Frequently we see designers underline body text or even text in images that is not directing users to another part of the website .
Underlining on non-linking text is a huge problem especially if you have other links on the site that use the underline to illustrate a clickable path to follow .
A current trend is to have links displayed in body text without the underline text decoration ( as defined in the website 's CSS ) yet this may still cause unnecessary confusion with users .
Try using other methods to highlight a message you want to stand out from the rest of the page content when it is not intended to be a hyperlink .
The same rules apply with the actual colour scheme you choose for your text .
Avoid the use of the standard link colour blue ( RGB colour # 0000 FF ) for non-linking text as well .
This will stop users from becoming frustrated when they attempt to click on text that will take them nowhere .
High Contrast Body Text
Another poor design trend we are seeing more of is the presentation of grey body text on a white background .
This has no value what so ever as it immediately excludes a vast majority of users that cannot even read what is displayed .
This is definitely one case where usability outweighs the need for attractive page aesthetics .
If clarity is your goal for your website , then advocate high contrast body text .
This rule also applies to text on images ; it is best to avoid fonts and styles that are hard to read .
Page Scanning
The old saying " first impressions are important " holds true when it comes to a visit to a website .
There is a fine balance when it comes to how much text to include on any give page or subject .
Remember time is precious before a user determines if they are in the right location on your website or not .
Keep your initial message brief and informative and offer related pathways if the user wants to learn more .
Most users have the habit of quickly scanning a couple of paragraphs before they either decide to learn more or look elsewhere .
Site Structure and Page Organization
Promoting a site structure that builds a level of user confidence is critical to a website 's success .
Will visitors find the information they are looking for or can they clearly understand your message ?
Solidifying a clear and organized site structure from the top down will help with this .
Logical Site Structure
Depending on the scale of the website this task can be fairly easily implemented .
Unfortunately a common mistake is to try to cram as much information on a page as possible .
Each topic should have its own page and any additional related material to that content should be the only linked content present ( other than the main site wide navigation ) .
To help clarify this , here is an example :
Perhaps you are selling musical instruments online and the page in question is a guitar you are trying to promote .
Included on this page should be the standard image(s ) of the product , and the description of the product in detail .
If users wish to learn more about the product such as technical specifications or an online downloadable manual they should be ( logically ) linked on the page as well , along with any other relevant material directly related to that product .
It is very easy ( and common ) to want to point to other unrelated content that you think a user might want to know about .
Do not offer opportunities for them to be led astray by cluttering the page with other products .
Chances are potential customers arrived to that particular page because they wanted to .
Cluttering a page with additional information about the latest flute in stock is not going to help conversions .
Perhaps the reason that web designers fall into this trap is most likely because they try to employ tactics used in print advertising .
With print advertising you are given a certain amount of ad space to illustrate your product .
Sometimes the designers forget that websites are dynamic and can grow beyond that page .
Splash Page
Visitors are coming to your website to find the information they are looking for and often the first thing they see is a splash page .
The majority of the time these intro pages offer nothing useful to the user and fall outside any consistent look and feel of the rest of the website .
Generally speaking , the sole purpose of a splash page is to add a " cool " factor to the entryway to the site .
Each and every page on your site including the homepage should be informative and consistent in look and feel .
AN SEO NOTE :
If the above is not enough to scare you off of using splash screens , consider that SEOs believe the index page ( aka the home page ) is perhaps the most crucial element to successful search engine placements .
If you have very little relevant content on your index page it throws up an unnecessary barrier to the search engines .
What good can come from making your website usable if nobody can even find it to begin with ?
Learn more about the dangers of Splash Screens >>
Navigation
The placement and organization of the navigation on your website is critical to keeping those potential customers on your website .
Customer satisfaction statistics state that up to 95 % of visitor frustration comes from inadequate navigation methods .
Maintain Site - wide Standards
Exactly where is the best place on a page to insert your navigation ?
Numerous studies have been done on this .
Should the main navigation be on the top of the page ?
Should it be on the left hand side of the page ?
However you choose to present your navigation keep it consistently placed throughout the website .
Users should always know how to get back to information they have already seen and as well , they should be confident they can find the information they have yet to read .
The homepage button should be in the same place on the page regardless of where you are on the site .
What am I Clicking ?
Users should always be made aware ahead of time by what is stated in the anchor text or button where they will go if they click that particular link .
If the click leads to a downloadable piece of software or to a PDF file , inform them upfront .
A vast majority of web surfers are discouraged by unexpected results by navigating through websites and being forced into something they do not want to do .
The following is a good example on how to inform a user that the link they are about to click is a PDF file ( warning : the following examples are not linked ) :
" Product " User Manual in PDF format ( 16MB )
Or
" Product " User Manual ( 16MB – PDF format )
NOTE : It is also a common courtesy to inform users of the physical size of file to be downloaded , as shown above .
Just like there are rules of the road when driving a car there are guidelines to follow when developing a website .
It is important to note that if tackled in the right manner incorporating basic usability components should not hamper creativity with the vision you have with your website .

Findings described in a new study by Stanford scientists may be the first step toward a major revolution in human regenerative medicine — a future where advanced organ damage can be repaired by the body itself .
In the May 2007 issue of The FASEB Journal , researchers show that a human evolutionary ancestor , the sea squirt , can correct abnormalities over a series of generations , suggesting that a similar regenerative process might be possible in people .
" We hope the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon will ultimately lead to new insights regarding the potential of cells and tissues to be reprogrammed and regenerate compromised organs in humans , " said Ayelet Voskoboynik , Ph.D. , of Stanford University and first author of the study .
Missing limbs , scarred hearts , broken spines , and wounded muscles always try to repair themselves , but often the result is invalidism or disease .
Even some tumors try to revert to normal , but are unsuccessful .
If the genetic sequence described in the sea squirt applies to humans , this study represents a major step for regenerative medicine .
The sea squirt is more closely related to humans than many would expect .
It may appear similar to a sea sponge , worm , or plant , but it is actually not closely related to any of these organisms .
Sea squirt larvae have primitive spinal cords , distinguishing them in the greater chain of life and on the evolutionary ladder .
Specifically , sea squirts , like humans , belong to a group of animals called chordates ( organisms with some level of spinal cord development ) , and many scientists believe that sea squirts approximate what the very first human chordate ancestor may have been like 550 million years ago .
By studying this modern day representative of our evolutionary ancestor , researchers are able to identify fundamental principles of complex processes , such as healing and organ regeneration , on which new treatments are based .
" The aim of biomedical science is to understand life so we can defend our bodies against injury , deformity , and disease .
The ultimate medical treatment would be to change an abnormal organ or tissue back to its vibrant , normal state , " said Gerald Weissmann , M.D. , Editor - in - Chief of The FASEB Journal .
" This study is a landmark in regenerative medicine ; the Stanford group has accomplished the biological equivalent of turning a sow ’s ear into a silk purse and back again . "

And he was constantly in pain , moaning and groaning until you began to wonder if he was doing it just for effect .
Worst of all , he was a mean old cuss , angry and embittered after years of illness .
All he did was complain .
A few dozen medical students , most of them in their first year at Weill Medical College of Cornell University , listened with concern to a presentation about him a few weeks ago .
Eventually , they knew , they would run into difficult patients like this one .
The sick man had been a mover and shaker once , with a place in high government circles .
But then he had the accident .
His wound became infected .
It was all downhill from there .
He quickly became unable to work , and his distress upset everyone around him .
Finally , his business associates forced him into long - term residential care .
Some of the faculty members in the conference room nodded in recognition .
It was a case right out of a chronic - care ward in a Veterans Administration hospital .
ON July 29 , Continental Flight 1669 , a 737-700 with about 120 passengers aboard , was bound for Newark from Caracas , Venezuela , when bad weather caused the plane to be diverted to Baltimore .
It sat there for about five hours with passengers on board as food and water ran low and toilets became filthy .
Since Dec. 29 , there have been hundreds of reports of passengers unable to get off parked airplanes for 6 , 8 and even 12 hours .
Just last weekend , for example , a Customs computer breakdown at Los Angeles International Airport stranded more than 17,000 international passengers on planes , some for more than 10 hours .
But what made the Continental flight somewhat different was that passengers organized and protested by clapping in rhythm and drumming on overhead bins .
Finally , the pilot , worried about mayhem , called the police .
“ People were clapping , but nobody got out of hand , ” said Israel Niezen , a developer of interactive media who was returning to his home near Los Angeles through Newark when Flight 1669 was diverted to Baltimore Washington International Airport .
Ginko attracted deposits by offering to pay 0.10 per cent daily accrued interest , which equates to a 44 per cent annual return .
The bank claimed to have 18,000 accounts and deposits amounting to $ US700,000 ( $ A800,000 ) in real money .
The in - world currency in Second Life is called the Linden ( $L ) and it is freely convertible into US dollars at an exchange rate of $ L270 to the dollar .
The idea of unilaterally converting deposits into bonds is to buy time for the bank to replenish its cash reserves .
Account holders can still opt to withdraw their funds , but instead of receiving par value as a depositor , they will only receive the market value of the security .
Currently , they are trading at a steep discount to their face value .
" There are a lot of people who put money in there and they are not going to get it out again , " said Robert Bloomfield , a professor of management and accounting at Cornell University and a close observer of the Second Life economy .
" For some of those people it 's enough money that it 's actually meaningful to them . "
In a note posted on the Ginko Financial website and on its network of virtual ATMs , the bank said it had been forced to take the action after a run on its deposits that was triggered by a recent decision by Second Life 's owners to ban gambling in the virtual world .
San Francisco - based Linden Lab ordered the ban after reportedly inviting the FBI to examine gambling activities in its 3D world .
Legislation passed in the US last year makes it a crime to use credit cards or online payment systems to make bets on the internet .
The Ginko notice said the bank began " experiencing a wave of withdrawals " after the ban was announced on July 26 .
" This led the funds we keep in reserve for day to day use to be exhausted , which evolved into a full blown panic depleting even our last line of cash reserves and resulting in the current situation , with about L$ 50,000,000 [ $ US185,000 ] queued up for withdrawal . "
Faced with having to conduct a fire sale of its assets , Ginko instead opted to convert the deposits into bonds - a course of action that would not be open to banks in the real world .
Ginko has long been criticised as being a scam and Linden Lab has also been accused of failing to use its powers to bring the bank into line .
But Luke Connell , the CEO of the World Stock Exchange and its parent company Hope Capital , has defended the move , saying it was necessary to avoid a banking collapse .
" You do n't want to have Ginko crash because if it does , it makes the entire Second Life economy look bad , " he said .
Ginko is the largest shareholder in WSE 's parent company , Hope Capital .
Investor confidence in Connell 's exchange has also been tested in recent week with news that a former employee defrauded WSE of $ US12,300 .
Connell says the money has since been identified and sequestered by Linden Lab and some of it has been returned .
He accused some members of the Second Life community of spreading rumours about the viability of his exchange in an attempt to undermine him .
In particular he pointed the finger at a couple of companies which had intended to float shares on the WSE but which subsequently withdrew their IPOs after failing to attract investors .
Connell said they blamed the cancellation of the floats on troubles at WSE .
" At the end of the day at the WSE , everything is exactly as it should be , " he said .
He said in the interest of transparency he would be handing over data on trades , dividends and stock issues for firms listed on the WSE to Professor Bloomfield who is conducting a study into Second Life financial markets .
Two smaller Second Life exchanges have already begun supplying the information .
Professor Bloomfield intends to analyse then publish his findings which he says should help boost confidence and ultimately attract new investors and listings .
He said while some of the exchanges were getting better at making disclosure , the banks were not .
" You just have no idea what 's happening with the [ depositors ' ] money , " he said .
Guido van Rossum unveiled his first Google project , Mondrian , tonight during a Python tech talk at the Google campus in Mountain View .
Mondrian is a web - based code review system built on top of a Perforce and BigTable backend with a Python - powered front - end .
Mondrian is a pretty impressive system and is currently in use across Google .
Shared Development Environment
Google uses a company - wide Perforce depot with almost no developer branches .
Each developer has their own NFS workspace readable by anyone in the company , including automated processes .
An administrative process takes snapshots of each developer workspace including local development environments accessed over SSH .
Files within these snapshots can be compared to checked - in data , encrypted , and archived .
Previous methods of review
Previous to Mondrian code review was conducted largely over e-mail using Google command - line wrappers built on top of Perforce .
A developer could initiate a code review from within the g4 mail tool , which would fire off an e-mail and begin a review thread .
When the developer receives a response of “ looks good to me , ” or lgtm for short , they could proceed to checkin .
Changes could be compared using tkdiff .
Design - level reviews are often conducted by e-mailing around Word documents or editing a team wiki .
Recently some design reviews have moved onto an internal version of Google Docs .
Web - based collaboration meets code review
The Mondrian tool creates a much better workflow by creating task - specific dashboards , in - line commenting , well - tracked statistics , and more .
The application is built on top of Python open source libraries such as the Django framework , smtpd.py mail service , and the wsgiref web server software .
Code reviews can be initiated and completed from within the Mondrian interface .
A developer requests a review from another user or a group of users to kick off the process .
Each invited reviewer can add comments directly underneath a line of code or reference the entire file .
You can request and diff the file against previous versions as well .
It ’s a pretty slick interface , lightly highlighting each line of code as you hover , and popping open a comment box in response to a double - click .
Comments can be saved as a draft and shared at a later time .
Putting the entire code review process online means you never have to worry about referencing the most recent version of a file or losing e-mails .
Mondrian captures every outgoing e-mail related to the workflow , looks for key data such as revision numbers , and updates a to - do list accordingly .
More on BigTable
Mondrian uses BigTable as backend storage for user data .
More specifically , it ’s used to store :
Change metadata such as a description or list of files
Comments entered through the web interface or via e-mail
Encrypted file snapshots taken from user workspaces
Per -user data such as active changes or last view dates
Summary
The Mondrian web code review system is pretty impressive .
Guido estimates he has spent about 25 % of his work time on the project since joining Google in December 2005 .
Mondrian served as Guido ’s introduction to Google technologies and processes with the help of a few other Googlers treating it as a side - project .
The application is so deeply intertwined with Google technologies it ’s not likely to be available as open source until Subversion and a backend such as SQLite can be supported .
I have been closely watching OPIS reports this week , and gas prices have ticked up most days .
I do n't have the numbers in front of me , but I think gas is at least a dime higher than it was a week ago .
( It occurs to me that if I would ever act on my predictions and buy some futures , I could make a little money ) .
Gasoline inventories were not this low following Hurricane Katrina , and yet we have had an uneventful summer .
It is very possible that we will not dig ourselves out of this hole for a long time .
In the short term , an upturn in gasoline prices is inevitable .
This week 's inventory report saw another gasoline draw :
U.S. commercial crude oil inventories ( excluding those in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve ) fell by 3.9 million barrels compared to the previous week .
However , at 329.7 million barrels , U.S. crude oil inventories remain above the upper end of the average range for this time of year .
Total motor gasoline inventories dropped by 1.5 million barrels last week , and are well below the lower end of the average range .
" Well below " may be an understatement .
Looking at my records , there have n't been too many weeks on record where gasoline inventories have been lower on an absolute basis ( and never on a days of supply basis ) .
In fact , the last time gasoline inventories were this low on an absolute basis was the week after Hurricane Katrina .
Incidentally , this week 's gasoline inventory is 191.1 million barrels .
The lowest number on record was on August 29 , 1997 at 185.6 million barrels .
The next few weeks will be interesting .
We are at the end of peak driving season , but we will soon be heading into fall turnaround season where gasoline production will drop .
Winter gasoline is also right around the corner .
This time of year typically sees gasoline prices fall ( prompting conspiracy calls when it also happens to be an election year ) but with inventories where they are we probably wo n't see that typical price drop .
In my opinion , we can't afford to see it .
Last fall prices fell , and demand picked up .
We can't afford for demand to pick up with inventories setting where they are .
I predict that prices will continue to rise .
I think they have to .
I also think we will see the ramifications of present inventory levels for quite some time .
On the other hand , we did go into the end of 2003 with inventories in this range , so we do have some history suggesting that levels can recover without requiring sharply higher prices .
But do n't bet on it .
Update : Conoco Sweeny , Texas Refinery To Shut Gasoline Unit
NEW YORK -( Dow Jones ) - ConocoPhillips ( COP ) plans to shut a key gasoline production unit at its Sweeny refinery in Texas on Thursday to make emergency repairs , according to a filing with state environmental regulators .
A plug valve in the reactor associated with the fluid catalytic cracker is the source of the problem , said the report to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality .
The shutdown , said to begin at 11 a.m. CDT Thursday , is seen lasting about 36 hours .
The report did n't indicate how long repairs might take or when the unit would return to normal operations .
The Sweeny refinery is able to process about 247,000 barrels of crude oil a day .
That 's not going to help matters any .

Dozens of veiled women gathered outside the Old Bailey to protest against the jail sentences given to four Muslim men for encouraging terrorism .
Mizanur Rahman , 24 , Umran Javed , 27 , and Abdul Muhid , 25 , were each jailed for six years for inciting murder and racial hatred during a demonstration against cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed .
A fourth man , 32 - year - old Abdul Saleem , was cleared of soliciting murder but convicted of inciting racial hatred .
He was jailed for four years .
Scroll down for more ...
Rahman had called for British soldiers to come home from Iraq in body bags , and Muhid chanted : " Bomb , bomb the UK " .
Outside the court , around 40 demonstrators - most hiding their faces - chanted and held placards .
Among them were a gaggle of women in burkas , who held up a sign which read : " British police go to hell " .
Police officers stood by as the group were kept behind barriers across the road .
Judge Brian Barker , the Common Serjeant of London , told the four men their words had been designed to encourage murder and terrorism .
Scroll down for more ...
He told them : " No one is entitled to make perverted use of ideology to propagate destruction and death . "
The judge said the protest in February 2006 had been " threatening , hateful and uncompromising " and the four men had " whipped up a frenzy " and gone far beyond what was " acceptable and legal " .
The four were arrested after 300 protesters marched to the Danish Embassy in central London over a cartoon which they said was offensive to Islam .
The drawing , which depicted the Prophet Mohammed wearing a headdress shaped like a bomb , was one of several printed in a Danish newspaper .
Scroll down for more ...
It caused outrage in the Islamic world where images of Mohammed are forbidden .
Rahman , 24 , of Palmers Green , North London , chanted to the crowd : " Oh Allah , we want to see another 9/11 in Iraq , another 9/11 in Denmark , another 9/11 in Spain , in France , all over Europe . "
Javed , from Birmingham , was recorded on video by the police shouting : " Bomb , bomb Denmark .
Bomb , bomb U.S.A. " Muhid , of Whitechapel , East London , led a crowd in chanting " Bomb , bomb the UK " .
Scroll down for more ...
Saleem , of Poplar , East London , was heard to chant : " UK you will pay , 7/7 on its way " and " Europe you will pay with your blood " .
Judge Barker told the defendants they had subjected London 's multi-national citizens to a " barrage of hatred and intolerance , just months after the July 7 outrage " .
He added : " Freedoms of speech and assembly have long been jealously guarded by our laws .
" With freedom comes respect and responsibility - none of which was demonstrated by you .
" What you were part of was the complete opposite of peaceful protest . "

As displays increase in size and prices drop , more and more users will end up with relatively large displays by default .
Nobody buys 15 or 17 inch displays any more ; soon , it wo n't make financial sense to buy a display smaller than 20 inches .
Eventually , if this trend continues , everyone will have 30 - inch displays on their desktops .
This is clearly a good thing .
You can never have enough display space .
But there is one unintended consequence of large displays .
One of the advantages of small monitors , ironically , is that because they 're small , they nudge users into a simpler , windowless method of working .
Instead of wasting time sizing , moving , and z- ordering windows , users only need to deal with one maximized window at a time .
They can flip between maximized applications in much the same way they change channels on the television .
But once your display gets to 1600 x 1200 or beyond , this easy one - app - per - display model is n't feasible any more .
Dan recently ran into this problem when he upgraded to a 30 " LCD :
Users of 30 - inch monitors face the terrible , terrible problem of how to effectively use all of that space .
You do n't often want to maximise a folder or document window on a screen this big ; either you 'll end up with a lot of white space and important program buttons separated by a vast expanse of nothing , or you 'll get lines of text 300 or more characters long , which are difficult to read .
That 's the large display paradox .
Having all that space can make you less productive due to all the window manipulation excise you have to deal with to make effective use of it .
Personally , I 'm a card - carrying member of the prestigious three monitor club , which means I 'm one step ahead of Dan .
At least until he doubles or triples down :
Although my displays are only 20 inches in size , I have three of them .
Maximizing a window to a 20 inch , 1600 x 1200 display area is a reasonable thing to do most of the time .
I also use UltraMon , which gives me the indispensible ability to drag maximized windows between monitors .
I 'm constantly grabbing maximized windows and " throwing " them from monitor to monitor , ala Minority Report .
With my triple monitor setup , I have a very large display surface with a primary area of focus and secondary areas that I can " snap " items to when I want them available for reference , but out of the way .
I have a natural snapping grid because I use three physical monitors .
It 's a side - effect of the hardware , but a crucial one that I 've absolutely come to rely on .
Dan only has a single large 30 inch monitor , so he has no natural grid to snap windows to .
He needs a software solution :
I 've been using WinSplit Revolution to manage this problem .
It 's a neat little Windows utility that makes it easy to bounce ( most ) windows around the screen and quickly resize them to take up the amounts of screen you probably want them to occupy .
Two panes , each 1280 by 1600 , give you a couple of twenty inch portrait - aspect - ratio " screens " that work great for many tasks .
I run into this problem a little bit on my three 20 inch displays , but it 's only a minor nuisance .
I 'm in serious trouble if I ever get a multiple monitor setup with displays larger than 20 inches .
( I 'd also need a much , much larger desk . )
There 's no question that maximized windows are n't effective on large displays .
For larger displays , I 'd need to extend the " snap grid " effect of my three monitors to each individual monitor .
That 's exactly what the WinSplit Revolution app does .
It 's quite intuitive ; you use CTRL +ALT +( numpad ) to push the currently selected window towards the quadrant of the screen represented by the number .
Pressing the key sequence multiple times iterates through the two or three possible sizes at that particular position .
This diagram explains it better than I can in text :
As you can see , you end up with a few dozen possible grid arrangements just using the simple numpad direction metaphor .
But it 's still quite a bit of work ; I have to select each window and then use the numeric keypad ( or the popup window equivalent ) to push it over where I want it to go .
As of version 1.8 , WinSplit Revolution is perfectly multiple monitor aware , and even offers a convenient key combo to move windows from monitor to monitor , too .
Fortunately , there 's GridMove , which supports multiple monitors .
Just use the middle mouse button to drag a window , and you invoke the current grid template , which provides automatic snappable drop targets for that window .
In the not - too - distant future , every user will have a monitor so large that maximizing a window no longer makes sense for most applications .
It 's too bad some kind of automatic snap grid support can't be embedded into the operating system to help users deal with large display areas .
Like Dan , we 're all going to need it sooner or later .
Until then , these applications -- or ones like them -- can fill the gap .

Science and technology reporter , BBC News
Imagery for the system came from six research institutions
Google developer describes
Sky 's techniques
The tool is an add - on to Google Earth , a program that allows users to search a 3D rendition of our planet 's surface .
Sky will allow astronomers a chance to glide through images of more than one million stars and 200 million galaxies .
Optional layers allow users to explore images from the Hubble Space Telescope as well as animations of lunar cycles .
" The basic idea is to take Google Earth and turn it on its head , " Ed Parsons , Geospatial technologist at Google told the BBC News website .
" So rather than using it to view imagery of the Earth , use it to view imagery of space . "
Dr John Mason of the British Astronomical Association , Britain 's largest body for amateur astronomers said : " Light pollution and air pollution is now so bad in many areas that all you can see when you look up is a few dozen stars .
" If this helps people to realise just what they are missing , it is a jolly good thing . "
Clear view
To use the new system , users will need to have Google Earth installed on their computer .
Digital astronomers can then zoom into an area from which they want to view the night sky .
SKY LAYERS Constellations : Connects stars and labels with name Backyard astronomy : Information on objects visible to the eye and small telescopes Hubble Space Telescope Imagery : 129 high - resolution pictures from Hubble Moon :
Two months of lunar positions and moon phases Planets : Positions of seven planets two months ahead Users Guide to Galaxies : Virtual tours through different types of galaxies Life of a star :
The different stages of a star 's life cycle
" Click a button and the world flips round and you see the sky from that particular location , " explained Mr Parsons .
" [ The view ] would be the constellations that you would see oriented in the sky on that particular day at that particular time . "
Users can overlay the night sky with other information such as galaxies , constellations and detailed images from the Hubble Space Telescope .
Imagery for the system came from six research institutions including the Digital Sky Survey Consortium , the Palomar Observatory in California and the United Kingdom Astronomy Technology Centre .
Much of the imagery can be found through searches on the internet but Google hope the add - on will be simpler and more fun .
Mr Parsons said : " The sky you will be seeing will be a completely clear and you will be able to see objects which are very faint indeed - that you can only see with very large telescopes . "
Virtual tour
Sky is not the first time Google has ventured into space .
In March 2006 , the company launched Google Mars which allows users to explore the surface of the Red Planet .
Nasa ' and Google signed an agreement in December 2006
Another service , Google Moon , lets users view the sites of the Apollo moon landings .
Both services use data from the US Space Agency Nasa , with which Google signed an agreement in December 2006 .
The Space Agreement Act was intended to put " the most useful of Nasa 's information on the internet " .
At the time , Nasa administrator Michael Griffin said the agreement would soon allow " every American to experience a virtual flight over the surface of the moon or through the canyons of Mars " .
The two organisations also said they would collaborate in a variety of areas including adding data collected by Nasa to Google Earth .
However , Mr Parsons said the latest tool was not a product of the partnership .
Mass market
Google
Sky is not the only tool that allows astronomers to explore the night sky from their computer .
Stellarium shows the night sky in 3D
For example , Stellarium is a free open source tool that gives people a chance to access more than 210 million stars , in addition to planets and moons .
The software is the brainchild of Fabien Chereau , a Research Engineer at the Paris Astronomical Observatory , and is used in many planetariums .
Like the suite of Google applications , it allows people to explore places of interest on Earth , as well as mission sites on the Moon and Mars .
Commercial alternatives also exist , such as Imaginova 's Starry Night , that offers a range of software packages aimed at beginners to " the serious astronomer " .
Apple Mac users can download a Starry Night widget that will allow them to see the night sky from any location on Earth .
" The other astronomy packages are designed for maybe the more professional amateur market , " said Mr Parsons .
" We are aiming this more at the mass market .
If people get hooked and interested they may migrate to these other packages . "
Roll Call reported this week that Republican lobbyists are n't sure how to get anything done in a Democratic Congress .
Several Democratic and Republican lobbyists agreed GOP consultants often get it wrong with Democrats because their corporate pitch is such an easy sell in Republican offices , which already are ideologically sympathetic to businesses ’ concerns .
Meeting with Democrats , some Republicans neglect to factor in a much wider array of constituencies that hold sway with the new majority , including labor , environmental and consumer groups .
“ Republican lobbyists are used to walking into an office and just saying , ‘ I ’d like you to do this , ’ ” said one Republican operative who regularly lobbies across the aisle .
“ With Democrats , you really have to hone your arguments , and you really have to sell them on policy . ” ( emphasis added )
In Tom DeLay ’s Congress , corporate lobbyists had it easy .
Their clients had a wish list , and the GOP majority was anxious to deliver .
Now these lobbyists are finding that when they ask the Democratic majority to do something , those darned liberals want reasons .
They ask pesky questions , such as , “ Why ? ”
No matter how frustrated we may get with congressional Dems , it ’s worth remembering that when it comes to running Congress , there is a difference between a Democratic majority and a Republican one .
More thoughts on WPF
Hi , my name is Eric , and I am a coding addict .
When I founded SourceGear , I was a programmer .
Nine years later , my company has turned me into a marketing guy .
After all the sacrifices I made to get this company going , it has coldly turned its back on me , ignoring my once prodigious programming talents , callously replacing me with people who are younger and better looking , watching apathetically as my technical skills atrophy each year , forgetting all the great things I have done , and ---
Ahem .
Sorry , I got a little off track there . :-)
Where was I ?
Ah yes , my addiction .
You see , although my company has grown to the point where it can no longer find a place for me as a coder , I have found it rather difficult to stop .
I 've got some sort of an addiction , a disease which compels me to write code .
It is this mania which has driven me to write things like my solitaire game and my blogging app .
I pretty much always have some kind of a hobby project going on .
Lately my hours as a compulsive coder are spent working on some ideas for woodworking design software .
Since most of my readers are interested in neither woodworking nor solid modeling , I 'll spare you the gory details .
About five weeks ago I published a few of my early thoughts on WPF ( Windows Presentation Foundation , formerly called " Avalon " ) .
My interest in WPF continued to grow , so recently I decided to give it a try by writing a WPF front end for my woodworking software .
In the process of doing so , I am becoming a WPF fan .
The screen shot below is a picture of my WPF viewer in action :
Basically , my woodworking software is designed around the concept of a list of steps .
Each step corresponds to one woodworking action , such as cutting a board or attaching two boards together .
A primary job of the software is to draw a picture of how the project will look at each step .
In the screen shot above , the ListView on the left contains all of the steps to build a simple bookshelf .
The larger 3D picture on the right is showing the currently selected step .
I am certainly still not an expert on WPF , but here is what I like so far :
It is so easy to put cool things into a ListView .
In Win32 , list controls are very oriented toward text .
WPF has no such bias .
I wanted my ListView control to have a little preview picture of each step .
This was really simple to do with WPF .

WPF 3D is far simpler to use than Managed DirectX .
That 's kind of a remarkable thing to say when you consider that Managed DirectX is far simpler than using DirectX from unmanaged code .
I was able to get excellent results from the 3D features of WPF in very little time .

I was able to get excellent results from the 3D features of WPF in very little time .
Obviously , there are tradeoffs .
For example , I have n't found a way to do volumetric textures using the 3D features in WPF .
Still , those tradeoffs seem worth the trouble .
I have n't tried it yet , but apparently WPF is supposed to be able to print my 3D stuff .
That 's a pretty big win , since I expected printing support to be a heckuva lot of work .

That 's a pretty big win , since I expected printing support to be a heckuva lot of work .
I have found XAML to be very nice , after I got past the initial learning curve .
At first , XAML looked like a bunch of nonsense on my screen .
It did n't take too long to find myself just typing tags and attributes .
The Visual Studio support for WPF and XAML is more useful than I thought .
The visual UI designer is basically useless , but installing " Cider " also adds other WPF support to Visual Studio 2005 , including special project actions and Intellisense .
The WPF samples in the Windows SDK are quite helpful .
The WPF documentation ?
Not so much .
Since everything in WPF is built on DirectX , controls and 3D stuff do n't seem to mind sharing the screen with each other .
When I was using Managed DirectX with Windows Forms , I could n't find any easy way to have my 3D view show up in the same window as my controls .
With WPF , this is trivial .
As the screen shot shows , I have my Viewport3D in the same window as a couple of ListView controls .
Finally , here is the coolest example of how smooth this integration is :
The preview pictures in the ListView are actually not pictures -- they are little Viewport3D objects .
With the Trackball class from Daniel Lehenbauer , I can use the mouse to rotate and zoom the model .
I have hooked up all the little viewports in the ListView to the same Trackball as the main view .
So , when I rotate or zoom the model on the right , those little previews in the ListView are automatically updated as well .
This is what I call Deeply Neato .
It 's easier to appreciate when you watch it happen , so I captured a short movie ( 4.5 MB AVI , 12 seconds ) .
Anyway , I suppose I will soon bump into some sort of a wall , but so far , I think WPF is really nice .
1942 : Tweety Forced to Wear Clothes
Tweety Bird first appears in " A Tale of Two Kitties . "
Animator Bob Clampett originally draws him without feathers but the Hays Office censorship bureau thinks the plucked bird is just a little too naked .
So Clampett covers
Tweety 's titillating flesh with yellow plumage .
( Note : Clampett does n't let this pass quietly , though .
In the episode , a cat yells to his partner , " Give me the bird ! "
To which the other cat responds , " If the Hays Office would let me , I 'd give him the bird , all right ! " )
1952 : Lucy Gets Knocked Up
Despite Lucille Ball 's pregnancy during an entire season of I Love Lucy , the actual word " pregnant " is n't allowed on air .
Instead , the show uses phrases that seem equally informative but ( somehow ) less fraught with sin , such as " with child , " " having a baby , " and " expecting . "
1956 : Elvis' Pelvis Shoved Off Screen
Elvis ' first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show is seen by 60 million people ( about 80 percent of America 's TV owners at the time ) .
His hips , however , are n't so lucky .
After his cover of Little Richard 's " Ready Teddy " - complete with trademark gyrations - the camera switches to a close - up of his face as not to over - stimulate the American public .
By the time he appears on the show for the third time ( in January 1957 ) , he 's only shown from the waist up .
1959 : Advertisers Rewrite History
On the dramatic anthology series Playhouse 90 , an episode titled " Judgment at Nuremberg " has all references to gas chambers eliminated from its re-enactment of the Nazi trials .
This is done at the behest of the show 's slightly sensitive sponsor , the American Gas Association .
1964 -1966 : Censors Throw Down in Navel Wars
Mary Ann from Gilligan 's Island , Jeannie from I Dream of Jeannie , and Gidget are all barred from baring their navels .
Actress Mariette Hartley receives the same treatment in a 1966 episode of Star Trek , but the show 's director , Gene Roddenberry , gets his revenge in 1973 .
He recasts Ms. Hartley in the pilot for his new show , Genesis II , and gives her two belly buttons .
1967 : Actors Successfully Hide Pot on Set
It 's a tough year for network censors struggling to keep up with the hippie culture 's profusion of drug slang .
Ed Sullivan requests that the Doors change the lyric " Girl , we could n't get much higher , " since it sounds suspiciously like a drug reference .
Meanwhile , The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour has a recurring skit about Goldie , a housewife with her own talk show called Share a Little Tea with Goldie .
The skit constantly plays on the tea / marijuana connection , which goes straight over the censors ' heads .
Goldie 's opening lines include " Hi[gh ] ! ...
And glad of it ! " 1970 : Studios Learn to Cope with Cannibalism
Monty Python 's Flying Circus airs " The Undertaker Sketch , " in which an undertaker convinces a man that the best way to dispose of his deceased mother is to eat her ( with French fries , broccoli , and horseradish sauce ) .
Bizarrely , the BBC allows this to be shown , but only if the sketch ends with the studio audience storming the stage in disgust .
1979 : Miss Piggy 's Ultimate Rejection
The Muppet Show is banned from TV in Saudi Arabia , due to Miss Piggy 's , well , pig-ness .
( The Prophet Muhammad declared the flesh of swine " an abomination . " )
Merchandise bearing her likeness is confiscated from shops and destroyed .
2004 : Nipples by the Number
We know it 's a little obvious to mention Janet Jackson 's " wardrobe malfunction " during Super Bowl XXXVIII , but it 's worth recapping a few stats : » Amount of time the nipple spent on - air : 1.01 seconds ( we actually timed it )
» FCC fines levied on CBS : $ 550,000
» Cost to NFL ( in sponsor refunds ) : $ 10 million
» Ranking among 2004 Internet searchers : 1
» Ranking in TiVo's " most rewound moments " : 1
» Number of American complaints to the network : more than 500,000
» Number of Canadian complaints : about 50 2006 : South Park Draws Up Controversy
Comedy Central prevents South Park from using the image of the Prophet Muhammad in the episode " Cartoon Wars . "
However , for the benefit of freeze - frame geeks everywhere , Trey Parker and Matt Stone sneak a tiny Muhammad into the opening credits in a shot that shows every resident of the town .
Bonus : The Turbulent Life of the TV Toilet 1957 : Before it airs , CBS yanks the pilot episode of Leave It To Beaver because of its plot : Wally and the Beav mail - order a baby alligator and are forced to hide it in the tank of the family 's toilet .
CBS finally decides the show can air , but only if all shots of the toilet seat are excised .
The toilet tank is left unharmed , marking the first time a toilet ( or half of one , anyway ) appears on TV .
1960 : Host Jack Paar walks off the set of The Tonight Show in the middle of taping an episode .
He would not return for a month .
The reason ?
Censors cut a joke that used the phrase " water closet . "
1971 : A major breakthrough occurs as the toilet is finally allowed to perform its function .
The first flush is heard , but not seen , on the first - season episode of All in the Family .
TV 's first flusher is , of course , Archie Bunker .
1973 : Jack Paar 's censors are proven right about the toilet 's power over The Tonight Show audience .
In the era of gasoline shortages , Johnny Carson jokes about an imminent shortage of toilet paper .
Across the country , panicked viewers go on a hoarding spree , emptying store shelves and forcing Carson to publicly apologize the next night .
Do n’t quit your shuddering just yet .
Live burial is not unheard of ; it has always been a real ( albeit distant ) possibility .
Indeed , it ’s conceivable the first burials of humans were accidental , live ones :
Ill and wounded hunters were left in caves with the entrances sealed off to keep out wild animals while the rest of the hunting parties continued after their prey .
It was hoped that once the victims had regained their strength , they would push the barriers out of the way and rejoin the group .
Some died in those caves , however
Example : [ Percy Russell , 1906 ]
PREMATURE BURIAL
To die is natural ; but the living death
Of those who waken into consciousness ,
Though for a moment only , ay , or less ,
To find a coffin stifling their last breath ,
Surpasses every horror underneath
The sun of Heaven , and should surely check
Haste in the living to remove the wreck
Of what was just before , the soul ’s fair sheath ,
How many have been smothered in their shroud !
How many have sustained this awful woe !
Humanity would shudder could we know
How many have cried to God in anguish loud ,
Accusing those whose haste a wrong had wrought
Beyond the worst that ever devil thought .
The still - living have been consigned to an eternal dirt nap often enough that fears of premature burial are based on fact as much as on lore .
Numerous cases of interments and almost interments dot history .
In the first century , the magician Simon Magus , according to one report , buried himself alive , expecting a miracle — a miracle that did n’t happen .
On Iona , in the sixth century , one of St. Columba ’s monks , Oran , was dug up the day after his burial and found to be alive .
Legend has it when he told his fellows he had seen heaven and hell , he was promptly dispatched and re-interred on grounds of heresy .
And the 13th - century Thomas a Kempis , the reputed author of the great devotional work The Imitation of Christ , was never made a saint because , it was said , when they dug up his body for the ossuary they found scratch marks on the lid of his coffin and concluded that he was not reconciled to his fate .
In the late 16th century , the body of Matthew Wall was being borne to his grave in Braughing , England .
One of the pallbearers tripped , causing the others to drop the coffin , thus reviving the dear departed .
Wall lived on for several more years , dying in 1595 .
He celebrated his ‘ resurrection ’ every year .
In the early 17th century , Marjorie Elphinstone died and was buried in Ardtannies , Scotland .
When grave robbers attempted to steal the jewelry interred with her , the deceased surprised the heck out of them by groaning .
The robbers fled for their lives , and Elphinstone revived , walked home , and outlived her husband by six years .
Marjorie Halcrow Erskine of Chirnside , Scotland , died in 1674 and was buried in a shallow grave by a sexton intent upon returning later to steal her jewelry .
While the light - fingered sexton was trying to cut off her finger to retrieve a ring , she awoke .
In her additional years of life after her first burial , she went on to give birth to and raise two sons .
No one knows what happened to the sexton .
The 17th century saw a number of premature burials .
Collapse and apparent death were not uncommon during epidemics of plague , cholera , and smallpox .
From contemporary medical sources , William Tebb compiled 219 instances of narrow escape from premature burial , 149 cases of actual premature burial , 10 cases in which bodies were accidentally dissected before death , and 2 cases in which embalming was started on the not - yet - dead .
Some instances were especially heartbreaking .
In the 1850s , a young girl visiting Edisto Island , South Carolina , died of diphtheria .
She was quickly interred in a local family ’s mausoleum because it was feared the disease might otherwise spread .
When one of the family ’s sons died in the Civil War , the tomb was opened to admit him .
A tiny skeleton was found on the floor just behind the door .
[ British Medical Journal , 1877 ]
A correspondent at Naples states that the Appeals Court has had before it a case not likely to inspire confidence in the minds of those who look forward with horror to the possibility of being buried alive .
It appeared from the evidence that some time ago , a woman was interred with all the usual formalities , it being believed that she was dead , while she was only in a trance .
Some days afterwards , when the grave in which she had been placed was opened for the reception of another body , it was found that the clothes which covered the unfortunate woman were torn to pieces , and that she had even broken her limbs in attempting to extricate herself from the living tomb .
The Court , after hearing the case , sentenced the doctor who had signed the certificate of decease , and the Major who had authorized the interment each to three month ’s imprisonment for involuntary manslaughter .
A recent “ not quite all the way over the line yet ” news story comes from 1993 :
Sipho William Mdletshe might as well be dead , as far as his fiancee is concerned .
Declared deceased after a traffic accident in Johannesburg , South Africa , Mdletshe , 24 , spent two days in a metal box in a mortuary before his cries alerted workers , who rescued him .
But Mdletshe is heartbroken , because his fiancee , who also was hurt in the crash , does n’t believe his story and refuses to see him .
She thinks he ’s a zombie who returned from the dead to haunt her .
In 1994 , 86 - year - old Mildred C. Clarke spent ninety minutes in a body bag in the morgue at the Albany Medical Center Hospital before an attendant noticed the bag was breathing .
She ’d been found sprawled on her living room floor , cold and motionless , with no detectable heartbeat , breath , or other signs of life .
She was also as stiff as a board .
The coroner did n’t have to think twice about declaring her dead .
She apparently did not agree with his verdict , and , with care , lived a week longer .
Okay , so it happens .
But how common an occurrence is it ?
In 1896 , T.M. Montgomery , who supervised the disinterment and moving of the remains at the Fort Randall Cemetery , reported that “ nearly 2 % of those exhumed were no doubt victims of suspended animation . ”
These days , getting accidentally buried alive in the United States or Canada borders on the impossible .
Embalming procedures will finish off anyone not quite all the way through the Pearly Gates , and the families of deceased citizens of both those countries overwhelmingly opt to have their loved ones embalmed .
( Contrary to popular belief , embalming is not mandatory in the United States .
Corpses carry little disease risk — we pose a much greater threat to the public health while we ’re still breathing , bleeding , and shedding skin .
Proof of this lack of danger is found in the Centers for Disease Control ’s study into the risk factors inherent to workers in the funeral business — they found those who deal with cadavers have no greater mortality rate than the general population , nor does their occupation appear to hold special danger of infection .
Moreover , despite the claims of the funeral industry , normal embalming does not kill all disease - causing organisms in a cadaver .
One study found common pathogens ( including the tuberculosis bacillus ) still present in 22 of 23 cadavers within 24 to 48 hours of embalming .
Other infectious organisms are virtually unaffected by normal embalming , including those that cause anthrax , tetanus and gas gangrene . )
There have been deaths by embalming .
In 1837 , Cardinal Somaglia was taken ill , passed out , and was thought to have died .
Preparations were begun immediately to embalm this very important church official .
When the surgeon / embalmer cut into the chest to instill embalming materials , he could see the cardinal ’s heart still beating .
Worse , at this point , the cardinal awoke from his stupor and wisely pushed the knife away from his chest .
His effort was to no avail , though — the chest incision killed him .
Sometimes the presumed corpse ’s ‘ still living ’ status is only discovered when someone sets about to perform a post - mortem .
A 1996 newspaper article reports :
In 1984 , a post - mortem examination was being conducted in a mortuary in New York .
When the pathologist made the first cut the “ corpse ” leaped up and grabbed him by the throat .
The pathologist died of shock .
The case of Daphne Banks , who was pronounced dead on New Year ’s Eve [ 1995 ] but showed signs of life when she got to the mortuary , is by no means unique .
From the time of Plato to the present there are many well - documented accounts of the dead coming back to life .
The Reverend Schwartz , a missionary , was brought back to life by hearing his favourite hymn played at his funeral .
The mourners were surprised to hear his voice from the coffin joining in the singing .
Nicephorus Glycas , the Greek Orthodox Bishop of Lesbos , laid in state in his church for two days while mourners filed past his coffin .
Suddenly he sat up and demanded to know what everybody was looking at .
The discovery that a corpse still has some life left in him is n’t a new phenomenon :
[ Stowe ’s Annals , 1587 ]
The 20 of Februarie [ 1587 ] , a strange thing happened to a man hanged for felonie at Saint Thomas Waterines , being begged by the Chirugeons of London , to have made of him an anatomie , after he was dead to all men ’s thinking , cut downe , throwne into a carre , and so brought from the place of execution through the Borough of Southwarke over the bridge , and through the Citie of London to the Chirugeons Hall nere unto Cripelgate :
The chest being opened there , and the weather extreme cold hee was found to be alive , and lived till three and twentie of Februarie , and then died .
One of the most famous of such cases is that of Anne Greene who , after being hanged for a felony on 14 December 1650 , was sent to the anatomy hall to be used for dissection .
She awoke and lived on for many years afterwards .
Rapist - murderer William Duell was hanged at Tyburn in November 1740 and taken for dissection .
The assistant noted the deceased was breathing and had a faint pulse .
Although he was in great pain , two hours later the dead man was sitting in a chair drinking wine .
He was sent back to prison and later exiled for life .
Around the same time , Professor Junkur of Halle University received a sack with the body of a hanged criminal to be used for dissection .
The body was dumped in his house after dark when the professor had already gone to bed .
During the night , the professor was awakened by the figure of a naked and shivering man holding an empty sack .
The professor decided to help the man escape further punishment and some years later encountered him on the street , a wealthy merchant with a wife and two children .
Not every anatomist was so kind - hearted .
The Newgate Calendar quoted the surgeon who worked on an eighteenth century German criminal as saying :
I am pretty certain , gentlemen , from the warmth of the subject and the flexibility of the limbs , that by a proper degree of attention and care the vital heat would return , and life in consequence take place .
But when it is considered what a rascal we should again have among us , that he was hanged for so cruel a murder , and that , should we restore him to life , he would probably kill somebody else .
I say , gentlemen , all these things considered , it is my opinion that we had better proceed in the dissection .
Okay , so it was ( and still is ) possible to be buried alive or to meet your maker on a post - mortem table .
The prospect is chilling , and numerous people have gone to great lengths to make sure it does n’t happen to them .
The practice of ‘ waking ’ the dead ( having someone sit with the deceased from the time of death until burial in case he ‘ wakes up ’ ) began out of this concern .
Especially in bygone days when a number of illnesses could cause the sufferer to slip into a coma and thus make it appear all life functions had been snuffed out , the danger of overly hasty interment was real .
( Edgar Allan Poe ’s macabre short stories , most notably “ Premature Burial , ” certainly helped increase such fears among the general populace . )
Some went so far as to specify in their wills they wanted special tests performed on their bodies to make sure they were actually dead .
Surgical incisions , the application of boiling hot liquids , touching red - hot irons to their flesh , stabbing them through the heart , or even decapitating them were all specified at different times as a way of making sure they did n’t wake up six feet under .
Some opted for being buried with the means to do themselves in , and guns , knives , and poison were packed into coffins along with the deceased .
The screams of a young Belgian girl who came out of a trance - like state as the earth fell on her coffin so upset Count Karnice - Karnicki , Chamberlain to the Czar and Doctor of the Law Faculty of the University of Louvain , that he invented a coffin which allowed a person accidentally buried alive to summon help through a system of flags and bells .
Patented in 1897 , this hermetically - sealed coffin had a tube , about 3.5 inches in diameter , extending to a box on the surface .
The tube was attached to a spring - loaded ball sitting on the corpse ’s chest .
Any movement of the chest would release the spring , opening the box lid and admitting light and air into the coffin .
To signal for help , a flag would spring up , a bell would ring for half an hour , and a lamp would burn after sunset .
Similar “ life - signaling ” coffins were patented in the United States .
Those old - fashioned devices might sound quaint and out of place in modern society , but concern over live burial has prompted the redirection of newer technologies to take the place of red flags and whistles :
Evangelist Mary Baker
Eddy has long been rumored to have been interred along with a functioning telephone .
That bit of popular lore likely grew out of a misremembering of the circumstances of her burial .
After she died at her home in Boston , in December 1910 , her body was kept at the general receiving vault at Mount Auburn Cemetery in nearby Cambridge for several months while her monument was being constructed .
Because she was a world renowned figure and there was some fear of thievery , a guard was hired to stay with the body until it was interred and the tomb sealed , and a telephone was installed at the receiving vault for his use during that period .
There was never a phone at the monument , inside or outside .
The same rumor is associated with Aimee Semple McPherson , another famous evangelist .
She was buried in 1944 in Los Angeles ’ Forest Lawn Memorial Park .
McPherson used a telephone on the stage of her Angeles Temple to keep in contact with her radio crew during sermons , and this may have contributed to the rumor .
More likely , people confused her with Mary Baker Eddy .
In 1995 a $ 5,000 Italian casket equipped with call - for - help ability and survival kit went on sale .
Akin to beeping devices which alert relatives to an elderly family member ’s being in trouble , this casket is equipped with a beeper which will sound a similar emergency signal .
The coffins are also fitted with a two - way microphone / speaker to enable communication between the occupant and someone outside , and a kit which includes a torch , a small oxygen tank , a sensor to detect a person ’s heartbeat , and even a heart stimulator .
Those worried about premature burial would do well to consider Point # 10 of “ Short Reasons for Cremation , ” a 12 - point pamphlet circulated in Australia at the turn of the century : Cremation eliminates all danger of being buried alive .
History does record some instances of deliberate live burial .
It was a method of execution employed in Roman times for vestal virgins who broke their vows of chastity , and some medieval monks and nuns were also thus punished for the same crime .
Plutarch described the process for vestal virgins :
. . . a narrow room is constructed , to which a descent is made by stairs ; here they prepare a bed , and light a lamp , and leave a small quantity of victuals , such as bread and water , a pail of milk , and some oil ; so that body which had been consecrated and devoted to the most sacred service of religion might not be said to perish by such a death as famine .
The culprit herself is put in a litter , which they cover over , and tie her down with cords on it , so that nothing she utters may be heard .
They then take her to the Forum …
When they come to the place of execution , the officers loose the cords , and then the high priest , lifting his hands to heaven , pronounces certains prayers to himself before the act ; then he brings out the prisoner , being still covered , and placing her upon the steps that lead down to the cell , turns away his face … the stairs are drawn up after she has gone down , and a quantity of earth is heaped up over the entrance to the cell …
This is the punishment of those who break their vows of virginity .
Medieval monks and nuns who broke their vows of chastity were often walled into small niches , just barely large enough for their bodies .
They also were given a pittance of food and water , and the grim benediction Vade in Pacem ( Depart in Peace ) .
Some have been buried alive to serve the dead in the next life .
In Africa , for example , two live slaves ( a man and a woman ) were interred with each dead Wadoe headman .
The man was given a bill - hook to use to cut wood for fuel in the next life , and the woman cradled the dead chief ’s head in her lap .
In 1849 , an observer at the funeral of King Thien Tri of Cochin , China , reported that along with rich and plentiful grave goods , all of the king ’s childless wives were entombed with his body , thus guaranteeing he’d be henpecked throughout eternity but would at least get his meals on time .
Susan Rubin sounds passionate and angry as she describes the junk - food free - for - alls she has seen at schools across the nation .
Students are often surrounded by foods that " are loaded with so many artificial ingredients and additives that you need a Ph.D. in biochemistry to figure out what 's in them , " says Rubin , a mother from Chappaqua , N.Y. , with three school - age daughters .
" Real food does n't come from a science lab .
It grows in the ground , flies in the air , swims in the sea and walks on the ground , " says Rubin , 47 , one of the stars of Two Angry Moms , a new documentary film about a parental war against the sale of highly processed , sugary foods in U.S. schools .
NUTRITION MISSION : More women sound off on keeping kids healthy
The other angry mom is the film 's producer , Amy Kalafa , 48 , of Weston , Conn. , a veteran independent filmmaker who has two daughters .
She was inspired by a state agricultural official who once said that it would take 2 million angry moms to change school food in the USA .
The women are fighting to remove foods such as chicken nuggets , french fries , cookies , candy , chips , doughnuts , snack cakes and sugary drinks from school vending machines and cafeterias .
The goal ?
To replace those foods with healthier offerings , such as fresh fruit and vegetables .
The film , which cost roughly $ 500,000 to make , was financed by Kalafa and her husband , Alexander Gunuey , along with some small grants and donations of $ 5 to $ 1,000 from hundreds of concerned parents .
People can buy 10 DVDs and a special information kit for $ 275 , then host screenings in September at homes , school auditoriums and community theaters .
In the fall , single DVDs will be available for $ 25 . ( See www.angrymoms.org.)
" The documentary is mostly inspirational , a how - to for anybody who watches it , " Kalafa says .
" She 's the filmmaker ; I 'm the troublemaker , " says Rubin , a dentist - turned - nutritionist who is the founder of the advocacy group Better School Food .
Rubin started on her campaign about 12 years ago when her oldest daughter , then in first grade , came home with candy wrappers in her backpack .
" I was a dentist at the time , and I wondered what was going on .
I was worried about cavities .
It was before obesity hit the radar screen . "
Kalafa was looking for a parent to feature in her film .
" I met so many parents who got stuck , but Susan had stepped out of her local school district and created a national group .
We met , we hit it off , and I said , ' OK , I 'm going to follow you for a year .
Let 's see what happens . ' "
The documentary is already drawing fire from food service directors who say many schools are succeeding in serving nutritious , tasty meals .
" What we are offering is much better than what is represented in the film , " says Sharlene Wong , director of food service for the Wallingford ( Conn . ) Public Schools .
She saw a preview of the documentary and has traveled around the country examining lunch programs .
In defense of schools
Wong says many districts have already made improvements .
" Our cooking methods have changed .
We do n't fry chicken nuggets , we bake them .
And if they are breaded , we use whole - wheat flour .
We have eliminated french fries and added baked sweet - potato wedges .
" We only offer whole - grain breads . …
Our pizzas are made with whole - grain crust and low - fat , low - sodium cheese . "
Kalafa and Rubin want districts to use more fresh , locally grown produce and offer gardens and cooking classes so kids can get involved .
Schools have been promoting local farm products for years , Wong says .
" There are thousands of districts that participate in farm - to - school programs .
We take any opportunity to use the farm - fresh products like corn , pears , plums , apples , broccoli and squash . "
Mary Hill , president of the School Nutrition Association , a professional group with 54,000 members , including food service directors , cooks and cafeteria managers , says the majority of districts are trying to offer more nutritious foods .
" We all want our children to eat healthier , and we 're going to do whatever it takes within our resources to make that possible . "
A federal law requires that school districts have their own wellness policies , including guidelines for foods sold in schools .
Some states regulate foods sold in vending machines , school stores and a la carte lines .
There 's also a bill before Congress that would require an updating of standards for these foods .
The heart of everyone 's concern is childhood obesity .
A third of children — about 25 million kids — are overweight or obese , which puts them at risk for developing type 2 diabetes , high blood pressure and other health problems .
Kalafa says she applauds improvements but adds that from what she has seen , " schools are still offering highly processed foods .
I have not seen a lot of schools baking chicken from scratch . "
She suggests that parents have lunch at school and investigate what 's being offered throughout the building .
If it 's not healthful , the adults should form a committee and take action , she says .
" I have letters from thousands of parents from every state talking about the nutrition horrors they 've seen in their kids ' schools , from preschool on up , " Kalafa says .
" I 'm not just talking about the school lunch program , but the entire culture of food in schools , which is reflective of the entire culture of food in America : the availability of lots of processed food that fills you up but does n't contribute to optimum learning and behavior .
" We 're trying to show people the many wonderful things that can be done when parents get involved . "
In the movie , she profiles a few model programs , including the one at the Katonah - Lewisboro School District in Katonah , N.Y .
Last year , the district started offering more nutritious foods in the vending machines and hired a chef trained at the Culinary Institute of America to help instruct the cafeteria staff on preparing healthier fare .
At first , the students grumbled about not having french fries and chocolate - chip cookies , says Fran Cortina , food service director for the district .
She 's an employee of ARAMARK , the food service provider .
" Honestly , they do n't even miss it anymore . "
Even some parents asked , " Did n't you go a little crazy by taking out the white bread ? " says Mary Ann Petrilena , one of the moms who helped spearhead the change .
But " these changes will profoundly impact children 's long - term health , " she says .
The district offers a farmers ' market on Saturday at the high school and has gardens at two schools .
Rubin wishes all schools had a garden .
" It 's a way to inspire students to care about the food , " she says .
" It 's so different when you are growing the food .
If peas are put in front of you , and you are told they are good for you , that does n't mean anything .
If you grow that pea and watch it flower , it 'll mean a lot more to you .
That 's such a powerful teaching tool . "
Proud to be angry
Some people say all these changes are too expensive , " but I think every penny is worth it , " Rubin says .
" To me , food is health care .
You can pay the farmer or the doctor . "
Rubin knows the term " angry mom " turns off some people , but it should n't , she says .
" I 'm proud to be an angry mom .
Angry mom means a mom who cares enough to stand up for her child 's health .
" You get angry when your boundary has been violated , and the food industry has violated our boundaries with what they are offering our kids .
I 'm just trying to protect my cubs . "
She hopes the film makes " the term ' angry mom ' as common as soccer mom . "

Angry moms Susan Rubin , left , and Amy Kalafa say schools would be healthier places for kids if they ditched the junk food and perhaps grew a garden , such as this one at Meadow Pond Elementary in South Salem , N.Y .
Schoolchildren here use garden vegetables for special events and cooking lessons .
Musings on my family , work and things I find interesting .
Mainly , this was / is intended to record things for my kids so that they can get an insight into how I feel about them , plus I have n't done any writing for a long time , so would like to get some skill in that sphere again .
I found a quote particularly telling in the New York Times ’ article on Bill Gates transitioning out of Microsoft .
Ray Ozzie , chief software architect of Microsoft , was discussing the dangers of Mr. Gates making strategic decisions after not staying informed .
He says :
“ It ca n’t be a situation where he ’s expected to suddenly , magically come up to speed , ” said Mr. Ozzie , [ … ]
“ You know , did you see the 20 announcements last week that Google did , Yahoo did , Cisco did ? “ [ emphasis mine ]
Why would Microsoft , a software , web , and now ( sigh ) advertising company consider Cisco , a maker of network hardware appliances , a competitor in the same vane as Google and Yahoo ?
Because Mr. Ozzie has read between the lines as several others have , and seen that Cisco ’s pattern of acquisitions indicate that it ’s planning on expanding into the online communications market , competing with Microsoft , Google , and others .
More importantly , it will be entering this market from a completely different angle than other companies .
Microsoft has ruled the desktop for years , and continues to attempt to tie the web to the desktop , where its strength remains .
Yahoo ! , a portal from the beginning , continues to act like a portal in its acquisitions and technology development .
This has caused problems at times due to a tendency to insist on having a finger in every pie , even when you ’ve run out of free fingers .
As Brad Garlinghouse , a Yahoo !
VP , outlined in a memo last year , Yahoo ! ’s effectiveness as a portal suffered when it offered visitors two different options for the same thing .
Some of that ’s been resolved ( we know who won Flickr vs. Yahoo !
Photos ) .
The other problem Yahoo ! has encountered by applying its portal background to the emerging web is a lack of focus .
Garlinghouse said , “ I ’ve heard our strategy described as spreading peanut butter across the myriad opportunities that continue to evolve in the online world .
The result : a thin layer of investment spread across everything we do and thus we focus on nothing in particular . ”
This certainly remains true as Yahoo !
even now attempts to compete on all fronts .
At the beginning of this month , Josh Catone discussed Yahoo ! ’s plans to compete with YouTube .
If Yahoo !
truly focuses on that effort , I ’m certain they can increase their market share of online video compared to YouTube , even if they do n’t overtake it .
But the problem remains : focus .
While Yahoo !
can devote focus in key areas for a time , I do n’t believe it can focus on all of them .
When is the last time you ’ve heard Yahoo !
360 discussed as a serious competitor in the social networking market ?
I ’ve heard Friendster mentioned more in the last month .
Google , on the other hand , is not a portal company , despite what many have said about its ever - increasing collection of offerings .
Google is a web service company .
It does n’t matter that Google has both Google Videos and YouTube , because Google is not in the business of pointing users toward anything but what they ’re already looking for .
There ’s no conflict in offering both YouTube and Google Video content in searches , because searchers do n’t care where the content comes from , they just want to find it .
And producers end up choosing between many different video services anyways ; having two services on the market only increase Google ’s chances a producer will host his or her video on a Google - owned property .
AOL has as interesting a history as any major company online , and only now looks like it might be emerging from “ has been ” status to become a competitor again .
Which is n’t to say it ’s traffic and revenues suddenly stopped existing until now , but rather that forward - thinking companies like the ones above do n’t consider a company that is n’t innovating and planning for 2 , 5 , 10 years down the road a threat .
An AOL that is satisfied with its load of subscribers , that maintains the status quo , that copies technology once the market demand is proven , and sits and grazes like a good cash cow is not a worry .
But an AOL that ’s expanding , not just catching up but trying new things itself , an AOL that is leveraging its loyal member base ( that is still comparable with Yahoo ! ’s ) and bringing them into the world of Web 2.0 , that would be something to worry about .
On the other hand , it may be too late if AOL has spent too much time in the care of Time - Warner , a media company , and plans on merely shifting its cash - cow focus from internet services to internet entertainment ( possibly even re-branding itself as TMZ ? ) .
Cisco , as I mentioned above , would enter the World Wide Web from a background none of those companies have .
Cisco could be the company with the best logistical understanding of how information moves from online space , to online space , to offline space , and the company with the most interest in making offline - to - online - to - offline transitions happen more often .
In some ways , Cisco is more interested in new media companies succeeding than new media companies are themselves .
The more audio , video , and miscellaneous data flow across the web , the more need there is for the hardware ( which Cisco sells ) to handle it .
Video conferencing ?
Bring it on !
Podcasting ?
Better than radio !
Blogging ?
A great place to place it all !
I meant what I said about John Chambers being a genius .
By getting in the business of the emerging web , he not only has the chance to share in the profits from that , but continually increase revenues from Cisco ’s core businesses as well .
And Cisco would be one of the few companies to not suffer major setbacks due to a possible bust of the advertising market .

Folks ; I actually took this career path because it disturbed me to see so many victims and I was sure I was the one who would make a difference .
During my career , I have employed compassion , empathy , negotiating skills , and decency in an effort to be someone who people would actually be left with the feeling that you mater after we leave .
I could write a book , no , ten books about the things I 've seen in your living rooms , bedrooms , streets and alleys .
But I wo n't because I am not talented enough and most of it would be in poor taste .
I see that this forum has a variety of genre .
I see the intelligent people trying to provoke thought and engage other people ’s minds .
I see the sick , disturbed people who have found an audience for which they can share their disturbing thoughts .
I see those in between who are just passing through musing at the fodder of all the rest .
And of course we now know that Kim Jong lives in the Salt Lake Valley .
So , perhaps this is to fall upon deaf ears .
But what the hell , I can't send it to the paper because they sell entertainment and this is n't very entertaining .
But at the risk of boring , pissing off , maligning , inadvertently offended , or maybe even causing someone to think a little , here goes .
1 . Complaints from citizensPeople , for the love of everything holly , why do you call us for some of this absolute shit ?
People are always saying " do n't you guys have anything better to do ? " when we show up at their home for some moronic reason .
Well guess hat ?
They are right !
We have so much more to do .
Why do you use us as swords to wield at your neighbor ?
Why do you use us as leverage mechanisms in you ’re screwed up personal relationships ?
You say we are all fat , lazy , or no good .
So why is it every time you want to threaten , scare or piss off an ex , a neighbor , a family member etc .
the first statement that rolls off of your lips is " I 'm gonna call the cops on you if , , , , , , Let me use yesterday as an example .
Noon , its 59 degrees and I get a call from a guy whose neighbor ’s dog has been left in a car .
I get there , the windows are cracked , and the dog has only been in there 20 minutes .
It ’s 59 Degrees !
It ’s not summer and if it were the dead of winter I 'd say the car is a $ 20,000 dog house .
But it turns out this guy has a running dispute with his neighbor so guess who he calls to irritate the guy a little more ?
Me .
When I go to leave , the asshole that called this in yells , " hey , are n't you gonna do anything ? "
I explain why I am not and he says " great , I 'm writing a letter to the paper " Holly shit .
Now I 'm the bad guy because I did n't embarrass your target enough for you ?
Grow the hell up .
1:30 PM .
Mom calls in a child abuse report on the ex .
Turns out the only abuse was that he is a half hour late returning from his turn with the girl .
The poor guy has two of us at his door and all his neighbors watching .
But we have to respond and gladly respond to every call because of the fact that every now and then , it ’s real .
So we can't pick and choose and no , I do n't have a crystal ball installed next to my MDC so I can see into the future .
Another 90 minutes wasted on a revenge complaint .
And yes , the ex got what she wanted .
All the neighbors are now murmuring that this guy might be a psycho because after all , there were police officers in his home .
Now his neighbors have a hard on for him and they are going to start calling us everything a bike gets stolen or a potted plant comes up missing .
3:15 PM .
Car just stolen from the parking lot of a grocery store .
The RP left the car running for just a minute while she went inside .
Dispatch gives us a description of the car .
The first thing we do is spread out into a grid of sorts hitting the main routes people would use to leave the area and we actually look for the victim ’s car .
Believe it or not , a great many times we actually locate the car and return it to the victim .
But after 30 minutes , if we have n't found it , it 's either in someone 's garage in the hood , or it 's out of the area .
So the next thing I do is respond to where the woman is to take a report .
Guess what ?
I get out of my car and this irate woman comes rolling over and yells at me right there in front of the super market " Where the hell have you guys been ! ! "
She goes on a tirade about how she 'll never get her car back now because we did n't respond fast enough and we could give a shit about here because she 's just another dumb ass taxpayer .
So I try in my most composed voice to explain " maam , when your car is stolen , the one place you wo n't find us is the place we are sure the car is NOT " Now I 'm being a smart ass and she wants my supervisors name .
People , most of you are decent , hard working , family loving , flag waving contributors to your society .
And it ’s because of this that I approach everyone with dignity and respect .
But to that loud minority that tries to use us to get even with the neighbor down the street , or the ex , or the boss .
You are the ones that are doing everyone a huge disservice .
You are the ones that take us away from the people we should be watching .
You are the pathetic , bored , angry , insecure misfits of society .
So the next time one of you is sitting at your barstool lamenting about how " the cops are never there when you need them " there 's a reason .
To the rest of you , I 'm truly sorry if it takes us a little longer than it should to get there .
I know who the gang bangers are .
I know most of the tweekers .
I know where to go and look for your property when you 've been ripped off .
I know where to go and look for the guy that that just jacked your wife ’s purse because as soon as I heard the physical description I recognized him and a repeat offender trying to get together some cash for his habit .
But I cannot tend to these real emergencies if you are going to call us because you think someone stole your paper or the neighbor is watering his lawn on an even rather than an odd day or because the kids down the street are on the damn skateboards again .
Hell , we were kids once .
Leave the kids to be kids .
Oh , and to the guy who called us during the busiest time of night to complain that your neighbor across the street was parked too close to the corner , real funny .
He 's a cop and you do n't like cops so you try and use other cops to harass him ?
Get a life .
Live like decent people and yes , absolutely call us when you see something real happening .
I 'll do everything in within my ability to help you .
Disclaimer .
I know there are asshole cops just like there are assholes in any and every profession .
I know some of the guys where like me , idealists who wanted to make a difference but now suffer from a thing we call “ compassion fatigue ”
Most of us really do give a damn about you and when you are in trouble , we haul ass to get there before it ’s too late .
Even then someone will always call in to complain that I was driving to fast and ‘ must have been late for dinner ”
But I ’ll tell you what , when we get a 911 call at 2:00 AM and all the call taker can hear on the other end is a woman screaming , it still gives us chills and yes , we ’re gonna drive like hell to get there as quick as possible because whoever is doing whatever to her needs to be stopped and we ’re the only ones that are going in .
So cut us a break .
It could be your wife , or mom , or girlfriend or daughter
( CNN ) -- Two U.S. soldiers whose signatures appeared on an op - ed piece in The New York Times critical of the war in Iraq were among seven Americans killed in a truck accident outside of Baghdad , family members said Wednesday .
Iraqi National Security Adviser Muwaffaq al - Rubaie said Wednesday he will support 2008 decrease in U.S. troops .
Staff Sgt. Yance Gray and Sgt. Omar Mora were members of the Army 's 82nd Airborne Division , based at Fort Bragg , North Carolina .
Gray , Mora and five other soldiers died Monday when their truck overturned near the Iraqi capital , U.S. officials said .
Gray and Mora were among seven soldiers , mostly sergeants , who wrote the op - ed piece that appeared in the Times on August 19 .
It called the prospects of U.S. success " far - fetched " and said the progress being reported was being " offset by failures elsewhere . "
" Four years into our occupation , we have failed on every promise , while we have substituted Baath Party tyranny with a tyranny of Islamist , militia and criminal violence , " they wrote .
" When the primary preoccupation of average Iraqis is when and how they are likely to be killed , we can hardly feel smug as we hand out care packages . "
Gray , 26 , joined the Army out of high school in Ismay , Montana , in 2000 , said his father , Richard Gray .
Yance Gray is survived by a wife and daughter .
A relative at Mora 's family home in Texas City , Texas , confirmed his death but had no other comment .
In their article , Mora , Gray and their comrades wrote that American troops in Iraq are operating " in a bewildering context of determined enemies and questionable allies , one where the balance of forces on the ground remains entirely unclear . "
However , they concluded , " As committed soldiers , we will see this mission through . "
Another of the signers of the Times article , Staff Sgt. Jeremy Murphy , was shot in the head a week before the article appeared but survived .
Meanwhile , a top Iraqi official said he foresees a decrease in foreign troop levels to less than 90,000 by the end of 2009 as Iraq bolsters and readies its security forces to take over responsibilities now being shouldered by the U.S. - led coalition forces .
The U.S. troop increase this year , dubbed " the surge " by the Bush administration , added nearly 30,000 troops to Iraq .
The number of U.S. troops at present is more than 160,000 and the number of other coalition forces is more than 11,000 .
National Security Adviser Mowaffaq al - Rubaie , speaking at a Wednesday press conference , told reporters that by next year the number of foreign troops might drop to about 130,000 , the pre-surge level , or to 100,000 troops .
" When we reach 2009 , we could talk about numbers that are less than 90,000 " among the Multi-National Force , said al - Rubaie , who emphasized that such withdrawals would depend on the security environment and troop readiness .
Al - Rubaie made the remarks a day after senior U.S. administration officials said that President Bush is prepared to embrace the recommendation of his top commander in Iraq , Gen. David Petraeus , and withdraw as many as 30,000 U.S. troops by next summer .

I 've been pretty unfortunate in having been proven correct in my prediction , made just over 14 months ago , that the Congressional subpoena power we were being promised was coming with a Democratic majority would be frontally attacked by the Bush " administration 's " refusal to prosecute contempt charges .
Was it really that good of a prediction , though ?
Not really .
After all , all I did was ask questions about the assumptions we were making regarding the subpoena power .
Specifically , what were the mechanics of it ?
So I did a little Googling , and found this at what was , at the time , the Wikipedia page for contempt of Congress :
In order to be convicted of contempt of Congress , the congressional committee subject to the contempt first reports a resolution that the affected individual is guilty of contempt .
This takes a majority vote of the committee .
The full United States House of Representatives or United States Senate then must approve the resolution , which sends the matter to a federal attorney , who may call a grand jury to decide whether to indict the affected individual , and prosecute if the grand jury affirms an indictment .
Right away , I knew so long as the power to actually punish contempt rested in the hands of the executive , that this " administration " would not permit such charges to go forward .
I suppose the only " prediction " involved was that at the time , nobody was talking about the rampant politicization of the US Attorneys ' offices , and very few of us were talking about the hints they were dropping about defying judicial orders .
But the point is that all it really took to figure this out was asking myself what had to happen procedurally in order for this " subpoena power " thing to work .
As soon as I did , the problems began to present themselves .
From then on , it was just a waiting game -- waiting for the " administration " to demonstrate for more eyes what I originally suspected they would do .
So I thought it might pay to turn to another issue with the same sort of questions : the proposals to end the occupation of Iraq by " defunding " it .
( To be clear , I do consider them separate issues , though the interests behind them can overlap .
I have never been an Iraq impeacher , though I fully understand the motivations of those who are .
My interest in seeing Bush impeached arose originally from the NSA spying revelations .
So in no sense have I ever considered impeachment and defunding to be competing methods to the same ends . )
The idea most commonly suggested involves the Congress refusing at some future point to consider any new Iraq funding bills , the advantage being that there 's no bill to veto , and it requires no affirmative votes -- just the commitment of the requisite number of House or Senate members not to support any effort to bring such a bill to the floor against the will of the leadership ( assuming they were on board with the defunding idea ) .
There seems to be no doubt that this would work , as far as it goes .
But how far does it go ?
That 's where we need to be asking questions about the mechanics of funding Defense Department operations .
And here 's what I found when I did ask : a report by the Congressional Research Service entitled , " A Defense Budget Primer " ( PDF )
What does it tell us ?
Well first , it reminds me that there 's more to the budgetary process than Congressional authorization and appropriations .
What we really need to find out about is what happens after the Congress says , in this case , that the " administration " is not authorized to spend money on this .
Page 41 seems informative .
Under the section describing continuing appropriations resolutions ( what Congress passes to keep the federal government operating in the event that the regular appropriations bills are delayed or otherwise left unpassed or unsigned ) , the report outlines the basics of what happens in the event that no continuing resolution is passed either , and the government is forced into a shutdown :
If Congress fails to pass regular appropriations acts by the beginning of the fiscal year on October 1 , DOD ( and other affected agencies ) can be left with no money to pay personnel , fund daily operations , or execute new contracts .
Standing law allows essential government activities , including national security - related functions , to continue even in the absence of funding , but non-essential programs may not continue , and day - to - day agency operations are disrupted .
Can anybody envision this " administration " declining to classify Iraq operations as national security - related ?
Does that mean standing law would allow the occupation to continue even in the absence of funding ?
I do n't know the answer to that .
But dollars to donuts the " administration " has an answer they want you to believe is definitive , should it become necessary to spring it on us .
Page 39 has more of interest :
While the [ appropriations ] acts themselves do not specify funding by line item , committee reports on the defense appropriations acts do specify levels of funding at the line item level .
Moreover , the military departments provide detailed budget information on programs in " justification " materials presented to Congress , and if appropriations reports do not specifically change the request , Congress assumes that DOD will carry out the programs as requested .
In a strict legal sense nothing requires DOD to adhere either to the recommendations in congressional reports or to its own program budget proposals in spending money appropriated by Congress at the line item level .
A failure to spend funds in accordance with the detailed justification materials and committee reports , however , could cause Congress to lose confidence in the requests and might result in reduced appropriations or in line item appropriations acts .
As a result , DOD procedures require officials to act in accordance with congressional intent , as expressed in the committee reports .
[ Emphasis added . ]
That 's something , I guess .
But I could see the Pentagon not having any tremendous fear that Democrats are going to cut Defense appropriations in the face of the Worldwide Terra ThreatTM .
What do you think ?
The third question I have is not directly addressed by the CRS report , and will require more research .
But basically it comes down to this :
While Congress has the " power of the purse , " who actually holds the purse Congress has this power over ?
It seems to me that in a political atmosphere that supports both the " unitary executive " theory and assertions by the executive of their right to be free of all interference from all other branches of government in exercising the " inherent powers " of the " Commander in Chief , " that the conditions are ripe for the assertion that since the Department of the Treasury is a part of that " unitary executive , " then the president may well believe he has the " inherent power " to order disbursements in direct defiance of Congressional instructions to the contrary .
Again , I do n't know " the answer , " but does anyone have confidence anymore that George W. Bush knows how far is too far ?
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
White House press secretary Tony Snow , who is undergoing treatment for cancer , will step down from his post September 14 and be replaced by deputy press secretary Dana Perino , the White House announced Friday .
White House press secretary Tony Snow will step down from his post on September 14 .
President Bush told reporters Friday that he will " sadly accept " Snow 's resignation .
Flanked by Snow and Perino in the White House press room , the president spoke warmly of his departing press secretary .
" It 's been a joy to watch him spar with you , " Bush told reporters .
Watch the announcement about Snow leaving »
Bush said he was certain of two things in regard to Snow .
" He 'll battle cancer and win , " Bush said , " and he 'll be a solid contributor to society . "
Turning to Snow , the president then said : " I love you , and I wish you all the best . "
Snow , speaking after Bush at the start of the daily White House news conference , said he was leaving to earn more money .
He took a big pay cut , he said , when he left his previous jobs as anchor and political analyst for Fox News .
According to The Washington Post , Snow makes $ 168,000 as the White House spokesman .
His family took out a loan when he started the job , " and that loan is now gone . "
" This job has really been a dream for me , a blast .
I 've had an enormous amount of fun and satisfaction , " Snow said .
He said he would continue to speak out on issues , and would do " some radio , some TV , but I do n't anticipate full - time anchor duties . "
Snow said he 's received great satisfaction from talking to people about his illness .
Snow 's cancer was diagnosed for the first time in February 2005 .
His colon was removed , and after six months of treatment , doctors said the cancer was in remission .
Perino announced March 27 that Snow 's cancer had recurred , and that doctors had removed a growth from his abdomen the day before .
Sources told CNN two weeks ago that Snow was planning to leave his job , possibly as early as September .
Bush tapped Snow to replace Scott McClellan in April 2006 .
Snow had been an anchor for " Fox News Sunday " and a political analyst for the Fox News Channel , which he joined in 1996 .
He also hosted " The Tony Snow Show " on Fox News Radio .
On Thursday , Snow told CNN his health is improving , citing two medical tests this month that found the cancer has not spread .
" The tumors are stable -- they are not growing , " Snow said of the results from an MRI and a CAT scan .
" And there are no new growths .
The health is good . "
The press secretary , whose hair has turned gray during chemotherapy treatment , said his black hair is expected to grow back in about a month .
" I'm also putting on weight again , " he said after returning from a 10 - day vacation .
" I actually feel very good about " the health situation .
Snow said on Friday he was to see his oncologist , and they will decide on some minor forms of chemotherapy to start as maintenance treatment .

[ A ] s it happens , the previous granting of clemency that is most analogous to what Bush did dates back neither to the Clinton or even the Nixon era , but to Bush 's father 's presidency .
In 1992 , on the eve of his last Christmas in the White House , George H.W. Bush pardoned former defense secretary Caspar Weinberger and five others for their conduct related to the Iran - Contra affair , in which he himself was also loosely implicated .
As David Johnston reported in the New York Times at the time , independent prosecutor Lawrence E. Walsh was livid .
" Mr. Walsh bitterly condemned the President 's action , charging that ' the Iran - contra cover - up , which has continued for more than six years , has now been completed . '"
An industry punchline
At this point , Phantom Entertainment — formally known as Infinium Labs and more formerly known as Global Business Resources — has become a joke among gamers .
You do n't even need a punch line anymore ; just set up a premise with Phantom in the title , and the jokes write themselves .
Phantom was going to remake the gaming world with a new console , the Phantom Game Receiver .
An unknown startup that made such an announcement back in 2002 was going to be greeted with skepticism , and Phantom found plenty .
It did n't help that the company failed to produce said console ; five years later , that dream is dead , but the company still lives on , hawking a hinged " lapboard " complete with keyboard , mouse , and hard surface .
Actually , the lapboard does n't exist , either .
Initially slated to be absolutely , for sure available by the end of 2006 , the lapboard is still nowhere in sight .
In the meantime , Phantom chalked up huge losses , and new cash ( for obvious reasons ) is hard to come by .
The company 's recently - filed SEC report for 2006 shows us exactly how Phantom continues to cling to life .
Bills , bills , bills
Phantom Entertainment does not meet the standard definition of a " stable company . "
In only a few years , Phantom 's corporate headquarters have bounced from Florida to Washington State to New York , and the company has now announced plans to relocate back to Florida .
Their current digs are listed at an unprepossessing address in Port Chester , NY .
Their current phone number leads to a voicemail system that does n't even bother to identify the company .
( Phantom did not return a call for comment on this article . )
While its executives have been circling the country in the quest for the perfect headquarters , they 've left a trail of debt in their wake .
Merrill Lynch , for instance , was the company that owned Phantom 's Seattle headquarters , and they were n't pleased to find Phantom come up $ 127,312 short on the lease .
So they took Phantom to court , hoping to recover the money .
The lease , which was supposed to run until August 2006 , was reworked and came to an abrupt end in February 2006 .
Merrill Lynch worked out a payment plan with Phantom that would see the company pay $ 5,000 a month and then cough up the remaining balance in a balloon payment due in July 2006 .
But Phantom ( still known as Infinium Labs back then ) did n't make the July payment , apparently because they were out of cash .
The company hoped to raise the money by selling another 50 million shares of stock , but decided to withdraw the SB - 2 application in May .
When July 31 rolled around , Infinium could n't pay .
Merrill Lynch then turned the collection rights for the account over to a third party , who signed another settlement agreement with Infinium on September 20 .
Under this deal , the debt was " settled for $ 100,000 pursuant to 3 ( a ) ( 10 ) of the Securities Act of 1933 , " according to the most recent Phantom filing with the SEC .
Infinium / Phantom apparently used its own stock to pay the debt .
It 's a pattern that recurs in many of the company 's dealings , especially in the legal cases — and there are plenty of legal cases .
When we looked into SEC documents like the company 's annual report , we found a company that changes names and locations with amazing frequency ; a company whose chairman has been indicted by the SEC for participating in a pump - and - dump " fax blast " scheme ; a company that routinely issues more stock when it runs into trouble .
Amazingly , Phantom lives on , a testament to just how long a company can survive without cash when it simply stops paying creditors .
The company is down to three full - time employees but still hopes to launch its Phantom Wireless Lapboard in September — if it survives that long .
When Phantom 's outside auditors prepared its most recent financial statement for the year ended on December 31 , 2006 , they " expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern . "
In Phantom 's favor , though , is the fact that auditors expressed the same concern in the company 's 2004 year - end report .
Yet Phantom clings to life .
Whether or not people like the company , surely this sort of achievement is worth some kind of endurance award .

We know it ’s coming .
There was that apocalyptic but apparently far - fetched JFK plot , what almost happened this summer in London with the car bombs .
Last Wednesday , when everybody thought it was 9/11 Part Two — at last — it was , at least to some New Yorkers , something of a relief .
We could deal with it and move on .
At 6:01 p.m. , like thousands of end - of - the - day office workers , I was walking down Park Avenue toward Grand Central , when a young brunette rushed past me .
“ A building collapsed !
It ’s a bomb ! ” she shouted into her phone pressed hard against her cheek .
A thick tower of smoke was rising from behind the MetLife building .
Here we go , I thought .
We all thought .
Sarah Perskie , who works on 42nd and Madison , was leaving work early when she saw the billowing black smoke .
“ I thought , Why are all the men ’s suits freckled ?
until I realized they were covered in dust , and I was , too , ” she says .
“ It ’s funny , because I ’m so scared of an attack that I do n’t even take the subway , ” she says .
“ But once I was in the midst of it , I thought , Now there ’s nothing I can do about it , great ! ”
People streamed out of Grand Central , some crying , most making futile attempts to place calls .
Dust - covered dresses and sunglasses .
People ran downtown , grabbing others on their way .
Some abandoned their shoes .
At 6:15 , a cluster of people on a corner of Lexington were engaged in a spirited discussion .
“ They say something exploded in the Empire State Building , ” one man said .
“ They think it might just be a transformer , but I ’m sure Al Qaeda ’s behind it , ” said a young woman .
For the most part , people were calm .
This time was different — this time we were expecting it , were n’t we ?
And now it was over and done with .
Hooray !
How resigned we must all be to this sense of inevitable disaster ; it ’s the sort of thing we all end up discussing with our shrinks , one more anxiety .
“ Your relief was part of the underlying post - traumatic - stress disorder that most New Yorkers have , ” says Manhattan psychotherapist Jean Malpas .
“ We do n’t even know that we ’re walking around with this unconscious anticipation of another attack .
Only when something happens , like it did on Wednesday , do we realize we live our lives with this fear . ”
Which we do .
So what to make of our wise Mayor Bloomberg ’s advice after the JFK plot came out ?
“ There are lots of threats to you in the world .
There ’s the threat of a heart attack for genetic reasons .
You ca n’t sit there and worry about everything .
Get a life , ” he said .
Or just add it to the list of popular fears : falling through the subway grate .
Electrified manhole covers .
Untreatable TB on the loose .
At 6:18 , on Second Avenue , a jacketless businessman said , “ It ’s not terrorists , ” frowning .
“ They say it ’s a pipe , and that it ’s steam , not smoke . ”
He sounded disappointed .
You could think ,
If they ’re really smart , they ’ll attack us right now , when all the police and firemen are occupied elsewhere .
It was perverse , the idea of wishing this ; what happened was terrible enough .
Meanwhile , we wait .

Putting NASA 's Budget in Perspective
( Unless otherwise indicated , the dollar figures cited in this webpage were obtained from The World Almanac and Book of Facts 2000 , World Almanac Books , PRIMEDIA Reference Inc. , 1999 , ISBN 0-88687-847-0 . )
The federal government spent roughly $ 14 billion ( B ) on NASA in fiscal year 1999 .
That 's a lot of money !
But what does that mean ?
How much is $ 14B ?
For most folks $ 14B is merely an abstract concept .
This webpage aims to put NASA 's budget in perspective by comparing this $ 14B figure with other governmental and private expenditures in the United States .
For example , in fiscal year ( FY ) 1999 , total federal expenditures were $ 1,699,217 million ( M ) -- approximately $ 1.7 trillion !
NASA 's budget of $ 14B , thus , represented only about 0.8 % of total federal expenditures during FY '99 .
In fact , since 1975 NASA 's budget has varied only between 0.7 % and 1.0 % of total federal expenditures .
NASA 's highest ever share of total federal expenditures was 5.5 % , which occurred in 1966 .
( Click here to see a graph illustrating NASA 's share of federal expenditures for the past 40 years . )
Many other interesting comparisons can be made :
Microsoft 's corporate revenues in 1998 were roughly the same as NASA 's budget that year .
NASA 's budget is roughly the same size as the budgets of each of the following states : Alabama , Connecticut , Kentucky , Louisiana , Missouri and Tennessee .
of the following states : Alabama , Connecticut , Kentucky , Louisiana , Missouri and Tennessee .
The federal government spends over 30 times as much money on Social Security as it does on NASA .
Americans spent over 19 times as much at restaurants in 1997 as the federal government spent on NASA that year .
NASA 's budget represents approximately 0.2 % of U.S. Gross Domestic Product .
What follows are a set of tables further illustrating how much -- or how little -- the federal government spends on NASA .
Note that these comparisons do not necessarily imply a cause - effect relationship between the governmental or private expenditure in question and NASA 's budget .
These comparisons are meant merely to illustrate the size of NASA 's budget .

Explanatory Notes
The blue row near the top , illustrating NASA 's data , is provided for reference purposes .
Using the Veterans Affairs Department ( VA ) as an example . . . .
The VA 's budget in 1999 was about $ 43 B ( 2nd column ) .
NASA 's budget , of about $ 14 B , was thus about 32 % the size of the VA 's budget ( 3rd column ) .
Put another way , the VA 's budget was over 3 times the size of NASA 's budget ( 4th column ) .
Put yet another way , for every dollar the federal government spent on NASA , the federal government spent $ 3.16 on the VA ( 5th column ) .

Explanatory Notes
The blue row near the top , illustrating NASA 's data , is provided for reference purposes .
Using consumer expenditures on groceries as an example . . . .
Consumers as a whole spent about $ 494 B on groceries in 1997 ( 2nd column ) .
NASA 's budget , of about $ 14 B , was thus about 3 % the size of what all consumers spent on groceries that year ( 3rd column ) .
Put another way , consumers spent over 34 times as much money on groceries as they did on NASA * ( 4th column ) .
Put yet another way , for every dollar the federal government happened to spend on NASA in 1997 , consumers happened to spend $ 34.32 on groceries ( 5th column ) .

Note on the Table 's Data Formats : Normally in tables like this all the numbers entail a common multiplication factor ( e.g. , the numbers are reported to be in " millions of dollars " or in " thousands of dollars " ) .
However , over time the federal government changed its accounting conventions concerning the magnitude of its budgetary numbers .
So , in this table the dollar amounts for the fiscal years :
1958 through 1966 are actual dollar figures
1967 through 1981 are in thousands of dollars
1982 through 1999 are in millions of dollars .
to top of table
As examples from the table :
In FY 1958 , NASA 's budget was exactly $ 89,193,256.00 -- roughly $ 89 M -- out of roughly $ 72 B in federal expenditures .
This means that NASA received 0.1 % of total federal expenditures .
In FY 1967 , NASA 's budget was approximately $ 5,425,815,000.00 -- roughly $ 5.4 B -- out of roughly $ 172 B in federal expenditures .
This means that NASA received 3.1 % of total federal expenditures .
In FY 1982 , NASA 's budget was approximately $ 6,026,000,000.00 -- roughly $ 6 B -- out of roughly $ 728 B in federal expenditures .
This means that NASA received 0.8 % of total federal expenditures .
Ultimately , the magnitude of the dollar figures for any given fiscal year are not important when calculating the percentage of the total federal budget NASA received for that year ( assuming , of course , that the magnitudes of NASA expenditures and total federal expenditures are the same for that year ) .
Bad news for buyers of ecological Christmas presents and seekers of environmental quick fixes : offsetting carbon emissions by planting extra trees might not work as well as we had all hoped .
It always seemed too easy , did n't it ?
New research presented at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union suggests that the carbon reducing benefits of the trees is outweighed by their tendency to trap heat close to the ground - especially when they are planted in the normally snowy , higher latitudes .
So while they cool the planet by taking carbon out of the atmosphere , they also warm it , like a winter blanket .
Ecologist Govindasamy Bala of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory told the BBC : " What we have found is in the so - called mid-latitude region where the United States is located and majority of European countries are located , the climate benefits of planting will be nearly zero . "
For the trees to have an impact they need to be planted in the tropics , he said .
Dr Bala and his colleague Ken Caldeira at the Carnegie Institution of Washington simulated the environmental impact of planting trees at different latitudes in a computer model .
They found that trees have two cooling effects : reducing atmospheric carbon and evapourating water , increasing cloudiness at the right height to reflect incoming solar radiation .
In the tropics this produces a significant cooling effect , the researchers said .
But because they are dark , the trees also increase heat by trapping solar radiation close to the ground .
This effect is most pronounced in areas that would otherwise be reflecting solar energy .
Dr Bala concludes : " When you plant trees to slow down global warming , you have to be careful where you do it . "
The Green Party argues that rather than paying to plant trees , people should think about the amount of carbon their lifestyles generate .
Siân Berry , Green Party principal Speaker said : " Offsetting is n't an excuse not to reduce burning fossil fuels - the first thing we need to do is to burn less .
" But if flying or whatever you are offsetting is absolutely unavoidable , then it 's better to invest in a scheme that provides clean technologies to the Global South so they can avoid making the same mistakes we have made . "

The sprawling Shia district , in the north - east of the Iraqi capital , is a stronghold of the Mahdi Army militia .
The Iraqi foreign minister , Hoshyar Zebari , today said the Mahdi Army - loosely controlled by the radical cleric Moqtada al - Sadr - could have been behind the abductions of a financial expert and four bodyguards from the finance ministry building near Sadr City .
Iraqi forces have established a special battalion of Iraqi soldiers and police officers to search for the missing men .
Sadr City residents reported that hundreds of US and Iraqi troops had sealed off areas of the neighbourhood overnight , carrying out a series of raids that lasted until dawn .
" We are conducting search operations near the site where the abduction took place , " Brigadier General Qassim al - Musawi , an Iraqi army spokesman , said .
" Maybe today , or in the coming few days , we will find them [ the Britons ] with the help of secret intelligence . "
Not all today 's military activity in Sadr City was linked to the kidnappings , with the US military saying five people had been arrested on suspicion of weapons smuggling .
The kidnappers wore police uniforms , had the appropriate identification papers and drove up to the ministry building in 19 four - wheel drive vehicles of a type used by officers .
Mr Zebari , who described the abduction of the five Britons as sophisticated , acknowledged the possible involvement of corrupt elements of the interior ministry police in the operation .
" It has been a known fact for some time that the interior ministry police , security units and forces are corrupt , are penetrated , " he told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme .
" This issue is a very serious , challenging fact to the government itself .
" The number of people who were involved in the operation , to seal off the building , to set roadblocks and to get into the building with such confidence , must have some connection . "
The seized British security guards worked for a private firm , while the financial expert has been advising the Iraqi government .
They were abducted just before noon in what appeared to be a carefully planned assault intended to give the impression it was a government - sanctioned operation .
According to one witness 's account , a group of gunmen stormed into a hall where a western adviser was giving a lecture , shouting : " Where are the foreigners ? "
The gunmen - led by a man in a police major 's uniform - then rounded up the five and left .
In London , the cabinet 's Cobra crisis committee held an emergency meeting to discuss the situation , and Tony Blair said the government would " do everything we possibly can to help " .
Today , the foreign secretary , Margaret Beckett , attending a meeting of the G8 nations in Berlin , said it was " clearly a very distressing time for all concerned " , adding : " Foreign Office officials are offering help and assistance to the next of kin .
" It is not sensible at this stage to speculate on what might have happened .
We are working closely with the Iraqi authorities to establish the facts , and doing all we can to secure their swift and safe release . "
Employees at the finance ministry are likely to be questioned about how the kidnappers were able to enter the building , seize the Britons and leave with no apparent resistance .
Bayan Jabr , the finance minister , is a conservative Shia politician who has been accused by Sunnis of fomenting sectarian violence , but he is a senior member of a Shia group that is a rival to the Mahdi Army .
The missing Britons have not been named for their own safety .
The security guards were working for GardaWorld , a Canadian - based firm employing mainly British ex-soldiers .
The finance expert was working for BearingPoint , a US management consultancy based in Virginia , which won a contract to help rebuild the Iraqi financial system in 2003 .
LOS ANGELES , Aug. 22 — Children who participated in “ Kid Nation , ” a CBS reality show that has come under fire over questions of whether it violated child safety and labor laws , were required to do whatever they were told by the show ’s producers , 24 hours a day , 7 days a week , or risk expulsion from the show , according to a copy of the contract signed by the children and their parents .
The contract also specifies that while the children could be paid for their participation , those payments or the agreement to be fully under the producers ’ direction did not constitute employment under the producers ’ interpretation and therefore was not subject to any state or federal labor laws .
The agreement , which was provided to The New York Times by the New Mexico attorney general ’s office under an open records act request , appears to anticipate the arguments that were later made by New Mexico state authorities that the show ’s producers might have violated state labor laws and licensing requirements for child housing .
“ Kid Nation , ” which is scheduled to have its premiere on CBS on Sept. 19 , took 40 children , ages 8 to 15 , and placed them in a New Mexico desert “ ghost town ” near Santa Fe for 40 days , during which they had little to no contact with their parents .
The program has been criticized by New Mexico state authorities who have said that they were not notified in advance of the conditions , which they said appeared to violate state laws .
In a weird sort of progress , NASA administrator Michael Griffin * acknowledges that global warming is real .
But being a Bush appointee it goes without saying that Griffin cannot possibly say something reasonable without slipping in the crazy somewhere .
In an interview with NPR ’s Steve Inskeep that will air in Thursday ’s edition of NPR News ’ Morning Edition , Administrator Griffin explains : “ I guess I would ask which human beings – where and when – are to be accorded the privilege of deciding that this particular climate that we have right here today , right now is the best climate for all other human beings .
I think that ’s a rather arrogant position for people to take . ”
I mostly let the global warming issue go these days since , IMO anyway , the key thresholds have already come and gone so there is little point getting worked up about it now .
Still , even a jaded cynic like me has to stop and stare at self - justifying stupidity like this .
Griffin ’s personal odyssey from doubt directly to despair reflects a too - convnient attitude that I see in rightwingers practically every day .
One moment they deny anything to do with global warming , the next they think that puny little people like us could never hope to influence such a terribly huge problem .
Or , this is a new one , it might even be morally wrong to fix the problem that we created .
So many rightwingers seem to magically pass from denial directly to despair without getting anywhere near the idea that we should try to tackle the climate problem before it wrecks us .
This transition from denial to inertia suits perfectly the Exxon - Mobil interests that fund America ’s rightwing .
Giving Griffin the benefit of the doubt , here is an answer to his complaint .
You do n’t have to know each individual who will win and lose from changing climate to know that human civilization in aggregate grew in and depends on a several thousand year period of historic climate stability .
Our global population has surged towards seven billion because food growers can plan their harvest five , ten and twenty years in the future .
Water rights in marginal lands use regional averages that have held true for hundreds of years .
Humans living near water ( somewhere near 50 % of the global population ) count on the coastlines staying where they are next year and the year after that .
The word civilization keeps growing in meaning as technology advances and far - flung regions grow entirely interdependent on one another for survival .
Hardly an exception from global interdependence , Americans may be the worse off than anybody .
Think of how many products you have used that came entirely from inside America .
Do you know where the raw materials were produced ?
Do you know where your shoes were assembled ?
The simple fact is that Americans could not possibly afford shoes , cars or coke for blast furnaces produced entirely in America .
Our raw manufacturing sector is dead .
We outsource both labor costs and evironmental degradation to poorer countries that make our stuff for us and then sell it back to us on the cheap .
Coincidentally many of these same countries stand on the front lines with respect to climate .
When components of the global system break down everything will start to crawl .
We need to find a solution for global change because every element of our current system is heavily mortgaged on stability .
Naturally instead of either proposing to mitigate change with sensible carbon policies or suggesting a national Apollo Program to handle the disruption that change will cause we get despondent , inertia - bound leaders like Michael Griffin who must rationalize away his ideological allergy to dealing with problems that he can no longer deny .

In a Thursday morning press conference , President George W. Bush insisted that there was no need to hold Attorney General Alberto Gonzales accountable because he had done nothing wrong .
" I have n't seen Congress say he 's done anything wrong , " the President insisted .
" I believe , David , we 're watching a political exercise . "
He went on , " Why would I hold someone accountable who 's done nothing wrong ? "
The President also dismissed the idea that after commuting his jail sentence , he had freed convicted former Vice Presidential Chief of Staff I. Lewis ' Scooter ' Libby from accountability .
" Lewis Libby was held accountable , " he stated in a curt manner .
" He was declared guilty by a jury .
He paid a high price for it . "

To use apostrophes , add an apostrophe followed by an " s " after the name of a person or place to indicate ownership .
For example , you could write " Mary 's lemons . "
In the case of plural ownership , add an apostrophe after the " s " instead , as in " the Smarts ' boat . "
You can also use apostrophes for other contractions , including " don't " for " do not , " and " isn't " for " is not . "
However , you should avoid using an apostrophe with the word " it " so you do n't get confused with " it's , " which is an abbreviation for " it is . "
For tips on how to write an apostrophe in cursive or how and avoid non-existent contractions , read on !
WASHINGTON , June 20 — Microsoft has agreed to make changes to its Windows Vista operating system in response to a complaint by Google that a feature of Vista is anticompetitive , lawyers involved in the case said on Tuesday .
The settlement , reached in recent days by state prosecutors , the Justice Department and Microsoft , averted the prospect of litigation over a complaint by Google that Vista had been designed to frustrate computer users who want to use software other than Microsoft ’s to search through files on their hard drives .
Google had made its complaint confidentially as part of the consent decree proceedings set up to monitor Microsoft for any anticompetitive conduct after it settled a landmark antitrust lawsuit five years ago that had been brought by the states and the Clinton administration .
The federal government and the states described the settlement and changes to be made to Vista in a joint status report filed late Tuesday evening in the consent decree proceedings .
State and federal lawyers had exchanged drafts of the report until near the deadline for the filing .
Disagreements over language reflected tensions between the Justice Department , which initially sided with Microsoft in the dispute , and some of the states , which have supported Google and advocated a more aggressive stance .
バーナーズ＝リーが18日のアメリカ人工知能学会の基調講演を行ったときに、Googleの検索担当ディレクタのPeter Norvigが疑問を投げかけたという話がZDNetで取り上げられている（Google exec challenges Berners- Lee）。内容は特に目新しくはないのだが、Googleという立場でセマンティック・ウェブの課題に対する考えが述べられているのは、興味深いところ。
基調講演でバーナーズ＝リーは、永続的なURIとRDFで情報を識別することの重要性を強調し、これらの仕様を一貫して用いることで、ウェブが本来目指していた協調的な性質をセマンティック・ウェブが獲得できるのだという持論を展開する。その講演後のQAセッションで、最初にマイクを握ったのがNorvigだったというわけだ。
Norvigは、セマンティック・ウェブに反対するわけではないが、Googleの視点からすると克服しなければならない問題があるとして、いくつかのポイントを挙げた。
まず最初に能力の不十分さ。サーバーの設定ができず、HTMLも書けないという何百万ものウェブマスターに次のステップを求めるのは無理がある。
2番目に競争。商売でやっている立場からは「うちが一番なんだから、どうして標準に従う必要があるんだ」という声が出てくる。
3番目が偽装。Googleはいつも、何とか裏をかいてランクを上げてやろうという試みといたちごっこをしているわけで、人間のチェックが少なくなるセマンティック・ウェブでは、そういう欺瞞行為が一層容易になる恐れがある。
バーナーズ＝リーはこれに対して、次のように答えたと紹介されている。
データを自分で提供できればそれに越したことはないが、必ずしも全部自力である必要はなく、RDFデータ提供のためのサービスが登場したっていいし、その方がパワフルだろう。
たとえば在庫や仕入れ価格を明らかにしなかった書店も、競合者がやり始めたらそれに倣ったりする。
偽装の問題は全くその通りだが、情報だけでなく、その出所やなぜそれが信頼できるのかを明確にすることもセマンティック・ウェブの一部だ。Googleは、今のウェブに対して素晴らしいことができるだけでなく、データのソースを確かめるルールという素晴らしい側面をグラフに加えられる立場にある。
対決というより、現実に膨大なデータを扱って様々な課題を克服しなければならないGoogleと、次のステップに人々を参加させたいバーナーズ＝リーの立場の違いだが、この落差がしばしばセマンティック・ウェブに対する疑問の種になっているのも確か。しかし（またもや）Harry ChenがGoogle Exec Challenges Tim Berners- Leeで述べているように、だからといってここで立ち止まっていては何もできないのであって、今ある技術を使って、どうやったら先に進めるかを考えていく方がいいのではないかな。
The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Wednesday January 04 2006
In the report below , we wrongly suggested that the two environmental organisations concerned - Greenpeace and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society - had accused each other of endangering lives by trying to ram one another 's vessels .
In fact , it was the Japanese factory ship and the Sea Shepherd vessel that accused each other of endangering lives , and not Greenpeace and Sea Shepherd .
A battle for what is being called " the high moral wave " was last night being fought off the wild coast of Antarctica as the world 's two leading international marine protection groups fought each other over which would stop the Japanese whaling fleet .
With an international crew of volunteers , a helicopter and a deep warchest , Greenpeace International has sent two boats , the Arctic Sunrise and the faster Esperanza , to the Southern Ocean to stop the Japanese whaling fleet as it tries to catch 900 minke , blue and other whales for " scientific research " .
Last night the group , which located and gave chase to the Japanese fleet before Christmas , claimed to have the whalers on the run in mountainous seas peppered with icebergs .
" The fleet seems to be running in circles , stopping and going in different directions .
It 's the sixth day in a row that we have seen no whales transferred to the factory ship .
It 's unlikely that whaling is being undertaken , " said a spokesman .
The animal rights protector Captain Paul Watson , who co-founded Greenpeace in the 1970s and later set up the more radical Sea Shepherd Conservation Society , was also in pursuit of the fleet yesterday in his ship , the Farley Mowat .
Capt Watson , who accuses Greenpeace of being " the Avon ladies of the environment " and of being more interested in publicity than in enforcing international law , intercepted the Nisshin Maru factory ship on Christmas Day .
Each environmental group now accuses the other of endangering lives by trying to ram its vessels .
Sea Shepherd had requested the presence of the Australian navy to monitor events in the Southern Ocean , but Australia 's environment minister , Ian Campbell , said that Sea Shepherd 's threats to attack the fleet " risk setting back the cause of whale conservation many years " .
Capt Watson said yesterday : " Stop threatening us , Mr Campbell , and charge us if you believe we are acting unlawfully .
Stop posing for the Japanese [ who ] are in blatant violation of international conservation laws . "
Despite a short truce at Christmas in which the captains swapped greetings , Capt Watson and Greenpeace were at daggers drawn again yesterday with Sea Shepherd accusing the larger group of refusing to say where the Japanese fleet was .
" Greenpeace has misled Sea Shepherd and betrayed us .
The Japanese fleet does not give a damn about protests .
[ Greenpeace ] just take pictures and hang banners .
We are down here to enforce international conservation law and to stop the illegal whaling operations . "
Greenpeace retorted : " Greenpeace distance themselves from Sea Shepherd because of their inability to commit to non-violent tactics .
But we 'll do what we can to put bodies between harpoons and whales and protect the whales non-violently , " said its spokesman Danny Kennedy .
Capt Watson yesterday warned Greenpeace that Japan had dispatched a warship to the Southern Ocean to protect its whaling fleet and arrest the conservationists for piracy .
This could not be confirmed .
Last night , the three conservation ships were reportedly trying to spot the Japanese harpoon vessels .
" They are sweeping along the [ Antarctic ] coast corridor with radar and helicopter reconnaissance flights with the objective of ferreting out the positions of the illegal harpoon vessels , " said a spokesman for Greenpeace .
Backstory
The bad blood between Greenpeace and Sea Shepherd goes back to 1979 , when Captain Paul Watson , membership number 008 , left the Greenpeace Foundation he helped set up in Canada in 1972 .
In 1978 , he formed the Sea Shepherd society .
While Greenpeace adopted an ethic of non-violence , Capt Watson , 55 , believes in confrontation and has been accused of piracy and terrorism .
Newswise — Colloidal silver is peddled as a cold medicine , decongestant , all - around germ fighter , and a kind of cure - all .
Is there any legitimate reason for taking the dietary supplement ?
The short answer is no , and there may be some serious and strange side effects , reports the August 2007 issue of the Harvard Health Letter .
Silver has several uses in conventional medicine .
Silver sulfadiazine is used to treat serious burns .
Fabric impregnated with silver is sometimes used as a dressing for wounds or skin infections .
And silver nitrate is occasionally used to treat warts and corns .
But there 's no proof that taking colloidal silver by mouth has any benefits .
As for harm , brain and nerve damage from silver exposure is rare , but colloidal silver can cause kidney damage , stomach distress , and headaches .
The most common problem associated with silver exposure is argyria :
The skin turns a bluish gray as granules of silver accumulate in the body .
The conjunctiva ( the membrane that covers the eyes ) and internal organs may also be affected .
Once silver is deposited , there 's no way to get it out , so the discoloration may be permanent .
Will the colloidal silver products currently on the market turn you blue ?
The Harvard Health Letter says if you use them for a short time and in recommended amounts , probably not .
But some people overdo it .
For example , a 59 - year - old man was sent to the emergency room because he looked cyanotic — the bluish color that indicates you 're not getting enough oxygen .
It turned out he'd been taking a homemade version of colloidal silver whenever he felt a cold coming on .
Also in this issue :
" ¢ The shingles vaccine " ¢ Beta blockers " ¢
Migraines and estrogen withdrawal " ¢ More exercise benefits " ¢
By the way , doctor :
Why are n't drugs like Avandia safe when approved by the FDA ?
Should I get the new prostate cancer test ?

BAGHDAD  Iraq will ask neighboring countries to help improve its security at a rare regional summit in Baghdad on Saturday that will be attended by the United States .
The Iraqi government will lobby Iran , Syria and other countries to tighten their borders , stop funding sectarian militias and crack down on religious leaders in their countries who encourage violence in Iraq , said Sami Alaskary , a Shiite lawmaker close to Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki .
The government will oppose any calls by Sunni - dominated countries to abolish Iraq 's constitution and start the process over , Alaskary said .
Some Arab countries think such a move is necessary for Sunni insurgents to put down their arms and join the government , he said .
" There will be no going back to square one , " Alaskary said .
" They have to accept that we have a constitution , that this is the army that Iraq has built .
There will be no going back . "
The Cairo - based Arab League , which includes many Sunni-led countries such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt , said in a statement this week that its delegation to the conference would press for changes to Iraq 's constitution .
Sixteen countries are expected to send delegates , Alaskary said .
Attendees will include all the countries that border Iraq — Syria , Jordan , Saudi Arabia , Iran , Kuwait and Turkey — as well as members of the Arab League , representatives of the Organization of the Islamic Conference , the United States , Britain and others .
Most of the officials will be midlevel diplomats such as deputy foreign ministers , Alaskary said .
A second conference , with higher ranking representatives , may be proposed for the near future , he said .
" This is the first small movement in the right direction .
It 's a long process , " said Mithal al - Alusi , an independent Iraqi Sunni lawmaker .
" Our neighbors have to understand that they cannot succeed if Iraq 's political process fails . "
The summit also may result in a rare meeting between the United States and Iran , which have not had formal relations since 1979 .
Washington has accused Iran of supplying arms to Iraqi militias .
" If we are approached over orange juice by the Syrians or the Iranians to discuss an Iraq - related issue that is germane to this topic — stable , secure , peaceful , democratic Iraq — we are not going to turn and walk away , " David Satterfield , the State Department 's Iraq coordinator , told reporters .
Iraqi leaders will ask the delegates to send ambassadors back to Iraq , Alaskary said .
Many Arab countries pulled envoys from Baghdad after a rash of kidnappings and assassination attempts in 2005 .

Virtual Reality is all the rage these days .
It promises to give us an arena of education , enlightenment , and entertainment boundless in its possibilities .
Indeed , one of the very first things pioneers will likely try out in a full fledged virtual environment will be Godhood .
Omnipotence .
Absolute Power .
Is it true " absolute power corrupts absolutely " , as Lord Acton thought ?
Virtual Reality will let us prove or disprove the axiom .
But more importantly , virtual reality could allow all us frail mortals to taste the power we 've always dreamt of , but thought we could never have .
Can mortal man ( and woman ) learn anything from a taste of Godhood ?
If so , what ?
And so what ?
One thing virtual reality could do is dispel some of our most cherished illusions .
Such as our wish for omnipotence .
But we 'll have to wait for years to experience a level of virtual reality suitable for exploring omnipotence -- right ?
Wrong .
We all of us already possess powerful virtual reality generators , even as we anticipate with quivering credit cards much lower quality ( and prohibitively expensive ! ) appliances promised us today by our brightest technophiles .
The fact of the matter is that commercial virtual reality machines will not match what we already have for probably another century or two .
Of what virtual reality devices am I speaking ?
The brain .
It has two well known V.R. modes : conscious imagination and unconscious dreaming .
But it also offers a little - known third mode of operation , for those willing to train themselves to access it : conscious dreaming .
Or , by its more commonly used appellation , lucid dreaming .
Lucid dreaming is a full immersion , fully controllable virtual reality environment for the dreamer , along the lines of a Star Trek holodeck .
What do I mean by fully controllable ?
That you are literally God in lucid dreaming ( if you want to be ) in every way imaginable , as will be seen in the remainder of this article .
I 've been charting a course towards personal enlightenment , self - realization , and mind expansion for many years now .
My venture into lucid dreaming came only after years of other consciousness altering affairs , ranging from yoga to Silva Mind Control to marijuana to self - hypnosis and other options .
I 've also spent considerable time studying the I Ching and Tao of Power , among other philosophical works .
I read Carlos Castenada at the very start of my personal journey ( in junior high ) , and have been lucky enough to have not one but a whole line of mentors to help me along the way , including a quite amazing combination hippie and Scientologist ( do n't confuse the church with its adherents ) , an honest - to - God hero of industry whom Ayn Rand never met but described perfectly in her novels , a Japanese college professor whose specialty was the boundaries of human potential , and an outrageous cowboy blessed ( or cursed ) with the destiny to ride the very crest of human fun , adventure , and excitement until his own amazing endurance fails him ( as of mid-2000 he still lives , despite many predictions to the contrary by others , including doctors , for almost twenty years now ) .
It 's been quite some time since I first began my lucid dreaming .
Years , in fact .
As I did not document the experience early on , I have precious little record of the beginning but for memories , and indirect references in later writing .
This means while everything I say here is true , it 's inevitable that some inaccuracies and vagueness dot the account .
I 'm not sure where I obtained the basic clues for initiating the process .
Perhaps I stumbled upon the procedure by accident in trial and error , or found it in one of the many texts I 've read over the years .
In any case , the source is unknown to me at the time of this writing .
What 's another explanation of lucid dreaming ?
In my own case , I was able to achieve 100 % control .
To be honest however , some yoga training and meditation in my past , as well as other factors , may have helped me reach this level .
How did I get started ?
SPECIAL TIPS FOR DREAM DOCUMENTATION : Upon awakening do n't try to capture the entire dream in sequential or organized form -- instead just hurriedly jot down the basic ideas or characters you remember , before they fade -- THEN begin noting every other snippet and detail that you can recall at random , until everything else fades away on you .
Next try to reconstruct the entire dream by building upon both the major elements and the snippets .
Each snippet should help you remember something more that preceded , followed , or accompanied it in the dream , eventually letting you end up with several decent - sized portions of the experience documented in an orderly fashion .
This dream documentation MUST be done IMMEDIATELY upon awakening , for best results .
I 'm not sure how good my dream recall was in my early lucid dreaming days .
It may have been somewhat better than before or after that time -- I just can't remember .
It may be likely that dream memories usually fade quickly no matter what .
They are slippery as eels most of the time .
I began my efforts at lucid dreaming by concentrating on a particular theme as I was drifting off to sleep .
After a week or so the theme would reliably ' stick ' , and I 'd find myself dreaming of the desired topic .
After perhaps another week of this I became sufficiently familiar with what was going on to realize I was dreaming , even as I was technically unconscious .
I guess you could say I 'd woven a " thread of continuity " from my waking experience to my dreaming one , by way of concentrating on a particular theme .
Eventually in my dreams the appearance of this theme helped me recall my purpose , and realize my state of mind .
In the nights that followed , full awareness I was dreaming became easier and easier to attain , ' till finally being unaware of the fact seemed impossible to me .
I truthfully cannot recall what my initial lucid dream theme (s ) were , but they may have been similar to the pleasant themes I 'd used for years to drift off quickly into sleep .
Something positive with no downsides whatsoever , like a great memory -- possibly from childhood even -- but not something which will stimulate me too much to abort the drift off process .
It also should NOT be related to a problem or problem - solving -- intellectual stimulation can be just as disruptive as any other , in spoiling the sleep cycle .
Once you find a good theme , you may be able to use it for years -- or at least until some major real life change ruins it for you in some way .
Keep in mind the theme does n't necessarily have to be from real life -- it can be something from a past dream itself .... hmmm .
That may be part of the key .
Perhaps in my initial lucid dreaming I focused on a theme of some past pleasant dream -- especially a recurring one .
I have several in my repertoire I may use -- though they may be unique to me personally .
For instance , I possess a dreaming history of sorts which seems to be an alternative life in the dreamworld , that can be surprisingly consistent and long - lasting .
One example is that my dream self has lived in several different abodes over the years , inhabiting each in dreams for years at a time .
One was a magnificent delapidated mansion I really loved , and lived in for many years ( experiencing it in maybe dozens of separate dreams over several years ) .
But in one dream a flood destroyed it , and my dream self had to move elsewhere .
I never did have another dream about living there again , although I often have dreams about REMEMBERING living there ( this is strange , is n't it ? ) .
I also spent a short time living in a Hobbit House , like those described in the J.R.R.
Tolkien books ...
Keep in mind that I have not purposely performed lucid dreaming for many years now -- although I fequently nowadays realize I 'm dreaming , usually when something unpleasant might be happening or about to happen -- therefore allowing me to mitigate my circumstances .
It 's mostly an automatic protective mechanism for me now , rather than anything more .
At other times I may realize I 'm dreaming when a dream or dream element is recurring on me -- I recall the first one was a dream , and so realize the case about the second .
Is confidence important to initiating lucid dreaming ?
Again , I suffer fuzzy memories here .
I believe I was pretty confident in those early days , although it may have taken me a couple weeks of regular effort to finally achieve what I sought .
I 'd read some things about it , maybe done significant research ( though I can't recall the sources now ) , so I was prepared .
With preparation comes confidence , in almost any endeavor .
Plus I had my past experience of other things sometimes not that far different from lucid dreaming .
I do n't think I ever had serious doubts I 'd achieve it , since I 'd previously had occasional lucid dreams by accident from time to time -- which I believe happens to everyone more than they think -- it 's just that they do n't REMEMBER the lucid dreaming later , for the same reason everyone forgets 99 % of all dreams after waking .
I guess doubt could make some difference .
But even if you tried everything you could to PREVENT lucid dreaming via doubt or other methods , I believe you 'd eventually fail and have a lucid dream anyway at some point .
The main trick may be in REMEMBERING the experience , rather than inducing it .
My first time
Indeed , one of my initial purposes in pursuing lucid dreaming may have been to chase away my nightmares .
In this , I succeeded magnificently .
But everything has a price , does n't it ?
Awakening to Godhood
As my confidence grew , I tired of the energy blasts , and began to grapple with fearsome beasts hand - to - hand , like Beowulf ; I could be as strong and impervious to harm as I wished to be , and so always defeated my foes .
For the first time ever I was able to fly at great heights with no qualms .
Before , I had often become frightened by the sight of the ground so far away , and begun tumbling out of control .
I reveled in my newfound power .
Manipulation of time and space
My friend sped helplessly away , as we both realized there was n't any hope of my making it back to him .
Just as the police reached me , I remembered my power .
I 'd used it primarily as a weapon and tool of levitation up to that point .
But there was no good reason why I could n't bend time and space as well , was there ?
I sent my dream into " rewind " , as if it were a tape in a VCR , and watched everything run backwards .
The cops disappeared back around the bend , my friend returned to the curb , and I backtracked to his car .
Then I hit the " play " button .
My friend was puzzled by my sudden hesitation to disembark this second time .
So I told him the cops were coming , and there they were , right on schedule .
Only this time , my friend and I sped away together , and had a merry time as the police pursued us in vain .
Absolute power bores absolutely
Though I 've forgotten many details about it over the years , I do remember my final judgment on the matter ( I 'm very careful to remember any lessons learned about an experience , even if I decide to let the details themselves fade into obscurity . )
In the main , I learned that absolute power bores absolutely .
It may corrupt too , as the old saying goes , but any corruption I experienced did n't make nearly as big an impression on me as the boredom .
When you 're master of all you survey , you 're also bereft of any challenge or hope of novelty .
When you win a battle you had no chance of losing , the victory is meaningless .
When nothing new can occur without your permission , you can not be surprised .
Without fear there is no courage .
Without need or want there is no progress or movement .
Without limitations , there is no life .
From my own experience , it appears Godhood would quickly grow unbearable , at least for the likes of us mortals , accustommed to more spicey , exciting fare .
Soon after I began lucid dreaming , neither extreme was available .
Both the joys , and the terrors , of my past dreaming experience were gone .
Imagine a person whose taste buds have been irrevocably destroyed , to the extent that they may no longer taste anything they eat or drink .
Every meal becomes a burden of mere exercise of the jaws and tongue , that must be performed several times a day to stave off weakness from hunger .
Rather than looking forward to meals , the victim begins to loathe them .
They become a punishment rather than a treat .
If you want to know the feeling , buy a pack of gum , chew all the sticks until every last bit of sweetness has been leached away , then pack the remnants into a plastic bag and refrigerate them .
For the next week , pull out the wad of gum and chew it for about twenty minutes three times a day , to emulate eating , and you 'll get some idea of what a taste denied person might perceive during meals .
You 'll also get some idea of what 's missing from the life of a God .
Any motion is essentially wasted from an emotional standpoint , as you may ultimately derive no pleasure or gain from it .
No gain , because you already have everything .
No pleasure , because there 's no other possibility to put it into context .
In a reality that knows only " Yes " , you quickly begin yearning desperately for a " No " .
If you 've never been ill , the vigor and well being of health has much less impact on your psyche than it might otherwise .
If you 've never experienced rejection , acceptance and love will rank low in your personal value system , as common , easily acquired qualities .
Pleasure may be devalued to the point of nothingness in the absolute absence of pain or deprivation , just as money may be devalued to the point of zero worth by inflation , which is by definition a state whereby money may be attained too easily .
Pleasure which comes consistently at no cost or risk of pain may quickly become inflated to the point where it becomes meaningless or worthless to the possessor .
My bargain for escape
Once I had attained Godhood in my dreams , I found it a somewhat difficult thing to rid myself of afterwards .
Godhood it seems , is neither given or lost easily , even in your dreams .
The paradox was this : I could suppress my absolute power by simply avoiding its use , or trying to forget I had it .
But this would n't work because I could always fall back on it , and I could n't help but know this .
So no matter how hard I tried , I could n't have normal dreams again , because everything was still dependent on my will , and I knew it .
Godhood can only be given up lock , stock , and barrel -- not piecemeal , and not temporarily .
To truly relinquish Godhood you must give it up unconditionally and forever .
Otherwise the deal simply cannot work , for the first time you encountered a particularly scary nightmare you 'd wish back your power to save yourself .
No , to obtain mortality you must reject Godhood altogether , giving up any future claim upon it , relinquishing any chance of regaining absolute deity status ever again .
Essentially , I had to choose the possibility of someday dying from sheer fright in my dreams over the option of defending myself via omnipotence .
I did n't have to think about my decision , once I realized my choices .
I grabbed mortality with both hands and denounced Godhood forever .
What 's a terrifying death for mortals , compared to an eternity of stifling , suffocating , joyless boredom as a God ?
To me , Godhood really did appear to be a fate worse than death .
I do n't fully understand how I struck my deal for escape , or with whom I was dealing .
Perhaps it was simply an argument between my conscious and sub-conscious selves .
Maybe some unknown mentor somewhere was teaching me a lesson via my dreams .
Maybe a psychiatrist would find something disturbing about the whole episode .
After a few weeks of despair and growing desire to put my dreams back the way they 'd been before , I met with two strangers in a dream , who explained to me much of what I 'm relating here , and then asked me if I truly wanted to lose the absolute power I 'd gained .
I said yes , and immediately enjoyed the consequences .
I have lost my omnipotence forever .
Though I no longer actively pursue lucid dreaming , I still sometimes find myself aware I 'm asleep and dreaming .
I can no longer manipulate my dreams like tapes in a VCR , and flying has once again become scary and accident - prone at times .
I 'm not helpless in dreamland now , but rather fairly confident , and only rarely experience true nightmares these days .
However , since I 'm now vulnerable once again to night terrors like anyone else , I do follow some precautions , such as avoiding sitting through needlessly gruesome films just before retiring for the night .
Have I ever again met the two strange entities with whom I dealt regarding the Godhood of my dreams ?
No .
Never again .
And no , I do not recall them having any particular names , either .
I also do not remember their specific appearance .
My vague memories suggest they were two quite ordinary looking people -- both male , I believe .
They did not behave as if the incident was a very big deal for anyone but me .
In the years since I first published these experiences on the net , some readers have accused me of possibly giving up the secrets of the universe and life itself here .... but there was never any indication to me that my all - powerful , all - knowing status in my dreamworld extended in any way to waking reality .
Every day of my life during my lucid dreaming status as a God , I would awake and live no differently in reality than I did before , or after .
My dreamed Godhood gave me no special knowledge or powers in waking reality , nor did it provide me with prophetic visions of the future .
My Godhood existed only in my dreams , and had no relation or relevance whatsoever to real life .
So no , I 'm sorry to disappoint those who believe otherwise , but I gave up only the omnipotence and omniscience within a fantasy -- not the real things , by any means .
But I also have to admit that if by some magic or miracle my lucid dreaming had bestowed such powers upon me in reality , I 'd have given them up just as gladly as I did the fantasy abilities .
The experience is just too awful to maintain for a being who can recall genuine curiosity , emotions , passions , pain , and pleasure .
Yes , I like to think that I would have struggled to cope with Godhood long enough to make the world a better place for everyone before I gave up the powers -- but I know I 'm kidding myself .
Because the longer you experience Godhood the less you care about anything but possibly escaping it .
By the time I realized the trap Godhood represented I was already desperate for an exit , and my care for anything else in the world ( at least during my dream - state ) completely extinguished .
By that point I was incapable of helping anyone or anything in my dreams -- because I simply did n't care .
I explain this further below .
( My advice to anyone who wishes to improve the world and somehow did gain Real World omnipotence ?
Make your improvements A.S.A.P. , because all your desire and will to help others will be consumed quickly by Godhood 's hunger )
What did I learn from lucid dreaming ?
I truly believe now the common male fantasy of the power to make all beautiful women fall madly in love with you would not be enjoyable for most who might somehow achieve it .
For it would be too similar to my dreaming experience .
The other people involved would be no more than puppets , incapable of initiating their own original actions , always dependent on your own commands and ideas , and with little or no regard for their own welfare or self interest , but for where it affected you , their absolute master .
Such entities would rank lower than slaves , lower even than animals -- they would be lifeless , soulless automatons , of little more value than a pornographic magazine to the owner .
When pleasure is no longer difficult to acquire , it loses its value .
Still do n't get it ?
Look at a cup of simple , thirst - quenching water .
In the desert , it can be priceless life - giving ecstacy .
But when we 're comfortably sitting at home , with all the plain , pure water we can drink , do we ?
Not me .
I almost never drink plain water if I can help it .
Give me a soft drink , coffee , tea , milk , orange juice -- almost anything but plain water .
No , under my prefered conditions water , the stuff which has kept all life on the planet alive for three billion years , almost ranks as a punishment .
The cup of water in the desert is analogous to the typical taste of pleasure the majority of us mortals experience in our daily existence .
It 's uncommon , difficult to find and keep , and therefore we look forward to it , anticipate it , search for it , hope for it .
Can you imagine an existence utterly devoid of pleasure , or even the hope of it ?
Apathy would run rampant -- maybe that 's why it seems
God does n't give a damn about anyone or anything --
He can't !
To Him , a baby 's laughter and a hyena 's chilling bark might be equivalent in the emotional reaction elicited : none whatsoever .
The motivation to escape
From my own experience with virtual Godhood , I can vouch for the plausibility of this theory .
Because look what I myself did !
Faced with omnipotence I quickly rejected it in favor of mortality , limitations , and vulnerability .
Maybe God Himself wanted the same thing , and so spun Himself out into a 100 billion galaxies ultimately developing maybe a few million interesting civilizations over several trillion trillion years , to see what might come of it .
After all , such a plan would sound much more interesting than simply going insane out of boredom over an infinitely longer period of time ( I suspect choosing to become a Universe would also bring with it a much shorter lifespan for the Deity in question -- Creation might be the equivalent of Suicide for a God , as He might not ever face an Ending otherwise . )
The caveat
Of course , it might also be true that in regards to some matters practically any sentient being might follow the same course , and make the same decisions , no matter how high or low on the totem pole they started from .
A preferable alternative to Godhood ?
Would an asymptotic approach to Godhood be acceptable ?
That is , growing ever nearer to Godhood , but never quite achieving it ?
Perhaps .
And this may in fact be the road our descendents in the far future will travel , should they enjoy a choice in the matter .
Perhaps the optimum balance would be one wherein we 're never in possession of more than barely adequate resources to defeat our foes and overcome obstacles , and often possessing not even that much in the way of advantages .
Such challenges would tend to strengthen us when we won , frighten us when we watched our compatriots fall , and stretch out the process of our achieving Godhood indefinitely , as our progress would be about as gradual as the Universe could allow .
If our enemies were usually of our own kind , our development would be self - regulating and positively reinforcing .
Our past history seems to indicate just such a process , as once we overcame the natural inorganic opposition to our survival ( the elements of weather , fire , earthquake , and flood ) , we faced off against various DNA relatives , from snakes to tigers to fellow human beings .
Perhaps the heroic struggle , against often overwhelming odds , is precisely what we are designed for , and would willingly choose for our destiny if made fully aware of all the alternatives .

Liberals and conservatives habitually speak of the United States as a superpower .
Neocons like Norman Podhoretz advise that our " only option " with Iran is " to go to war " ( The Week , June 8 , p.6 )  as though we can .
A New York Times commentary on Iraq blithely states that , no matter the outcome , " the United States would still be the sole world power " ( Jan. 14 , p. WK1 )  as though we are .
Bush planners aim at establishing a " permanent " U.S. military presence in Iraq ( The Christian Science Monitor , June 12 , p.1 )  as though we could .
And presidential candidates of both parties speak as though we can accomplish anything if we 're well - led .
Well , as Roky Erickson once said , " You can believe that story if you want to . "
Consider , first , global economics , then China , then the state of our military .
The Economist ( Feb. 14 , p.18 ) : " Typically in the past , when America 's economy has weakened , the rest of the world soon flagged .
But this time ... the rest of the world has speeded up even as the American engine has lost steam .
... [ Gross national product ] per person is now growing faster in the euro area than it is in America .
Domestic demand is also booming in emerging economies in Asia , the Middle East , and Russia [ and ] most of China 's growth comes not from exports but from domestic demand . "
Since World War II , and until recently , American consumption has been the world 's primary economic force  which is why the world had no choice but to tolerate our misadventures .
Now many nations are booming on their own , in cooperation with one another .
The U.S. is still important , but it 's not necessary .
The Economist ( April 14 , p.12 ) , under the headline " Come in number one , your time is up " : " America used to be the world 's biggest exporter .
First it was pushed aside by Germany , and now it has been outclassed by China .
...
In global finance , too , America and the dollar are being shoved off their pedestal .
The dollar is still preferred as a reserve currency , but it is no longer the favourite form of cash for households and firms .
There are now more euro[s ] ... in circulation than there are dollars [ my italics ] .
In the international bond market , the euro has displaced the dollar as the main currency .
...
Wall Street 's stockmarket capitalisation has now been eclipsed by Europe [ combined with Russia ] . "
Still important , but not necessary .
Still important , but now the world has many other choices .
In light of these facts , to think of the U.S. as " the sole world power " is ludicrous  as it is ludicrous to imagine that in this brave new world we will be granted the authority , and accorded the deference , to which we 've been accustomed for 60 years .
The leading nations have n't yet decided what to do with their new power .
They 're not used to it .
But they 'll get used to it , and they will use it  how , at this point , is anyone 's guess .
But the more delusional we remain about our status , the harder the shock will be when they figure out how .
It 's been widely reported that we are , by far , the world 's biggest debtor nation .
The Week ( June 8 , p.20 ) : " Including unfunded promises made for Medicare , Social Security , and federal retirement programs , U.S. taxpayers have a total debt of $ 59 trillion .
That 's $ 516,000 for every U.S. household . "
Obviously , we 're not paying that debt anytime soon , especially when " the nation 's average personal savings rate fell to negative 1 % in 2006 , meaning that Americans spent more than they earned " ( The Week , Feb. 16 , p.16 ) .
Also widely reported : America needs foreign investment and loans to function .
Foreigners " hold a record 52 % " of U.S. government debt , " up from 25 % in 1995 " ( The Week , Dec. 15 , 2006 , p.44 ) .
How can you call America a superpower when we can't meet our expenses without the goodwill of our rivals ?
Which brings us to China , our primary banker .
The New York Times ( April 14 , p.C3 ) : " Last year , when Treasury debt increased by $ 184 billion , almost half of that amount ... was provided by lenders in China .
... China [ is ] the largest source of funding for the United States government 's deficits . "
The article reports that our Federal Reserve bought 20 % of " our newly issued bonds " and that " only 4 % of the [ total ] money came from American investors and institutions " ( my italics ) .
Which totals only 24 % coming from American sources .
Without the present level of foreign investment , especially Chinese investment , America would be in very bad straits .
Uh oh ... the Chinese show signs of changing their ways .
" Their fastest growth these days lies in Europe , Africa , the Middle East , South America , and elsewhere in Asia  in other words , practically anywhere other than the United States " ( The New York Times , April 18 , p.C1 ) .
One result is that China has created a new " agency to invest its immense reserves in foreign currency .
...
Some analysts say the formation of the new agency means China is moving away from heavy reliance on investing in United States dollars through Treasury securities [ The New York Times , March 10 , p.C3 ] . "
We 're still important , but not nearly as necessary .
With even a small change in its investment policy , China has the power to dampen America 's economy .
Now consider the state of America 's military .
Colin Powell , quoted in Time ( April 16 , p.30 ) : " The active Army is about broken . "
The Washington Post ( March 19 , p.1 ) : " Senior U.S. military and government officials acknowledge ... that it will take years for the Army and Marine Corps to recover from what some officials privately have called a ' death spiral , ' in which the ever more rapid pace of war - zone rotations has consumed 40 % of their total gear , wearied troops , and left no time to train .
...
The U.S. military now lacks a large strategic reserve of ground troops ready to respond quickly and decisively to potential foreign crises .
...
The vast majority [ of Army units in the United States ] are rated ' not ready . ' "
The Post article reports the reactions of several congressmen to a classified military briefing .
Rep. Solomon P. Ortiz , D - Texas : " I have seen the classified - only reports .
And based on those reports , I believe that we as a nation are at risk of major failure , should our Army be called to deploy to an emerging threat . "
Rep. Walter B. Jones , R - N.C. : " This nation has got to replenish and fix what is soon going to be broken . "
Finally , the Post goes on : " Under current ... plans , it will take two to three years after the Iraq war ends [ my italics ] ... to restore ... equipment levels .
It will take five years and at least $ 75 billion for the Army to increase its active - duty ranks [ as planned ] up to 547,000 soldiers . "
That 's for the future .
Right now the military is hurting at home as well as on the battlefield .
" The backlog of [ veterans ' ] disability claims stands at more than 405,000 , with cases averaging 177 days to be processed .
...
Experts estimate that an additional 400,000 claims will be filed in the next two years " ( The New York Times , June 6 , p. WK13 ) .
" Care facilities for American troops and their families are buckling under the strain of war and funding limitations " ( USA Today , June 5 , p.1 ) .
Barry McCaffrey , retired four - star Army general : " There is no argument of whether the U.S. Army is rapidly unraveling " ( The Christian Science Monitor , April 4 , p.11 ) .
The Washington Post ( May 8 , p.D1 ) : " Joseph E. Stiglitz [ Nobel winner in economics ] ... co-authored a study that predicts the Iraq conflict alone will eventually cost taxpayers more than $ 1 trillion , counting military rebuilding and health care for wounded veterans . "
Incredibly , we have n't paid for any of this yet .
The Post article noted , " The war bill is going directly on the nation 's credit card . "
Foreign investors , especially China , have been paying for this war .
Now why would they do that ?
The answer :
It 's in their strategic interest to finance a war that drains America 's financial , military , and leadership clout .
They 're paying for us to screw ourselves .
It saves them the trouble .
However , given the irresponsibility of America 's military adventures and the equal irresponsibility of the American electorate in elevating someone like George W. Bush to power , why would China and the other investing nations finance the rebuilding of America 's military might ?
How could that possibly be in their interest  especially now that the euro has overtaken the dollar as a viable medium for world exchange ?
Hence China and others are making obvious moves to invest differently .
We 're about to be left behind .
We 're still important , a big economy , a player .
We 're still dangerous , with all our bombs and missiles .
But we wo n't be fighting another ground war anytime soon , and everybody knows it .
Financially and militarily , we 're no superpower anymore  though no presidential candidate can say that .
Whether we recede from center stage gracefully or destructively , we 'll recede .
We already have .
It does n't look that way on TV , but we already have .
Learning Number Theory and Haskell : More QuickCheck and Divisors
This is part two of my series Learning Number Theory and Haskell .
Last time , we implemented a division algorithm according to an exact specification from Jones Elementary Number Theory .
We used the QuickCheck testing library to make ourselves fairly confident that the code was actually correct ( in other words , behaved according to certain expectations ) .
More QuickCheck
Since QuickCheck may be feeling pretty new right now , let ’s play around with it for a bit .
Exercises 1.1 and 1.2 of the Jones text give some interesting theorems about the remainders of perfect squares .
We will verify these theorems with a hundred or so random test cases each .
( Note that I ’ve now stopped using the jonesQuot and jonesRem functions defined earlier .
It was nice to be able to reproduce that behavior , but it ’s nicer to become skilled at using the standard library functions instead of inventing our own replacements .
We ’ll just be careful about negative numbers from here on . )
Prelude > :qc \
-> ( n^2 `rem` 4 ) `elem` [ 0 , 1 ] +++ OK , passed 100 tests .
Prelude > :qc \
-> ( n^2 `rem` 3 ) `elem` [ 0 , 1 ] +++ OK , passed 100 tests .
Prelude > :qc \
-> ( n^2 `rem` 5 ) `elem` [ 0 , 1 , 4 ] +++ OK , passed 100 tests .
Prelude > :qc \
-> ( n^2 `rem` 6 ) `elem` [ 0 , 1 , 3 , 4 ] +++ OK , passed 100 tests .
Yep , they all check out .
Of course , you should still write proofs because , as you ’re probably quite familiar by now , QuickCheck is suitable for contradicting things or providing evidence in favor , but not for proving things .
Generalizing the Proof Method
I was interested in this concept , so I extended it to arbitrary divisors with a simple Haskell program that generalizes the method of the proofs in the text .
If you ’re following along to learn Haskell , this makes use of two shorthands for creating lists .
The innermost list [ 0 .. d - 1 ] is an arithmetic sequence , and hopefully it ’s fairly obvious what that does .
The outer list is built using a list comprehension .
The vertical bar should still be read as “ such that ” , and in this context , <- is read as “ element of ” .
So the outermost list is the list of all ( n ^ 2 ) `rem` d such that n is an element of [ 0 .. d - 1 ] .
These techniques make a lot of mathematical code in Haskell very concise , and keep it closer to math syntax .
Finally , nub just removes the duplicates from a list .
You can : edit NumTheory.hs again , and add the following :
import Data .
List ( nub ) --
Add this at the top of the file , by the other import squareRems d = nub $ [ ( n ^ 2 ) `rem` d | n <- [ 0 .. d - 1 ] ]
We can check this , but we ’ll need to be careful about negative values of the divisor since I used rem instead of jonesRem .
Prelude > :l NumTheory [ 1 of 1 ] Compiling NumTheory ( NumTheory.hs , interpreted )
Ok , modules loaded : NumTheory .
* NumTheory > :qc \
d -> ( d > 0 ) == > ( ( n ^ 2 ) `rem` d ) `elem` squareRems d +++ OK , passed 100 tests .
This algorithm can be supported by a proof that is not given in the text .
The theorem is that the remainder of a 2 when divided by d is equal to the remainder of some k2 , where 0 <= k < d .
This is proven by writing a as qd + r by the division algorithm .
The a2 = q2d2 + 2qdr + r 2 .
In turn , r2 can be written as pd + s by the division algorithm .
Then a2 = q2d2 + 2qdr + pd + s , which in turn is equal to d( q2d + 2 qr + p ) + s.
Thus , a2 gives a remainder of s , but so does r2 , and we know that 0 <= r < d .
It should , therefore , be no surprise that the QuickCheck test succeeds .
Divisors
The next set of theorems from the text deal with divisors .
If we ’d like to verify these theorems using QuickCheck , we need a way to decide if one number divides another one or not .
Following Jones , we ’ll say ( b | a ) , read as “ b divides a , ” iff there is some integer q such that a = qb .
Recall that for any pair of numbers a and b , with b not equal to 0 , there is a unique pair of integers ( q , r ) such that a = qb + r and 0 <= r < b .
In the special case that b is not zero , it ’s clear that b | a iff r = 0 for the unique values of q and r given by the division algorithm .
b `divides` a = a `rem` b == 0
This leaves out the possibility that b = 0 .
The function above will fail if that occurs , because rem a b is undefined when b = 0 .
So we go back to the definition , which is that b divides a iff there is a q so that a = qb .
If b = 0 , that equation becomes a = 0b , which is only true if a = 0 .
Adding that as a special case , the function looks like this :
0 `divides` a = a == 0 b `divides` a = a `rem` b == 0
( This is a definition by pattern matching , which is one of the nicest syntax aspects of the Haskell language .
The order is significant here , as the second version of the function will match all possible parameters that are n’t matched beforehand . )
I ’ve convinced myself that the function is correct , but it ’s time for some good old QuickCheck .
The text gives a few corner cases explicitly at the top of page 4 , so we can test them .
* NumTheory > :qc \
-> n `divides` 0 +++ OK , passed 100 tests .
* NumTheory > :qc \
-> 1 `divides` n +++ OK , passed 100 tests .
* NumTheory > :qc \
-> n `divides` n +++ OK , passed 100 tests .
Excellent !
Now we ’d like to test the general case so we can be really sure that divides is correct … but how ?
All we have is that b divides a iff for some q , a = qb .
We need to know something more about q than it merely being an integer to make this work .
A convenient property is given in exercise 1.3 ( d ) from the Jones text .
If a satisfactory q exists , it must divide a itself , so it is between –a and a .
The case not covered by this reasoning is when a = 0 , but then q = 0 will definitely do the trick !
Let ’s write a test .
* NumTheory > : qc \\a b -> ( b `divides` a ) == any ( \\q -> a == q * b ) [ (- abs a ) .. abs a ] +++ OK , passed 100 tests .
Here , I build a list of all possible values for q , and then use the built - in any function to see if any of them work .
Notice that the first parameter to any is another function , which I ’ve written using the anonymous lambda syntax .
This is far too slow to be used for an implementation , but it works fine as a test .
Testing a Property of Divisors
Let us now make use of our new function .
Exercise 1.4 of the text asks whether it is the case that if a | b and c | d , then ( a + c ) | ( b + d ) .
If you ’re following along with me in the text , which I hope you are , you should convince yourself of the answer ahead of time by more mundane means .
Quick Check easily gives the answer .
( Here ’s a comprehension quiz .
The mere fact that QuickCheck can provide a definite answer should tell you what the answer is .
Why ? )
* NumTheory > : qc \\a b c d -> ( ( a `divides` b ) && ( c `divides` d ) ) ==> ( a + c ) `divides` ( b + d ) *** Failed !
Falsifiable ( after 5 tests and 7 shrinks ) : 1 1 1 0
So not only do we get an answer ( no , the conjecture is false ! ) , but we get a counter - example .
If a = 1 , b = 1 , c = 1 , and d = 0 , then it is true that a | b because b = ( - 2 ) a and c | d because d = ( - 1 ) c , but it is not true that ( a + c ) | ( b + d ) .
a + c is 2 , and b + d is 1 , and clearly there is no integer q such that 1 = 2 q .
HOW THE IRS LIES TO EMPLOYERS ABOUT WITHHOLDING By : Devvy December 4 , 2003 NewsWithViews.com
" Truth is the first object . " -- Thomas Jefferson to Dr. Maese , 1809 .
ME 12:232
In my recent article on How The IRS Violates It 's Own Code , the facts were carefully presented which definitively proved how the IRS deliberately lies and misleads Americans by unlawfully seizing ( stealing ) assets by circumventing the law .
This article will prove how the American worker and employer alike have been hoodwinked regarding the withholding process .
The purpose behind this chicanery is not to benefit America , but to further enrich the coffers of the private banking cartel aka the Federal Reserve .
There is no need for an income tax , flat tax , sales tax or any other direct tax .
All Americans are encouraged to look behind the curtain so that they might fully understand the grand plunder sucking the lifeblood out of our economy .
See : http://www.devvy.com.
Do n't be fooled by this current illusion of a " booming economy . "
Debt is not prosperity .
Employers must withhold So says the Great Deceivers , the Internal Revenue Service .
Employers are routinely told that they must , under certain provisions of the tax code , withhold taxes of all sorts from an employee 's paycheck .
Funny thing though , when sincere Americans request that the IRS send its representatives to public seminars on this issue , the IRS is no where to be found .
Robert Schulz , Chairman of the Board of We the People Foundation for Constitutional Education , Inc. , made a swing through 37 cities in April and May of 2003 .
Before he arrived at each destination , he sent , via certified mail , an invitation to both the IRS and U.S. Attorney 's offices to come to his public seminars and correct him if he was giving out the wrong legal facts regarding withholding .
What could be more reasonable ?
In not one of those 37 cities did either DOJ or IRS send any representative , begging the question , " Why not ? "
Schulz is a man of honesty and integrity .
His invitations to DOJ and IRS were sincere ; his only desire was to be absolutely certain that the information he communicated to attendees was legally factual .
Instead , he was met with the same usual arrogance in the form of silence .
Why do you suppose that is ?
Abracadabra , courtesy of the IRS Lynda Wall is an expert in the field of withholding and has been assisting employers and employees alike for many years in understanding the law regarding this issue .
We the People Foundation for Constitutional Education , Inc. will be holding our national convention in Washington , DC this coming January and Ms. Wall will give a two hour , comprehensive seminar that will firmly establish in anyone 's mind once and for all how the IRS lies to employers about this process and the lawful remedy .
According to Ms. Wall : " The IRS will tell employers and employees that according to IRC section 3402 ( a ) ( 1 ) of their code : " ....... every employer making payment of wages shall deduct and withhold upon such wages a tax determined in accordance with tables or computational procedures prescribed by the Secretary . "
" However , this is what the law really says : no ( federal , state , city or county ) municipal corporation shall levy or collect or cause to be levied or collected any tax upon the income , or any part thereof , of any person , resident or nonresident ( also known as the " Full Paycheck Law " ) .
Employers are prohibited from taking amounts from pay for federal or state taxes , fees or other charges absent the lawful , knowing , written consent of the employee .
" The Code of Federal Regulations clearly advises the employers at 26 CFR ï¿½31.3402 ( p ) - 1( a )
" An employee who desires to enter into an agreement for withholding ... shall furnish his employer with Form W - 4 ( or its equivalent ) for withholding .
The furnishing of such Form W - 4 shall constitute a request for withholding . "
Then , 31 CFR ï¿ ½215.2 ( n ) ( 1 ) clearly tells the employers they cannot take amounts from the workers ' pay for any form of State tax UNLESS the employee VOLUNTARILY elects to have such sums withheld .
" Consensual taking from pay occurs ONLY when an employee voluntarily elects in writing to volunteer to participate in any ( federal , state , city or county ) municipal corporate tax , program , insurance ( disability , Medicare ) , trust ( social security ) , including non-judicial tax levy , garnishment for taxes , tax offsets , tax interest or penalty and the employer consents such a request . "
The fruits of your labor belong to you Pursuant to 26 CFR ï¿ ½31.3402 ( p ) - 1( b ) ( 2 ) , either the employer or the employee may terminate the withholding agreement ( W - 4 or its equivalent ) by furnishing a signed written notice to the other .
An employer cannot lawfully take amounts from the worker 's pay without the risk of being sued after the worker submits his / her written notice to terminate the withholding agreement ( W - 4 or its equivalent ) .
According to Ms. Wall , when the employer 's tax professionals ( CPA or attorney ) are the ones negligently advising the company to convert and transmit the worker 's property ( pay ) , those incompetent tax professionals are at risk of being sued for negligence , malpractice and misfeasance .
Sheds a whole new light on things , does n't it ?
State laws protect workers from non-consensual taking from pay without the worker 's explicit , knowing , voluntary , written consent .
Only the worker or contractor / payee can make the determination whether or not he / she wants to volunteer to participate in government taxes , fees or other charges ( i.e. , social security trust contributions [ FICA ] , social programs [ Medicare ] , benefits [ disability ] ) as well as non-judicial liens / levies , penalties and interest .
By all means , every employee and employer should go to the law library and verify the information above .
It is accurate , it is factual and it is the law on the books .
Do n't take the word of the IRS for anything .
Check the facts for yourself .
Then sit down and have a heart to heart chat with your tax professional and find out why he / she does n't know the law .
After all , they 're supposed to be the experts looking out for you , the client .
Unlawfully penalizing employers
The IRS threatens employers with huge fines if they do n't withhold payroll taxes .
Funny thing though , according to a September 15 , 2003 letter from GAO ( General Accounting Office ) to Congressman Elton Gallegly regarding W - 4's and reporting , this little nugget of truth stands out : " Under current law , IRS does not have statutory authority to impose a penalty to enforce employer compliance with the reporting requirement .
The reporting requirement was promulgated in Treasury regulations . "
How many employers has the IRS defrauded for untold millions of dollars in fines when in fact , they had no legal authority to impose or enforce such penalties and fines ?
Tax cheats
The IRS likes to use a lot of rhetoric about " tax cheats " who wo n't " pay their fair share . "
When one lifts the curtain and exposes the lies and fraud being conducted every day by the IRS , one would venture to say that the real " tax cheats " are those who work for the IRS .
Employers are being fleeced to the tune of approximately 30 % of their operating budget in " payroll deductions . "
The worker over a ten year period with $ 200 of taxes withheld each pay period , would get clipped for $ 104,000 !
For what ?
Certainly not to fund our military , social security or any other legitimate , authorized expenditure by Congress .
Those expenditures are funded through borrowing by Congress .
Debt is not prosperity .
The American workers and employers have been cheated long enough .
If someone owns the fruits of your labor , stolen from you by deceptive and deceitful methods , then you are a slave .
The withholding issue was sold under the guise of patriotism because the American people did not want this new taxing scheme back in 1942 .
Sixty - one years later , the American people still do n't want this fleecing of the fruits of their labor which does not benefit them in any way .
This process only encourages addictive over spending by Congress and more borrowing from the central bank .
Again , debt is not prosperity .
We the people have two choices :
You can either stay on your knees to this tyranny or you can get the facts and then enforce your rights using the law .
What future will you pass on to your children and grand babies ?
Freedom or indentured servitude ?

Eric Miller ’s career as an Army Ranger was n’t ended by a battlefield wound , but his DNA .
Lurking in his genes was a mutation that made him vulnerable to uncontrolled tumor growth .
After suffering back pain during a tour in Afghanistan , he underwent three surgeries to remove tumors from his brain and spine that left him with numbness throughout the left side of his body .
So began his journey into a dreaded scenario of the genetic age .
Because he was born with the mutation , the Army argued it bore no responsibility for his illness and medically discharged him in 2005 without the disability benefits or health insurance he needed to fight his disease .

“ The Army did n’t give me anything , ” said Miller , 28 , a seven - year veteran who is training to join the Tennessee Highway Patrol .
While genetic discrimination is banned in most cases throughout the country , it is alive and well in the U.S. military .
For more than 20 years , the armed forces have held a policy that specifically denies disability benefits to servicemen and women with congenital or hereditary conditions .
The practice would be illegal in almost any other workplace .
There is one exception , instituted in 1999 , that grants benefits to personnel who have served eight years .

“ You could be in the military and be a six - pack - a - day smoker , and if you come down with emphysema , ‘ That ’s OK .
We ’ve got you covered , ’ ” said Kathy Hudson , director of the Genetics and Public Policy Center at Johns Hopkins University .
“ But if you happen to have a disease where there is an identified genetic contribution , you are screwed . ”
Representatives from the Pentagon declined multiple requests to discuss the policy .
A high cost
The regulation appears to have stemmed from an effort to protect the armed services from becoming a magnet for people who knew they would come down with costly genetic illnesses , according to Dr. Mark Nunes , who headed the Air Force Genetics Center ’s DNA diagnostic laboratory at Keesler Air Force Base in Mississippi .
Advertisement
The threat is almost certainly small .
A 1999 military analysis estimated that about 250 service members are discharged each year for health problems involving a genetic component .
Disability payments for them would amount to $ 1.7 million the first year and rise each year after that as more veterans join the rolls .
Healthcare expenditures would have added to the tab .
“ Maybe they did n’t want to foot the bill for my disability , ” said Miller , whose rare genetic disease is called Von Hippel - Lindau syndrome .
“ It ’s saving money for them .
I ’m just one less soldier that they have to dish out compensation to . ”
But the cost for individuals medically discharged can be high .
While some eventually receive benefits from Veterans Affairs or private insurers , the policy leaves Miller and others scrambling to find treatment for complex medical conditions at the same time they are reestablishing their lives as civilians without having the benefit of Tricare , the military ’s health insurance .
“ It seems particularly draconian to say , ‘ Well , you ’re out with no benefits , ’ whereas another person with the same injury gets the coverage simply because we do n’t know there ’s a gene in there that ’s causing this , ” said Alex Capron , a professor who studies healthcare law , policy and ethics at USC .

The fear of genetic discrimination coincides with early efforts to decode the human genome more than 25 years ago .
It took no great insight to realize that a complete inventory of life ’s building blocks would not only revolutionize the practice of medicine , but also mark individuals whose genes put them at risk for myriad diseases .
Congress took action in 1996 , banning genetic discrimination in group health plans , and in 2000 , President Clinton signed an executive order forbidding the practice against the federal government ’s nearly 2 million civilian employees .
Similar laws against genetic discrimination swept through 31 states .
Congress is working to extend the federal law with the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act , which would protect people with individual medical policies .
The act has passed the House and awaits a vote in the Senate .

Even if it becomes law , it will not apply to military personnel .
The Defense Department ’s original policy did not consider genetics when determining whether a soldier deserved medical retirement , assuming that any disease discovered during service had been incurred in the line of duty .
There was little reason to consider genetic mutations , since few were known .
But by 1986 , as scientists associated more sections of DNA with particular diseases , the military declared that it was not responsible for soldiers with “ congenital and hereditary ” conditions .
At the urging of the National Human Genome Research Institute , the Defense Department proposed in 1999 that anyone who had served for 180 days be eligible for medical retirement , even if their health problem had a genetic component , said Barbara Fuller , assistant director for ethics at NHGRI , part of the National Institutes of Health .
Advertisement
But the Office of Management and Budget decided on the longer , 8 - year term to conform with other military health and retirement guidelines , according to an OMB official .
Some genetic discrimination is unavoidable given the demands of military service , said Nunes , now a geneticist at Ohio State University .
“ If you have achondroplasia -- if you ’re a dwarf -- you ’re not eligible for military service , ” he said .
“ If you have hereditary hearing loss , you ’re not eligible for military service .
If you have color blindness , you ’re not eligible to fly an airplane .
Obviously , there ’s genetic discrimination in the military , for good reason . ”
But Nunes said the armed forces ’ disability policy was flawed by a fundamental misunderstanding about the biology of inherited diseases .

Only in a few cases , such as Huntington ’s disease , does a specific mutation in a particular stretch of DNA guarantee the onset of illness .
In most cases , a faulty gene increases an individual ’s risk of developing a disease , but does not ensure it .
Typically , an external event is necessary to trigger the onset of a medical condition .
Such was the case with an Army helicopter gunship pilot who was reassigned to desk duty after she became too pregnant to fly .
Dr. Melissa Fries , an Air Force geneticist who became involved in the case , said the pilot developed a blood clot in her leg -- a typical complication of pregnancy that is exacerbated by inactivity .
Advertisement
She was diagnosed with chronic thrombophlebitis , a condition that disqualified her from flying .
The pilot , who declined to discuss her case , decided to retire from the Army .
As part of her medical work - up , doctors discovered she had a genetic mutation for Factor V Leiden , which is found in 5 % of Caucasians and increases their risk of developing blood clots .
An Army physical evaluation board , which determines disability benefits , denied her claim because of the mutation .
Her military doctors were stunned since her thrombophlebitis was probably caused by her pregnancy and desk job .
They downplayed the role of her mutation because 99 % of Factor V Leiden carriers never develop blood clots .
Advertisement
Testing discouraged
Military doctors now discourage their patients from getting potentially life - saving genetic tests , undermining their ability to provide top - notch care .
“ If someone called me up with regard to genetic testing , I had to say , ‘ That might not be something you want to pursue , ’ ” Nunes said .
“ That ’s very hard to say . ”
In her 26 years in the Air Force , Fries said she often dissuaded women from getting tested for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations that dramatically increase their risk of developing breast cancer .
Advertisement
She recalled counseling a 22 - year - old soldier whose father had just been diagnosed with Huntington ’s disease .
The soldier had 50 - 50 odds of developing the disease .
A neurologist at Walter Reed Army Medical Center ordered a genetic test for Huntington ’s , and it turned up positive .
“ He was discharged from the military on the basis of the Huntington ’s disease gene even though , at that level of gene expansion , there was expected to be another 25 years before he would display any symptoms , ” said Fries , now director of genetics and fetal medicine at Washington Hospital Center in Washington , D.C .
For many in the military , the best course is to simply refuse all genetic tests , even though they may be needed for an accurate diagnosis , she said .
Advertisement
Getting genetic tests through civilian channels is not an option because it would violate the uniform code of military justice .
“ You could get court - martialed if it were revealed that you had sought medical treatment or testing outside the system , ” Nunes said .
Most soldiers have no idea about the genetic rule , much less have a reason to challenge it .
For those who choose to fight , it can be arduous process .
No one contested the policy until Marine Gunnery Sgt. Jay Platt did in 1998 .
Advertisement
Platt had lost an eye and a testicle to Von Hippel - Lindau syndrome before doctors told him he had a malignant tumor in his left kidney and four benign tumors on his brain .
He knew his 15 - year Marine career was over .
“ If you want to go ahead and medically retire me , I ’m not going to fight it , ” he told his doctors .
But the Marines refused .
Instead , he was medically discharged without any benefits because his genetic disease was a preexisting condition .
A discharge have would cut Platt off from Tricare , which allows members to seek care from a large network of providers , just like a civilian HMO .
Advertisement
“ That was my biggest thing , ” he said .
“ I needed to have treatments for the rest of my life . ”
With the help experts from NHGRI , Platt appealed his case to an physical evaluation board .
His doctors said that although the mutation predisposed him to Von Hippel - Lindau syndrome , some aspect of his service -- such as repeated exposure to the solvents used to clean weapons -- could have triggered the tumors .
Platt ultimately won his case and was granted disability payments of about $ 2,000 a month .
He now travels the country as a motivational speaker talking about his fight against his disease .
The helicopter pilot with the Factor V Leiden mutation also appealed her case , going all the way to the Army surgeon general to win a medical retirement .
Advertisement
But Miller , the Army ranger , did not fare so well .
Even though he had the same disease as Platt , he lost his appeal and was discharged without benefits in 2005 .
He still has to monitor his slow - growing tumors and be on the lookout for new ones .
But without Tricare coverage , he can’t afford to see a civilian doctor close to his home in Oak Ridge , Tenn .
Instead , he travels an hour and a half to the Veterans Affairs facility in Johnson City at least twice a year .
Every so often , he makes the three - hour drive to another VA facility in Lexington , Ky. , to see a neurologist with expertise in his disease .
The worry never leaves him .
His genes guarantee that he will never be cured .

A scientific study of British students ' eating habits has found eating ham and cheese for breakfast can significantly improve cognitive functioning .
The study headed up by psychology professor David Benton of Wales ' Swansea University found the traditional German breakfast can aid in cognitive functions like memory and attention levels , The Sunday Times of London said .
" It is all down to the glucose release of the breakfast into the bloodstream .
The slower the release , the better the pupils performed , " Benton said of his study 's findings .
Benton 's group monitored the eating habits and cognitive performance of 6 - and 7 - year - olds to determine the effect of a well - balanced breakfast .
Benton 's group also found meals with slow - releasing glucose levels helped children stay physically fit and curbed obesity by limiting one 's appetite .
" The high protein in the breakfast will release into the system slowly , and therefore it will suppress the appetite for longer , and prevent children from snacking , " he told the newspaper .

A team of international researchers has collected the oldest ever recovered DNA samples and used them to show that Greenland was much warmer at some point during the last Ice Age than most people have believed .
The ancient DNA was discovered at the bottom of a two kilometer thick ice sheet and came from the trees , plants and insects of a boreal forest estimated to be between 450,000 and 900,000 years - old .
Previously , the youngest evidence of a boreal forest in Greenland was from 2.4 million years ago .
The results of the research were published today in the journal Science .
" These findings allow us to make a more accurate environmental reconstruction of the time period from which these samples were taken , and what we 've learned is that this part of the world was significantly warmer than most people thought , " said Martin Sharp , a glaciologist at the University of Alberta and a co-author of the paper .
Sharp said the silty ice found underneath the huge Greenland glacier created a perfect , natural " freezer " to preserve the prehistoric DNA .
Scientists have , in the past , found older organic matter , but they have not found any uncontaminated DNA that is as old or older than the Greenland samples .
Sharp and his PhD student Joel Barker contributed to the research by providing DNA samples from the silty ice of much younger glaciers ( 3,000 years - old ) on Ellesmere Island in Arctic Canada .
The Canadian DNA samples offered a control sample for the researchers around the world who worked to estimate the age of the Greenland DNA samples .
The work in Canada also contributed to the evidence that suggests the boreal forest DNA samples found in Greenland were from forests that grew where the samples were found and were not from plant matter carried by wind or water from forests elsewhere in the world .
The DNA samples suggest the temperature of the southern Greenland boreal forests 450,000 to 900,000 years - ago was probably between 10C in summer and - 17C in winter .
Also , the reduced glacier cover in that region means the global ocean was probably between one and two metres higher during that time compared to current levels .
Sharp , who has been a supporter of the idea that the current global warming trend is human induced , believes the new research offers evidence that climate warming on the current scale is possible through natural conditions .
However , he cautions that this research does not prove the current global warming trend is not human induced .
" It could mean that our current warming is the result of both natural processes and human influences , and we may be heading for even bigger temperature increases than we previously thought , " Sharp said .

Culinary GENIUS !
This , my friends , is my culinary epiphany .
Feast your eyes on this !
A cake ... with a t- bone drawn on it ?
Has our intrepid chefstress lost her mind ?
NO , my friends , NO ! because THIS .... is MEAT CAKE .
Okay , see , this bears some explanation .
A coworker is getting married next week , and we were talking about wedding cakes ( I had just done one for two friends of mine ) .
He asked if I could do one for him - totally joking of course .
" Oh , sure , what kind of chef are you that you can't pump out a wedding cake on just two weeks notice ? ? "
He went on to describe his ultimate wedding cake .
" I hate that wedding cakes are all girly .
There should be like a groom cake to go with the traditional wedding cake .
A guy 's cake .
Like .. made out of meat . "
A lightbulb went off in my mind .
" I could TOTALLY do that , " I exclaimed .
" A meatloaf !
With mashed potato frosting !
OH MY GOD ! " " Yeah ! "
He was catching on .
" And like , gravy between the layers and melted cheese for the writing ! " " Hmmmm .
No , ketchup glaze , " I decided .
" I am so totally going to do this , " I suddenly realized .
So today I did .
Here 's how it went down :
The first thing I needed was the meatloaf .
I make a pretty yummy meatloaf , but I never make it the same way twice .
I knew I needed a dryer meatloaf , so I would need a lot of breadcrumbs .
Into a bowl , I mixed :
6 # hamburger , 80 % lean
3 large AA eggs
2 TB minced garlic
1 TB minced dried onion
1 TB basil
2c bread crumbs
2 TB kosher salt
I knew there was going to be a lot of fat left in the pans , and I am lazy , so I used disposable cake tins .
Three 8 inch rounds .
There would n't be as much fat if I 'd used leaner meat , but the grocery store did n't have any leaner meat in chubs , and I did n't want to spend a million dollars on this anyway .
Next time I 'll cut the beef with something a little leaner , or maybe bigger chunks of bread .
I was n't too concerned about it , since this was only the trial run to see if this idea is even worthy .
I evenly distributed the meat into the cake tins .
And then into the 400 degree oven until they reached an internal temperature of 170 degrees , which was about 45 minutes .
I glazed two of them after about 20 minutes , but this was an act of sheer optimism , as there was a better than average chance I was going to have to cut the tops off anyway , to level them .
It would n't do at ALL to have them bathing in yukky grease once they were out , so I pulled them out of the tins right away and let them cool on draining racks .
Yep , glazing was too optimistic .
The meatloaf bound up a little tighter than I would have liked - I think next time I would go with three cups of bread crumbs instead of two .
I watched an episode of Good Eats while I waited for them to cool , and thanks to Alton , I really wanted wontons .
Like any cake , it needed to be leveled .
I was n't too worried about accuracy here , but I carved off a nice level slice from each layer .
They steamed up when I leveled them , so I ate a quick lunch of meatloaf scraps while they cooled down some more .
Needed a little salt , but my meatloaf is still very tasty .
This time Alton taught me about vinegar .
I stacked the layers and cut off the edges , to get some semblance of roundness .
More scraps for dinner , I foresee .
Again , I 'm not really worried about making it perfect , because I can buy a lot of forgiveness with icing .
I mean potatoes .
( pardon me , I 've got to go check on my green tea melon sorbet ) ( back .
It 's not ready yet , but my raspberry ginger sorbet is hardened and it is delicious and I 'm eating some . )
So many scraps for dinner ! mmmmm .
I am going to stack them on my prettiest paper round .
Hee hee hee .
I whipped up a little more glaze to put between the layers .
For glaze , I use Worcestershire sauce ( pronounce the city ' worcestershire ' " wuss - tuh - shuh " ( with hard , english vowel sounds ) .
' worcester ' is " wuss - tuh " .
the stress goes on the first syllable in both .
Do n't be wrong .
You do n't pronounce the 'ce ' , like you do n't call Gloucester ' glao - che - ster ' ACK BRAIN FREEZE DAMN YOU , GINGER SORBET ! ok .
Sorry. ' gloucester ' and ' gloucestershire ' are pronounced " gloss - tuh " and " gloss - tuh - shuh " respectively .
or wuss - stur - sher , but the sauce is pronounced " wuhsher " .
Yeah .
I 've had a LOT of emails about this .
It 's very strange .
A lot of them contradict each other .
say it right .
the end . ) , brown sugar , and ketchup .
This is the only time I ever eat ketchup on purpose , because ketchup is vinegary , salty tomato blood and it is gross .
True culinary fact .
I use 1 tsp of wooshereshtir sauce , 1 / 4 c of brown sugar , and 1 c of ketchup , roughly .
It 's like my meatloaf .
I do n't usually make it the same way twice .
I generally brush it on while it bakes , so the sugar caramelizes to deliciousness , but I am just using the raw deal here .
And now I spread it between the layers .
The weight of the next layer is going to push on it , so I do n't spread the glaze all the way to the edges .
I 'm being extra careful here , since I do n't want the ketchup bleeding into the mashed potatoes when I spread them on .
When I fill a cake with the same frosting that 's going on the outside , I 'm not so careful about it , but in cases like this , I do n't want to contaminate the outer appearance at all .
And now the frosting !
Yeah , I 'm cheating and using potato flakes - but for a specific reason .
I like my real mashed potatoes with the skin in and lumpy as hell , so you can tell that it used to be a potato , but consistency is key here .
I 'm using potato flakes for smoothness and uniformity that I can't really get with real potatoes without killing my whip attachment .
Yes , I * have * heard of a potato ricer , but I do n't have one .
And the ingredients for this alone cost me $ 40 , so I was n't about to invest some money on a ricer that I 'm only going to use for this .
And this is just a test cake anyway .
Nyah .
Yes .
I 'm cheating .
And lazy .
MMmmm potato flakes .
Is it buttercream ?
Is it mashed potatoes ?
hm .
Hard to tell !
And THAT , my friends , is the whole very point .
And now for the crumb coat !
A very thin layer of potatoes is applied to give the cake shape , and to seal in the meaty crumbs and glaze that escaped .
If this were a cake , I 'd have frozen it for a little while before doing the actual frosting .. .. But it 's not a real cake !
HA -HA !
So I 'm plowing ahead and smothering it with potatoey goodness .
It 's at about this stage I started giggling at how well my plan was working .
Holy hell , this looked like a cake .
A real , proper cake !
I am a GENIUS !
And now for the delicate touches .
A spirally border with accents of glaze and a T - bone on top .
I 've never drawn a T - bone steak before .
It did n't come out too bad , though there is a definite uterusy quality to it .
And the brilliant part of this , is that mashed potatoes can be colored ( anyone who 's ever seen the movie Hook will testify ) .
So I could have decorated this just like any other cake in the world .
But the whole point of it is to be a Manly Man Cake , and hence the steak .
Next time , I 'll decorate it like a proper cake .
You can pipe the mashed potatoes as easily as frosting .
I also considered cutting some crispy bacon to be ' candles ' .
It tastes delicious .
I chilled it , sliced it , then served it warmed up from the microwave .
Cold meatloaf only belongs in sandwiches , not meat cake .
It came out as well as I hoped , and it 's received far more attention than I ever thought it would .
Holy cats , a lot of you have seen this !
I 've received a ton of email about it , and so far the worst people have had to say was ' ewww meatloaf ' .
I shrug at thee !
Meatloaf - when done properly - is delicious !
Unless you are not a meatatarian , in which case it maybe tastes like murder , but for us hardcore meatatarians , murder tastes like meat !
And meat is delicious !
And now I 'm going to go watch what Alton has to say about spices , while you look at my meatcake some more .
Bon apetit !
WHEE !
There is now a Meatcake Gallery !

" The book is not that interesting , as tales of desperation and survival are actually quite common . "
What do the public really think of literature ?
Here are some examples , in the form of reviews culled from the reader comments on Amazon.com .
1984 by George Orwell :
Caitlyn from Atlanta , GA , wrote : " 1984 is the worst book I have ever read .
I would advise anyone who is thinking about reading this book to reconcider !
George Orwell is not a bad writer , however , this book he does not do evry well on , as some of his others .
Prehaps he was getting old and lost his touch .
Animal Farm was okay , but 1984 was horrible .
It took him forever , it seemed like , to get into the accual book .
If someone were to take out all of the useless part of 1984 , it would be half as long .
Why would he wirte so much about nothing ?
I havent ever meet someone who could wirte such a boring book about the goverment .
I have meet many people who have loved this book , but i dispised it .
I am not at all intrested in the goverment .
This may be part of the reason that I didnt like it .
I would advise you not to read this book . "
One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez :
R. Vanderhoof wrote : " I spent several weeks slogging through this book and found it to be very repetitive and tedious in the extreme .
Keeping track of the family tree is a constant effort .
At best , Marquez reveals an egalitarian attitude that seems to pervade the Americas south of the Rio Grande ( no wonder those countries are in constant economic trouble ) .
Marquez should study supply side economics as described by Milton Friedman , another Nobel Prize winner , in order to give his book better balance . "
Brave New World by Aldous Huxley :
Ashley Lue wrote : " This was the worst book that I have ever read !
The way that Huxley wrote the book was awful .
He was writing about something that could never happen to our society .
Back then he thought that our world would pretty much go to hell and the book portrayed the world that we should be living in today .
Nothing that he said made sense .
I do n't understand why he would want anyone to live in that weird world that those people had to live in .
People should have emotions and actual relationships .
No one should be punished like that .
I advise you not to read this book , unless you want to fall asleep !! :) "
A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens :
goosedog 69 ( New York ) wrote : " if you do n't like reading books with way too much detail than do n't buy this book .
when i was reading it i could n't understand anything it said .
if you are older maybe you would n't think it 's boring , or if you like this author 's books , but i thought it was very boring and it took me forever and a half to read . "
A reader wrote : " I found this book difficult to follow and hard to hold my interest .
I am an English teacher so I do n't think it 's me .
I was revved about the book and started it immediately unpon receipt .
I did n't even finish it -- which is something I can say about few books ... "
The Naked and the Dead by Norman Mailer :
[ A — presumably — different ]
A reader wrote : " his book has potential but fails to deliver the goods .
too much time is invested for the pay off .
i hated the time machine sequences they were a total waste of time , eventually i just skiped them to help get the book over .
this is a shame because there were some very good parts to the book a good editor could have improved it by trimming a few hundred pages . "
Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare :
Son of Sammy wrote : " i just read this book .
everybody like always talks about how great it is and everything .
but i do n't think so .
like , it 's been done before , right ??
soooo cliched .
omg . "
The Quiet American by Graham Greene :
Jorge Frid ( in Mexico City ) wrote : " AT first you think that you are going to read about some secret agent in Vietnam that was killed , but when you see that the story of the book is not that man , is a journalist from England that does n't want to go back to his country you will be disappointed , the book does n't have any main story , it has the story of the journalist , his girlfriend ( who was also the girlfriend of the " secret agent " ) and many more , but you will not be interested in one story at all , a real waste of time this book . "
Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe :
Newton Ooi ( in Phoenix , AZ ) wrote : " If imitation is the highest form of praise , then this book must be one of the most praised books in the English canon .
A man from a middle - class upbringing leaves it and ends up stuck on a tropical island .
This story would inspire Swiss Family Robinson , Castaway , and probably Lord of the Flies .
Mr. Crusoe is a white , Englishman with a wife and kids .
After the wife dies , he leaves the kids to go on his own and to serve God .
He ends up stuck on an island by himself .
There he encounters cannibalistic natives , and one of their intended victims .
The former scares him , and he essentially enslaves the latter , teaching him to call him Master .
" The book is not that interesting , as tales of desperation and survival are actually quite common . "
Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy :
A reader wrote : " I love classic novels .
Some of my favorites :
Gone with the wind / The catcher in the rye / Huck Finn / The Iliad ..
I adore Shakespeare ... this book was B - O - R - I - N - G !!!
I stopped reading at 400 pages .
I am someone that almost never stops reading books .
I could n't stand it any longer .
I do n't mind the parts the were actually about Anna and human relationships .
I could not stand all of the boring Russian politic talk or Levin and his boring farming or hunting talk .
AHH !
I do not recommend this book .
If I truly hated someone , I would them to read this book . "
The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck :
Jef4Jesus wrote : " So , I 'm only on page 478 of 619 , but I 've been disgusted at the amount of profanity .
So far I 've found more than 500 uses of profanity !
On average every page ( with relatively big writing , even ) has more than one swear .
Yikes !
I 'm never going to read Grapes of Wrath again , and wo n't be recommending it to anyone .
If you do n't like profanity , be careful . "
M. Landis wrote : " This book was 600 pages written purly about a bunch of hicks from Oklahoma starving .
Thanks , but no thanks . "

Halfway through the twentieth century , the historian Richard Hofstadter , in his book The American Political Tradition , examined our important national leaders , from Jefferson and Jackson to Herbert Hoover and the two Roosevelts — Republicans and Democrats , liberals and conservatives .
Hofstadter concluded that " the range of vision embraced by the primary contestants in the major parties has always been bounded by the horizons of property and enterprise .
. ..
They have accepted the economic virtues of capitalist culture as necessary qualities of man .
. . .
That culture has been intensely nationalistic ... "
Coming to the end of the century , observing its last twenty - five years , we have seen exactly that limited vision Hofstadter talked about — a capitalistic encouragement of enormous fortunes alongside desperate poverty , a nationalistic acceptance of war and preparations for war .
Governmental power swung from Republicans to Democrats and back again , but neither party showed itself capable of going beyond that vision .
After the disastrous war in Vietnam came the scandals of Watergate .
There was a deepening economic insecurity for much of the population , along with environmental deterioration , and a growing culture of violence and family disarray .
Clearly , such fundamental problems could not be solved without bold changes in the social and economic structure .
But no major party candidates proposed such changes .
The " American political tradition " held fast .
In recognition of this , perhaps only vaguely conscious of this , voters stayed away from the polls in large numbers , or voted without enthusiasm .
More and more they declared , if only by nonparticipation , their alienation from the political system .
In 1960 , 63 percent of those eligible to vote voted in the presidential election .
By 1976 , this figure had dropped to 53 percent .
In a CBS News and New York Times survey , over half of the respondents said that public officials did n't care about people like them .
A typical response came from a plumber : " The President of the United States is n't going to solve our problems .
The problems are too big . "
There was a troubling incongruity in the society .
Electoral politics dominated the press and television screens , and the doings of presidents , members of Congress , Supreme Court justices , and other officials were treated as if they constituted the history of the country .
Yet there was something artificial in all this , something pumped up , a straining to persuade a skeptical public that this was all , that they must rest their hopes for the future in Washington politicians , none of whom were inspiring because it seemed that behind the bombast , the rhetoric , the promises , their major concern was their own political power .
The distance between politics and the people was reflected clearly in the culture .
In what was supposed to be the best of the media , uncontrolled by corporate interest - that is , in public television , the public was largely invisible .
On the leading political forum on public television , the nightly " MacNeil - Lehrer Report , " the public was uninvited , except as viewer of an endless parade of Congressmen , Senators , government bureaucrats , experts of various kinds .
On commercial radio , the usual narrow band of consensus , excluding fundamental criticism , was especially apparent .
In the mid-1980s , with Ronald Reagan as President , the " fairness doctrine " of the Federal Communications Commission , requiring air time for dissenting views , was eliminated .
By the 1990s , " talk radio " had perhaps 20 million listeners , treated to daily tirades from right - wing talk - show " hosts , " with left - wing guests uninvited .
A citizenry disillusioned with politics and with what pretended to be intelligent discussions of politics turned its attention ( or had its attention turned ) to entertainment , to gossip , to ten thousand schemes for self - help .
Those at its margins became violent , finding scapegoats within one 's group ( as with poor - black on poor - black violence ) , or against other races , immigrants , demonized foreigners , welfare mothers , minor criminals ( standing in for untouchable major criminals ) .
There were other citizens , those who tried to hold on to ideas and ideals still remembered from the sixties and early seventies , not just by recollecting but by acting .
Indeed , all across the country there was a part of the public unmentioned in the media , ignored by political leaders - energetically active in thousands of local groups around the country .
These organized groups were campaigning for environmental protection or women 's rights or decent health care ( including anguished concern about the horrors of AIDS ) or housing for the homeless , or against military spending .
This activism was unlike that of the sixties , when the surge of protest against race segregation and war became an overwhelming national force .
It struggled uphill , against callous political leaders , trying to reach fellow Americans most of whom saw little hope in either the politics of voting or the politics of protest .
The presidency of Jimmy Carter , covering the years 1977 to 1980 , seemed an attempt by one part of the Establishment , that represented in the Democratic party , to recapture a disillusioned citizenry .
But Carter , despite a few gestures toward black people and the poor , despite talk of " human rights " abroad , remained within the historic political boundaries of the American system , protecting corporate wealth and power , maintaining a huge military machine that drained the national wealth , allying the United States with right - wing tyrannies abroad .
Carter seemed to be the choice of that international group of powerful influence - wielders — the Trilateral Commission .
Two founding members of the commission , according to the Far Eastern Economic Review — David Rockefeller and Zbigniew Brzezinski — thought Carter was the right person for the presidential election of 1976 given that " the Watergate - plagued Republican Party was a sure loser ... "
Carter 's job as President , from the point of view of the Establishment , was to halt the rushing disappointment of the American people with the government , with the economic system , with disastrous military ventures abroad .
In his campaign , he tried to speak to the disillusioned and angry .
His strongest appeal was to blacks , whose rebellion in the late sixties was the most frightening challenge to authority since the labor and unemployed upsurges in the thirties .
His appeal was " populist " — that is , he appealed to various elements of American society who saw themselves beleaguered by the powerful and wealthy .
Although he himself was a millionaire peanut grower , he presented himself as an ordinary American farmer .
Although he had been a supporter of the Vietnam war until its end , he presented himself as a sympathizer with those who had been against the war , and he appealed to many of the young rebels of the sixties by his promise to cut the military budget .
In a much - publicized speech to lawyers , Carter spoke out against the use of the law to protect the rich .
He appointed a black woman , Patricia Harris , as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development , and a black civil rights veteran , Andrew Young , as ambassador to the United Nations .
He gave the job of heading the domestic youth service corps to a young former antiwar activist , Sam Brown .
His most crucial appointments , however , were in keeping with the Trilateral Commission report of Harvard political scientist Samuel Huntington , which said that , whatever groups voted for a president , once elected " what counts then is his ability to mobilize support from the leaders of key institutions . "
Brzezinski , a traditional cold war intellectual , became Carter 's National Security Adviser .
His Secretary of Defense , Harold Brown , had , during the Vietnam war , according to the Pentagon Papers , " envisaged the elimination of virtually all the constraints under which the bombing then operated . "
His Secretary of Energy , James Schlesinger , as Secretary of Defense under Nixon , was described by a member of the Washington press corps as showing " an almost missionary drive in seeking to reverse a downward trend in the defense budget . "
Schlesinger was also a strong proponent of nuclear energy .
His other cabinet appointees had strong corporate connections .
A financial writer wrote , not long after Carter 's election : " So far , Mr. Carter 's actions , commentary , and particularly his Cabinet appointments , have been highly reassuring to the business community . "
Veteran Washington correspondent Tom Wicker wrote : " The available evidence is that Mr. Carter so far is opting for Wall Street 's confidence . "
Carter did initiate more sophisticated policies toward governments that oppressed their own people .
He used United Nations Ambassador Andrew Young to build up good will for the United States among the black African nations , and urged that South Africa liberalize its policies toward blacks .
A peaceful settlement in South Africa was necessary for strategic reasons ; South Africa was used for radar tracking systems .
Also , it had important U.S. corporate investments and was a critical source of needed raw materials ( diamonds , especially ) .
Therefore , what the United States needed was a stable government in South Africa ; the continued oppression of blacks might create civil war .
The same approach was used in other countries — combining practical strategic needs with the advancement of civil rights .
But because the chief motivation was practicality , not humanity , there was a tendency toward token changes — as in Chile 's release of a few political prisoners .
When Congressman Herman Badillo introduced in Congress a proposal that required the U.S. representatives to the World Bank and other international financial institutions to vote against loans to countries that systematically violated essential rights , by the use of torture or imprisonment without trial , Carter sent a personal letter to every Congressman urging the defeat of this amendment .
It won a voice vote in the House , but lost in the Senate .
Under Carter , the United States continued to support , all over the world , regimes that engaged in imprisonment of dissenters , torture , and mass murder : in the Philippines , in Iran , in Nicaragua , and in Indonesia , where the inhabitants of East Timor were being annihilated in a campaign bordering on genocide .
The New Republic magazine , presumably on the liberal side of the Establishment , commented approvingly on the Carter policies : " . . .
American foreign policy in the next four years will essentially extend the philosophies developed ... in the Nixon - Ford years .
This is not at all a negative prospect ....
There should be continuity .
It is part of history .... "
Carter had presented himself as a friend of the movement against the war , but when Nixon mined Haiphong harbor and resumed bombing of North Vietnam in the spring of 1973 , Carter urged that " we give President Nixon our backing and support - whether or not we agree with specific decisions . "
Once elected , Carter declined to give aid to Vietnam for reconstruction , despite the fact that the land had been devastated by American bombing .
Asked about this at a press conference , Carter replied that there was no special obligation on the United States to do this because " the destruction was mutual . "
Considering that the United States had crossed half the globe with an enormous fleet of bombers and 2 million soldiers , and after eight years left a tiny nation with over a million dead and its land in ruins , this was an astounding statement .
One Establishment intention , perhaps , was that future generations see the war not as it appeared in the Defense Department 's own Pentagon Papers — as a ruthless attack on civilian populations for strategic military and economic interests — but as an unfortunate error .
Noam Chomsky , one of the leading antiwar intellectuals during the Vietnam period , looked in mid-1978 at how the history of the war was being presented in the major media and wrote that they were " destroying the historical record and supplanting it with a more comfortable story ... reducing ' lessons ' of the war to the socially neutral categories of error , ignorance , and cost . "
The Carter administration clearly was trying to end the disillusionment of the American people after the Vietnam war by following foreign policies more palatable , less obviously aggressive .
Hence , the emphasis on " human rights , " the pressure on South Africa and Chile to liberalize their policies .
But on close examination , these more liberal policies were designed to leave intact the power and influence of the American military and American business in the world .
The renegotiation of the Panama Canal treaty with the tiny Central American republic of Panama was an example .
The canal saved American companies $ 1.5 billion a year in delivery costs , and the United States collected $ 150 million a year in tolls , out of which it paid the Panama government $ 2.3 million dollars , while maintaining fourteen military bases in the area .
Back in 1903 the United States had engineered a revolution against Colombia , set up the new tiny republic of Panama in Central America , and dictated a treaty giving the United States military bases , control of the Panama Canal , and sovereignty " in perpetuity . "
The Carter administration in 1977 , responding to anti-American protests in Panama , decided to renegotiate the treaty .
The New York Times was candid about the Canal : " We stole it , and removed the incriminating evidence from our history books . "
By 1977 the canal had lost military importance .
It could not accommodate large tankers or aircraft carriers .
That , plus the anti-American riots in Panama , led the Carter administration , over conservative opposition , to negotiate a new treaty which called for a gradual removal of U.S. bases ( which could easily be relocated elsewhere in the area ) .
The canal 's legal ownership would be turned over to Panama after a period .
The treaty also contained vague language which could be the basis for American military intervention under certain conditions .
Whatever Carter 's sophistication in foreign policy , certain fundamentals operated in the late sixties and the seventies .
American corporations were active all over the world on a scale never seen before .
There were , by the early seventies , about three hundred U.S. corporations , including the seven largest banks , which earned 40 percent of their net profits outside the United States .
They were called " multinationals , " but actually 98 percent of their top executives were Americans .
As a group , they now constituted the third - largest economy in the world , next to the United States and the Soviet Union .
The relationship of these global corporations with the poorer countries had long been an exploiting one , it was clear from U.S. Department of Commerce figures .
Whereas U.S. corporations in Europe between 1950 and 1965 invested $ 8.1 billion and made $ 5.5 billion in profits , in Latin America they invested $ 3.8 billion and made $ 11.2 billion in profits , and in Africa they invested $ 5.2 billion and made $ 14.3 billion in profits .
It was the classical imperial situation , where the places with natural wealth became victims of more powerful nations whose power came from that seized wealth .
American corporations depended on the poorer countries for 100 percent of their diamonds , coffee , platinum , mercury , natural rubber , and cobalt .
They got 98 percent of their manganese from abroad , 90 percent of their chrome and aluminum .
And 20 to 40 percent of certain imports ( platinum , mercury , cobalt , chrome , manganese ) came from Africa .
Another fundamental of foreign policy , whether Democrats or Republicans were in the White House , was the training of foreign military officers .
The Army had a " School of the Americas " in the Canal Zone , from which thousands of military leaders in Latin America had graduated .
Six of the graduates , for instance , were in the Chilean military junta that overthrew the democratically elected Allende government in 1973 .
The American commandant of the school told a reporter : " We keep in touch with our graduates and they keep in touch with us . "
And yet the United States cultivated a reputation for being generous with its riches .
Indeed , it had frequently given aid to disaster victims .
This aid , however , often depended on political loyalty .
In one six - year drought in West Africa , 100,000 Africans died of starvation .
A report by the Carnegie Endowment said the Agency for International Development ( AID ) of the United States had been inefficient and neglectful in giving aid to nomads in the Sahel area of West Africa , an area covering six countries .
The response of AID was that those countries had " no close historical , economic , or political ties to the United States . "
In early 1975 the press carried a dispatch from Washington : " Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger has formally initiated a policy of selecting for cutbacks in American aid those nations that have sided against the U.S. in votes in the United Nations .
In some cases the cutbacks involve food and humanitarian relief . "
Most aid was openly military , and by 1975 , the United States exported $ 9.5 billion in arms .
The Carter administration promised to end the sale of arms to repressive regimes , but when it took office the bulk of the sales continued .
And the military continued to take a huge share of the national budget .
When Carter was running for election , he told the Democratic Platform Committee : " Without endangering the defense of our nation or commitments to our allies , we can reduce present defense expenditures by about 5 to 7 billion dollars annually . "
But his first budget proposed not a decrease but an increase of $ 10 billion for the military .
Indeed , he proposed that the U.S. spend a thousand billion dollars ( a trillion dollars ) in the next five years on its military forces .
And the administration had just announced that the Department of Agriculture would save $ 25 million a year by no longer giving free second helpings of milk to 1.4 million needy schoolchildren who got free meals in school .
If Carter 's job was to restore faith in the system , here was his greatest failure — solving the economic problems of the people .
The price of food and the necessities of life continued to rise faster than wages were rising .
Unemployment remained officially at 6 or 8 percent ; unofficially , the rates were higher .
For certain key groups in the population — young people , and especially young black people — the unemployment rate was 20 or 30 percent .
It soon became clear that blacks in the United States , the group most in support of Carter for President , were bitterly disappointed with his policies .
He opposed federal aid to poor people who needed abortions , and when it was pointed out to him that this was unfair , because rich women could get abortions with ease , he replied : " Well , as you know , there are many things in life that are not fair , that wealthy people can afford and poor people cannot . "
Carter 's " populism " was not visible in his administration 's relationship to the oil and gas interests .
It was part of Carter 's " energy plan " to end price regulation of natural gas for the consumer .
The largest producer of natural gas was Exxon Corporation , and the largest blocs of private stock in Exxon were owned by the Rockefeller family .
Early in Carter 's administration , the Federal Energy Administration found that Gulf Oil Corporation had overstated by $ 79.1 million its costs for crude oil obtained from foreign affiliates .
It then passed on these false costs to consumers .
In the summer of 1978 the administration announced that " a compromise " had been made with Gulf Oil in which Gulf agreed to pay back $ 42.2 million .
Gulf informed its stockholders that " the payments will not affect earnings since adequate provision was made in prior years . "
The lawyer for the Energy Department who worked out the compromise with Gulf said it had been done to avoid a lengthy and costly lawsuit .
Would the lawsuit have cost the $ 36.9 million dropped in the compromise ?
Would the government have considered letting off a bank robber without a jail term in return for half the loot ?
The settlement was a perfect example of what Carter had told a meeting of lawyers during his presidential campaign — that the law was on the side of the rich .
The fundamental facts of maldistribution of wealth in America were clearly not going to be affected by Carter 's policies , any more than by previous administrations , whether conservative or liberal .
According to Andrew Zimbalist , an American economist writing in Le Monde Diplomatique in 1977 , the top 10 percent of the American population had an income thirty times that of the bottom tenth ; the top 1 percent of the nation owned 33 percent of the wealth .
The richest 5 percent owned 83 percent of the personally owned corporate stock .
The one hundred largest corporations ( despite the graduated income tax that misled people into thinking the very rich paid at least 50 percent in taxes ) paid an average of 26.9 percent in taxes , and the leading oil companies paid 5.8 percent in taxes ( Internal Revenue Service figures for 1974 ) .
Indeed , 244 individuals who earned over $ 200,000 paid no taxes .
In 1979 , as Carter weakly proposed benefits for the poor , and Congress strongly turned them down , a black woman , Marian Wright Edelman , director of the Children 's Defense Fund in Washington , pointed to some facts .
One of every seven American children ( 10 million altogether ) had no known regular source of primary health care .
One of every three children under seventeen ( 18 million altogether ) had never seen a dentist .
In an article on the New York Times op - ed page , she wrote :
The Senate Budget Committee recently . .. knocked off $ 88 million from a modest $ 288 million Administration request to improve the program that screens and treats children 's health problems .
At the same time the Senate found $ 725 million to bail out Litton Industries and to hand to the Navy at least two destroyers ordered by the Shah of Iran .
Carter approved tax " reforms " which benefited mainly the corporations .
Economist Robert Lekachman , writing in The Nation , noted the sharp increase in corporate profits ( 44 percent ) in the last quarter of 1978 over the previous year 's last quarter .
He wrote : " Perhaps the President 's most outrageous act occurred last November when he signed into law an $ 18 billion tax reduction , the bulk of whose benefits accrue to affluent individuals and corporations . "
In 1979 , while the poor were taking cuts , the salary of the chairman of Exxon Oil was being raised to $ 830,000 a year and that of the chairman of Mobil Oil to over a million dollars a year .
That year , while Exxon 's net income rose 56 percent to more than $ 4 billion , three thousand small independent gasoline stations went out of business .
Carter made some efforts to hold onto social programs , but this was undermined by his very large military budgets .
Presumably , this was to guard against the Soviet Union , but when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979 , Carter could take only symbolic actions , like reinstituting the draft , or calling for a boycott of the 1980 Moscow Olympics .
On the other hand , American weaponry was used to support dictatorial regimes battling left - wing rebels abroad .
A report by the Carter administration to Congress in 1977 was blunt , saying that " a number of countries with deplorable records of human rights observance are also countries where we have important security and foreign policy interests . "
Thus , Carter asked Congress in the spring of 1980 for $ 5.7 million in credits for the military junta fighting off a peasant rebellion in El Salvador .
In the Philippines , after the 1978 National Assembly elections , President Ferdinand Marcos imprisoned ten of the twenty - one losing opposition candidates ; many prisoners were tortured , many civilians were killed .
Still , Carter urged Congress to give Marcos $ 300 million in military aid for the next five years .
In Nicaragua , the United States had helped maintain the Somoza dictatorship for decades .
Misreading the basic weakness of that regime , and the popularity of the revolution against it , the Carter administration continued its support for Somoza until close to the regime 's fall in 1979 .
In Iran , toward the end of 1978 , the long years of resentment against the Shah 's dictatorship culminated in mass demonstrations .
On September 8 , 1978 , hundreds of demonstrators were massacred by the Shah 's troops .
The next day , according to a UPI dispatch from Teheran , Carter affirmed his support for the Shah :
Troops opened fire on demonstrators against the Shah for the third straight day yesterday and President Jimmy Carter telephoned the royal palace to express support for Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlevi , who faced the worst crisis of his 37 - year reign .
Nine members of parliament walked out on a speech by Iran 's new premier , shouting that his hands were " stained with blood " in the crackdown on conservative Moslems and other protesters .
On December 13 , 1978 , Nicholas Gage reported for the New York Times :
The staff of the United States Embassy here has been bolstered by dozens of specialists flown in to back an effort to help the Shah against a growing challenge to his rule according to embassy sources .. . .
The new arrivals , according to the embassy sources , include a number of Central Intelligence Agency specialists on Iran , in addition to diplomats and military personnel .
In early 1979 , as the crisis in Iran was intensifying , the former chief analyst on Iran for the CIA told New York Times reporter Seymour Hersh that " he and his colleagues knew of the tortures of Iranian dissenters by Savaki , the Iranian secret police set up during the late 1950s by the Shah with help from the CIA . "
Furthermore , he told Hersh that a senior CIA official was involved in instructing officials in Savaki on torture techniques .
It was a popular , massive revolution , and the Shah fled .
The Carter administration later accepted him into the country , presumably for medical treatment , and the anti-American feelings of the revolutionaries reached a high point .
On November 4 , 1979 , the U.S. embassy in Teheran was taken over by student militants who , demanding that the Shah be returned to Iran for punishment , held fifty - two embassy employees hostage .
For the next fourteen months , with the hostages still held in the embassy compound , that issue took the forefront of foreign news in the United States and aroused powerful nationalist feelings , When Carter ordered the Immigration and Naturalization Service to start deportation proceedings against Iranian students who lacked valid visas , the New York Times gave cautious but clear approval .
Politicians and the press played into a general hysteria .
An Iranian - American girl who was slated to give a high school commencement address was removed from the program .
The bumper sticker " Bomb Iran " appeared on autos all over the country .
It was a rare journalist bold enough to point out , as Alan Richman of the Boston Globe did when the fifty - two hostages were released alive and apparently well , that there was a certain lack of proportion in American reactions to this and other violations of human rights : " There were 52 of them , a number easy to comprehend .
It was n't like 15,000 innocent people permanently disappearing in Argentina ....
They [ the American hostages ] spoke our language .
There were 3000 people summarily shot in Guatemala last year who did not . "
The hostages were still in captivity when Jimmy Carter faced Ronald Reagan in the election of 1980 .
That fact , and the economic distress felt by many , were largely responsible for Carter 's defeat .
Reagan 's victory , followed eight years later by the election of George Bush , meant that another part of the Establishment , lacking even the faint liberalism of the Carter presidency , would be in charge .
The policies would be more crass — cutting benefits to poor people , lowering taxes for the wealthy , increasing the military budget , filling the federal court system with conservative judges , actively working to destroy revolutionary movements in the Caribbean .
The dozen years of the Reagan - Bush presidency transformed the federal judiciary , never more than moderately liberal , into a predominantly conservative institution .
By the fall of 1991 , Reagan and Bush had filled more than half of the 837 federal judgeships , and appointed enough right - wing justices to transform the Supreme Court .
In the seventies , with liberal justices William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall in the lead , the Court had declared death penalties unconstitutional , had supported ( in Roe v. Wade ) the right of women to choose abortions , and had interpreted the civil rights law as permitting special attention to blacks and women to make up for past discrimination ( affirmative action ) .
William Rehnquist , first named to the Supreme Court by Richard Nixon , was made Chief Justice by Ronald Reagan .
In the Reagan - Bush years , the Rehnquist Court made a series of decisions that weakened Roe v.
Wade , brought back the death penalty , reduced the rights of detainees against police powers , prevented doctors in federally supported family planning clinics from giving women information on abortions , and said that poor people could be forced to pay for public education ( education was not " a fundamental right " ) .
Justices William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall were the last of the Court 's liberals .
Old and ill , though reluctant to give up the fight , they retired .
The final act to create a conservative Supreme Court was President Bush 's nomination to replace Marshall .
He chose a black conservative , Clarence Thomas .
Despite dramatic testimony from a former colleague , a young black law professor named Anita Hill , that Thomas had sexually harassed her , Thomas was approved by the Senate and now the Supreme Court moved even more decisively to the right .
With conservative federal judges , with pro-business appointments to the National Labor Relations Board , judicial decisions and board findings weakened a labor movement already troubled by a decline in manufacturing .
Workers who went out on strike found themselves with no legal protection .
One of the first acts of the Reagan administration was to dismiss from their jobs , en masse , striking air traffic controllers .
It was a warning to future strikers , and a sign of the weakness of a labor movement which in the thirties and forties had been a powerful force .
Corporate America became the greatest beneficiary of the Reagan - Bush years .
In the sixties and seventies an important environmental movement had grown in the nation , horrified at the poisoning of the air , the seas and rivers , and the deaths of thousands each year as a result of work conditions .
After a mine explosion in West Virginia killed seventy - eight miners in November 1968 there had been angry protest in the mine district , and Congress passed the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 .
Nixon 's Secretary of Labor spoke of " a new national passion , passion for environmental improvement . "
The following year , yielding to strong demands from the labor movement and consumer groups , but also seeing it as an opportunity to win the support of working - class voters , President Nixon had signed the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 .
This was an important piece of legislation , establishing a universal right to a safe and healthy workplace , and creating an enforcement machinery .
Reflecting on this years later , Herbert Stein , who had been the chairman of Nixon 's Council of Economic Advisers , lamented that " the juggernaut of environmental regulation proved not to be controllable by the Nixon administration . "
While President Jimmy Carter came into office praising the OSHA program , he was also eager to please the business community .
The woman he appointed to head OSHA , Eula Bingham , fought for strong enforcement of the act , and was occasionally successful .
But as the American economy showed signs of trouble , with oil prices , inflation , and unemployment rising , Carter seemed more and more concerned about the difficulties the act created for business .
He became an advocate of removing regulations on corporations and giving them more leeway , even if this was hurtful to labor and to consumers .
Environmental regulation became more and more a victim of " cost - benefit " analysis , in which regulations protecting the health and safety of the public became secondary to how costly this would be for business .
Under Reagan and Bush this concern for " the economy , " which was a short - hand term for corporate profit , dominated any concern for workers or consumers .
President Reagan proposed to replace tough enforcement of environmental laws by a " voluntary " approach , leaving it to businesses to decide for themselves what they would do .
He appointed as head of OSHA a businessman who was hostile to OSHA 's aims .
One of his first acts was to order the destruction of 100,000 government booklets pointing out the dangers of cotton dust to textile workers .
Political scientist William Grover ( The President as Prisoner ) , evaluating environmental policy under Carter and Reagan as part of his penetrating " structural critique " of both presidents , concluded :
OSHA appears caught in a cycle of liberal presidents — who want to retain some health and safely regulatory programs , but who also need economic growth for political survival — and conservative presidents , who focus almost exclusively on the growth side of the equation .
Such a cycle will always tend to subordinate the need for safe and healthful workplaces to ... ensuring that commitment to OSHA will only be as strong as the priorities of business will allow .
George Bush presented himself as the " environmental president , " and pointed with pride to his signing of the Clean Air Act of 1990 .
But two years after that act was passed , it was seriously weakened by a new rule of the Environmental Protection Agency that allowed manufacturers to increase by 245 tons a year hazardous pollutants in the atmosphere .
Furthermore , little money was allocated for enforcement .
Contaminated drinking water had caused over 100,000 illnesses between 1971 and 1985 , according to an EPA report .
But in Bush 's first year in office , while the EPA received 80,000 complaints of contaminated drinking water , only one in a hundred was investigated .
And in 1991 and 1992 , according to a private environmental group , the National Resources Defense Council , there were some 250,000 violations of the Safe Water Drinking Act ( which had been passed during the Nixon administration ) .
Shortly after Bush took office , a government scientist prepared testimony for a Congressional committee on the dangerous effects of industrial uses of coal and other fossil fuels in contributing to " global warming , " a depletion of the earth 's protective ozone layer .
The White House changed the testimony , over the scientist 's objections , to minimize the danger ( Boston Globe , October 29 , 1990 ) .
Again , business worries about regulation seemed to override the safety of the public .
The ecological crisis in the world had become so obviously serious that Pope John Paul II felt the need to rebuke the wealthy classes of the industrialized nations for creating that crisis : " Today , the dramatic threat of ecological breakdown is teaching us the extent to which greed and selfishness , both individual and collective , are contrary to the order of creation . "
At international conferences to deal with the perils of global warming , the European Community and Japan proposed specific levels and timetables for carbon dioxide emissions , in which the United States was the leading culprit .
But , as the New York Times reported in the summer of 1991 , " the Bush Administration fears that ... it would hurt the nation 's economy in the short term for no demonstrable long - term climatic benefit . "
Scientific opinion was quite clear on the long - term benefit , but this was not as important as " the economy " - that is , the needs of corporations .
Evidence became stronger by the late eighties that renewable energy sources ( water , wind , sunlight ) could produce more usable energy than nuclear plants , which were dangerous and expensive , and produced radioactive wastes that could not be safely disposed of .
Yet the Reagan and Bush administrations made deep cuts ( under Reagan , a 90 percent cut ) in research into renewable energy possibilities .
In June 1992 more than a hundred countries participated in the Earth Summit environmental conference in Brazil .
Statistics showed that the armed forces of the world were responsible for two - thirds of the gases that depleted the ozone layer .
But when it was suggested that the Earth Summit consider the effects of the military on environmental degradation , the United States delegation objected and the suggestion was defeated .
Indeed , the preservation of a huge military establishment and the retention of profit levels of oil corporations appeared to be twin objectives of the Reagan - Bush administrations .
Shortly after Ronald Reagan took office , twenty - three oil industry executives contributed $ 270,000 to redecorate the White House living quarters .
According to the Associated Press :
The solicitation drive . . . came four weeks after the President decontrolled oil prices , a decision worth $ 2 billion to the oil industry . .. Jack Hodges of Oklahoma City , owner of Core Oil and Gas Company , said : " The top man of this country ought to live in one of the top places .
Mr. Reagan has helped the energy business . "
While he built up the military ( allocations of over a trillion dollars in his first four years in office ) , Reagan tried to pay for this with cuts in benefits for the poor .
There would be $ 140 billion of cuts in social programs through 1984 and an increase of $ 181 billion for " defense " in the same period .
He also proposed tax cuts of $ 190 billion ( most of this going to the wealthy ) .
Despite the tax cuts and the military appropriations , Reagan insisted he would still balance the budget because the tax cuts would so stimulate the economy as to generate new revenue .
Nobel Prize - winning economist Wassily Leontief remarked dryly : " This is not likely to happen .
In fact , I personally guarantee that it will not happen . "
Indeed , Department of Commerce figures showed that periods of lowered corporate taxes ( 1973 - 1975 , 1979 - 1982 ) did not at all show higher capital investment , but a steep drop .
The sharpest rise of capital investment ( 1975 - 1979 ) took place when corporate taxes were slightly higher than they had been the preceding five years .
The human consequences of Reagan 's budget cuts went deep .
For instance , Social Security disability benefits were terminated for 350,000 people .
A man injured in an oil field accident was forced to go back to work , the federal government overruling both the company doctor and a state supervisor who testified that he was too disabled to work .
The man died , and federal officials said , " We have a P.R. problem . "
A war hero of Vietnam , Roy Benavidez , who had been presented with the Congressional Medal of Honor by Reagan , was told by Social Security officials that the shrapnel pieces in his heart , arms , and leg did not prevent him from working .
Appearing before a Congressional committee , he denounced Reagan .
Unemployment grew in the Reagan years .
In the year 1982 , 30 million people were unemployed all or part of the year .
One result was that over 16 million Americans lost medical insurance , which was often tied to holding a job .
In Michigan , where the unemployment rate was the highest in the country , the infant death rate began to rise in 1981 .
New requirements eliminated free school lunches for more than one million poor children , who depended on the meal for as much as half of their daily nutrition .
Millions of children entered the ranks of the officially declared " poor " and soon a quarter of the nation 's children — twelve million — were living in poverty .
In parts of Detroit , one - third of the children were dying before their first birthday , and the New York Times commented : " Given what 's happening to the hungry in America , this Administration has cause only for shame . "
Welfare became an object of attack : aid to single mothers with children through the AFDC { Aid to Families with Dependent Children ) program , food stamps , health care for the poor through Medicaid .
For most people on welfare ( the benefits differed from state to state ) this meant $ 500 to $ 700 a month in aid , leaving them well below the poverty level of about $ 900 a month .
Black children were four times as likely as white children to grow up on welfare .
Early in the Reagan administration , responding to the argument that government aid was not needed , that private enterprise would take care of poverty , a mother wrote to her local newspaper :
I am on Aid to Families with Dependent Children , and both my children are in school .
... I have graduated from college with distinction , 128th in a class of over 1000 , with a B.A. in English and sociology .
I have experience in library work , child care , social work and counseling .
I have been to the CETA office .
They have nothing for me ....
I also go every week to the library to scour the newspaper Help Wanted ads .
I have kept a copy of every cover letter that I have sent out with my resume ; the stack is inches thick .
I have applied for jobs paying as little as $ 8000 a year .
I work part - time in a library for $ 3.50 an hour , welfare reduces my allotment to compensate .
. ..
It appears we have employment offices that can't employ , governments that can't govern and an economic system that can't produce jobs for people ready to work .. . .
Last week I sold my bed to pay for the insurance on my car , which , in the absence of mass transportation , I need to go job hunting .
I sleep on a piece of rubber foam somebody gave me .
So this is the great American dream my parents came to this country for :
Work hard , get a good education , follow the rules , and you will be rich .
I do n't want to be rich .
I just want to be able to feed my children and live with some semblance of dignity .. . . "
Democrats often joined Republicans in denouncing welfare programs .
Presumably , this was done to gain political support from a middle - class public that believed they were paying taxes to support teenage mothers and people they thought too lazy to work .
Much of the public did not know , and were not informed by either political leaders or the media , that welfare took a tiny part of the taxes , and military spending took a huge chunk of it .
Yet , the public 's attitude on welfare was different from that of the two major parties .
It seemed that the constant attacks on welfare by politicians , reported endlessly in the press and on television , did not succeed in eradicating a fundamental generosity felt by most Americans .
A New York Times / CBS
News poll conducted in early 1992 showed that public opinion on welfare changed depending on how the question was worded .
If the word " welfare " was used , 44 percent of those questioned said too much was being spent on welfare ( while 50 percent said either that the right amount was being spent , or that too little was being spent .
But when the question was about " assistance to the poor , " only 13 percent thought too much was being spent , and 64 percent thought too little was being spent .
This suggested that both parties were trying to manufacture an anti-human - needs mood by constant derogatory use of the word " welfare , " and then to claim they were acting in response to public opinion .
The Democrats as well as the Republicans had strong connections to wealthy corporations .
Kevin Phillips , a Republican analyst of national politics , wrote in 1990 that the Democratic Party was " history 's second - most enthusiastic capitalist party . "
Phillips pointed out that the greatest beneficiaries of government policy during the Republican presidencies of Ronald Reagan and George Bush were the superrich : " It was the truly wealthy , more than anyone else , who flourished under Reagan .. ..
The 1980s were the triumph of upper America ... the political ascendancy of the rich , and a glorification of capitalism , free markets , and finance . "
When government policy enriched the already rich , it was not called welfare .
This was not as obvious as the monthly checks to the poor ; it most often took the form of generous changes in the tax system .
In America : Who Really Pays The Taxes ? , two investigative reporters with the Philadelphia Inquirer , Donald Barlett and James Steele , traced the path by which tax rates for the very rich got lower and lower .
It was not the Republicans but the Democrats — the Kennedy - Johnson administrations — who , under the guise of " tax reform , " first lowered the World War 11 - era rate of 91 percent on incomes over $ 400,000 a year to 70 percent .
During the Carter Administration ( though over his objections ) Democrats and Republicans in Congress joined to give even more tax breaks to the rich .
The Reagan administration , with the help of Democrats in Congress , lowered the tax rate on the very rich to 50 percent and in 1986 a coalition of Republicans and Democrats sponsored another " tax reform " bill that lowered the top rate to 28 percent .
Barlett and Steele noted that a schoolteacher , a factory worker , and a billionaire could all pay 28 percent .
The idea of a " progressive " income in which the rich paid at higher rates than everyone else was now almost dead .
As a result of all the tax bills from 1978 to 1990 , the net worth of the " Forbes 400 , " chosen as the richest in the country by Forbes Magazine ( advertising itself as " capitalist tool " ) , was tripled .
About $ 70 billion a year was lost in government revenue , so that in those thirteen years the wealthiest 1 percent of the country gained a trillion dollars .
As William Greider pointed out , in his remarkable book Who Will Tell The People ?
The Betrayal of American Democracy :
For those who blame Republicans for what has happened and believe that equitable taxation will be restored if only the Democrats can win back the White House , there is this disquieting fact :
The turning point on tax politics , when the monied elites first began to win big , occurred in 1978 with the Democratic party fully in power and well before Ronald Reagan came to Washington , Democratic majorities have supported this great shift in tax burden every step of the way .
Not only did the income tax become less progressive during the last decades of the century , but the Social Security tax became more regressive .
That is , more and more was deducted from the salary checks of the poor and middle classes , but when salaries reached $ 42,000 no more was deducted .
By the early 1990s , a middle - income family earning $ 37,800 a year paid 7.65 percent of its income in Social Security taxes .
A family earning ten times as much , $ 378,000 paid 1.46 percent of its income in Social Security taxes .
The result of these higher payroll taxes was that three - fourths of all wage earners paid more each year through the Social Security tax than through the income tax .
Embarrassingly for the Democratic party , which was supposed to he the party of the working class , those higher payroll taxes had been put in motion under the administration of Jimmy Carter .
In a two - party system , if both parties ignore public opinion , there is no place voters can turn .
And in the matter of taxation , it has been clear that American citizens have wanted taxes that are truly progressive .
William Greider informs us that shortly after World War II , when rates on the very rich were up to 90 percent , a Gallup poll showed that 85 percent of the public thought the federal tax code was " fair . "
But by 1984 , when all those tax " reforms " had been put into effect by Democrats and Republicans , a public opinion survey by the Internal Revenue Service found that 80 percent of those polled agreed with the statement :
" The present tax system benefits the rich and is unfair to the ordinary working man and woman . "
By the end of the Reagan years , the gap between rich and poor in the United States had grown dramatically .
Where in 1980 , the chief executive officers ( CEOs ) of corporations made forty times as much in salary as the average factory worker , by 1989 they were making ninety - three times as much .
In the dozen years from 1977 to 1989 , the before - tax income of the richest 1 percent rose 77 percent ; meanwhile , for the poorest two - fifths of the population , there was no gain at all , indeed a small decline .
And because of favorable changes for the rich in the tax structure , the richest 1 percent , in the decade ending in 1990 , saw their after - tax income increase 87 percent .
In the same period , the after - tax income of the lower four - fifths of the population either went down 5 percent ( at the poorest level ) or went up no more than 8.6 percent .
While everybody at the lower levels was doing worse , there were especially heavy losses for blacks , Hispanics , women , and the young .
The general impoverishment of the lowest - income groups that took place in the Reagan - Bush years hit black families hardest , with their lack of resources to start with and with racial discrimination facing them in jobs .
The victories of the civil rights movement had opened up spaces for some African - Americans , but left others far behind .
At the end of the eighties , at least a third of African - American families fell below the official poverty level , and black unemployment seemed fixed at two and a half times that of whites , with young blacks out of work at the rate of 30 to 40 percent .
The life expectancy of blacks remained at least ten years lower than that of whites .
In Detroit , Washington , and Baltimore , the mortality rate for black babies was higher than in Jamaica or Costa Rica .
Along with poverty came broken homes , family violence , street crime , drugs .
In Washington , D.C. , with a concentrated population of black poor within walking distance of the marbled buildings of the national government , 42 percent of young black men between the ages of eighteen and thirty - five were either in jail , or out on probation or parole .
The crime rate among blacks , instead of being seen as a crying demand for the elimination of poverty , was used by politicians to call for the building of more prisons .
The 1954 Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education had begun the process of desegregating schools .
But poverty kept black children in ghettos and many schools around the country remained segregated by race and class .
Supreme Court decisions in the seventies determined that there need be no equalization of funds for poor school districts and rich school districts ( San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez ) and that the busing of children need not take place between wealthy suburbs and inner cities ( Milliken v. Bradley ) .
To admirers of free enterprise and laissez - faire , those people were poor who did not work and produce , and so had themselves to blame for their poverty .
They ignored the fact that women taking care of children on their own were working very hard indeed .
They did not ask why babies who were not old enough to show their work skills should be penalized — to the point of death — for growing up in a poor family .
Ironically , it was Republican Kevin Phillips who , analyzing the Reagan years , wrote : " Less and less wealth was going to people who produced something ... disproportionate rewards to society 's economic , legal and cultural manipulators - from lawyers to financial advisers . "
In the mid-eighties , a major scandal began to emerge in Washington .
The deregulation of the savings and loan banks begun in the Carter administration had continued under Reagan , leading to risky investments which drained the assets of the banks , leaving them owing billions of dollars to depositors , which the government had insured .
As the years went by and the problem was kept behind a screen , it was going to take more and more money to pay depositors and bail out these banks .
The figure began to reach $ 200 billion .
During the 1988 presidential campaign , the Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis was restrained from pointing the finger at the Republican administration because the Democrats in Congress were heavily involved in bringing about and then covering up the situation .
So the voters were kept in the dark .
The enormous drain of money from the treasury for defense had once been declared by President Eisenhower to be a " theft " from human needs .
But it was accepted by both parties , as Democrats competed with Republicans to show the electorate how " tough " they were .
Jimmy Carter as president had proposed a $ 10 billion increase in the military budget , an enactment of exactly what Eisenhower had described .
All of the huge military budgets of the post - World War II period , from Truman to Reagan and Bush , were approved overwhelmingly by both Democrats and Republicans .
The spending of trillions of dollars to build up nuclear and nonnuclear forces was justified by fears that the Soviet Union , also building up its military forces , would invade Western Europe .
But George Kennan , the former ambassador to the Soviet Union and one of the theoreticians of the cold war , said this fear had no basis in reality .
And Harry Rositzke , who worked for the CIA for twenty - five years and was at one time CIA director of espionage operations against the Soviet Union , wrote in the 1980s : " In all of my years in government and since I have never seen an intelligence estimate that shows how it would be profitable to Soviet interests to invade Western Europe or to attack the United States . "
However , the creation of such a fear in the public mind was useful in arguing for the building of frightful and superfluous weapons .
For instance , the Trident submarine , which was capable of firing hundreds of nuclear warheads , cost $ 1.5 billion .
It was totally useless except in a nuclear war , in which case it would only add several hundred warheads to the tens of thousands already available .
That $ 1.5 billion was enough to finance a five - year program of child immunization around the world against deadly diseases , and prevent five million deaths ( Ruth Sivard , World Military and Social Expenditures 1981 - 1988 ) .
In the mid-1980s , an analyst with the Rand Corporation , which did research for the Defense Department , told an interviewer in an unusually candid statement , that the enormous number of weapons was unnecessary from a military point of view , but were useful to convey a certain image at home and abroad :
If you had a strong president , a strong secretary of defense they could temporarily go to Congress and say , " We 're only going to build what we need .. ..
And if the Russians build twice as many , tough . "
But it would be unstable politically .. ..
And it is therefore better for our own domestic stability as well as international perceptions to insist that we remain good competitors even though the objective significance of the competition is ... dubious .
In 1984 , the CIA admitted that it had exaggerated Soviet military expenditures , that since 1975 it had claimed Soviet military spending was growing by 4 to 5 percent each year when the actual figure was 2 percent .
Thus , by misinformation , even deception , the result was to inflate military expenditures .
One of the favorite military programs of the Reagan administration was the Star Wars program , in which billions were spent , supposedly to build a shield in space to stop enemy nuclear missiles in midair .
But the first three tests of the technology failed .
A fourth test was undertaken , with government funding for the program at stake .
There was another failure , but Reagan 's Secretary of Defense , Caspar Weinberger , approved the faking of results to show that the test had succeeded .
When the Soviet Union began to disintegrate in 1989 , and there was no longer the familiar " Soviet threat , " the military budget was reduced somewhat , but still remained huge , with support from both Democrats and Republicans .
In 1992 , the head of the House Armed Services Committee , Les Aspin , a Democrat , proposed , in view of the new international situation , that the military budget be cut by 2 % , from $ 281 billion to $ 275 billion .
That same year , as Democrats and Republicans both supported minor cuts in the military budget , a public opinion survey done for the National Press Club showed that 59 percent of American voters wanted a 50 percent cut in defense spending over the next five years .
It seemed that both parties had failed in persuading the citizenry that the military budget should continue at its high level .
But they continued to ignore the public they were supposed to represent .
In the summer of 1992 , Congressional Democrats and Republicans joined to vote against a transfer of funds from the military budget to human needs , and voted to spend $ 120 billion to " defend " Europe , which everyone acknowledged was no longer in danger — if it ever had been — from Soviet attack .
Democrats and Republicans had long been joined in a " bipartisan foreign policy , " but in the Reagan - Bush years the United States government showed a special aggressiveness in the use of military force abroad .
This was done either directly in invasions , or through both overt and covert support of right - wing tyrannies that cooperated with the United States .
Reagan came into office just after a revolution had taken place in Nicaragua , in which a popular Sandinista movement ( named after the 1920s revolutionary hero Augusto Sandino ) overthrew the corrupt Somoza dynasty ( long supported by the United States ) .
The Sandinistas , a coalition of Marxists , left - wing priests , and assorted nationalists , set about to give more land to the peasants and to spread education and health care among the poor .
The Reagan administration , seeing in this a " Communist " threat , but even more important , a challenge to the long U.S. control over governments in Central America , began immediately to work to overthrow the Sandinista government .
It waged a secret war by having the CIA organize a counterrevolutionary force ( the " contras " ) , many of whose leaders were former leaders of the hated National Guard under Somoza .
The contras seemed to have no popular support inside Nicaragua and so were based next door in Honduras , a very poor country dominated by the United States .
From Honduras they moved across the border , raiding farms and villages , killing men , women and children , committing atrocities .
A former colonel with the contras , Edgar Chamorro , testified before the World Court :
We were told that the only way to defeat the Sandinistas was to use the tactics the agency [ the CIA ] attributed to Communist insurgencies elsewhere : kill , kidnap , rob , and torture .
.. .
Many civilians were killed in cold blood .
Many others were tortured , mutilated , raped , robbed , or otherwise abused .
. . .
When I agreed to join ... I had hoped that it would be an organization of Nicaragnans .... [ It ] turned out to be an instrument of the U.S. government .
. . .
There was a reason for the secrecy of the U.S. actions in Nicaragua ; public opinion surveys showed that the American public was opposed to military involvement there .
In 1984 , the CIA , using Latin American agents to conceal its involvement , put mines in the harbors of Nicaragua to blow up ships .
When information leaked out , Secretary of Defense Weinberger told ABC news : " The United States is not mining the harbors of Nicaragua . "
Later that year Congress , responding perhaps to public opinion and the memory of Vietnam , made it illegal for the United States to support " directly or indirectly , military or paramilitary operations in Nicaragua . "
The Reagan administration decided to ignore this law and to find ways to fund the contras secretly , looking for " third - party support . "
Reagan himself solicited funds from Saudi Arabia , at least $ 32 million .
The friendly dictatorship in Guatemala was used to get arms surreptitiously to the contras .
Israel , dependent on U.S. aid and always dependable for support , was also used .
In 1986 , a story appearing in a Beirut magazine created a sensation : that weapons had been sold by the United States to Iran ( supposedly an enemy ) , that in return Iran had promised to release hostages being held by extremist Moslems in Lebanon , and that profits from the sale were being given to the contras to buy arms .
When asked about this at a press conference in November 1986 , President Reagan told four lies : that the shipment to Iran consisted of a few token antitank missiles ( in fact , 2,000 ) , that the United States did n't condone shipments by third parties , that weapons had not been traded for hostages , and that the purpose of the operation was to promote a dialogue with Iranian moderates , in reality , the purpose was a double one : to free hostages and get credit for that , and to help the contras .
The previous month , when a transport plane that had carried arms to the contras was downed by Nicaraguan gunfire and the American pilot captured , the lies had multiplied .
Assistant Secretary of State Elliot Abrams lied .
Secretary of State Shultz lied ( " no connection with the U.S. government at all " ) .
Evidence mounted that the captured pilot was working for the CIA .
The whole Iran - contra affair became a perfect example of the double line of defense of the American Establishment .
The first defense is to deny the truth .
If exposed , the second defense is to investigate , but not too much ; the press will publicize , but they will not get to the heart of the matter .
Once the scandal was out in the open , neither the Congressional investigating committees nor the press nor the trial of Colonel Oliver North , who oversaw the contra aid operation , got to the critical questions :
What is U.S. foreign policy all about ?
How are the president and his staff permitted to support a terrorist group in Central America to overthrow a government that , whatever its faults , is welcomed by its own people as a great improvement over the terrible governments the U.S. has supported there for years ?
What does the scandal tell us about democracy , about freedom of expression , about an open society ?
Out of the much - publicized " contragate " scandal came no powerful critique of secrecy in government or of the erosion of democracy by actions taken in secret by a small group of men safe from the scrutiny of public opinion .
The media , in a country priding itself on its level of education and information , kept the public informed only on the most superficial level .
The limits of Democratic party criticism of the affair were revealed by a leading Democrat , Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia , who , as the investigation was getting under way , said : " We must , all of us , help the President restore his credibility in foreign affairs . "
A few Democrats were critical , which was deplored by a Harvard professor , James Q. Wilson , who was a member of Reagan 's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board .
Wilson looked back nostalgically to a " bipartisan consensus " ( the equivalent of the one - party system in a totalitarian state ) .
He worried most about " a lack of resolve to act like a great power . "
It became clear that President Reagan and Vice - President Bush were involved in what became known as the Iran - contra affair .
But their underlings scrupulously kept them out of it , illustrating the familiar government device of " plausible denial , " in which the top official , shielded by subordinates , can plausibly deny involvement .
Although Congressman Henry Gonzalez of Texas introduced a resolution for the impeachment of Reagan , it was quickly suppressed in Congress .
Neither Reagan nor Bush were indicted .
Rather , the Congressional committee put the lesser culprits on the witness stand and several of them were indicted .
One ( Robert McFarlane , a former National Security Adviser to Reagan ) tried to commit suicide .
Another , Colonel Oliver North , stood trial for lying to Congress , was found guilty , but was not sentenced to prison .
Reagan retired in peace and Bush became the next president of the United States .
In an ironic twist , an obscure citizen of the tiny town of Odon , Indiana , became a tangential actor in the Iran - contra controversy .
This was a young man named Bill Breeden , a former minister who lived in a tepee in the woods with his wife and two children , teaching the children at home .
Breeden 's home town of Odon was also the home town of Admiral John Poindexter , McFarlane 's successor as Reagan 's National Security Adviser , who was heavily involved in the illegal activities of the Iran - contra affair .
One day Bill Breeden noticed that the town , to show its pride in its " home boy , " had renamed one of its streets " John Poindexter Street . "
Breeden , a pacifist and critic of U.S. foreign policy , indignant at what he thought was a celebration of immoral behavior in government , stole the sign .
He announced that he was holding it for " ransom " - $ 30 million , the amount of money that had been given to Iran for transfer to the contras .
He was apprehended , put on trial , and spent a few days in jail .
As it turned out , Bill Breeden was the only person to be imprisoned as a result of the Iran - contra affair .
The Iran - contra affair was only one of the many instances in which the government of the United States violated its own laws in pursuit of some desired goal in foreign policy .
Toward the end of the Vietnam war , in 1973 , Congress , seeking to limit the presidential power that had been used so ruthlessly in Indochina , passed the War Powers Act , which said :
" The President , in every possible instance , shall consult with Congress before introducing United States Armed Forces into hostilities or into situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances . "
Almost immediately , President Gerald Ford violated the act when he ordered the invasion of a Cambodian island and the bombing of a Cambodian town in retaliation for the temporary detention of American merchant seamen on the ship Mayaguez .
He did not consult Congress before he gave the attack orders .
In the fall of 1982 , President Reagan sent American marines into a dangerous situation in Lebanon , where a civil war was raging , again ignoring the requirements of the War Powers Act .
The following year , over two hundred of those marines were killed when a bomb was exploded in their barracks by terrorists .
Shortly after that , in October 1983 ( with some analysts concluding this was done to take attention away from the Lebanon disaster ) , Reagan sent U.S. forces to invade the tiny Caribbean island of Grenada .
Again , Congress was notified , but not consulted .
The reasons given to the American people for this invasion ( officially called Operation Urgent Fury ) were that a recent coup that had taken place in Grenada put American citizens ( students at a medical school on the island ) in danger ; and that the United States had received an urgent request from the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States to intervene .
An unusually pointed article in the New York Times on October 29 , 1983 , by correspondent Bernard Gwertzman demolished those reasons :
The formal request that the U.S. and other friendly countries provide military help was made by the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States last Sunday at the request of the United States , which wanted to show proof that it had been requested to act under terms of that group 's treaty .
The wording of the formal request , however , was drafted in Washington and conveyed to the Caribbean leaders by special American emissaries .
Both Cuba and Grenada , when they saw that American ships were heading for Grenada , sent urgent messages promising that American students were safe and urging that an invasion not occur .. ..
There is no indication that the Administration made a determined effort to evacuate the Americans peacefully ....
Officials have acknowledged that there was no inclination to try to negotiate with the Grenadian authorities .
...
" We got there just in time , " the President said ....
A major point in the dispute is whether in fact the Americans on the island were in such danger as to warrant an invasion .
No official has produced firm evidence that the Americans were being mistreated or that they would not be able to leave if they wanted .
The real reason for the invasion , one high American official told Gwertzman , was that the United States should show ( determined to overcome the sense of defeat in Vietnam ) that it was a truly powerful nation : " What good are maneuvers and shows of force , if you never use it ? "
Philip Jones Griffiths ' iconic photo from the U.S. invasion of Grenada .
The connection between U.S. military intervention and the promotion of capitalist enterprise had always been especially crass in the Caribbean .
As for Grenada , an article in the Wall Street Journal eight years after the military invasion ( October 29 , 1991 ) spoke of " an invasion of banks " and noted that St. George 's , the capital of Grenada , with 7500 people , had 118 offshore banks , one for every 64 residents .
" St. George 's has become the Casablanca of the Caribbean , a fast - growing haven for money laundering , tax evasion and assorted financial fraud ... . "
After a study of various U.S. military interventions , political scientist Stephen Shalom ( Imperial Alibis ) concluded that people in the invaded countries died " not to save U.S. nationals , who would have been far safer without U.S. intervention , but so that Washington might make clear that it ruled the Caribbean and that it was prepared to engage in a paroxysm of violence to enforce its will . "
He continued :
There have been some cases where American citizens were truly in danger : for example , the four churchwomen who were killed by government - sponsored death squads in El Salvador in 1980 .
But there was no U.S. intervention there , no Marine landings , no protective bombing raids .
Instead Washington backed the death squad regime with military and economic aid , military training , intelligence sharing , and diplomatic support .
The historic role of the United States in El Salvador , where 2 percent of the population owned 60 percent of the land , was to make sure governments were in power there that would support U.S. business interests , no matter how this impoverished the great majority of people .
Popular rebellions that would threaten these business arrangements were to be opposed .
When a popular uprising in 1932 threatened the military government , the United States sent a cruiser and two destroyers to stand by while the government massacred thirty thousand Salvadorans .
The administration of Jimmy Carter did nothing to reverse this history .
It wanted reform in Latin America , but not revolution that would threaten U.S. corporate interests .
In 1980 , Richard Cooper , a State Department expert on economic affairs , told Congress that a more equitable distribution of wealth was desirable .
" However , we also have an enormous stake in the continuing smooth functioning in the economic system .
.. .
Major changes in the system can .. . have important implications for our own welfare . "
In February 1980 El Salvador Catholic Archbishop Oscar Romero sent a personal letter to President Carter , asking him to stop military aid to El Salvador .
Not long before that , the National Guard and National Police had opened fire on a crowd of protesters in front of the Metropolitan Cathedral and killed twenty - four people .
But the Carter administration continued the aid .
The following month Archbishop Romero was assassinated .
There was mounting evidence that the assassination had been ordered by Roberto D'Aubuisson , a leader of the right wing .
But D'Aubuisson had the protection of Nicolas Carranza , a deputy minister of defense , who at the time was receiving $ 90,000 a year from the CIA .
And Elliot Abrams , ironically Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights , declared that D'Aubuisson " was not involved in murder . "
When Reagan became President , military aid to the El Salvador government rose steeply .
From 1946 to 1979 , total military aid to El Salvador was $ 16.7 million .
In Reagan 's first year in office , the figure rose to $ 82 million .
Congress was sufficiently embarrassed by the killings in El Salvador to require that before any more aid was given the President must certify that progress in human rights was taking place .
Reagan did not take this seriously .
On January 28 , 1982 , there were reports of a government massacre of peasants in several villages .
The following day , Reagan certified that the Salvadoran government was making progress in human rights .
Three days after certification , soldiers stormed the homes of poor people in San Salvador , dragged out twenty people , and killed them .
When , at the end of 1983 , Congress passed a law to continue the requirement of certification , Reagan vetoed it .
The press was especially timid and obsequious during the Reagan years , as Mark Hertsgaard documents in his book On Bended Knee .
When journalist Raymond Bonner continued to report on the atrocities in El Salvador , and on the U.S. role , the New York Times removed him from his assignment .
Back in 1981 Bonner had reported on the massacre of hundreds of civilians in the town of El Mozote , by a battalion of soldiers trained by the United States .
The Reagan administration scoffed at the account , but in 1992 , a team of forensic anthropologists began unearthing skeletons from the site of the massacre , most of them children ; the following year a UN commission confirmed the story of the massacre at El Mozote .
The Reagan administration , which did not appear at all offended by military juntas governing in Latin America ( Guatemala , El Salvador , Chile ) if they were " friendly " to the United States , became very upset when a tyranny was hostile , as was the government of Muammar Khadafi in Libya .
In 1986 , when unknown terrorists bombed a discotheque in West Berlin , killing a U.S. serviceman , the White House immediately decided to retaliate .
Khadafi was probably responsible for various acts of terrorism over the years , but there was no real evidence that in this case he was to blame .
Reagan was determined to make a point .
Planes were sent over the capital city of Tripoli with specific instructions to aim at Khadafi 's house .
The bombs fell on a crowded city ; perhaps a hundred people were killed , it was estimated by foreign diplomats in Tripoli .
Khadafi was not injured , but an adopted daughter of his was killed .
Professor Stephen Shalom , analyzing this incident , writes ( Imperial Alibis ) : " If terrorism is defined as politically motivated violence perpetrated against non-combatant targets , then one of the most serious incidents of international terrorism of the year was precisely this U.S. raid on Libya . "
Early in the presidency of George Bush , there came the most dramatic developments on the international scene since the end of World War II .
In the year 1989 , with a dynamic new leader , Mikhail Gorbachev , at the head of the Soviet Union , the long suppressed dissatisfaction with " dictatorships of the proletariat " which had turned out to be dictatorships over the proletariat erupted all through the Soviet bloc .
There were mass demonstrations in the Soviet Union and in the countries of Eastern Europe which had been long dominated by the Soviet Union .
East Germany agreed to unite with West Germany , and the wall separating East Berlin from West Berlin , long a symbol of the tight control of its citizens by East Germany , was dismantled in the presence of wildly exultant citizens of both Germanies .
In Czechoslovakia , a new non-Communist government came into being , headed by a playwright and former imprisoned dissident named Vaclav Havel .
In Poland , Bulgaria , Hungary , a new leadership emerged , promising freedom and democracy .
And remarkably , all this took place without civil war , in response to overwhelming popular demand .
In the United States , the Republican party claimed that the hard - line policies of Reagan and the increase in military expenditures had brought down the Soviet Union .
But the change had begun much earlier , after the death of Stalin in 1953 , and especially with the leadership of Nikita Khrushchev .
A remarkably open discussion had been initiated .
But the continued hard line of the United States became an obstacle to further liberalization , according to former ambassador to the Soviet Union George Kennan , who wrote that " the general effect of cold war extremism was to delay rather than hasten the great change that overtook the Soviet Union by the end of the 1980s . "
While the press and politicians in the United States exulted over the collapse of the Soviet Union , Kennan pointed out that , not only did American policies delay this collapse , but these cold war policies were carried on at a frightful cost to the American people :
We paid with forty years of enormous and otherwise unnecessary military expenditures .
We paid through the cultivation of nuclear weaponry to the point where the vast and useless nuclear arsenal had become ( and remains today ) a danger to the very environment of the planet .
. ..
The sudden collapse of the Soviet Union left the political leadership of the United States unprepared .
Military interventions had been undertaken in Korea and Vietnam with enormous loss of life , also in Cuba and the Dominican Republic , and huge amounts of military aid had been given all over the world — in Europe , Africa , Latin America , the Middle East , Asia — on the supposition that this was necessary to deal with a Communist menace emanating from the Soviet Union .
Several trillion dollars had been taken from American citizens in the form of taxes to maintain a huge nuclear and nonnuclear arsenal and military bases all over the world — all primarily justified by the " Soviet threat . "
Here then was an opportunity for the United States to reconstruct its foreign policy , and to free hundreds of billions of dollars a year from the budget to be used for constructive , healthy projects .
But this did not happen .
Along with the exultation " We have won the cold war " came a kind of panic : " What can we do to maintain our military establishment ? "
It became clearer now , although it had been suspected , that United States foreign policy was not simply based on the existence of the Soviet Union , but was motivated by fear of revolution in various parts of the world .
The radical social critic Noam Chomsky had long maintained that " the appeal to security was largely fraudulent , the Cold War framework having been employed as a device to justify the suppression of independent nationalism — whether in Europe , Japan , or the Third World " ( World Orders Old and New ) .
The fear of " independent nationalism " was that this would jeopardize powerful American economic interests .
Revolutions in Nicaragua or Cuba or El Salvador or Chile were threats to United Fruit , Anaconda Copper , International Telephone and Telegraph , and others .
Thus , foreign interventions presented to the public as " in the national interest " were really undertaken for special interests , for which the American people were asked to sacrifice their sons and their tax dollars .
The CIA now had to prove it was still needed .
The New York Times ( February 4 , 1992 ) declared that " in a world where the postwar enemy has ceased to exist , the C.I.A. and its handful of sister agencies , with their billion - dollar satellites and mountains of classified documents , must somehow remain relevant in the minds of Americans . "
The military budget remained huge .
The cold war budget of $ 300 billion was reduced by 7 percent to $ 280 billion .
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Colin Powell , said : " I want to scare the hell out of the rest of the world .
I do n't say that in a bellicose way . "
As if to prove that the gigantic military establishment was still necessary , the Bush administration , in its four - year term , launched two wars : a " small " one against Panama and a massive one against Iraq .
Coming into office in 1989 , George Bush was embarrassed by the new defiant posture of Panama 's dictator , General Manuel Noriega .
Noriega 's regime was corrupt , brutal , authoritarian , but President Reagan and Vice - President Bush had overlooked this because Noriega was useful to the United States .
He cooperated with the CIA in many ways , such as offering Panama as a base for contra operations against the Sandinista government of Nicaragua and meeting with Colonel Oliver North to discuss sabotage targets in Nicaragua .
When he was director of the CIA in 1976 - 1977 , Bush had protected Noriega .
But by 1987 Noriega 's usefulness was over , his activities in the drug trade were in the open , and he became a convenient target for an administration which wanted to prove that the United States , apparently unable to destroy the Castro regime or the Sandinistas or the revolutionary movement in El Salvador , was still a power in the Caribbean .
Claiming that it wanted to bring Noriega to trial as a drug trafficker ( he had been indicted in Florida on that charge ) and also that it needed to protect U.S. citizens ( a military man and his wife had been threatened by Panamanian soldiers ) , the United States invaded Panama in December 1989 , with 26,000 troops .
It was a quick victory .
Noriega was captured and brought to Florida to stand trial ( where he was subsequently found guilty and sent to prison ) .
But in the invasion , neighborhoods in Panama City were bombarded and hundreds , perhaps thousands of civilians were killed .
It was estimated that 14,000 were homeless .
Writer Mark Hertsgaard noted that even if the official Pentagon figure of several hundred civilian casualties was correct , this meant that in Panama the U.S. had killed as many people as did the Chinese government in its notorious attack on student demonstrators at Tiananmen Square in Beijing six months earlier .
A new president friendly to the United States was installed in Panama , but poverty and unemployment remained , and in 1992 the New York Times reported that the invasion and removal of Noriega " failed to stanch the flow of illicit narcotics through Panama . "
The United States , however , succeeded in one of its aims , to reestablish its strong influence over Panama .
The Times reported : " The President [ of Panama ] and his key aides and the American Ambassador , Deane Hinton , have breakfast together once a week in a meeting that many Panamanians view as the place where important decisions are taken . "
Liberal Democrats ( John Kerry and Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts , and many others ) declared their support of the military action .
The Democrats were being true to their historic role as supporters of military intervention , anxious to show that foreign policy was bipartisan .
They seemed determined to show they were as tough ( or as ruthless ) as the Republicans .
But the Panama operation was on too small a scale to accomplish what both the Reagan and Bush administrations badly wanted : to overcome the American public 's abhorrence , since Vietnam , of foreign military interventions .
Two years later , the Gulf War against Iraq presented such an opportunity .
Iraq , under the brutal dictatorship of Saddam Hussein , had taken over its small but oil - rich neighbor , Kuwait , in August 1990 .
George Bush needed something at this point to boost his popularity among American voters .
The Washington Post ( October 16 , 1990 ) had a front - page story headline : " Poll Shows Plunge in Public Confidence : Bush 's Rating Plummets . "
The Post reported ( October 28 ) : " Some observers in his own party worry that the president will be forced to initiate combat to prevent further erosion of his support at home . "
On October 30 , a secret decision was made for war against Iraq .
The United Nations had responded to the invasion of Kuwait by establishing sanctions against Iraq .
Witness after witness testified before Congressional committees in the fall of 1990 that the sanctions were having an effect and should continue .
Secret CIA testimony to the Senate affirmed that Iraq 's imports and exports had been reduced by more than 90 percent because of the sanctions .
But after the November elections brought gains for the Democrats in Congress , Bush doubled American military forces in the Gulf , to 500,000 , creating what was now clearly an offensive force rather than a defensive one .
According to Elizabeth Drew , a writer for the New Yorker , Bush 's aide John Sununu " was telling people that a short successful war would be pure political gold for the President and would guarantee his re-election . "
Historian Jon Wiener , analyzing the domestic context of the war decision shortly afterward , wrote that " Bush abandoned sanctions and chose war because his time frame was a political one set by the approaching 1992 presidential elections . "
That and the long - time U.S. wish to have a decisive voice in the control of Middle East oil resources were the crucial elements in the decision to go to war against Iraq .
Shortly after the war , as representatives of the thirteen oil - producing nations were about to gather in Geneva , the business correspondent of the New York Times wrote : " By virtue of its military victory the United States is likely to have more influence in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries than any industrial nation has ever exercised . "
But those motives were not presented to the American public .
It was told that the United States wanted to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi control .
The major media dwelled on this as a reason for war , without noting that other countries had been invaded without the United States showing such concern ( East Timor by Indonesia , Iran by Iraq , Lebanon by Israel , Mozambique by South Africa ; to say nothing of countries invaded by the United States itself — Grenada , Panama ) .
The justification for war that seemed most compelling was that Iraq was on its way to building a nuclear bomb , but the evidence for this was very weak .
Before the crisis over Kuwait , Western intelligence sources had estimated it would take Iraq three to ten years to build a nuclear weapon .
Even if Iraq could build a bomb in a year or two , which was the most pessimistic estimate , it had no delivery system to send it anywhere .
Besides , Israel already had nuclear weapons .
And the United States had perhaps 30,000 of them .
The Bush administration was trying hard to develop a paranoia in the nation about an Iraqi bomb which did not yet exist .
Bush seemed determined to go to war .
There had been several chances to negotiate an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait right after the invasion , including an Iraqi proposal reported on August 29 by Newsday correspondent Knut Royce .
But there was no response from the United States .
When Secretary of State James Baker went to Geneva to meet with Iraqi foreign minister Tariq Aziz , the instruction from Bush was " no negotiations . "
Despite months of exhortation from Washington about the dangers of Saddam Hussein , surveys showed that less than half of the public favored military action .
In January 1991 , Bush , apparently feeling the need for support , asked Congress to give him the authority to make war .
This was not a declaration of war , as called for by the Constitution ; but since Korea and Vietnam , that provision of the Constitution seemed dead , and even the " strict constructionists " on the Supreme Court who prided themselves on taking the words of the Constitution literally and seriously would not intervene .
The debate in Congress was lively .
( At one point , a Senate speech was interrupted by protesters in the balcony shouting " No blood for oil ! "
The protesters were hustled out by guards . )
It is likely that Bush was sure of having enough votes , or he would have launched the invasion without Congressional approval ; after all , the precedent for ignoring Congress and the Constitution had been set in Korea , Vietnam , Grenada , and Panama .
The Senate voted for military action by only a few votes .
The House supported the resolution by a larger majority .
However , once Bush ordered the attack on Iraq , both houses , with just a few dissents , Democrats as well as Republicans , voted to " support the war and support the troops . "
It was in mid-January 1991 , after Saddam Hussein defied an ultimatum to leave Kuwait , that the U.S. launched its air war against Iraq .
It was given the name Desert Storm .
The government and the media had conjured up a picture of a formidable military power , but Iraq was far from that .
The U.S. Air Force had total control of the air , and could bomb at will .
Not only that , U.S. officials had virtual total control of the airwaves .
The American public was overwhelmed with television photos of " smart bombs " and confident statements that laser bombs were being guided with perfect precision to military targets .
The major networks presented all of these claims without question or criticism .
This confidence in " smart bombs " sparing civilians may have contributed to a shift in public opinion , from being equally divided on going to war , to perhaps 85 percent support for the invasion .
Perhaps more important in winning over public support was that once American military were engaged , it seemed to many people who had previously opposed military action that to criticize it now meant betraying the troops who were there .
All over the nation yellow ribbons were displayed as a symbol of support for the forces in Iraq .
In fact , the public was being deceived about how " smart " the bombs being dropped on Iraqi towns were .
After talking with former intelligence and Air Force officers , a correspondent for the Boston Globe reported that perhaps 40 percent of the laser - guided bombs dropped in Operation Desert Storm missed their targets .
John Lehman , Secretary of the Navy under President Reagan , estimated there had been thousands of civilian casualties .
The Pentagon officially had no figure on this .
A senior Pentagon official told the Globe , " To tell you the truth , we 're not really focusing on this question . "
A Reuters dispatch from Iraq described the destruction of a seventy - three - room hotel in a town south of Baghdad , and quoted an Egyptian witness : " They hit the hotel , full of families , and then they came back to hit it again . "
Reuters reported that the air raids on Iraq first used laser - guided bombs , but within a few weeks turned to B - 52s , which carried conventional bombs , meaning more indiscriminate bombing .
American reporters were kept from seeing the war close - up , and their dispatches were subject to censorship .
Apparently recalling how press reports of civilian casualties had affected public opinion during the Vietnam war , the U.S. government was taking no chances this time .
A Washington Post reporter complained about the control of information , writing ( January 22 , 1991 ) :
The bombing has involved ... dozens of high - flying B - 52 bombers equipped with huge , unguided munitions .
But the Pentagon has not allowed interviews with B - 52 pilots , shown videotapes of their actions or answered any questions about the operations of an aircraft that is the most deadly and least accurate in the armada of more than 2000 U.S. and allied planes in the Persian Gulf region ... .
In mid-February , U.S. planes dropped bombs on an air raid shelter in Baghdad at four in the morning , killing 400 to 500 people .
An Associated Press reporter who was one of few allowed to go to the site said : " Most of the recovered bodies were charred and mutilated beyond recognition .
Some clearly were children . "
The Pentagon claimed it was a military target , but the AP reporter on the scene said : " No evidence of any military presence could be seen inside the wreckage . "
Other reporters who inspected the site agreed .
After the war , fifteen Washington news bureau chiefs complained in a joint statement that the Pentagon exercised " virtual total control ... over the American press " during the Gulf War .
But while it was happening , leading television news commentators behaved as if they were working for the United States government .
For instance , CBS correspondent Dan Rather , perhaps the most widely seen of the TV newsmen , reported from Saudi Arabia on a film showing a laser bomb ( this one dropped by British aircraft in support of the American war ) hitting a marketplace and killing civilians .
Rather 's only comment was : " We can be sure that Saddam Hussein will make propaganda of these casualties . "
When the Soviet government tried to negotiate an end to the war , bringing Iraq out of Kuwait before the ground war could get under way , top CBS correspondent Lesley Stahl asked another reporter : " Is n't this the nightmare scenario ?
Are n't the Soviets trying to stop us ? "
( Ed Siegel , TV reporter for the Boston Globe , February 23 , 1991 ) .
The final stage of the war , barely six weeks after it had begun , was a ground assault which , like the air war , encountered virtually no resistance .
With victory certain and the Iraqi army in full flight , U.S. planes kept bombing the retreating soldiers who clogged the highway out of Kuwait City .
A reporter called the scene " a blazing hell ... a gruesome testament .
...
To the east and west across the sand lay the bodies of those fleeing . "
A Yale professor of military history , Michael Howard , writing in the New York Times ( January 28 , 1991 ) , quoted the military strategist Clausewitz approvingly : " The fact that a bloody slaughter is a horrifying act must make us take war more seriously , but not provide an excuse for gradually blunting our swords in the name of humanity . "
Howard went on to say : " In this conflict of wills , the bottom line remains a readiness to kill and be killed .
. . . "
The human consequences of the war became shockingly clear after its end , when it was revealed that the bombings of Iraq had caused starvation , disease , and the deaths of tens of thousands of children .
A U.N. team visiting Iraq immediately after the war reported that " the recent conflict has wrought near - apocalyptic results upon the infrastructure ....
Most means of modern life support have been destroyed or rendered tenuous .... "
A Harvard medical team reporting in May said that child mortality had risen steeply , and that 55,000 more children died in the first four months of the year ( the war lasted from January 15 to February 28 ) than in a comparable period the year before .
The director of a pediatric hospital in Baghdad told a New York Times reporter that on the first night of the bombing campaign the electricity was knocked out : " Mothers grabbed their children out of incubators , took intravenous tubes out of their arms .
Others were removed from oxygen tents and they ran to the basement , where there was no heat .
I lost more than 40 prematures in the first 12 hours of the bombing . "
Although in the course of the war Saddam Hussein had been depicted by U.S. officials and the press as another Hitler , the war ended short of a march into Baghdad , leaving Hussein in power .
It seemed that the United States had wanted to weaken him , but not to eliminate him , in order to keep him as a balance against Iran .
In the years before the Gulf War , the United States had sold arms to both Iran and Iraq , at different times favoring one or the other as part of the traditional " balance of power " strategy .
Therefore , as the war ended , the United States did not support Iraqi dissidents who wanted to overthrow the regime of Saddam Hussein .
A New York Times dispatch from Washington , datelined March 26 , 1991 , reported : " President Bush has decided to let President Saddam Hussein put down rebellions in his country without American intervention rather than risk the splintering of Iraq , according to official statements and private briefings today . "
This left the Kurdish minority , which was rebelling against Saddam Hussein , helpless .
And anti- Hussein elements among the Iraqi majority were also left hanging .
The Washington Post reported ( May 3 , 1991 ) : " Major defections from the Iraqi military were in the offing in March at the height of the Kurdish rebellion , but never materialized because the officers concluded the U.S. would not back the uprising .... "
The man who had been Jimmy Carter 's National Security Adviser , Zbigniew Brzezinski , a month after the end of the Gulf War , gave a cold assessment of the pluses and minuses of the event .
" The benefits are undeniably impressive .
First , a blatant act of aggression was rebuffed and punished ....
Second , U.S military power is henceforth likely to be taken more seriously ....
Third , the Middle East and Persian Gulf region is now clearly an American sphere of preponderance . "
Brzezinski , however , was concerned about " some negative consequences . "
One of them was that " the very intensity of the air assault on Iraq gives rise to concern that the conduct of the war may come to be seen as evidence that Americans view Arab lives as worthless .. ... And that raises the moral question of the proportionality of response . "
His point about Arab lives being seen as " worthless " was underlined by the feet that the war provoked an ugly wave of anti-Arab racism in the United States , with Arab - Americans insulted or beaten or threatened with death .
There were bumper stickers that said " I do n't brake for Iraqis . "
An Arab - American businessman was beaten in Toledo , Ohio .
Brzezinski's measured assessment of the Gulf War could be taken as close to representing the view of the Democratic Party .
It went along with the Bush administration .
It was pleased with the results .
It had some misgivings about civilian casualties .
But it did not constitute an opposition .
President George Bush was satisfied .
As the war ended , he declared on a radio broadcast : " The specter of Vietnam has been buried forever in the desert sands of the Arabian peninsula . "
The Establishment press very much agreed .
The two leading news magazines , Time and Newsweek , had special editions hailing the victory in the war , noting there had been only a few hundred American casualties , without any mention of Iraqi casualties .
A New York Times editorial ( March 30 , 1991 ) said : " America 's victory in the Persian Gulf war ... provided special vindication for the U.S. Army , which brilliantly exploited its firepower and mobility and in the process erased memories of its grievous difficulties in Vietnam . "
A black poet in Berkeley , California , June Jordan , had a different view : " I suggest to you it 's a hit the same way that crack is , and it does n't last long . "
Okay , I might get into serious trouble with this , but I 've been asked dozens of times how you can tell a gay man or woman from his / her straight counterparts .
( ' Straight ' means ' heterosexual ' in modern gay parlance )
Some are obvious ( I mean , do you need my help to know Richard Simmons and k.d. lang are gay ? ) .
But most are a bit more subtle , and it is n't usually a matter of how much product they use in their hair , or how much they follow professional sports , that really matter .
Some have said it 's a sense that 's difficult to describe , and I guess it is .
However , I 've distilled the following clues from my * years * ( ahem ! ) of experience :
( Take it for all it 's worth - - I 'm just having fun here )
This week the Russian and Chinese militaries are conducting a joint military exercise involving large numbers of troops and combat vehicles .
The former Soviet Republics of Tajikistan , Kyrgkyzstan , and Kazakstan are participating .
Other countries appear ready to join the military alliance .
This new potent military alliance is a real world response to neoconservative delusions about US hegemony .
Neocons believe that the US is supreme in the world and can dictate its course .
The neoconservative idiots have actually written papers , read by Russians and Chinese , about why the US must use its military superiority to assert hegemony over Russia and China .
Cynics believe that the neocons are just shills , like Bush and Cheney , for the military - security complex and are paid to restart the cold war for the sake of the profits of the armaments industry .
But the fact is that the neocons actually believe their delusions about American hegemony .
Russia and China have now witnessed enough of the Bush administration ’s unprovoked aggression in the world to take neocon intentions seriously .
As the US has proven that it cannot occupy the Iraqi city of Baghdad despite 5 years of efforts , it most certainly cannot occupy Russia or China .
That means the conflict toward which the neocons are driving will be a nuclear conflict .
In an attempt to gain the advantage in a nuclear conflict , the neocons are positioning US anti-ballistic missiles on Soviet borders in Poland and the Czech Republic .
This is an idiotic provocation as the Russians can eliminate anti-ballistic missiles with cruise missiles .
Neocons are people who desire war , but know nothing about it .
Thus , the US failures in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Reagan and Gorbachev ended the cold war .
However , US administrations after Reagan ’s have broken the agreements and understandings .
The US gratuitously brought NATO and anti-ballistic missiles to Russia ’s borders .
The Bush regime has initiated a propaganda war against the Russian government of Vladimir Putin .
These are gratuitous acts of aggression .
Both the Russian and Chinese governments are trying to devote resources to their economic development , not to their militaries .
Yet , both are being forced by America ’s aggressive posture to revamp their militaries .
Americans need to understand what the neocon Bush regime cannot : a nuclear exchange between the US , Russia , and China would establish the hegemony of the cockroach .
In a mere 6.5 years the Bush regime has destroyed the world ’s good will toward the US .
Today , America ’s influence in the world is limited to its payments of tens of millions of dollars to bribed heads of foreign governments , such as Egypt ’s and Pakistan’s .
The Bush regime even thinks that as it has bought and paid for Musharraf , he will stand aside and permit Bush to make air strikes inside Pakistan .
Is Bush blind to the danger that he will cause an Islamic revolution within Pakistan that will depose the US puppet and present the Middle East with an Islamic state armed with nuclear weapons ?
Considering the instabilities and dangers that abound , the aggressive posture of the Bush regime goes far beyond recklessness .
The Bush regime is the most irresponsibly aggressive regime the world has seen since Hitler’s .

Congressional Republicans picked a bad time for a new series of corruption scandals .
This happens to be the week in which both chambers are considering major new ethics reform measures .
The good news is , the House passed its measure today by a wide margin .
The bad news is , there ’s at least one Senate Republican for whom chutzpah has no meaning .
Republican Sen . Ted Stevens , whose home back in Alaska was raided by federal investigators Monday in a wide - ranging corruption investigation , has threatened to place a hold on the Democratic - drafted ethics legislation just passed by the House and expected on the Senate floor by week ’s end .
The senator told a closed session of fellow Republicans today , including Vice President Dick Cheney , that he was upset that the measure would interfere with his travel to and from Alaska — and vowed to block it .
The same guy who ’s likely to be busted for taking bribes is blocking the Senate from voting on an ethics reform bill ?
I often feel sorry for satirists ;
Republicans must make it tough for writers to exaggerate for comedic effect .

The Honorable Nancy Pelosi
Speaker of the House
U.S. House of Representatives
Washington , D.C. 20515
Via email .
Dear Speaker Pelosi :
I write to you today with the results of two years of research on the subject of the creation of broadcast - quality video of congressional proceedings for download on the Internet .
My conclusion can be summarized as follows :
By the end of the 110th Congress , the U.S. House of Representatives could achieve the goal of providing broadcast - quality video of all hearings and the floor for download on the Internet .
In early 2005 , when I joined the Center for American Progress as a Senior Fellow and Chief Technology Officer , John Podesta asked me to look into the question of the video record of the U.S. Congress .
This issue was a natural one for both of us .
John , of course , served many years in senior staff positions in the Senate , and has always had a strong interest in technology policy .
When I created the first radio station on the Internet , one of my first actions was to apply for broadcast credentials with the U.S. Congress , where I was able to create the first webcasts from the floor of the House and Senate starting with Bill Clinton 's State of the Union Address in 1995 .
I was also able to work with the Joint Economic Committee later that year to do the first on - line congressional hearings .
01 http://museum.media.org/radio/
02 http://town.hall.org/radio/JEC
My investigation into the question of whether broadcast - quality video from all congressional hearings can be made available on the Internet for download was conducted in two stages .
In stage 1 , I conducted an extensive feasibility analysis , examining all the technical and financial issues involved .
In stage 2 , I created a proof - of - concept prototype to get hands - on experience with the current congressional webcasts and to demonstrate how one might apply more systematic techniques towards creation of an archive .
Stage 1 : Feasibility Analysis
There are two ways that video is produced for a congressional hearing :
Through the media .
Directly from the committee .
A member of the media obtains credentials from the United States Senate Radio - Television Gallery , which manages the credentials - granting process on behalf of the United States House of Representatives Radio - Television Gallery .
While there are issues with the composition of the gallery , in particular the ban on “ new media , ” membership applications enforced by congressional employees acting to shield the “ old media ” Executive Committee from competition , I believe focusing on the media is to lose focus on the needs of the public and the responsibilities of the U.S. Congress to provide a complete record .
The media , by definition , will choose what they want to cover .
On any given day , there may be a dozen simultaneous hearings in the U.S. House of Representatives , and even with a greatly expanded gallery membership , it is unlikely that the media would choose to provide a comprehensive video record of all hearings .
However , just because an event is not worthy of the evening news does not mean it should be omitted from the public record or not made available on the Internet to reach the “ long tail ” it provides .
My investigation thus focused primarily on what it would take for the U.S. Congress to directly provide this permanent video record in the form of broadcast - quality video for download on the Internet .
The term “ broadcast - quality ” is subject to interpretation , and I believe some flexibility should be maintained in specifying this standard , leaving individual committees to determine the parameters based on operational considerations .
However , for purposes of illustration and based on my own personal experience , I would consider broadcast - quality to be an 8 mbps stream of H.264 - encoded video using the NTSC standard with a 48 - Khz stereo audio stream , delivered in an MPEG4 format .
This is approximately 3.6 gigabytes per hour of video .
While this may sound large , there are numerous sites on the Internet working with this quality of data or even significantly better standards such as 1080i or 720 p High - Definition video .
In the course of my investigation of this topic , I held numerous discussions with senior scientists who are experts in computer networking and video encoding and transmission .
I discussed the matter in depth with teams from Cisco , Google , and Sun Microsystems , and brought the matter up directly with protocol architects who are the authors of the standards that are used today for “ webcasting ” and other live and streaming media services .
I also spent considerable time examining the physical infrastructure on Capitol Hill and in the Washington , D.C. area .
I met with technical staff from Verizon , Switch and Data , and Equinix .
I discussed the matter with routing experts who are responsible for much of the Internet infrastructure that is used to connect the Washington area to both commercial networking fabric and to the Research and Education networks such as Internet2 and National LambdaRail .
I met repeatedly with the Chief Information Officer and other officials from Georgetown University and other area institutions that maintain large network presences .
In addition to these numerous technical consultations , I met with officials from the Government Printing Office , who said such a goal was very much in the spirit of their own Strategic Vision for the 21st Century .
In a letter to me on July 27 , 2006 , Bruce R. James , the Public Printer of the United States , was very supportive of the concept of “ live and permanently archived video from Congressional and Executive branch public proceedings on the Internet . ”
Mr. James encouraged me to continue my consultations and to keep his Chief Technology Officer and the Superintendent of Documents informed as to my conclusions .
Finally , I met numerous times with staff members of the Gallery and with staff from many committees to learn of progress on technical issues such as the wiring of committee rooms and the installation of cameras .
From first - hand experience , I understand how difficult it is to wire these historic facilities .
I was very pleased to learn of your recent efforts to accelerate the pace of these efforts , and my discussions with your staff lead me to believe that the pace is such that there is no doubt that every committee room will have cameras in the next two years .
The physical infrastructure will thus soon be in place to provide systematic , comprehensive coverage of each hearing .
I will not discuss all of those details in this letter , but if anybody is interested there is a technical lecture on - line I gave on the topic to the Google engineering staff as part of their “ tech - talk ” series :
03 http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2633159172413478267
While the technical issues are complex , the bottom line is very simple .
I have absolutely no doubt that it is technically and financially feasible within 2 years for the U.S. Congress to provide broadcast - quality video from every hearing and from the floor for download on the Internet .
Just because something is feasible does not mean that it is desirable .
Providing this data is a policy choice not a technical question .
I thus turn now to the question of what such a video record might mean .
Stage 2 : Proof of Concept Prototype
For two weeks starting February 26 , 2007 , I set about systematically “ ripping ” webcast video streams from congressional committees , transcoding the data , and uploading the hearings to the Internet Archive and to Google Video .
( “ Ripping ” is the process of converting something that is only available as a webcast stream into a file .
“ Transcoding ” is converting the format of the video . )
I picked the Internet Archive and Google Video as examples of one non-profit and one for - profit entity , but they are simply examples .
There are literally hundreds of services — from YouTube to universities and everything in - between — that would be able to use this data .
The question I asked myself in creating these hearings on two different video upload sites was whether there is added value in having many different ways of looking at the U.S. Congress , or whether the current system of depending solely on the committees ' webcast and web presence is sufficient .
In other words , should the U.S. Congress be the sole “ retail ” provider of a presence to people through house.gov , or would it be better if the U.S. Congress also played a “ wholesale ” role by providing bulk data to be processed by other systems ?
Note that the terms “ retail ” and “ wholesale ” are used to differentiate between direct service to end users and bulk distribution of raw data , and do not imply any financial transactions .
All U.S. government data is , of course , in the public domain and available at no charge .
In the course of two weeks of processing congressional hearings , I was able to download , transcode , and upload 63 hearings for a total of 160 hours and 43 minutes of video .
You may see the Internet Archive version of this video here :
04 http://www.archive.org/search.php?query=hooptedoodle
You will notice that this particular service has some features that are not available on congressional web sites .
For example , users are able to annotate hearings with ratings and reviews .
The site allows users to both download and stream video , and the video has been converted to a non-proprietary standard that works across all different operating systems and players .
And , because I am drawing on hearings from several different committees , it offers a degree of unification not available from the house.gov sites , which are all administered seperately .
In addition , users can easily navigate the archive by a series of keywords .
For example , one can search for all hearings from a particular committee , such as the Committee on Appropriations :
05 http://www.archive.org/search.php?query=appropriations.house.gov
The Committee on Appropriations illustrates the importance of maintaining an archive .
Appropriations , along with Foreign Affairs , Ways and Means and several other committees have a current policy of offering a live webcast , but not maintaining an archive of their proceedings .
This means that the prototype that I have built contains the only video archive on the Internet for these committees , making me the point of origination for the data .
I do not believe that it is appropriate for a private citizen such as myself to be the point of origination for the public video record of these committees .
Another issue that I uncovered in the course of transcoding this video was that all the committees provide video encoded with proprietary technologies .
Indeed , several commiteees go so far as to say that the use of Microsoft software is “ required ” to interact with the committee and provide the company with free ads with links into the Microsoft site to get products .
Even if the committee chooses to publish their video in a proprietary format , it is simply not correct technically to say that this video must be viewed on Microsoft 's products : these files could just as easily be played using open source tools such as VLC media player , Democracy Player , or MPlayer .
Any member of the public should be able to choose to use Microsoft software , but to maintain that the software is “ required ” is a commercial endorsement by the U.S. Congress that has monetary value to the company previously mentioned .
In the course of building this prototype , I was able to examine the video quality of the webcasts of a large number of committees .
The quality of the webcasts ranges from barely acceptable to very , very bad .
In some cases , the committees provide a video picture of 160 by 120 pixels at 10 frames per second , video quality that is significantly worse than that which I used in 1993 when I was doing some of the first webcasts on the Internet .
( I should also note that the process of ripping and then transcoding further degrades quality , an issue that did not concern me in building the proof of concept prototype and which would not occur if the full - resolution files were available for download . )
Even the best webcasts are not of adequate quality to be of use in video production , even at the consumer level with software such as iMovie , let alone for a film or news production .
The video cameras installed in the Capitol are very good and there are no technical obstacles to offering better quality .
It is simply a matter of a few more bits .
Files can easily be uploaded to an FTP server where the miracle of Internet distribution will move the data out into the rest of the world , so there are no capacity issues to worry about .
Providing bigger files and distributing them on the net is a question of policy , not a technical issue .
To illustrate the difference better quality makes , I have posted two versions of a hearing by the Committee on House Administration , which maintains one of the better web sites in house.gov .
The first URL below is a transcoding of the version offered by the Committee from their web site , transformed into a downloadable file , the procedure I used on all 63 hearings .
The second URL is taken directly from a DVD which I bought from C - SPAN and uploaded with their permission :
06 http://www.archive.org/details/gov.house.cha.05252006-final
07 http://www.archive.org/details/gov.house.cha.05252006-dvd
As can be seen , the C - SPAN version offers the viewer significantly better quality options .
A professional filmmaker or a news organization could download the full resolution version of the file , which is quite large .
A YouTuber or other mashup artist could download something smaller , and the casual viewer could simply watch a version directly on the site .
If one does n't like the “ look and feel ” of the Internet Archive , the whole point of making the data available in bulk is that there will be options .
Here is that same hearing on Google Video :
08 http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1058295326420473490
Notice that the presentation is very different .
Here , anybody can add a tag to the data or annotate , not just the document creator .
The site includes the ability to download a version preformatted for the iPod .
It thus becomes a matter of personal preference for members of the public to decide how best to consume their data .
Of the 63 hearings that were uploaded to the Internet Archive , 36 were uploaded to Google Video as a sanity check .
Here is the collection on that service :
09 http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=hooptedoodle
As a further proof of concept , I took the hearing from C - SPAN , available under their new license policy , and uploaded it to Azureus , a service based on the BitTorrent peer - to - peer protocol :

Conclusions
I offer my prototypes not as an illustration of what I think a congressional web site should look like , or even a model of what a fully - developed external site might look like , but simply to illustrate why the U.S. Congress should take advantage of the “ network effect ” of having data available in bulk for others to work with .
It is , of course , vital that the U.S. Congress be the official source of all this data , offering a permanent , public archive of proceedings and hearings .
Providing broadcast - quality video from all congressional hearings for download on the Internet will encourage the dissemination of this data and the creation of new and exciting ways for the public to interact with their elected representatives .
Based on 25 years of experience in the field of computer networking and a 2 - year investigation of this specific issue , I have absolutely no doubt that it is technically and financially feasible for the U.S. Congress to provide a permanent broadcast - quality video record of proceedings and hearings for download on the Internet .
Technically speaking , this is a “ no - brainer . ”
This is simply a matter of will .
Adopting a goal that by the end of the 110th Congress , the U.S. House of Representatives will offer broadcast - quality video of the floor and all hearings for download on the Internet is a reachable goal and one that will set a standard for transparency and openness .
Your leadership in embracing this goal would set an example for all branches of the federal government , indeed for all governments here and abroad .
If a hearing is to be considered truly public , the public has to be able to see it , both now and forever .
I encourage you to adopt this standard as a goal for the 110th Congress .
Respectfully yours ,
Carl Malamud

Twenty - two inches from quivering whisker to fat tail , they can chomp through concrete and leap more than two feet in the air .
Sauntering down your street in broad daylight , insolently raising two claws to the binman , they rifle through your rubbish and scoff poison as if it was milk chocolate .
There is something of the night and also something of the urban myth about the nearly indestructible super rat coming to a pile of carelessly discarded foodstuffs near you .
But Britain 's pest controllers are adamant : they are receiving more panicky reports of rodent infestation than ever , and it does seem that our rats are evolving into something not seen before .
Over the past five years , the number of infestations of Rattus norvegicus , better known as the brown rat , has steadily increased , according to figures collected by the National Pest Technician 's Association .
Infestation dipped last year by 8 % but is widely forecast to rise this year , and the association suspects that the true infestation figure only fell last year because fewer people report incidences now that many local authorities charge for pest control services .
Meanwhile , people report bigger , and bolder , rats .
Pest control professionals recently reported catching one beast in south London that measured 22 inches long .
So has the creature we know as the sewer rat , the barn rat , the love rat and the lab rat evolved into a new breed of super rat ?
" It 's not so much [ a ] super rat in terms of being 2ft long and two stone in weight , " says Oliver Madge , chief executive officer of the British Pest Control Association .
" Food is the key .
They have a better reproduction rate and a better chance of survival .
[ The new rat is ] not super - but it 's certainly a strong species coming through because they 've got the food and the climate is milder . "
But the super rat is n't just a healthier , better - fed rat : " Traditional poisons are n't working , " says Madge .
" They are eating and feeding from the poison .
They can consume what we call a lethal dose and it does n't kill them . "
Experts say the main reason for the rise in the numbers of rats is obvious : from the milky bread thrown out for the birds to that carelessly tied sack of Sunday leftovers , we as a society are producing more food waste and chucking it out more carelessly .
The rat are not the only scavenger whose numbers are increasing .
It is not quite an ecosystem that has evolved around the rubbish bin but it is not far off , and various species certainly give each other a helping paw when it comes to raiding our trash .
Old - fashioned black binbags are easily ripped open by urban foxes or cats , for example , encouraging mice and rats to feast on what is inside .
Virtually rodent - proof wheelie bins are a different matter - but this is where the squirrels have a role to play .
" It is very difficult for rats to get inside a wheelie bin but squirrels have learned how to flip the lids open if there is a lip on the bin .
They are very dextrous , " says Madge .
The super rat has evolved thanks to all this dining from the table of man .
As people pile high the KFC leftovers and Indian takeaways , and toss away half - eaten megaburgers when their stomachs can't take any more abuse , our ratty friends acquire a symbiotic addiction to rubbishy food .
According to Martina Flynn of Sorex , whose scientists have developed three of the four main pest - control chemicals , rodents have become so used to munching protein - heavy fast foods in certain urban centres that they refuse to eat the carbohydrates and cereal traditionally used as bait or poison .
" The rats and mice are forever keeping ahead of us and making it hard for us , " says Flynn .
She believes that few rodents develop full physiological resistance to poisons , although it does take a bigger dose to kill them off these days , but behavioural resistance is another problem .
" Rats are very neophobic - which means they are wary of new objects .
You can put a bait down and they wo n't touch it for 10 days , " she says .
Many people blame the rise of the fortnightly rubbish collection for the rise of the super rat .
One third of local councils have abolished weekly ( or daily ) collections of rubbish and pick up nonrecycleable rubbish only once every two weeks .
For residents unable to keep their wheelie bins safely stowed in the backyard , this means that there are plenty of ways their rubbish can be scattered far and wide during the long wait for collection .
In one area , a council official reportedly advised residents to freeze their roast - dinner carcasses until collection day .
It caused outrage but sounds sensible enough .
As it happens , councils are not legally required to collect rubbish every week , and the government has no plans to force the issue .
And expert opinion agrees a weekly collection is not necessary , provided the proper precautions are taken .
" It is not essential from a health - risk point of view in this country for rubbish to be collected once a week , " says Howard Price of the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health .
" Fortnightly collections may be adequate but only if the containers provided are big enough and properly lidded so that the waste is safely contained and does not spill out .
It must also be collected promptly and efficiently with no spillage on to the street during collection . "
If you are under siege from the super rat , there is one place you could go .
This time last year , the Hebridean isle of Canna had a human population of 11 and a rat population of nearly 10,000 .
The rats had gnawed through supposedly rodent - proof composters and seriously damaged bird populations .
The National Trust for Scotland called in a team of ratcatchers from New Zealand .
When food was scarce last winter , 14 catchers laid 4,200 bait stations filled with a low - toxicity bait rarely used in Europe .
Wheelie bins were also introduced and residents agreed not to keep chickens ( whose scattered food the rats enjoyed nibbling ) .
" The last confirmed rat presence was in February , " says Richard Luxmoore of the trust .
" I 'm not saying we 've completely got rid of the rats but if there are any left we 've got remarkably few " .
Personal Statement of " IT Pro "
16 July 2007
My journey towards FBI employment began several years ago .
I have a family friend that is a retired Special Agent and a college acquaintance that is a current Agent .
I became interested in joining the FBI under their Computer Science entry program , aiming to eventually specialize in high - technology crime .
While all my work experience is in the field of computers and technology , I have virtually no formal training .
I spent the next two and a half years working on earning the credentials to meet the FBI 's required qualifications .
I took classes part - time and ended up spending several thousand dollars to put myself through technical training classes to earn an advanced Cisco networking certification .
Certificate in hand , I completed my FBI application the next day .
A month or two later I was contacted to take the written portion of the exam , which I passed .
Some time after that I was told that I had been selected for the oral interview .
The Applicant Coordinator for my local field office was very helpful .
She gave an extensive pre-interview session for a number of applicants , giving us tips on the interview process and how to prepare .
After I received my interview date I spent the next week preparing in earnest .
It paid off , I passed the interview .
I was ecstatic .
The hard part was over , I honestly believed that the job was in the bag .
The next step , of course , was the polygraph .
I had done some research , found AntiPolygraph.org , and read the Lie Behind the Lie Detector , but for whatever reason I decided that I did not need to employ any special countermeasures .
Those who know me know that I am an honest person .
Other than drinking before the age of 21 , I have never used an illegal drug .
I have never stolen from an employer or been accused or convicted of any crime .
I figured this should n't be a problem .
I was naive .
The polygraph followed the standard procedure documented on AntiPolygraph.org .
I was conscious of my breathing , because I was slightly nervous , but I tried to remain calm and breathe normally .
At several points the blood - pressure cuff was inflated so tightly that it was causing physical pain , but I chose not to mention it because I honestly thought the polygrapher would take that as a sign of trying to alter the test results .
By the end of the test I was told the results were not coming back the way he wanted .
As has been documented elsewhere , I was given the chance to " admit " what was bothering me , though I assured him there was nothing .
I was told that the questions relating to my truthfulness on the employment application were showing signs of deception .
In reality I had been 100 % honest on my application .
Eventually , after a few more rounds of trying to get a confession out of me I was told that the results were inconclusive but that he would send them to headquarters anyway .
I honestly thought that this was all a bluff that they tried on everyone and that I would move on to the next step .
After a few weeks the polygrapher called me to say that he wanted to do a follow - up test to resolve a few issues , and that this was " pretty standard " .
I agreed and we went through an abbreviated version of the same test .
At the end I was again given the routine of digging for a confession , and when I admitted that there was nothing to confess I was told that I had failed .
I was crushed .
My Applicant Coordinator called me soon after and recommended that I write a letter to ask for a retest .
She seemed genuinely sympathetic , and to this day I believe she really wanted me to pass , and believed that I could .
I wrote the letter and then called several times over the next few months to follow up .
I was eventually granted a retest with a different polygrapher at a different field office .
I wo n't go into the details , but it was pretty much the same story .
This time I employed countermeasures , but I believe that it was already too late .
At the end I was told that my questions regarding drug use were showing signs of deception .
Strange , since I had supposedly passed that section the last time .
The section on application truthfulness was apparently fine this time around !
Of course it 's all or nothing , so it makes little difference .
It was over , again .
My conditional offer of employment was rescinded and my Applicant Coordinator never called back .
The dream job that I had been preparing for for years is now unavailable to me forever .
This page contains my latest renders and works - in - progress .
Some projects will be completely new and some may seem familar .
As technology improves over the years I like to revisit earlier concepts and see if I can update them .
My newest work is available only to the DB Members who support me .
These images are changable for up to a week ( maybe two ) after I first post them as I fix things and find improvements .
Member feedback is important to me so please leave a rating and comment on the images that interest you .
