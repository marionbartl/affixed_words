BARCELONA , Spain ( Reuters ) - Dwindling numbers of birds worldwide are a sign that governments are failing to keep promises to slow damage to nature by 2010 , an international report said on Thursday .

Rising human populations and clearance of forests for farming or biofuels were wrecking natural habitats , according to the study by Birdlife International , which groups experts in more than 100 conservation bodies worldwide .
Even common birds , such as doves or skylarks in Europe , were becoming scarcer in a worrying sign of wider upsets to nature .
Birds are among the best researched of all wildlife and are a barometer of the environment .
“ Bird species are slipping faster than ever towards extinction , ” according to Birdlife ’s “ State of the World ’s Birds ” report issued at an International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) congress in Barcelona .
In May , Birdlife International data for an IUCN “ Red List ” of endangered species showed that one in eight , or 1,226 of almost 10,000 bird species , were at risk of extinction with new threats including climate change .
Birds ’ decline showed governments were failing to live up to a commitment made at the U.N. Earth Summit in 2002 to achieve a significant reduction in the rate of loss of diversity of animals and plants by 2010 , the report said .
“ With two years to go , birds are showing that we are falling far short of the target , and that , far from slowing down , the rate of biodiversity loss is still accelerating , ” it said .
LONG RECORDS
Alison Stattersfield , head of science for Birdlife and lead author of the report , told Reuters : “ Birds are a good indicator for the wider environment because we have such long records .
“ People notice that there are n’t so many birds around , even ones that are common . ” she said .
Millions of amateur birdwatchers have helped ensure longer and better records than for other creatures such as amphibians or insects .
Stattersfield said birds had been tracked by the “ Red List ” since 1988 , the longest of any type of creature .
Since then , 225 species have been listed as under greater threat , compared with just 17 whose status has improved .
Since 2000 , three species were feared to have become extinct -- Spix ’s macaw in Brazil , the Hawaiian crow and the poo-uli , also in Hawaii , according to the report ( www.birdlife.org/sowb).
Among bird families , 82 percent of albatrosses were threatened , 60 percent of cranes , 27 percent of parrots , 23 percent of pheasants and 20 percent of pigeons .
Big birds that produce few eggs seemed most at risk .
Humans use about half of all species of birds , mainly as pets or as food .
Among other uses , birds help keep insect pests in check in farmland and forests .

Homeland Security chief Michael Chertoff sat down with Threat Level on Monday in Silicon Valley to talk about laptop searches at the border , the government 's new - found interest in computer security , and the continuing saga of overeager terrorist watch lists .
Among the revelations :
It seems blog comments inspired him to propose a laptop - tracking application for those who had their computers seized at the border .
He also explained why watch - list mismatches are the airlines ' fault , and why the government is too secret .
__
Wired.com:__
There have been quite a few security czars over the years , but sometime last year , cybersecurity became important .
What changed ?
Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff : I 'm going to give credit to Mike McConnell , the director of national intelligence .
When I came on board and we looked at the entire department three - and - a - half years ago , one of the issues we saw was that we did n't have a very mature cybersecurity program .
We have US - CERT , which does good work , but we did n't have a program much beyond that .
Frankly , it was hard to get people to explain what they thought our value - add to the program would be .
It 's not like we are inventing software or firewalls or are competing with McAfee or companies like that .
We could talk about creating a forum where the cyber community could come together and share information , but that seemed like pretty weak tea .
But last year , Mike McConnell and I sat down … and really began talking through what do we do to deal with this issue – the problem is getting greater .
We have had intrusions .
We have had the theft of information over the internet .
We are concerned about denial - of - service attacks .
We saw the attacks in Estonia .
The sense was we could n't not deal with the problem because it was hard .
And as I became better acquainted with some of the tools other parts of the government use in terms of capabilities for cybersecurity , that we have used for [ the Department of Defense and ] for the intelligence community , for example , I was persuaded – it did n't take a lot of persuasion – that there ought to be a way to translate this into civilian domains .
And there are two parts to this .
One , we have to protect our own civilian assets – meaning the dot - gov assets .
And there what is involved is getting a hold on the number of access points between .gov domains and the internet , and finding a way to progress from our current Einstein model [ DHS 's Intrusion Detection Software ] , which is the passive detection - after - the - fact model , into a real - time detection tool and possibly even a defensive capability with respect to our networks connecting to the internet .
And just getting a handle on that would be a huge benefit in terms of protecting our assets against espionage and also against the possibility of an attack .
The larger challenge – and frankly one that is further out – is to find a way to partner with the private sector to enable and encourage them with some to the capabilities that we have to increase their defensive capacities , but on a voluntary basis , meaning not making them do it or regulating them into doing it .
But instead offering them the opportunity – much the same in the non-cyber - world , we go to people who run power plants and dams and we share information and best practices that they can use to defend their own assets .
__
Wired.com : __When you hear talk of cyberwar , people start talking about power plants going down and you get cascading problems .
Do we need legislation to give DHS the power to regulate those who run critical infrastructure ?
Chertoff : I 'd be hesitant to go there with private sector .
With the Federal Aviation Administration or other government agencies , I think it is different .
I think with the private sector the model is the cooperative model .
They have a very strong interest in protecting their assets .
But they also have to make a choice about how much they want to partner with the government .
The one thing we do n't want to do , because the culture of the internet is opposed to anything that smacks of government clumsy heavy - handedness , is that we do n't want to be sitting on the internet , like certain other countries do , where people suspect we are limiting what people can see .
We do n't want to force people to do what they do n't want to do .
We do n't want them to think we are intruding into their private space .
There is an interdependence on the internet that puts a premium on being a responsible citizen .
If you fail to protect your own assets , it does n't just affect your assets , it affects the assets of everyone linked up to you .
So pretty soon , someone who does n't do a responsible job is going to find themselves ostracized .
The business community is pretty good at understanding that , when they have a threat , and there is capability to defend against the threats , if you do n't exhaust every reasonable means , pretty soon you will end up being sued and you will be in bankruptcy court .
They have a natural incentive to protect their assets .
Wired.com:__
__What is your threat model ?
Is the threat level that high ?
__Chertoff : __There are nation states and non-nation states that have the ability to penetrate and filch information and there are certainly other countries in that area as sophisticated as we are – or close to it – so naturally you worry about that .
I think you worry about intrusions that steal valuable intellectual property , and you worry to an even greater degree about corruption or disruption of processes .
By corruption , I mean someone enters the financial sector and you begin to corrupt how the system works and it becomes unreliable , people begin to find out they have lost money from their bank account .
The reliability of the system becomes compromised .
There is no question in terms of espionage :
It has already materialized .
There is a huge amount of penetration of certain government systems that we have had to contend with .
Now we are able to defend against a lot of this , but some of it has not been defended against and some of this is out in public
We had the Estonian experience in terms of an attack actually on a system .
If we wait till someone tries this the first time , its going to be a really unhappy circumstance .
Just ask [ Treasury Secretary ] Hank Paulson .
If someone takes out a bank , and all of a sudden you do n't know any more if your money is safe , that imperils the entire banking system .
There are some people who believe the current generation of terrorists wants a big visible bang .
But you know , the next generation may not want a big visible bang .
They might take a quiet satisfaction in watching the entire financial system shutter .
__ Wired.com : __Could we talk about laptops and the borders ?
( ed. note :
The government reserves the right to look through any laptop or electronic device crossing the border , saying it is no different from any other luggage .
DHS published the official policy on its website just weeks ago . )
__Chertoff : __This is something that has been done since there were laptops ...
It is not a new program .
It is a program that affects only a small number of people .
And contrary to what the ACLU says , it is constitutional , because the courts say it is constitutional , including the 9th Circuit most recently .
The only thing that happened recently is that I ordered the policy to be put online in the interests of openness and transparency .
We get about 80 million people a year coming to our airports , and a very small number are put into secondary inspection and that 's based on some suspicion that the inspector has about the person .
It is that pool of people in secondary that have their things gone through , they can have their luggage and documents gone through .
And nowadays because you can bring contraband through on a laptop , they can have their laptop looked at .
You are looking for material that is contraband itself , such as child pornography or information about how to set up remote control
IEDs .
Or if they are non-Americans , you are looking for information on the laptop about why they should not be admitted .
In many cases , we open the laptop and look at it right there .
There are some cases where it is encrypted or it is difficult to assess , we may hold on to laptop for purpose of having someone more expert look at it .
If it turns out there 's nothing there of criminal nature or significant in terms of national security or admission to the country , we return the laptop and expunge the information and it evaporates .
If it turns out there is significant information , we may return the laptop and keep the info , or if the laptop is itself evidence of a crime , then once we have PC [ probable cause ] determination we keep it .
One thing I am thinking of doing is creating a better tracking system so if we do take a laptop off the premises , we find a way to let them track it and after a certain number of days they can inquire about when it going to be returned or what the situation is .
Wired.com:__
__Would n't it allay the suspicions of the business community if you had a policy that says we only search through laptops if we have a good reason to do so ?
__Chertoff : __That 's exactly why I put it up on the internet .
It is on the web to say , ' We only do it when we put you into secondary and we only put you into secondary when there is a suspicion , when there is a reason to suspect something . '
We were trying to say we do n't take everyone 's laptop and suck it up into a giant vacuum cleaner .
There is some basis for suspicion the inspectors use , and they are the same they have used for decades .
We posted [ about the policy ] on the Leadership blog and we got a lot of comments .
So I said , ' Let 's look at all the comments and if there is something we can clarify in the policy because there is a persistent issue , we will do it . '
I am willing to treat this as a bit of an experiment in interactive policy - making .
For example , it seemed to bother people , from what I was told , when a laptop is taken elsewhere .
So that 's where I came up with idea of finding a way to assure people they wo n't lose their laptop .
We are going to track it and make sure we can account for when it is and when they will get it back .
So I am willing to do this back and forth in interactive way .

__Since people could simply store things on servers or use Gmail , does n't the program just get at low - hanging fruit ?
__Chertoff : __I 'm going to tell you a story from real life .
When
I was a prosecutor we had had wiretaps for criminal cases for years – it was a well - known thing .
But time and again I would hear the following on a wiretap : " I hope no one is listening in because if they are we are going to jail . "
The truth is it is very hard to perfectly avoid being captured if you are doing something wrong simply by saying , ' I 'm not going to put it on my laptop .
I will put it somewhere else . '
They are going to have to be worrying that the other place they are keeping it , the cloud , is being penetrated
Now is it impossible ?
No , a perfect terrorist could find a way to circumvent this .
But if I can reduce the risk by getting rid of 99
percent , I am way ahead of the game .
Wired.com:__
__If you have an encrypted laptop and you are an American citizen and you come back to the border and you get pulled aside for secondary , they want to look through the laptop and you do n't want to give the password , what happens ?
__Chertoff : __That 's being litigated .
I think our view is that you can be required to open it up , in much the same way , that if you have a briefcase and it is locked and you do n't want to open the lock .
And the hunch is that 's a circumstance where the laptop might be seized and taken elsewhere to be decrypted .
[ In response to a follow - up e-mail , spokesman Russ Knocke clarified .
" Constitutionally ,
U.S. citizens are permitted entry into the country .
However , if they are carrying contraband such as illegal narcotics , they may be taken into custody .
In the hypothetical circumstance that a U.S. citizen is entering the country with an encrypted laptop , and that individual is even referred to secondary in the first place , and then that individual refuses to cooperate by providing a password ( again , even if we were to get this point ) , then the laptop could be seized and de-encrypted . " ]

__Almost seven years after 9/11 , there are still reports of problems with the government 's watch lists .
Most recently , Jim
Robinson , a former assistant attorney general , says he is stuck on the list .
__Chertoff : __In the airport environments , supposing there is a terrorist Jim Smith and that person should be on the watch list , the question is how do you distinguish them from the other Jim Smiths and the answer is you need an additional bit of data , such as a birthday .
That would override or eliminate most false positives .
In order to allow people to do this , [ beginning ] about two or three months ago , people who are selectees can give their frequent flier number or birthday , the airline can enter it in system and they can enter that at the kiosk or at home and they can get their boarding pass and it wo n't be an issue .
One airline has done that very well .
There are some airlines that have not done that .
They do n't want to reconfigure their software , it 's not an issue of customer service they care about , and if there are false positives they can blame the government .
We would like to reconfigure in the next year ... so we do the checking .
Some of the airlines do n't want to do that because they would have to reconfigure their software .
So that 's why there was a discussion recently about whether we should fine airlines that do n't correct this problem .
There is a system for correcting this and which is adding another data point , but the people running the system have to be willing to reconfigure the system .
If they do n't care , then the problem is going to continue .
Wired.com:__
__But there is no mechanism for me to say I 'm not doing what you think I am doing ?
__Chertoff : __There is a redress program .
The easiest thing to resolve is that you are not the person we are worried about .
The hardest thing to resolve is that you are worried about me , but you should n't be – because , to be honest , there are people who are dangerous who lie about being dangerous .
And if you tell why you have them on list , they will reconfigure or readjust their behavior to not leave the traces that are a problem .
There may be people for whom it is inconvenient to be patted down or asked a few questions .
The downside is that if we do n't do that except if we have proof someone is an actual terrorist , you are going to have a Mohammed Atta getting on an airplane or crossing the border and that 's going to raise the risk .
Wired.com:__
__At what point do stops by law enforcement and four - hour holdups at the airport become a punishment that you can actually protest ?
__Chertoff : __Particularly with respect to Americans , the number of people that are on the list that are not false positives are not that large a number .
And if they do raise an issue , we will take a look at what the basis is .
And sometimes we will make adjustments .
But if you are asking if we would do a court process where we litigate it , I mean , that effectively would shut it down .
And then I guarantee what would happen is this :
If you stopped using the watch list and basically anybody could get on a plane without knowing their identity , sooner or later something would happen – and people would lose their lives , and then there would be another 9/11
Commission and we'd hear about how you had this system and you would have kept them off and these people lost their loved ones on a plane .
I do n't know if they do it anymore , but when I was a kid we all had polio shots , and after a while , you just do n't know anyone with polio .
And the question was raised was , why are we taking these shots ?
There 's not that much polio around .
And one of the reasons there 's not that much polio around is that everyone is getting inoculated .
Wired.com:__
__You are talking about sharing information and this being an open process , but so much of the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative is secret .
Homeland Security Presidential Directive 23
\– which authorized the program – there 's still not an unclassified version of it .
You can talk about Einstein , but there are other things you can't talk about .
There 's reportedly $ 20 billion in the classified intelligence budget for cyber -security .
From the outside , it 's hard to know what 's going on .
With that much secrecy , it sounds like security through obscurity .
__Chertoff : __I
think secrecy is one of the hard issues .
That 's because the culture of the internet is an open culture and I would like to see us be as open as possible .
It 's obvious that some things can't be open because they compromise things that , if known to others , would diminish our ability to do certain things , whether that be acquire information or take certain steps
We will have to figure out how to be open to the extent we can while recognizing you live in a world where openness can be a problem too .
It is my fervent hope that more and more of the strategy will be public and only things that really have to be kept secret will be kept secret .
But once something is out it is out – so there is hesitancy and deliberativeness about making things public .
But in this case we tried to make public early we were thinking about this .
Wired.com:__
__How do people know this is n't a program about sitting on the internet and monitoring everything ?
__Chertoff : __That 's why I think the easy part is the government piece , because clearly with government domains , you have a right to protect your own domain .
And that 's why I emphasize the voluntariness .
I think the key to the approach is one where the government offers to work with the private sector .
But it has to be consent - based .
If you do n't want any part of it , then you can walk away .

SAN FRANCISCO / NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - EBay
Inc said it will cut 10 percent of its work force and spend about $ 1.3 billion to buy online payment and classified companies to counter a slowdown in its main web auctions business .

Shares of eBay fell by as much as 12 percent on Monday , their lowest level in more than five years , after the company also said third - quarter revenue would hit the low end of its forecast .
Shares clawed their way back to close at $ 17.89 , down $ 1.05 or 5.5 percent , on the Nasdaq .
Investors are concerned the U.S. housing slump , higher fuel prices and a growing financial crisis are taking a greater toll on eBay ’s auctions .
Some also questioned one of eBay ’s purchases , Bill Me Later , which offers consumers deferred payments and financing promotions , as the credit crisis grips global markets .
The most significant layoffs in the San Jose , California - based company ’s history will affect about 1,000 employees and 600 temporary workers , across a variety of jobs and locations at eBay and PayPal , its online payments service .
The reduction is expected to incur restructuring charges of about $ 70 million to $ 80 million , mostly in the fourth quarter , but save $ 150 million annually thereafter .
Chief Executive John Donahoe told Reuters the company would reinvest resources into its auctions business , whether through lower prices , coupons or improving user experience .
It would also plow the proceeds into higher - growth areas like PayPal and classifieds .
“ This is not in any way tied to the short term .
This is tied to simplifying the organization ... to compete over 12 to 18 months , ” Donahoe said .
“ This is a time when eBay is putting its foot on the gas in terms of investing for future growth . ”
Auctions growth has slowed in the last few years , with a wealth of online deals at other sites and greater competition from the likes of online retailer Amazon.com Inc , which has cut into eBay ’s market share .
In the past year , the company lowered its up - front listing fees to lure more sellers and offered more fixed - price listings , which appeal to buyers .
EBay also increased fraud protections and incentives such as coupons .
Pacific Crest analyst Steve Weinstein called the job cuts “ responsible ” .
He predicted that sales in eBay ’s U.S. auctions business will have declined from a year ago when they report on October 15 .
“ If you ca n’t fix your top line , you have to address the cost structure , ” Weinstein said .
The cost - cutting , he said , was “ a positive happening amid some broader negatives .
Yes , this is a good thing , but a declining core business is worse . ”
For the third quarter , eBay expected to hit the low end of its revenue forecast of $ 2.1 billion to $ 2.15 billion .
But it said it would exceed the high end of its earnings forecast range of 39 cents to 41 cents per share , before items .
Donahoe said the job cuts and acquisitions should make eBay more nimble and draw buyers to its site for the holiday shopping season .
“ We anticipate a fairly competitive holiday season where consumers will be looking to save that extra buck , ” Donahoe said .
“ Similarly , there are people who will be looking to make a little more money , to sell something . ”
CREDIT AND CLASSIFIEDS
EBay said it would buy the U.S. - based Bill Me Later payments service for about $ 820 million in cash and $ 125 million in options .
The No 2 online payments player will be combined with PayPal and is expected to generate $ 150 million in revenue in 2009 .
EBay sees the deal closing in the fourth quarter and adding to earnings in 2011 , while reducing operating earnings per share by 3 cents in the current fiscal year ’s fourth quarter and by 6 cents in 2009 .
EBay executives noted the deal price would have been double that sum a year earlier , and that Bill Me Later ’s features can appeal to consumers any economy .
“ You can have a wonderful credit business that continues to operate in a down market , ” said PayPal President Scott Thompson , who will oversee the unit .
When asked about the risks of any exposure to credit issues , Thompson said Bill Me Later was very selective in offering one - time deferred payment options to consumers .
EBay is also buying Danish online classifieds businesses Den Bla Avis and BilBasen for about $ 390 million , adding to a global portfolio of classified ad sites .
Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Jeffrey Lindsay said investors were concerned about the deals eating into eBay earnings , but that the acquisitions should help the company strategically .
“ In the current environment , people will find it more difficult to get credit to buy things online .
Provided they manage the risk carefully , Bill Me Later gives an excellent alternative , ” he said .
“ It might give a way that people will prefer to buy on eBay rather than go somewhere else . ”

Taking on McCain
Barack Obama is determined not to make the same mistake as John Kerry , who lost the 2004 election because he failed to respond quickly and aggressively to Republican attacks on his character and his war record in Vietnam .
The Obama camp has the resources to hit back .
Strategists say he will increase advertisement spending by 20 % a week until election day .
The Democrats are also focusing on McCain 's character - specifically his temperament , the not so subtle suggestions that at 72 he is too old to be president , and his former associations with a disgraced businessman .
Strategists say the pattern of thrust and parry will continue until election day - but do not expect Obama to get involved .
Obama is using television advertisements to take the fight to McCain , allowing him to remain statesmanlike and above the fray .
Erratic , or just too old ?
John McCain 's other big weakness as far as Obama is concerned is his reputation for losing his temper in senate committee rooms .
The questions about McCain 's temperament grew during last week 's crisis on the Wall Street bailout .
The Obama camp honed in on McCain 's apparent inability to keep his cool in a new ad yesterday , painting the Republican as " erratic in a crisis " .
Campaign supporters like Claire McCaskill , a senator from Missouri , kept the line going on the chat shows : " One day , no bailout .
The next day , a bailout .
One day , I 'm suspending my campaign .
The next day , I 'm not . "
Expect renewed calls for McCain to make a full release of his medical records .
George Bush
Obama in his own pronouncements has been trying to undercut McCain 's claim to be a maverick reformer by weighing him down with the legacy of George Bush .
The argument also tries to defuse McCain 's negative campaigns by labelling them a distraction .
" No wonder his campaign 's announced a plan to turn a page on the financial crisis , distract with dishonest , dishonorable assaults against Barack Obama , " said a new ad yesterday .
" We can't afford another president who 's this out of touch . "
Guilt by association
McCain 's biggest skeleton is his intervention on behalf of Charles Keating , a campaign contributor and Arizona businessman , who was convicted of fraud in the collapse of a savings and loan institution in the 1980s .
McCain met federal investigators on two occasions in 1987 at Keating 's behest , earning a rebuke from the Senate ethics committee .
McCain claims he learned from the mistake and that set him on his path of reform .
The Obama camp yesterday released a 13 - minute web documentary about Keating and sent out an email to supporters claiming " John McCain still has n't learned his lesson " .
Beliefs
Like Obama , McCain has a troublesome pastor in his past : the Reverend John Hagee .
McCain spent more than a year courting Hagee to win his endorsement during the Republican primary , only to renounce the association last February after footage emerged of the pastor describing the Nazi holocaust as part of God 's plan .
The association with Hagee could hurt the Republicans in Florida , where there is a large Jewish vote .
Sarah Palin also has a potential pastor disaster in the making , thanks to 2005 footage from her Assembly of God church in Alaska .
The footage shows Palin joining a visiting pastor on stage while he denounces witchcraft .
Expect more footage to emerge of Palin's own pronouncements from the pulpit as governor , including her statements about God 's plan for the war in Iraq .

The economy is worsening and this isnt the time to be single with no clue on how to survive the recession .
I have a myspace page you have to read if you want to take that first step to changing your life for the better .
4. ) Sugar baby needed :
The economy 's bad !
You need someone to take care of you .
Laid off from Wall Street ? -
Have lunch ( $ $ ) on me - m4w - 30 ( midtown ) I just heard Playboy is looking for Women of Wall Street , trying to find hotties who have been laid off from the investment banks .
I 'm also in finance , but still have a job thankfully .
How about this offer - if you 've been laid off , perhaps we can have a lunch date in my bed , along with a $ 1000 donation for you .
Serious replies please .
Only professional women ( I 'll ask to see your ID card ) .
( If being paid does n't make you feel like a whore , showing your ID card beforehand definitely will . )
5 . ) Sugar daddy needed .

I need a man to take care of me .
" OH WHAT THE HELL - EVERYONE IS DOING IT ANYWYAY - w4 m - 32 " Here goes : looking for a benefactor relationship with one generous man - no drama / stds or CL addicts .
Reason for looking for such relationship :
Was laid off like so many other people .
So why not the new trend of benefactor relationship where the arrangement is clear from the beginning and no drama while I sort my job situation out as the economy rebounds .
( If you have never been laid off and frustrated you may not understand this and please do n't email me with a lecture - men who have been down and out will understand this more than men who have never been through such times . )
Finally , here 's a thoughtful young man we wo n't get along with :
" I 'm looking for someone possessed of a sharp intellect that I can converse with .
a brooding sense of humor is a plus , as long as it is n't composed solely of snarky pointed remarks at the expense of others .
gallows humor is what I 'm talking about here .
this is a ' depression , ' after all , is n't it ? "
Yes , it certainly is .
An Iranian militia held civil defense drills on Sunday to prepare for any hostile air strikes and the military said it could close a waterway crucial for world oil supplies if Iran was attacked .
Execution in Iran Iran executes citizen convicted of spying for Israel Dudi Cohen Ali Ashtari , an Iranian citizen convicted in June of spying on his country for Israel , was executed .

The exercises organized by student members of the Basij militia were held at hundreds of schools across the country and involved transporting wounded people and putting out fires after a fictitious bombardment by enemy planes .
The United States and Israel have hinted they could take military action if Iran presses ahead with a nuclear program they believe is aimed at making atomic bombs .
Iran , which says the program is for peaceful purposes , says it will retaliate for any strikes against it .
State television showed pictures of ambulances with sirens wailing rushing to the scene of a simulated attack and people lying on the ground with bloodied faces .

Officials also reiterated that Iran was ready to close down the Strait of Hormuz , a sea route at the mouth of the Gulf through which 40 percent of the world 's traded oil passes , if the United States attacked .
Navy Commander Rear Admiral Habibollah Sayari said foreign forces in the region were being closely watched and Iran would not allow any foreign ship to enter its waters .
" We are capable of closing the Strait of Hormuz , " he told the IRNA news agency .
Rasoul Sanairad , a senior Basij political officer , said the strait provided " an exceptional opportunity " for defending the nation , according to Fars News Agency .
Military experts say Iran 's armed forces cannot match US military technology but could still cause havoc on shipping routes , particularly using small craft for hit - and - run attacks .
Iran 's navy will hold exercises in December involving missile - equipped battleships and scuba - diving special forces , state radio said .
The Basijis are a paramilitary force estimated to have 12 million members who uphold Islamic revolutionary values .
In the 1980s war with Iraq , they provided much of the manpower for the front .
In peacetime , they help enforce Iran 's strict Islamic dress and other moral codes .
In the end , I guess I 'm grateful to Richard Dawkins for the Out Campaign , primarily because it has made me think about the whole issue of atheism , god , and religion much more carefully — and I would n't have thought that was possible .
Today , in particular , as I contemplate putting his Scarlett A on my site , I find myself thinking about what atheism actually means , and what it does n't mean .
It 's much more complicated than I had realized .
Take the simplest , bare - bones , definition :
An atheist is a person who does not believe in God .
It seems simple enough , but then one has to ask what the word " God " actually means .
The standard concept of God in our culture was forged over the last two thousand years or so , primarily in the fires of ancient Greek philosophy , medieval culture , and the theology of the Roman Catholic Church .
Few protestants , and fewer very conservative protestants realize just how much of what they believe was invented by Roman Catholics , long after Jesus , Paul , and the Early Church Fathers were dead .
The result is an authoritarian creature , based on the model of a king , quasi- human , quasi - superman , invisible , in charge of the whole universe but intimately concerned with the tiniest detail of everyone 's daily life , who requires not only absolute obedience but also obeisance , is absolutely good , but thinks that eternal punishment is appropriate for temporal misdemeanors — the chief of which is , in most cases , not believing in his existence when he refuses to give us any solid evidence : in fact , punishment for behaving rationally .
No .
I do n't believe in that God .
In fact , I would argue that that God is a contradiction in terms — that the concept disproves itself .
Many Christians will read that last sentence as a rejection of God — that is , as a rejection of a person .
It is not .
It 's the rejection of an idea .
I am not standing before the creator of the universe , and screaming " I do n't believe in you . "
I am standing before a bunch of theologians , and saying " I think you got it wrong . "
To paraphrase the advocates of Intelligent Design : God is just a theory .
It 's a theory that I think is mistaken .
The reason I think it 's mistaken is that ( unlike , say , radio theory or the theory of evolution , or quantum electro - dynamics ) there is no real evidence for it .
I do , however , with Douglas Adams , tend to believe that there are artificial gods .
To put it another way , there are many religious people who see the god -idea , not as a description of the physical world , but as a cultural and personal tool , an abstraction about their community which enables them to practice their faith .
You will be unlikely to find such people bombing either trade centers or abortion clinics .
And you will be unlikely to find them trying to force their beliefs on others .
Many atheists would claim that all religion is bad .
I doubt this , in both senses .
That is , I doubt that there are no good religions — I 've named a few I like on this blog — and I doubt that there is any religion that has no good in it .
This seems absurd .
Why would it last ?
We are at a point in history when part of the world is coming to understand that certain traditional ideas — like the traditional theory of god — were mistaken .
We are also coming to understand that certain institutions — like traditional religion — are flawed .
But it would be a grave mistake to throw the baby out with the bathwater .
We are nowhere near understanding the big picture — how humans form communities , how those communities can go wrong , how to even know what it means for a community to go wrong for sure .
There 's room for a little humility .
Many atheist are also materialists .
They claim that the material world is all that exists .
I can only go so far down that road .
First , some distinctions .
One can reject the god - theory without rejecting the supernatural .
I happen to reject both , but they are not the same .
It is possible to not believe in a god , and still believe in ghosts , fairies , or Santa .
there 's no necessary connection .
Likewise , one can reject god - theory and the supernatural without rejecting the spiritual .
This is where I part company with many other atheists .
And I do it on the same basis that I part company with traditional religion — evidence .
The traditional Christian view is that our conscious experience is evidence of a soul — a " me " that lives inside my body , peers through my eyes , tastes with my tongue , but in the end is separate from my physical body , can go to heaven when I die while that body stays here on earth , can have experiences which do n't involve the body , such as direct experience of God , and can be put into a new body when Jesus returns .
Most atheists reject this idea — obviously the parts about heaven , God , and the return of Jesus , but more fundamentally the idea that there is a soul , separate from the physical body .
They 're probably right about this .
All the evidence of brain research seems to point to thought , emotion , and sensation as intimately connected to the structures and functions of the body : particularly of the brain .
This seems on the face of it to call the idea of an independent soul into question .
When an electrode stimulation in this part of the brain can predictable cause a person to feel a certain emotion or think a certain thought , there seems to be little need for some supernatural entity to do the feeling and thinking .
But many atheists go beyond this point , and either deny the existence of conscious experience altogether , claim it is merely an illusion , or simply ignore the issue as trivial and not worthy of examination .
I think they are mistaken .
The reason I think they are mistaken is the evidence of conscious experience itself .
It is my only connection to the " outside " world .
I would know nothing of science , of physical reality , of atheists , if it were n't for my conscious experience .
Yet , the physical descriptions of brain activity — however well they correlate — do n't come remotely close to describing those experiences , let alone explaining them .
My own current theory — held lightly , and open to change — is that the universe - as - described - by - science - so - far has another , internal side , which is the universe - as - experienced - from - within .
There is a profound difference between everything you could learn about me — or I , about you — from exterior , physical , examination , and the experience of being me .
And it is a difference of kind .
I do n't think there 's an immaterial soul haunting my body , but I do think there 's a spiritual side to the material world .
Pain is a reality , even though you will never find one when dissecting a brain .
I 'm only staking the position out , at the moment , not defending it , because I am well aware just how strong the full - going materialists ' defenses are on this point .
But I will say where I think my atheist friends are making their mistake .
This inner life , the realm of consciousness as experienced , the spiritual realm if you will , is part of the territory that had been staked out by Christianity , and by religion in general .
In the current political climate , there is a political war on — a struggle for control of the culture that was initiated by extremist religion .
Atheists have , quite rightly , joined the political fray — fighting to stop religion from dictating that lies be taught in science classes , or that teachers be allowed to force children to pray in schools .
But it is a mistake to allow a political battle to define ones position on an issue of science or philosophy .
I strongly suspect that my extreme materialist friends find it difficult to acknowledge the spiritual side of the world because it feels like a capitulation to religion , or to a religious world - view .
It was a materialist approach , focused on externals , that helped them to forge an alternative functional worldview , so naturally they would like that approach to cover everything .
I think they are mistaken .
I think that they are denying the one part of reality we can be most certain exists , and , moreover , I think that an unwillingness to examine it will always make them sound a little foolish to the common person .
So , if pressed , I would call myself a spiritual atheist .
I do n't think the god - theory stands up .
I do n't believe in a separate , supernatural or non-physical realm .
But on the other hand , I 'm quite sure there is more to the world than can be viewed through a microscope .
The physical world has an inside as well as an outside , and it 's worthwhile trying to map it , and correlate it with what we know of the exterior .
When I put the A up on my site , that is what it will mean .
Not so fast :
Is Prop 8 an " amendment " or a " revision " ?
The state constitutional challenge to Prop 8 turns out to be more interesting than I initially supposed .
The California constitution recognizes two types of changes : " revisions " and " amendments . "
The distinction , which is not elaborated in the constitutional text and barely explained in California state court decisions , matters a great deal because the state constitution places a higher hurdle in front of revisions than amendments .
" Revisions " can be effected only through approval by two - thirds of each state house , followed by a majority vote of the people .
" Amendments " can be effected by simple majority vote of the people , without prior legislative approval .
Prop 8 , which inserted a ban on same - sex marriage into the state constitution , was styled as an amendment and accordingly went through the amendment process — requiring only the simple majority vote of the people ( 52 % ) that it got on Tuesday .
It did not get the prior approval of two - thirds of each house of the state legislature .
But if it turns out that Prop 8 was a " revision " rather than an " amendment " then Prop 8 violated the procedural requirements for changing the state constitution and is therefore unconstitutional .
In that case , Prop 8 supporters would first need to get the approval of two - thirds of each state house , which is extremely unlikely given that the state legislature has twice voted to extend marriage to same - sex couples .
So back to the question , which is it : a revision or an amendment ?
Recent posts by Eugene and Stephen Bainbridge argue that Prop 8 is an amendment .
They cite cases in California which indicate that the distinction turns on the extensiveness and numerosity of the changes wrought by a proposed change .
( I urge you to read their excellent posts , as I will assume your knowledge of them here . )
On this view , changes that affect multiple constitutional provisions , like the proposed addition of 21,000 words to the state constitution in one case Professor Bainbridge cites , would be revisions , as would be attempts to reallocate judicial power to the legislature .
Changes that affect only a discrete and narrow set of rights or provisions would be an amendment .
Prop 8 added only 14 words to the state constitution , adds only one provision , and deals only with the discrete issue of defining marriage .
In their view , it does not deal with a host of constitutional rights or alter the basic structure of state government or the role of the state judiciary in it .
This argument may be accepted by the California courts .
If forced to bet , I 'd bet it will prevail .
However , the issue presented by Prop 8 is different in important respects from any that the state courts have previously confronted .
In a brief filed yesterday several legal groups representing gay couples argue that Prop 8 is a revision .
You should read their brief if you want to get into the weeds of the argument further , but I can summarize the heart of it fairly succinctly : Prop 8 stripped ( 1 ) a fundamental right ( marriage ) from ( 2 ) a suspect class ( gays ) .
Because of the importance of these changes , they argue , it is thus a revision and not an amendment .
The following issues bearing on the revision / amendment distinction are raised : First , can a fundamental right be denied through amendment , requiring only a majority vote of the people ?
Second , can a bare majority target a suspect class by mere amendment ?
Either of these alone would present a novel issue for the state courts .
( Important rights of criminal defendants were at issue in Raven v. Deukmejian , 52 Cal 3d 336 ( Cal. 1990 ) , though the court did n't call them " fundamental rights " and at any rate held that the case involved a revision . )
Together , they 're a double - whammy of constitutional change .
Now you may disagree that the fundamental right to marry extends to same - sex couples .
You may also disagree that sexual orientation classifications are suspect , requiring heightened judicial scrutiny .
Both objections are well - grounded , are the majority view in other state court systems , and may well be correct .
But the California Supreme Court disagrees with you on both points , as it held in its marriage decision last May .
Unless it reverses its decision , the court could take the importance of the right declared and the suspect nature of the discrimination into account when it decides what kind of constitutional change Prop 8 would be .
The California Supreme Court has held that the difference between an amendment and a revision turns on both " quantitative and qualitative " factors , and that " substantial changes in either respect could amount to a revision . "
Raven , 52 Cal. 3d at 350 ( emphasis added ) .
Thus , even if we thought that Prop 8 affected relatively few constitutional provisions ( say , the state 's equal protection and due- process guarantees ) , changes to these provisions might be regarded as " substantial qualitative " reforms in the content of basic constitutional principles .
In determining the difference between a revision and an amendment , we might ask what purpose the distinction serves .
The revision process requires considerably more deliberation and political consensus before a constitutional change is made .
I can see an argument , along the lines implied by Professor Bainbridge and Eugene , that more deliberation and consensus should be required before extensive and numerous changes are made in the basic design of state government .
This is because such changes involve great complexity and have far - reaching consequences that should not be decided by dueling 30 - second TV ads .
The distinction between revision and amendment is thus a procedural protection for the basic design of government .
But I can also see an argument , offered by those challenging Prop 8 , that more deliberation ( through the legislative process ) and more consensus ( than a bare majority vote in an election ) should also be required before a majority strips a fundamental right from 3 % of the population .
Otherwise , fundamental constitutional rights enjoy no more protection from majorities than ordinary statutory rights .
And protected minorities have no more protection against majorities than those majorities themselves see fit to grant them by grace .
The revision / amendment distinction , on this view , is a structural mechanism ( embedded in the state constitution itself ) for shielding these vulnerable minorities against hostile majorities .
The revision / amendment distinction could , of course , serve both the procedural purpose identified by Eugene and Professor Bainbridge and the structural pupose identified by the Prop 8 challengers .
Consider a couple of analogies .
( 1 ) Suppose a majority of the people became concerned about the growing political influence of Mormons , exhibited by what the majority regarded as their huge donations to political campaigns , and decided to alter the state constitution to deny Mormons , and Mormons alone , the right to make contributions to ballot fights .
Aside from the obvious federal constitutional issues involved , would the change be considered an " amendment " or a " revision " under the California constitution ?
( 2 ) Suppose a majority of the people decided that blacks were not taking the responsibilities of marriage very seriously , exhibited by what the majority regarded as high illegitimacy rates , high divorce rates , and rampant cohabitation and promiscuity , and decided to alter the state constitution to deny to blacks , and blacks alone , the fundamental right to marry ?
Again putting aside the invalidity of such a change under the federal constitution , would the change be an " amendment " or a " revision " under the California constitution ?
Under the Bainbridge / Volokh analysis , would n't these proposed changes be amendments , requiring only approval by a bare majority of the state 's voters ?
Neither involves extensive changes to the state constitution , or numerous or profound changes to the basic structure of California government , or an alteration of the judicial role .
Each involves the denial of a fundamental right to a protected class , just as Prop 8 does ( again , according to the California Supreme Court ) .
If Prop 8 is different , how is it different ?
Just because gays are involved ?
Under California law , whether you agree or not , gays stand on the same plane as any other protected class .
Discrimination against them is as suspect as it is against blacks or Mormons .
And also under California law , marriage is as fundamental for them as it is for blacks and as important for them as political speech is for Mormons .
It 's just a thought experiment , of course , since we would never dream of amending a constitution to make such outrageous changes eliminating the important rights of racial and religious minorities .
But if the question were presented , it 's not obvious to me that the issue would be resolved by counting the words in the hypothetical amendments , tallying the number of constitutional provisions affected , or asking simply whether the judicial role had been compromised .
It 's plausible that the courts would say these are " revisions " requiring approval by two - thirds of each house of the state legislature followed by a majority vote at the ballot box .
Indeed , before Prop 8 , no state had ever changed its constitution to deny a fundamental right to a suspect class of people .
Thus , the two state supreme court decisions Eugene cites ( one from Alaska and one from Oregon ) where similar procedural challenges were unsuccessfully lodged against anti-gay marriage amendments , arise from quite different doctrinal contexts than the California case presents .
Neither of those state supreme courts had taken either of the landmark steps taken by the California Supreme Court last May .
I make no prediction about how the California courts will resolve these questions .
What they will actually do probably depends in part on what they think the political and other consequences of overturning Prop 8 would be .
A decision invalidating Prop 8 would infuriate both opponents of gay marriage and those wary of judicial intrusion in important matters of public policy .
Prop 8 supporters raised some $ 35 million , effectively coordinated a massive volunteer effort , launched a devastating ad campaign , and won — only to be told it was all for naught ?
There would be a backlash , which might well result in attempts to recall some of the justices on the California Supreme Court .
It 's happened before in California , as anyone old enough to remember the name " Rose Bird " can tell you .
While in theory the possibility of such a backlash should not matter to judicial decisions , in practice it would be surprising if it did n't .
Supporters of Prop 8 need only peel off a single justice of the 4 - justice majority to win on the revision / amendment distinction .
I 'm also not saying that a ruling against Prop 8 would necessarily be in the long - term best interests of the gay - marriage movement .
It 's a complicated calculus .
On the one hand , California is a big prize in lots of ways and getting gay marriage there sooner might hasten things elsewhere in the country .
It would also help gay families in the state , who stand to lose a lot while waiting another decade or so for their marriages to be validated in another proposition battle .
On the other hand , I think gay marriage will eventually win at the ballot box in California and will win in a few state legislatures even before that happens .
The risk of invalidating Prop 8 is that you scare a few more states into enacting constitutional barriers just as the political and cultural winds are shifting in your favor .
( However , there probably are n't more than a handful of states left that would enact constitutional gay - marriage bans . )
I 'm also dubious about the underlying constitutional claims and prefer legislative to judicial action on this subject .
Even as a doctrinal and precedential matter , moreover , the narrowest reading of the California precedents is probably closer to the view expressed by Professor Bainbridge and Eugene than it is to the view expressed by the Prop 8 challengers .
The state courts are perfectly free to limit the precedents to their facts and thus dismiss the Prop 8 challenge .
Prop 8 does n't involve numerous or profound changes in the basic structure of state government .
But if the courts ask why there is a distinction between revision and amendment , and answer that the distinction also provides a structural safeguard for what the courts themselves regard as a vulnerable minority exercising a fundamental right , it 's not obvious that the challenge should fail .

Crist extends voting hours
This is a very big deal : Florida Governor Charlie Crist , to the shock and dismay of Florida Republicans , just moved to extend early voting hours , a move likely to widen the Democrats ' lead under a program on which the Obama campaign has intensely focused .
" He just blew Florida for John McCain , " one plugged in Florida Republican just told me .
The Buzz reports :
At a hastily arranged news conference , Crist said the right to vote is sacred and that " many have fought and died for this right . "
He said he consulted a leading Democratic legislator , Rep. Dan Gelber of Miami Beach , before issuing his order , and that Gelber knew of a similar order issued by Gov. Jeb Bush in 2002 that dealt with helping voters deal with new equipment .
As to the perception that more early voting helps Democrats , Crist said : " This is not a political decision .
This is a people decision . "
Democrats had urged the extension , which means that votes will be cast 12 hours a day , not eight hours a day .
TOKYO , Nov. 28 ( UPI ) --
Finnish phone maker Nokia , facing a tough market in Japan , will pull out of that country except to market its high - end Vertu , Forbes reported Thursday .
Nokia 's Vertu phones , which cost up to $ 10,000 , are handcrafted and feature precious metals , the financial magazine reported .

" There is definitely a market in Japan for Vertu , " analyst Carolina Milanesi at Gartner Research was quoted as saying .
She also approved of Nokia 's decision , given the weak market share for its other phones .
The Forbes report said Nokia has only about 1 percent in Japan 's mature market , which is dominated by local makers and network operators .
Compounding Nokia 's problems is that Japan is now in a recession .
The smell of fresh snow and the burning fuel of a Ski-Doo Olympic Snowmachine are part of my vivid childhood memories .
I would hang on to my pop ’s snowsuit , as we rode through Alaskan muskegs , down river banks , and up power line trails .
Checking our trap line was dirty work .
Bait consisted of freezer burnt salmon and road kill rabbit retrieval missions .
I grew up with the smell of skinned mink , beaver , muskrats , coyotes , and wolves in my garage .
We took the hides to the Fur Rendezvous in Anchorage and sold them .
Staying in a hotel with plumbing and television was our decadent reward .
I learned more about nature from trapping and hunting than I did from any biology class .
Habits , tracking , instincts ; I was in awe of the Nature around me and then I helped kill it .
It was n’t easy .
Mink are smart as white collar thieves .
They could get bait out of a trap nine times out of ten , and defecate before departing , a not - so - subtle message to Pop and I .
I do n’t write these things to brag , just as fact .
You may be revolted by this lifestyle , and I wo n’t argue .
I share this to provide you the reference of my horror of aerial wolf hunting .
Shooting wolves from planes is to hunting , what hiring a prostitute is to dating .
Alaska has a long history of bounties and hunting - much of it controversial .
Aerial wolf hunting began in 1948 .
In 1972 , Congress passed a law that prohibited aerial wolf hunting .
Problem solved ?
No , under the guise of “ wolf control , ” permits were issued to “ pilot gunner ” teams in 1979 .
In 1992 , under Governor Walter Hickel ’s Administration , the Alaska Board of Game initiated a wolf control program with the goal of reducing numbers by 80 % .
Under threat of a massive tourist boycott , the “ land and shoot ” policy was reintroduced .
During Democrat Governor Tony Knowles Administration , only non-lethal measures were used against wolves .
The Wolf Management Reform Coalition collected 33,000 signatures to put an aerial wolf hunting ban on the November 1996 ballot ; 59 % of Alaskans voted for it , with the exception being a biological emergency .
A Republican Legislature introduced SB74 .
This bill eliminated the need for a biological emergency to justify aerial wolf control and usurped the will of the people .
Governor Knowles vetoed the bill and the Republican majority overrode it .
In March of 2000 , SB267 was passed which allowed hunters other than the state biologists to aerially shoot wolves .
That same year , Alaskans voted on another ballot initiative to ban aerial wolf hunting by a 53 % majority .
In 2004 , then Governor Frank Murkowski reinstated aerial wolf hunting to private hunters .
He opened up 60,000 square miles of Alaska for the flying cowboys .
All you needed was a plane and a permit .
With all of this history , we should have been prepared to deal with a Palin Administration hell bent on killing wolves .
She and I were “ raised by the same wolves ” , and she wants to shoot them out of planes .
She stacked the Alaska Board of Game with pro-aerial wolf hunters .
She was successful at merging faulty science , Safari Club International interests and state funded propaganda ; spinning a web of lies to masquerade as conservation .
I ’m not sure where it started ; maybe a spam email promising penis enlargement from shooting mammals out of planes went viral .
Running our policy on “ Faith Based Science ” has n’t worked ; animals you believe are here for you to rule , and exist because Noah got two of them on a boat and they managed not to eat each other is one thing .
But if you refuse to use the brain God gave you for observation and noticing patterns of science , well , how good of a steward of the Earth are you ?
Years of classic , scientific studies by Adolph Murie and Vic Van Ballenberghe have been mocked or ignored .
Their studies were in the field , observing the balance between wolves and ungulate populations .
They proved what common sense verifies ; wolves take the weak and the sick thereby strengthening the herds .
The Alaska Board of Game lacks common sense and ignores science .
The Board is loaded with Viagra starved , trigger - happy Alaska Outdoor Council and Safari Club International agenda driven thugs .
Because of declining hunter success throughout the 1990s , residents of McGrath were vocal about the need for aerial wolf control .
They complained loudly and constantly that there were n’t enough legal moose to hunt .
The most comprehensive moose population survey to date was done in the fall of 2001 .
Alaska Department of Fish & Game Biologists documented moose numbers and the bull / cow ratios within a 520 square mile area around McGrath known as the Experimental Micro Management Area or EMMA , as well as the rest of Game Management Unit ( GMU ) 19D East .
520 square miles is a relatively small area .
It is in fact , just under 12 miles north , south , east and west of McGrath .
The target ratio for a sustainable hunted population is 30 bulls / 100 cows .
Within the EMMA , that ratio fell to an unhealthy 6 bulls / 100 cows .
Outside EMMA and basically outside the range of lazy 4 - wheeler hunters , that ratio was 44 bulls / 100 cows - well above the healthy target .
Here ’s the kicker direct from the Alaska Department of Fish & Games official report :
“ The low bull : cow ratio in this area ( EMMA ) results from an imbalance between hunting and recruitment .
The bull : cow ratio in the remainder of GMU 19D East remains relatively high . ”
In other words , the science from ADF&G ’s own biologists contradicted the need for any predator control .
Studies conducted for the McGrath Adaptive Management Team proved that over - hunting was the reason for the lack of moose in the area , not wolves .
That data was buried and wolf control was implemented .
Right before the 2006 Election , Alaskans for Wildlife submitted 57,000 signatures to get another aerial wolf hunting ban in place .
Newly elected Governor Palin and the ADF&G issued even more wolf kill permits and put up a $ 150 bounty per wolf .
A state judge ruled Palin exceeded her authority and the bounty was scrapped .
At the end of the 2007 legislative session , Palin flooded the legislature with bills to ease up on wolf hunting restrictions , but the bills were held up in committee .
In the spring of 2008 , Palin tried to declare wildlife an “ asset ” of the State to make their management off limits to ballot initiatives .
She covertly tried to tack a wolf hunting bill on to an animal cruelty bill , SB 273 , introduced by Senator Bill Wielechowski .
Pun intended : she got shot down .
Last month Alaskans voted once again on Aerial Predator Control .
The intent of the ballot initiative was simple enough ; to prohibit the shooting of wolves and grizzly bears from aircraft .
Lieutenant Governor Sean Parnell , overseer of elections , did his part to insure the proposition language was confusing enough to guarantee failure :
Ballot Measure 2
Bill Amending Same Day Airborne Shooting
BALLOT LANGUAGE
This bill amends current law banning same - day
airborne shooting to include grizzly bears .
The
bill permits the Board of Game to allow a predator
program for wolves and grizzly bears if the
Commissioner of Fish and Game finds an emergency ,
where wolves or grizzly bears in an area
are causing a decline in prey .
Only employees of
the Department of Fish and Game could take
part in the program .
Only the minimum number
of wolves or grizzly bears needed to stop the
emergency could be removed .
Should this initiative become law ?
___Yes
___No
Parnell was dragged into court several times for misrepresenting the intent of the initiative on the ballot .
Many Alaskans were confused by the ballot language .
My neighbor is a retired state engineer .
He is a bright man and a conservationist .
He voted no despite being an outspoken opponent of aerial wolf killing .
Had I not known to vote yes , I would have voted no too .
Now , aerial predator control proponents can disingenuously claim that Alaskans favor killing wolves and bears from planes as evidenced by the 2008 vote on Ballot Prop 2 .
Governor Palin did her part to defeat the initiative as well .
She approved the use of public money and ordered the Alaska Department of Fish and Game to publish a 26 - page full color pamphlet called “ Understanding Intensive Management and Predator Control in Alaska . ”
It circulated through newspapers statewide and was mailed to tens of thousands of Alaskans just days before the election .
The pamphlet emphasized “ how well the current system is working . ” Jim Marcotte , Director of Support for the Board of Game , said the pamphlet was not meant to influence voters - Really ?
Spending public money to tell Alaskans that the Aerial Wolf Control Program is necessary to protect our moose and caribou populations just before a statewide election was n’t an attempt to influence the outcome ?
The fear machine was in full force .
The message was clear : wolves threaten hunters ’ ability to put food on the table .
But the truth was more about putting pelts on a wall .
In addition to the pamphlet and mailers , the state paid for Board of Game members to fly all over Alaska to “ educate ” the public on the benefits of predator control - again just before the election .
This entire predator control program is about turning Alaska into a wild game farm .
In response to the allegation that she signed off on a “ propaganda campaign to justify the state ’s barbaric wolf slaughter from the skies , ” Palin said , “ My understanding is this program was funded by the Legislature to factually explain game management practices to Alaskans , and I do n’t have a problem with that . ”
The total bill for the “ education ” was $ 400,000 .
Nearly the same amount of money she vetoed for high school drop out prevention .
It ’s shameful she spent almost half a million dollars on pamphlets to compensate for Alaska ’s prohibition on Cialis .
Hey , if you ’ve been shooting wolves out of planes , and you have an erection lasting for more than four hours , check the Boone & Crocket stats , you may have a trophy !
In June of this year , the ADF&G broke their own predator control regulations with the slaughter of 14 wolf pups near Point Moeller .
Under the ADF&G Wolf Control Regulations ( 5AAC 92.110 ( i ) ) , “ Denning , the killing of wolf young in the den , is prohibited . ”
On site at the scene of the crime were Deputy ADF&G Commissioner for Wildlife , Ken Taylor , and The Director of ADF&G ’s Division of Wildlife Conservation , Doug Larsen .
Why were suits from Juneau involved in a routine field operation ?
Why do we pay them salaries to enforce laws they are either unaware of , or choose to break ?
Perhaps they knew they were breaking their own law and were there to support the cover - up and clean up crew .
ADF&G Biologists want to “ maintain ” caribou herd numbers between 3,000 - 4,000 animals on the Alaska Peninsula near Port Moeller .
According to former ADF&G Commissioner Ron Skoog , the caribou populations on the Alaska Peninsula have fluctuated many times over the last several decades .
Indeed , the caribou population on the Alaska Peninsula has dropped to 500 or fewer at least 3 times over 132 years .
ADF&G Biologists obtained emergency permission to kill wolves by misleading the Board of Game and Alaskans to think the current decline is unprecedented .
This is clearly NOT the case .
Sarah Palin has been in a position to do the right thing for the wildlife of Alaska .
Independent Alaskan Biologists have been begging for her ear .
Faith based science is not science , yet it is what she has used in her policy making ; mocking legitimate studies , and embracing big game hunters .
The Rapture is not an environmental policy nor is it a game management policy .
It ’s been a long time since I set or checked a trap .
I ’ve spent hours behind a camera , camping in bear refuges , in awe of the nature of Alaska .
When I was a child , I had no idea how big the world was , or how tamed parts had become .
Looking at the world , I know Alaska is precious in its wildness .
Why ca n’t we just let Nature run wild ?

GOP senator : McCain put ' nail in our coffin ' Andrew McLemore
Published : Saturday November 15 , 2008
Print This Email This South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint joined the growing ranks of Republicans turning on Sen. John McCain for betraying his conservative principles in the pursuit of the Oval Office , CNN reported .
McCain is largely responsible for the Republican Party straying from its own " brand , " DeMint told a group of GOP officials in Myrtle Beach on Friday during a conference on the future of the party .
" We have to be honest , and there 's a lot of blame to go around , but I have to mention George Bush , and I have to mention Ted Stevens , and I 'm afraid I even have to mention John McCain , " he said .
DeMint complained about many of McCain 's policies while on the campaign trail .
" His proposal for amnesty for illegals .
His support of global warming , cap - and - trade programs that will put another burden on our economy .
And of course , his embrace of the bailout right before the election was probably the nail in our coffin this last election , " DeMint said .
The head of the most conservative faction of Senate Republicans , DeMint said the sweeping Democratic gains in November 's election vindicate his call for a return to Reaganite values , McClatchy Newspapers reported .
" One of our principles is that power corrupts , and you need to disperse it , " DeMint said .
" And if our own party allows ourselves to be destroyed by this idea , and are not willing to stand up , then we have to change everyone at the top . "
Many Republicans have begun claiming the party 's failure in the 2008 election was the result of watered - down conservatism and the way to rectify that failure is moving further to the right , according to Salon.com .
PHILADELPHIA 
It was strange .
Bizarre .
Weird .
A little freaky , too .
And , in the end , only fitting , that the Philadelphia Phillies beat the Tampa Bay Rays 5 - 4 , on one of the wackiest endings in World Series history .
" It 's better to be lucky sometimes , " said Phillies manager Charlie Manuel , " than good . "
The Phillies ' high - powered offense finally emerged with three home runs , but it was a 40 - foot ground ball off the bat of catcher Carlos Ruiz that won the game .
It was the first walk - off victory by the Phillies in franchise history , providing them with a 2 - 1 lead in the best - of - seven series .
" There were so many crazy things that happened tonight , " said Eric Bruntlett , who scored the game 's winning run .
" That was the perfect ending .
You saw a little bit of everything .
You certainly do n't expect to win a game like that .
" It was strange circumstances all the way around . "
In a game that did n't end until 1:47 a.m. ET , after a 1 hour , 12 minute rain delay , the Phillies were still in the clubhouse until 3 trying to explain this victory .
" " They got breaks , we got breaks , " Phillies shortstop Jimmy Rollins said .
" It just so happens that we got the last break . "
The Phillies , who had squandered a 4 - 1 lead , opened the ninth when Bruntlett was hit by Grant Balfour 's pitch .
Balfour , then pitching to Shane Victorino , threw an inside pitch that nearly hit him .
Victorino jumped out of the way , and the ball shot past him , but caromed right back to Dioner Navarro .
Navarro quickly threw to second , but it sailed into center field , allowing Bruntlett to reach third .
Rays manager Joe Maddon ordered two intentional walks , loading the bases .
He brought in Ben Zobrist from right field , creating a five - man infield .
The infield looked like a crowded subway station with five infielders , three baserunners , four umpires and a pitcher and catcher .
" I 've never seen so many people in the infield at one time , " said Dobbs , who was standing on first .
" It was definitely crowded . "
Ruiz , who had reached base seven of the last eight times , walked to the plate hoping to hit a simple fly ball .
He fell behind 1 - and - 2 , and then on a 2 - 2 pitch , hit a slow roller towards third .
" Thank God for the rain , " Rollins said .
" If the field was dry , it probably would have rolled right to [ third baseman Evan ] Longoria . "
Instead , it trickled 40 feet towards Longoria .
He charged in , scooped the ball barehanded and dove , but as he fell , the toss sailed high into the air , over Navarro 's head .
" It really was good fortune on their part , " Longoria said .
" He could n't have picked up the ball and rolled it to a better spot .
If he hits it a little harder , we have a chance to get a double play .
" It was just one of those nights . "
It certainly was the happiest 40 - foot - hit Rollins has seen in his life , sending 45,900 fans screaming into the night , knowing they are just two victories shy of their first World Series title in 28 years .
" I 'm so happy , " Ruiz says .
" I was trying to hit a fly ball to the outfield .
It did n't work .
But I 'll take it .
It was a great moment . "
It was also sweet revenge for Ruiz , who an inning earlier almost became the goat .
The Rays trailed 4 - 3 when center fielder B.J. Upton led off the eighth with an infield single .
After Carlos Pena struck out for the first out , Upton took matters into his own hands .
He stole second base with Longoria at the plate .
And on the next pitch , he stole third and scampered home when Ruiz 's throw bounced away from third baseman Pedro Feliz .
" I know I had an error , but that 's part of the game , " Ruiz said .
" The only thing I had on my mind my last at - bat was that the game was in my hands , so I had to do something . "
It may not have been picturesque , but considering the time of night , who cared about looks ?
" It was a beautiful thing , " said Phillies first baseman Ryan Howard , whose home run in the sixth inning was his first since Sept. 26 , after hitting 48 during the regular season .
" Nobody was talking about being tired .
I did n't even know what time it was until they started playing that song , After Midnight .
The Phillies ' victory also spared first - base umpire Tom Hallion of being cast in the same light as Don Denkinger , whose blown call in Game 6 of the 1985 World Series helped the Kansas City Royals beat St. Louis .
Phillies starter Jamie Moyer , 45 , the second - oldest player to appear in a World Series game , made a brilliant play to field a bunt in the seventh by Carl Crawford .
He dove and flipped the ball with his glove to Howard , who caught the ball barehanded .
It was a bang - bang play , but replays revealed that Crawford was out .
He instead was called safe .
" As an umpire , you never want to be involved in the outcome of the game , " Hallion said .
" We do n't like to be involved in something like that .
We like to get every play right .
" We 're human beings , and sometimes we get them wrong . "
It turned out to be immaterial , and by the time the Phillies and Rays play Sunday night at 8:29 ET , it likely will be forgotten .
All that matters now is Game 4 , with the Rays knowing that a victory is imperative , particularly with Phillies ace Cole Hamels scheduled in Game 5 .
" Tonight 's win , " Rollins says , " is only as good as tomorrow 's win . "
Rollins corrected himself .
Make it tonight 's win .
It was already 2:30 in the morning .
Two pupils have been suspended after one filmed the other pretending to spank a teacher ’s backside during lessons and posted it on the internet .
In the footage , the boy stands behind the female teacher and makes gestures as she leans across a desk helping a classmate .
He then crouches and sticks out his tongue towards her backside before he follows her as she moves towards the back of the class – continuing to pretend to spank her .
The teacher appears oblivious to what is happening behind her back .
Throughout the 22 seconds of footage – uploaded to YouTube – the boy ’s friend , who filmed the incident on a mobile phone , can be heard laughing .
Brighton Pavilion MP
David Lepper condemned the antics of the pupils at Varndean School in Balfour Road , Brighton , yesterday and also criticised YouTube for allowing it to be uploaded .
Mr Lepper said : “ These children have been given an almost unlimited audience for showing off this behaviour .
People say censoring YouTube would infringe freedoms but what about the freedom of the poor teacher who has had this done to her ? ”
He called on the school to ban mobile phones from classrooms and said better parenting was needed to stop children behaving as they had .
Mr Lepper said : “ I would like to see the strongest possible action taken against those involved . ”
Staff at Varndean said they had been unaware of the incident before The Argus contacted them after receiving a complaint yesterday .
They said the incident was being investigated .
Within hours the video had been removed from YouTube by its creator .
It was uploaded on October 25 labelled “ At Varndean School during a French lesson lol ” and had been viewed more than 130 times before it was withdrawn .
The video had attracted comments from other users .
Varndean acting headteacher Mark Whitby said both pupils had been “ internally suspended ” , meaning they were isolated from other children .
A series of detentions have also been meted out .
Mr Whitby said : “ Both children involved in this incident have been spoken to with their parents and both appropriately sanctioned .
We also immediately instructed for the video clip to be removed from the website .
The school does not tolerate poor behaviour and the misuse of mobile devices . ”
He added : “ It would also be appropriate to say that this behaviour is uncharacteristic of these boys , that they are nice kids from nice families and they are going to live to regret it .
This was silliness which has gone awry . ”
Yep , that old sucky economy warhorse .
The gist is that women could n't afford luxuries in the depression but wanted to buy something to treat themselves .
Something small , cheap , and with a big impact .
Lipstick .
During the Depression sales went up and according to the NY Times Styles section today they 're up again : 40 % .
And the colors that are hot ?
Not blood red , but rather muted pinks and browns .
We really are depressed .
Dear World :
The United States of America , your quality supplier of ideals of liberty and democracy , would like to apologize for its 2001 - 2008 service outage .
The technical fault that led to this eight - year service interruption has been located , and the software responsible was replaced Tuesday night , November 4 .
Early tests of the newly - installed program indicate that we are now operating correctly , and we expect it to be fully functional by mid-January .
We apologize for any inconvenience caused by the outage , and we look forward to resuming full service — and hopefully even to improve it in years to come .
Thank you for your patience and understanding ,
The USA
On a side note , the music comes from one of my favorite live performers , My Robot Friend .
I 've seen him play a few times .
He 's in NYC at least twice a year .
His stage show is crazy .
Unfortunately there are n't any good videos of his show online , this one 's okay :
what they do n't show is by the end of the song the electric blue fingers grow to about 4 feet long each .
It looks crazy when you see him in person .

When shopping , many Bay Area cooks tend to focus on produce and other fresh foods .
We make obsessive lists for milk and juice for the morning , meat for dinner , salad greens for workday lunches .
In doing so , we often neglect the pantry .
Yet great cooks are only as good as what 's in their cupboard .
Foods from the pantry are the backbone of any meal , whether it 's oats for breakfast or polenta for supper .
Pantries that are stocked and organized with care also have the potential to inspire many meals to come .
A glance at a colorful can of tuna in olive oil can remind you of an easy pasta recipe you can make tonight , without having to shop .
A canister of quinoa might spark a memory of a remarkable salad .
We decided to tackle the pantry for this chapter in our Kitchen Essentials series , which started off with a story on our Top 10 cooking techniques and was followed by one about kitchen tools .
The pantry list goes beyond basics like kosher salt and panko breadcrumbs ( see the link with this story at sfgate.
com / food for a list of those ) ; instead , we chose ingredients that are distinctive yet adaptable and add spark to a range of preparations .
The items also differ depending on the type of cooking we do most often .
For example , those who cook in a Mediterranean vein are more likely to use aged sherry vinegar from Spain than the Japanese rice wine mirin .
Yet with their sweet , complex flavor , both ingredients serve a similar purpose : A splash can help dishes that just need " something . "
A few of the ingredients on our list are pricier or harder to find than their generic counterparts , but we offer substitutions .
Also , if you spend an extra dollar or two on a quality can of tuna that can turn salad greens into dinner , it might make the difference between using up food you already have and dropping $ 30 at the corner Thai restaurant .
Maybe it 's a remnant of childhood stories about Old Mother Hubbard and her hungry dog , but I get a little forlorn when my cupboard is bare .
I hope this guide will help you keep yours stocked , and keep you in good spirits with the prospect of delicious meals ahead .

Mirin
Why :
This sweet Japanese rice wine is used in many Japanese and Korean dishes .
Made from glutinous or sweet rice , it 's often added to soups and is an essential component of teriyaki sauce and Korean marinated barbecue beef dishes such as kalbi ( marinated beef short ribs ) .
In general , mirin can liven up Asian - style salad dressings or any savory sauce , and add a honeyed sweetness to glazes and marinades .
Shopping tips : Most supermarkets carry mirin , as do Japanese and Korean grocers .
Substitutes : Sake , which is normally drier .
Dark chocolate
Why :
The percentage listed on chocolate labels indicates how much of the bar is cocoa mass versus sugar .
Bittersweet chocolate usually starts at 70 percent , while semisweet usually tops off at 62 percent .
We like to stock our pantry with chocolate in the 65 to 70 percent range , because it can be used in a wide range of baking applications .
With its fruity flavor and not too much bitterness , this chocolate can also be eaten plain .
Shopping tips :
At the high end , El Rey ( pictured ) and Valrhona have many versions in this range .
Lindt offers a less - expensive version .
Substitutes : Depends on the recipe .
Fish sauce
Why : This Southeast Asian condiment made from fermented anchovies is an essential ingredient in Thai , Vietnamese , Philippine and other Southeast Asian cuisines .
Many cooks call on it for a quick shot of umami , the Japanese term for the fifth flavor found in savory , protein - rich foods .
It works even for Western pasta sauces , vinaigrettes or fish dishes .
Shopping tips :
Some brands available at Asian stores , such as Three Crabs from Vietnam , are milder and less salty than the standard Tiparos brand ( pictured ) from Thailand .
Substitutes : Worcestershire sauce , soy sauce ( if using as a basic flavor enhancer ) , anchovy fillets .
Quinoa
Why : Quinoa has gotten a lot of attention as a super grain because of its high protein content and fiber , iron and calcium .
Technically , it 's a seed from the Andes , not a grain , but is usually included in the whole - grain group .
Quinoa takes less than 15 minutes to cook and has a light texture and mild , nutty flavor .
It 's versatile , a great option for salads , soups and as a more nutritious yet fast - cooking substitute for white rice .
Shopping tips : Quinoa generally requires rinsing before cooking .
It can be processed in a way that it loses some of its nutritional value , so compare labels when shopping to get the most nutrition for your buck .
Substitutes : Bulgur , whole wheat couscous .
Salted capers
Why : Whether pureed into a sauce or sprinkled over hors d'oeuvres , capers add a salty kick to many dishes .
We particularly like capers preserved in coarse salt because they have a more nuanced , fruity flavor and a meatier texture than the capers in brine .
Shopping tips : Italian delis , cheese shops and specialty grocers often carry jars of salted capers from Italy .
Before using , rinse them thoroughly , soak for 30 minutes in water , then rinse again .
Otherwise , brined capers are fine .
Substitutes : Chopped caper berries or salt - cured olives .
Chipotle peppers in adobo
Why : Chipotle peppers are smoked and dried jalapeno peppers preserved in a sauce traditionally made of ancho chiles , herbs , spices , sugar , vinegar and often tomatoes .
Chipotles are easy to use and add a smoky spiciness to marinades and Mexican sauces .
Shopping tips : Chipotle peppers in adobo are sold in cans in most supermarkets and Mexican markets .
They are very spicy , especially if you use the seeds , so sometimes only a 1/2 teaspoon of the puree is enough .
Leftovers keep well in an airtight container in the refrigerator .
Substitutes : Dried chipotle chiles or chipotle chile powder .
Garbanzo beans
Why : Also known as chickpeas , garbanzo beans hold up well in cans , retaining their shape and nutty flavor surprisingly well .
Dried ones taste better , but they need to be presoaked and take a fairly long time to cook .
Garbanzos offer an easy way to add protein to salads , soups and Middle Eastern dishes .
Shopping tips : A 15 - ounce can of garbanzo beans contains about 1 1/2 cups beans , after draining and rinsing .
One cup dried beans yields about 3 cups cooked beans .
Substitutes : Canned white beans or cannellini beans .
High - quality honey
Why : Sure , the stuff in the plastic bear is fine for squirting into tea or over yogurt .
But cheaper brands of honey often contain non-honey sweeteners .
The much more complex and fragrant wildflower honeys , whether orange blossom , lavender or star thistle , add a touch of sweetness to a vinaigrette or sauce , or work as a base for desserts .
Shopping tips : Head to farmers ' markets for the best local options , such as Marshall 's Farm S.F. Bay Area Beekeeper 's Blend ( pictured ) , also available at Whole Foods .
Substitutes : Pomegranate molasses , pure maple syrup .
Whole - grain mustard
Why : Mustard provides many flavors in one condiment - sweetness , spice , acid and even umami .
It helps emulsify salad dressings and adds depth to sauces .
Ground mustard is spicier than whole - grain mustard , which is mild enough to coat a meat roast , yet also has enough flavor to punch up a red wine pan sauce .
Shopping tips : French brands Maille ( pictured ) , Delouis Fils and Fallot brands are usually easy to find .
Substitutes : Mild Dijon or coarse - ground mustard .
Fancy tuna in olive oil
Why : High - quality imported tuna in olive oil is a whole different breed from most domestic tuna .
That 's partly because most imported brands are " fancy " grade , which means the tuna is in large pieces , rather than " chunk , " which is in smaller pieces .
The olive oil makes a difference , too , easing the transition to a nicoise salad or pasta sauce .
Tuna is a great source of omega - 3s , but because of mercury concerns , should be eaten in moderation .
Shopping tips : Both Ortiz brand from Spain ( pictured ) and Dave 's Gourmet Albacore from Santa Cruz were the top scorers with The Chronicle 's Taster 's Choice panel .
" White " tuna usually means albacore , whereas " light " is a lesser grade of fish .
Substitutes : Light tuna in olive oil .
Spaghetti with Tonnato & Crispy Breadcrumbs Serves 4
This is delicious and attractive with spinach spaghetti as well as regular types .
Serve it right away or the breadcrumbs will become soggy .
12 ounces spaghetti or bucatini
1/2 sweet French baguette ( stale bread is better )
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
-- Kosher salt to taste
1 recipe Tonnato Sauce ( see Recipe , this page ) , about 3/ 4 cup Instructions : Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for the pasta , then cook according to package directions .
While the water is coming to a boil , remove the crust or most of the crust from the baguette with a bread knife , then chop baguette into 1 - inch cubes .
Place in a food processor and process or pulse until broken down into rather large breadcrumbs .
Melt the butter in a large frying pan over medium to medium - low heat until bubbly .
Add the olive oil and heat until the butter is lightly browned , about 3 minutes , watching closely .
Add the breadcrumbs and toss in the pan until crispy and browned , about 5 minutes .

Honey - Poached Pears with Chocolate Drizzle Serves 6 - 8
Instead of melting the chocolate , you can also simply grate some over the top of each dessert using a microplane .
1/2 cup good - quality honey such as from Marshall 's Farm
2 cloves or 1 piece star anise
1 1/4 pounds pears ( 3 - 4 pears ) , ripe but firm , peeled , halved and cored
1 1/2 teaspoons orange zest ( from 1/2 orange )
1/4 teaspoon orange blossom water , or to taste ( optional ; see Note )
1 to 2 ounces quality bittersweet chocolate ( 65 - 70 percent )

In a small skillet or saucepan that will hold the pears in a single layer , combine 1 cup of water , the honey and cloves or star anise .
Bring to a gentle simmer and stir to dissolve the honey .
Place the pears in the liquid , cut side down .
Bring to a gentle simmer and cook until no longer firm on the bottom , 8 - 15 minutes , depending on the variety of the pears and how ripe they are .
Flip and repeat on the other side .
Remove from the heat and let the pears cool in the liquid for 30 minutes .
They will absorb some of the liquid as they cool .
Remove the pears and spices from the liquid , then simmer the cooking liquid until thickened and reduced to about 1 /2 cup , 10 minutes .
Add the zest and simmer an additional minute , then add the orange blossom water , if using .
Strain into a pitcher .

It goes on to note that if renewable energy is only brought on - line to displace conventional coal power , then the net job losses from existing industries may well offset the gains in wind power .
That topic brought a discussion in comments a couple of days ago .
It is , however , perhaps worth pursuing in a little more detail .
To steal a phrase “ It is the best of times , it is the worst of times , ” although the rest of the opening to A Tale of Two Cities ( “ It was the epoch of belief , it was the epoch of incredulity , it was the season of Light , it was the season of Darkness , it was the spring of hope , it was the winter of despair , ” ) may also be appropriate .
It is also interesting , and will become more so as the new Administration seeks to find a way forward out of the compounding problems that now face it .
The WSJ has noted the statements by President - elect Obama earlier :
Newton boasts two wind energy firms , and Iowa is one of the leading wind producing states in the country .
TPI joins wind turbine manufacturing facilities in Cedar Rapids ( Clipper Windpower ) , West Branch ( Acciona Energy North America ) and Fort Madison ( Siemens Power Generation ) .
There has been , for example , a suggestion that employing more folk in the wind industry will reduce employment , due to a drop in demand from the coal and related industries .
And with such sentiments it becomes apparent , again , that many folk just do n’t , as yet , appreciate the coming problems in the magnitude of the shortage of supply of fuel .
As Leanan noted , the old Maytag plant in Newton is now building turbine blades , ultimately to employ 500 folk .
Yet in terms of significant impact into the national need it is still going to be quite small , in the near term .
In the recent election Missouri voted and passed their own target for the future :
Shall Missouri law be amended to require investor - owned electric utilities , cooperative utilities , and certain municipal utilities to generate or purchase electricity from renewable energy sources such as solar , wind , biomass and hydropower with the renewable energy sources equaling at least 2 % of retail sales by 2011 increasing incrementally to at least 15 % by 2021 , including at least 2 % from solar energy ; and restricting to no more than 1 % any rate increase to consumers for this renewable energy ?
It passed overwhelmingly and brings Missouri into line with more than half the rest of the states .
At present Missouri gets more than 80 % of its power from coal , but has seen significant investment in wind over the past few years .
Tom Carnahan , president of Wind Capital Group , leads the charge here developing the state ’s first wind farms .
Wind Capital began erecting Suzlon S88 turbines in Gentry County in June 2006 .
Today dozens of towers rise from the state ’s breezy northwestern plains where sleek white blades spin high above grazing cattle and row crops .
Four projects totaling about 163 megawatts of capacity are complete .
Their high - tech pinwheels generate electricity used by both nearby towns and cities hundreds of miles away .
They represent about $ 200 million in investment by Wind Capital and financing partner John Deere Wind Energy , but that ’s just the beginning , according to Carnahan .
Taken with the unique selling of the technology by Boone Pickens there is already a tremendous impetus behind moves to grow the industry and , in turn , displace , not initially coal , but rather natural gas .
( Though the Pickens program itself is in a little bit of a bind because of the credit crunch . )
Whether the natural gas will still be around to be displaced remains an unanswered question , since current development of the Marcellus shale is still getting under way , and the operational lifetime of the wells is still to be determined .
Interestingly the estimate for the 12 horizontal wells that Atlas is currently drilling is around $ 25 million .
They plan on drilling another dozen after these 12 are complete .
Yet wind is already causing some reduction , if only slight on a national scale , in coal use .
Dairyland has since developed an alternative plan that reduces the byproducts by using a different coal blend , said Chuck Sans Crainte , vice president , generation .
However , the new , lower - energy coal blend will reduce the electricity output of the Genoa power plant , which will be offset by power purchased from a new wind farm in Iowa , purchased power from a biomass - fueled plant being developed in Cassville and Dairyland 's share of power generated by a new power generator near Wausau , he said in a statement .
Wind itself is not without its critics , and sites that criticize the industry are likely to grow in numbers .
Talking to a colleague from Germany recently , he mentioned that concerns there seemed to be on the increase as the industry has grown larger .
Yet , even if the industry is to grow as much as projected over the years , it is unlikely in the short - term to either effect changes in fossil fuel industrial employment or in fossil fuel energy production , by itself .
Yet within the next four years , it has probably the most potential for significant impact on both power and employment of the renewable options .
Certainly a study of Australian conditions suggested the potential for the future .
. . .as a result of automation , employment in the coal mining industry fell by 45 % between 1987 and 2002 .
Moreover , as a result of the restructuring of the electricity industry as a whole , employment in the industry plunged by 50 % during the 1990s .
By serving as a substitute for coal power , the wind power industry , with 50 % local content in dollar terms , already creates two to three times the number of direct , local job - years per kWh generated than coal power .
. .
Given the investments that are currently being made in the installation of new farms it will be interesting to see how additional Federal investment can significantly impact that growth rate .
More to the point may be investments in the grid to take advantage of this potential power source , since the grid will act as the “ battery of last resort ” when for a variety of reasons the weather wo n’t co-operate .
Apparently there may or may not be problems with them operating , for example , in a blizzard , which is good , since New Zealand has joined Tibet and Alaska , to name but two , in having unexpectedly heavy snows and storms this year .
In Manitoba 10 of the 63 turbines were transiently affected as winds got above 72 km /hr .
On the other hand , as more of the nation comes to rely on their power , the grid must be sufficient to supply power when the wind is either too strong or non-existent .
And for much of that power over the next couple of decades , I strongly suspect we will still have to plan on the use of coal for most of the electric power that we need .
Though the industry may not use the tens of thousands of men that it did when I started , it is likely to continue to need an increasing number , as the energy problems around the world become more evident .
It will remain difficult to overcome the problem of scale , particularly as the liquid fuels supply diminishes , and efforts , and thus employment , to find larger numbers of increasingly smaller production sites increase .
Which leaves me wondering where all the five million new jobs will go - though I also suspect that this may depend on who does the counting .
The Queen Mother once labelled some of Britain 's EU colleagues as " Huns , wops and dagos " , a BBC broadcaster has said .
Edward Stourton , who co-presents Radio 4 's
Today programme , said the comments were made to him by the royal in the early 1990s after he returned from covering a European summit .
The story is recounted in a book published this week by the journalist - It 's A PC World .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The broadcaster said the comment left him thinking the " nation 's favourite grandmother " was a " ghastly old bigot " .
Mr Stourton , writing in his book , said after being told of his European visit , the Queen Mother said : " It will never work , you know ...
It will never work with all those Huns , wops and dagos . "
Mr Stourton added : " The words were delivered with the eyes on maximum tiara - strength twinkle , but I am afraid I froze .
" The nation 's favourite grandmother was , I thought , in fact a ghastly old bigot , a prey to precisely the kind of prejudice which had driven the conflicts the European project had been designed to prevent ...
I thought that what she had said was nasty and ugly . "
In his book the broadcaster broadly welcomes the advent of political correctness and describes himself as a " recovering male chauvinist pig " .
He describes in his book that " The first recorded modern use of the phrase is thought to be by the radical African - American writer Toni Cade in 1970 " .
' Sperm donors should be allowed to father more families ' say doctors after only 300 men volunteer in a year
Doctors are calling for sperm donors to be allowed to father more families to beat a ' critical ' shortage of donations .
The number of children being born from donor sperm is at a record low which many believe stems from a ban on anonymity for donors three years ago .
Data from the world 's first study of children born from donated sperm where the father 's identity was known shows one in three wants more contact .
Shortage : 500 hundred new sperm donors a year are needed to satisfy demand
Because children born from donor sperm or eggs in the UK can now trace their biological parents when they turn 18 , potential donors have been deterred , it is claimed .
A possible solution to the shortage is to allow men to father more than the current legal limit of 10 families , with 15 families becoming the new maximum .
Experts from the British Fertility Society ( BFS ) say this would only slightly increase the ' very small ' chance that children born from the same donor would inadvertently have babies together , raising the risk of genetic defects .
Cold storage : A frozen sperm bank in Manchester
Around 4,000 UK patients need donor sperm each year , which requires a minimum of 500 new donors to meet demand , says an editorial in the British Medical Journal .
But in 2006 there were only 307 new registrations and fewer women than ever are conceiving with a donor father .
BFS chairman Mark Hamilton and BFS secretary Allan Pacey claim many clinics have long waiting lists or have been forced to stop providing services altogether .
Dr Hamilton said : ' There is no real evidence base to suggest that 10 is a critical upper limit .
There are some countries like Holland where they permit up to 25 children to be conceived through donor insemination , rather than families .
' This is probably because of the smaller geographical area in Holland and smaller population .
' The concern in setting a limit is the genetic risk of consanguinity .
But the safety margin in terms of the number of children which might be conceived in a country like the UK is very great , and the current limit of 10 families per donor is very , very safe .
' It 's a matter of cold genetic risk versus society 's view of the notion of an individual being associated with more than just a few children .
' We are looking at it through a prism of families today which consist of one or two children but if we look back a few years having a lot of children was the norm ' .
He called for a flexible approach as some men might want to potentially father only a handful of children while others would be relaxed about the prospect of fathering many more .
He said ' Some men live in dread and fear of children resulting from donated sperm ringing them up , while others do n't mind . '
Happy families : Donors have been put off providing sperm after anonymity laws were relaxed , experts say
He said the BFS believed the 10 family limit was ' more restrictive than it needed to be ' .
' It could be increased to 15 families .
We are suggesting there should be a debate in society about this .'
Research from the Sperm Bank of California in Berkeley analysed the desires of donor - conceived children , where the donor had agreed to release their identity .
The US still allows sperm donors to remain anonymous if they wish .
The findings showed 39 children requested information on their donor father over a six - year period , representing 30 per cent of those who could have asked for it .
Of these , 59 per cent planned to contact their donor father , seven per cent did not and 34 per cent were unsure .
At least half of the group did eventually contact their donor father and some met him , says data released at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine meeting in San Francisco .
Dr Hamilton said the 30 per cent figure was interesting .
' We do n't have the data in the UK because of scant social science research .
It suggests that for 70 per cent it 's not important to contact the donor .
' Most couples that request donor insemination would like any resulting children to be similar to the parents in terms of physical characteristics and there is some evidence that where there is physical congruity , children may relate to their parents better and feel comfortable growing up to look like their parents .
' However , there is such a shortage of donors that prospective parents take what 's on offer and that may not be best for them . '
The BFS wants more resources needed to run late - opening clinics to accommodate would - be donors after normal working hours .
Clare Lewis - Jones , chief executive of Infertility Network UK , said : ' We know from the calls we receive from patients needing donor insemination how devastating it is to not be able to access the treatment they need in order to have a family because of the current shortage of sperm donors , which in some cases is simply because of where they live . '
Before the election , I wrote elsewhere about Obama 's creepy " call to service " .
Public schools will have their funding cut unless they force their students to perform 50 hours of service a year .
Since for most people , public school is the only choice they 've got , this amounts to a mandatory service program for every child in a public school in the country .
Well , it appears that this was n't just standard electioneering pablum , because Obama 's new website expounds on his plan " to require 50 hours of community service in middle school and high school and 100 hours of community service in college every year . "
This program is disturbing , representing a new government intrusion into private life cloaked in the patriotic rhetoric of " serving America , " and a crowding out of private enterprise by government - created programs using forced labor .
So it would seem that the nation 's first black president wants us to work for free .
EDIT : I note with interest that the wording of the website has been changed , no doubt because of the spate of blogs talking about it .
( Change ... our position on the issues ! )
The original full text will be posted below .
Nevertheless , the amendment is still troubling .
Grants contingent on community service , while still a matter of government taking money from taxpayers to entice others to do things , is an easier sell .
But as I argued before , this program will offer $ 40 / hour wages , enticing students away from good resume - building activities to government make - work jobs , and the proposal may well lead to tuition inflation based on simple supply and demand .
( Note that in this case the rich will be better able to afford lower - paying but better resume - building internships - a way for Democrats to play to their Upper West Side faction . )
And for secondary school the ploy will be even more coercive .
He talks about " setting a goal " to force kids to volunteer .
But how will that be accomplished ?
By the only means that the federal government has - public schools will have their funding cut unless they force their students to perform 50 hours of service a year .
APPENDIX : The original note was changed to its current stage without fanfare , retraction , or acknowledgment .
Now politicians do this all the time , so it 's not much of a criticism of the Obama administration to point this out .
It is , however , a small rebuke to those who believed that his election would somehow lead to a quantum leap in political transparency and integrity .
The original Obama blurb , before they were called on it and cloaked it in nicer sounding language :
" The Obama Administration will call on Americans to serve in order to meet the nation ’s challenges .
President - Elect Obama will expand national service programs like AmeriCorps and Peace Corps and will create a new Classroom Corps to help teachers in underserved schools , as well as a new Health Corps , Clean Energy Corps , and Veterans Corps .
Obama will call on citizens of all ages to serve America , by developing a plan to require 50 hours of community service in middle school and high school and 100 hours of community service in college every year . "
Governor Palin does n’t want anybody to worry about “ Troopergate ” anymore , nothing to see here folks !
When she protests as much as she has on this subject , you know it should be investigated further .
Oh , and by the way , it ’s business as usual again .
Palin is still going to be charging the government of Alaska a per diem to work out of her house and the state is still going to be picking up the tab for her children to fly everywhere with her .
The really bad news , we are going to be hearing more about Sarah Palin .
She refuses to fade from the limelight .
McClatchy
Palin also said she loved her time in the national spotlight and wo n’t rule out a run for president or vice president in 2012 .
Those were some of Palin ’s responses to questions posed Sunday afternoon in a wide - ranging interview with the Anchorage Daily News and KTUU Channel 2 at the governor ’s Wasilla home .
Greta Von Susteren of Fox News had just finished an interview with her and was chatting with the governor and her husband in the kitchen .
Moose chili cooked in the crock pot and moose hot dogs lay on the table .
Palin insisted they were n’t a prop for the national media but just how the family likes to dine .
Here ’s some of what she had to say :
Q — Why did your campaign lose ?
A — I think the Republican ticket represented too much of the status quo , too much of what had gone on in these last eight years , that Americans were kind of shaking their heads like going , wait a minute , how did we run up a $ 10 trillion debt in a Republican administration , how have there been blunders with war strategy under a Republican administration .
If we ’re talking change , we want to get far away from what it was that the present administration represented and that is to a great degree what the Republican Party had been representing .
Q — There ’s been an enormous amount of information about you that Alaskans have been exposed to the past couple of months — and lots of it very critical .
What are Alaskans supposed to make of all this ?
A — Regarding information regarding my record , that its now out there much of it that was based on misinformation was a very , very frustrating thing to have to go through when the record was never corrected .
And we would try to correct the record and too many in the media chose not to make those corrections .
Gosh , golly gee , it seems Sarah Palin feels misunderstood .
That meddlesome media , never gets anything right in her opinion .
Well our fondest wish , that she would quitely slink into oblivion just is n’t going to happen , not with the likes of Entertainment Tonight camped outside her door .
It looks like our suffering is going to continue …
Hackers , like life , will find a way .
Sony knows that all too well thanks to the PSP , but so far the PlayStation 3 has stood strong in the face of legions of nerds trying to find a way to exploit it .
A potentially major breakthrough may have been made , though , as well - known PS3 hacker StreetskaterFU ( we 've no idea what he 's going for with that name -- really ) has managed to decrypt the beta client for Sony 's PlayStation Home service .
Curious devs can now poke around in the files looking for a way to exploit the newish in - game XMB functionality , potentially allowing homebrew apps and game backups without hard drive swapping .
There 's no guarantee it will lead anywhere in the end , but you do n't care either way , right ?
Our upstanding readership would never participate in such heinously illegal activities .

Batman and alter ego Bruce Wayne are not dead , according to DC Comics executive editor Dan DiDio .
The caped crusader apparently falls to his death in a helicopter explosion at the conclusion of Grant Morrison 's Batman R.I.P. , moments after adversary the Black Glove reveals that he is actually Batman 's father , Dr Thomas Wayne .

The gloomy economy and falling oil and gas prices have put the damper on plenty of clean - energy projects , such as T. Boone Pickens ’ big Texas wind farm .
But today ’s storm clouds are just a passing phenomenon , if Wal - Mart ’s plans are any indication .
The Bentonville , Arkansas - based retailer just announced a deal with Duke Energy to use wind power for 15 % of the electricity at hundreds of its Texas stores .
The wind will come from a Duke wind farm slated to go operational next spring .
What ’s interesting about Wal - Mart ’s announcement is the company ’s long - term bet that using wind power will be cost - competitive with traditional power sources .
Wal - Mart ’s vice - president of energy said in a statement , “ We ’re purchasing renewable power at traditional energy rates , ” though the company did n’t disclose specific terms .
Wind power is intermittent , but it is n’t volatile .
That is , the electricity generated by wind farms is generally sold at fixed prices in long - term contracts to utilities and other big users .
Natural gas , one of the big and growing sources of power in the U.S. , has the opposite problem : it ’s a constant source of power , but prices can fluctuate wildly .
That ’s one reason power prices in Texas spiked earlier this year .
U.S.government energy analysts expect natural - gas prices to say low next year because of weak demand in the slumping economy — which is n’t the best of news for renewable energy in the short term .
Even plenty of renewable - energy enthusiasts worry that slumping fossil fuel prices will take the steam out of clean energy .
Home prices down by record amount in September Good news for Bay Area - a smaller drop

Home prices down by record amount in September 1 / 4 Back to Gallery
Home prices plunged by a record amount nationwide in September , but California 's price decline in October was less than the record drop posted the previous month .
The two reports released Tuesday left industry experts split on whether the market will worsen or stabilize in the immediate months ahead .
The closely watched Standard & Poor 's / Case - Shiller 10 - City Composite Index plummeted 18.6 percent from September 2007 , the steepest decline in 20 years of available data .
The 20 - city index dropped 17.4 percent , also a record .
The indexes , released on the last Tuesday of each month , track sales and resales of individual houses .
The losses or gains correspond to actual price changes .

" There was n't a good number in there , but these numbers do n't really reflect what 's happening now , " said Patrick Newport , U.S. economist with Englewood , Colo. , consulting firm IHS Global Insight , noting that the bad economic news began midway through September and has worsened since .
" We should expect really awful housing ( data ) for the rest of the year . "
Among the 20 cities tracked by Case - Shiller , the San Francisco metropolitan region experienced the third - largest annual plunge , 29.5 percent , and by far the largest monthly decline , 3.9 percent .
Case - Shiller defines the area as Alameda , Contra Costa , Marin , San Francisco and San Mateo counties .
Phoenix led the list with a 31.9 percent annual decline , followed by Las Vegas at 31.3 percent .
A more up - to - date report released Tuesday also showed worsening conditions in California , but not in as dramatic a fashion as some had expected .
The California Association of Realtors said the median price for existing single - family homes fell 39.9 percent in October from the same month last year to $ 311,060 .
That was down 1.9 percent from September and fell short of the revised record annual decline set last month of 40.8 percent .
Transactions across California rose 117.1 percent , reaching an annual level not seen since late 2005 , largely due to rising sales of priced - to - move foreclosed or distressed properties .
The median declined to $ 520,920 in the Bay Area , down 35.8 percent annually .
The Los Angeles trade group defines the region as San Francisco , Alameda , Contra Costa , Marin , Solano , Santa Clara and San Mateo counties .
Association President James Liptak said in a statement that most October sales probably opened escrow before the credit freeze set in , so the full impact wo n't become clear until November and December .
Economist Esmael Adibi , however , said the liquidity crisis has had ample time to drag down sales in the state and by and large has not .
He believes that the housing market could be at the beginning of what will be a long bottoming out period , with sales of foreclosed homes and new defaults slowing next year .
" There will still be negative numbers showing up , but I would think you 'll see moderation in the decline , " said Adibi , director of the Anderson Center for Economic Research at Chapman University in Orange .
Since May , Case - Shiller 's national monthly declines have rested around or below 1 percent , leading some observers to speculate that the markets were approaching a bottom several months ago .
In Tuesday 's report , the declines were 1.9 percent for the 10 - city index and 1.8 percent for the 20 - city index .
The change is n't large and could in part reflect seasonal home - buying patterns , which typically slow down at the end of summer , but is n't good news in any case .
" The key point is we do not yet see a deceleration , " said Susan Wachter , professor of real estate at the University of Pennsylvania 's Wharton School of Business .
" This is another historic decline and the drivers are still pointing down . "
The October index is sure to fall further , she said .
Beyond that , the health of the housing sector will depend on how markets react to government efforts like the $ 800 billion plan to loosen lending announced Tuesday , as well as stimulus measures to come , she said .
Standard & Poor 's expects it will take at least until the middle of next year before the housing market bottoms outs and until 2010 before prices begin to climb , Newport said .
Case - Shiller is a repeat sales index , meaning it tracks the actual price gains or declines for existing single - family homes that have traded hands at least twice .
The California Association of Realtors calculates the median value of all homes that are sold in a given month .
Industry observers say both methods have strengths and weaknesses , but that the large proportion of foreclosure sales in today 's market is skewing the results of both .
More local reports show that while prices are off 35 percent or more in areas plagued by foreclosures , such as eastern Contra Costa County , the declines are far less in coastal areas with relatively few distressed properties , such as San Francisco and Marin counties .
In a separate report on Tuesday , the Construction Industry Research Board said California housing production in October was the lowest on record .
Developers obtained permits for only 4,140 single - family homes and multifamily units during the month , down 49 percent from a year ago .
In this tough economy , Valerie Whitlock uses two forms of currency : money and barter .
The 37 - year - old actress and writer from Studio City holds down sporadic film and television gigs to cover her rent , utilities , car payments and insurance .
For everything else -- head shots and haircuts , clothing and cut reels -- she trades her handcrafted jewelry .
She started swapping for goods while at work on the set .
But now the classifieds website Craigslist and her MySpace page for Fancy Pants Jewelry have become great places to find even more trading partners .
Her best scores include microdermabrasion treatments , a used Apple G4 iBook computer and Marc Jacobs jeans .
“ Jewelry - making has become a creative outlet for me as well as an extra income and barter tool , ” Whitlock said .
“ It has made a huge difference in my life . ”

As the financial crisis makes cash and credit increasingly scarce , the ancient custom of bartering is booming .
Cost - conscious consumers are getting creative to make every dollar count .
Some are dusting off books , DVDs , video games and other little - used items to trade for necessities or gifts .
Others are exchanging services such as house painting for Web design or guitar lessons for clerical work .
These newly minted cheapskates are seeing the world through green eyeshades , cutting costs wherever and whenever they can .
“ In the last couple of months , it ’s been like a bucket of cold water in our faces , ” said Mary Hunt , founder of money management site DebtProofLiving.com .
“ It has woken us up .
We are paying attention to what things cost . ”

Every recession triggers bartering , economists say .
But the Internet has given the practice unprecedented reach .
Before the Web connected strangers from all corners of the country , bartering was limited by geography and social circle .
As a form of everyday currency , bartering has downsides .
It ’s far more time - consuming and tricky to negotiate the exchange of goods and services than it is to simply plunk down some bills .
Sometimes prospective swappers flake out or try to rip off their trading partners .
Transactions do n’t always go smoothly .
Plus , there are potential tax liabilities .
The Internal Revenue Service considers income from bartering taxable .
Getting creative

Still , exchanging something you no longer want or need for something you do is appealing to many .
A growing number of websites , including TradeaFavor.com and JoeBarter.com , cater to the cost - conscious .
There were 148,097 listings in the barter category of Craigslist in September , up sharply from 83,554 a year earlier , according to the classifieds website .
Bartering via Craigslist ’s Los Angeles service was up 72 % over the same time , with 4,009 listings in September .
Specialty sites such as PaperBackSwap.com and Peerflix.com , are also popular .
Jessica Hardwick , founder of SwapThing.com , started noticing an uptick in bartering in the spring .
Families who were worried about the soaring price of groceries and gas started taking vacations by swapping homes with people who lived within a few hours ’ drive .
As the kids prepared to go back to school after their trips , they bartered PlayStation games , skis , even a bicycle for school uniforms .
Interest soars
Over the last few months , her Cupertino , Calif . - based site ’s membership and traffic have snowballed as more people look to trade their talent and time .
With 162,000 members , SwapThing.com , which used to be populated by collectors and video - game enthusiasts , has been transformed into a bustling bazaar for everyday goods and services .

“ As long as the economy is the way it is , people have to find alternative ways to get the things they need and want , ” Hardwick said .
“ People are turning to the Internet . ”
That ’s where Erin Huggins , a 35 - year - old Pilates instructor in Los Angeles , is building her business .
After stints promoting bands , tending bar and working for Courtney Love , Huggins traded the rock ‘ n ’ roll lifestyle for the healing arts .
She opened her own Pilates studio in 2005 but had to shutter it in April , when she lost some clients who had been thrown out of work by the Hollywood writers strike .
So she shifted her strategy .
Now she sees a handful of clients in a home studio , and she ’s growing her practice online by creating a virtual studio at ErinHuggins.com , where people can download instructional videos .

Sense of community
Huggins is also using the Internet to stretch her budget .
She swapped one year of Pilates and nutritional consulting for branding and image consulting worth about $ 30,000 .
She saves $ 500 a month on body work by trading her services with a friend who is a massage therapist .
She also barters for the smaller stuff .
Rather than plunk down cash , she ’s hoping to offer someone an hour of private Pilates instruction , which normally costs $ 150 , to clean her house once a week .
“ I do n’t think people realize the power of bartering , ” Huggins said .
“ Sometimes we do n’t value what we have in our services because we put so much value on the tangible dollar . ”

For avid swappers , cash - free transactions provide a sense of community and connection that money can’t always buy .
Chris Murphy , a 42 - year - old violinist from Santa Monica , has been bartering for years .
He exchanged private lessons for website design services and played a wedding for a used Nissan Pathfinder .
Soon he was trading for vacation homes in Big Bear , even legal services .
He gives some of his students barter credits :
For every four hours they work in his office doing data entry and other duties , they get a music lesson .
Holiday budgeting
For Elle Febbo , a 34 - year - old freelance writer and mother of four sons from Saugus , bartering is more of a necessity .
Finances tightened with the writers strike -- her husband is a key grip -- and she was out of work for a few years recovering from skin cancer and working with a nonprofit organization to help others cope with the disease .

The family made big changes , such as renting out their home and moving into a smaller one to scrimp on expenses .
She also barters .
That ’s how she exchanged a flat iron she won in a raffle for five BB guns and four walkie - talkies for summer camping trips .
“ I count it as a blessing that bartering is an option , ” Febbo said .
“ Somebody ’s got what you need , you have something someone else wants . ”
Helen Roberts , an economics professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago , says holiday shoppers will turn to bartering and other cost - saving measures this year as their confidence in the economy sinks .
“ People are feeling they ca n’t blow the budget in the way they used to be able to , ” she said .
But people wo n’t buck the cash economy when good times return , said Lawrence J. White , professor of economics at New York University ’s Stern School of Business .

“ Bartering waxes and wanes , ” White said .
“ Money is really the most efficient mechanism . ”

We have known for a while that many on the far right are unmoored , floating around in a fantasy land of their own creation , but who knew they would not even get their fantasy land correct ?
In the latest attempt to defend Palin ’s utter inability to name any Supreme Court cases other than Roe with which she disagreed , Malkin posts this comment from one of her readers about how Palin should have responded :
Palin : Now , let me ask you a question , Katie .
You interviewed Senator Biden recently .
So when you asked him this same question , would you care to share with me his answer ?
Couric :
Well , I did n’t ask him that question .
Palin :
You did n’t ?
Why not ?
He ’s a VP nominee .
I ’m a VP nominee .
Do n’t you want to know what Supreme Court decisions he disagrees with ?
Why are you only interested in my perspective on this ?
Couric : …………. ( Katie ) Crickets chirping …..
That sure would have showed Katie !
Take that evil liberal Soros led commie media !
Except , of course , as Malkin later notes , Couric did ask Biden that question .
He answered it in full sentences , too , the sexist bastard .
Even in their fantasies to take down the evil liberal media , they still manage to make Palin look stupid .
But it was fun for five minutes , right guys ?
And let me just close with this - if Katie Couric is making you look dumb , the gig is up .
Jacqui Smith , the home secretary , has asked the attorney general to investigate possible " criminal wrongdoing " by the MI5 and the CIA over its treatment of a British resident held in Guantánamo Bay , it was revealed tonight .
The dramatic development over allegations of collusion in torture and inhuman treatment follows a high court judgment which found that an MI5 officer participated in the unlawful interrogation of Binyam Mohamed .
The MI5 officer interrogated Mohamed while he was being held in Pakistan in 2002 .
It emerged tonight that lawyers acting for Smith have sent the attorney general , Baroness Scotland , evidence about MI5 and CIA involvement in the case , which was heard behind closed doors in high court hearings .
In a letter seen by the Guardian , they have asked Scotland - as an independent law officer - to investigate " possible criminal wrongdoing " .
The move could lead to a criminal prosecution .
The evidence was suppressed following gagging orders demanded by David Miliband , the foreign secretary , and the US authorities .
The action by Smith , the minister responsible for MI5 activities , is believed to be unprecedented .
A Home Office spokesman confirmed tonight that the letter and closed evidence had been sent to the attorney .
It had no further comment .
Tonight Clive Stafford Smith , director of the legal charity Reprieve , which represents Guantánamo detainees , welcomed the move .
He said : " This is a welcome recognition that the CIA cannot just go rendering British residents to secret torture chambers without any consequences , and British agents cannot take part in American crimes without facing the music " .
He added : " Reprieve will be making submissions to the attorney general to ensure that those involved in these crimes – from the US , Pakistan , Morocco , Britain , and elsewhere – are held responsible . "
Richard Stein of Leigh Day , which is acting for Mohamed in the British courts , said : " Ultimately the British government had little choice in the matter , once they conceded that a case had been made out that Binyam Mohamed was tortured . "
" The Convention Against Torture rightly imposes an obligation on signatory states to investigate cases of torture , and we look forward to a full and open airing of the crimes committed against Mr Mohamed and a thorough investigation by the Police and Crown Prosecution Service into this case . "
Reprieve has argued that the case against Mohamed should be dropped by the US government , and that he should be returned to the UK , as the British government requested in August 2007 .
It says Mohamed is a victim of " extraordinary rendition " and torture .
They claim that all the evidence against him was the " fruit of torture " .
Mohamed was seized in Pakistan and later secretly rendered to Morocco , Afghanistan , and then to the US base in Cuba .
He claims that while in Morocco he was tortured by having his penis sliced with a razor .
In the high court earlier this month , Lord Justice Thomas and Mr Justice Lloyd Jones condemned as " deeply disturbing " a refusal by the US to disclose evidence .
In a particularly damning passage , they said claims by Mohamed 's lawyers that the US was refusing to release the papers because " torturers do not readily hand over evidence of their conduct " could not be dismissed and required an answer .
Charges against Mohamed - including that he was involved in a dirty bomb plot - have been dropped , allegedly to prevent the US from revealing torture evidence .
The US authorities now planned to charge him with other offences , the judges noted .
Backstory
Binyam Mohamed , 30 , an Ethiopian national who worked in London as a janitor , was held in Pakistan in 2002 , where he was interrogated by an unidentified MI5 officer .
The CIA secretly rendered him to Morocco .
The US flew him to Afghanistan , where he was held incognito before being flown to Guantánamo Bay in September 2004 , where he remains .
In 2007 , the British government asked that he should be released .
The US refused and said he must be tried by a special military commission in Guantánamo Bay .
In court hearings in Britain , David Miliband , the foreign secretary , has said that documents believed to show Mohamed was tortured must not be released because the US wants to keep the evidence secret .
The US has warned that if the UK courts ordered the release of the documents , America might stop sharing intelligence with Britain .
MI5 was involved in Mohamed 's interrogation in Pakistan , where the high court says he was held unlawfully .

This is Geithner ’s bio from the New York Fed .
I ’ve emphasized a few little mom and pop outfits that any agent of Change / Hope would obviously be involved with .
By some miracle , though , he ’s not a former CEO of Goldman Sachs !*
* But read the Bloomberg piece below . :
Timothy F. Geithner became the ninth president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on November 17 , 2003 .
In that capacity , he serves as the vice chairman and a permanent member of the Federal Open Market Committee , the group responsible for formulating the nation ’s monetary policy .
Mr. Geithner joined the Department of Treasury in 1988 and worked in three administrations for five Secretaries of the Treasury in a variety of positions .
He served as Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs from 1999 to 2001 under Secretaries Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers .
He was director of the Policy Development and Review Department at the International Monetary Fund from 2001 until 2003 .
Before joining the Treasury , Mr. Geithner worked for Kissinger Associates , Inc. Mr. Geithner graduated from Dartmouth College with a bachelor ’s degree in government and Asian studies in 1983 and from the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies with a master ’s in International Economics and East Asian Studies in 1985 .
He has studied Japanese and Chinese and has lived in East Africa , India , Thailand , China , and Japan .
Mr. Geithner serves as chairman of the G - 10 ’s Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems of the Bank for International Settlements .
He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Group of Thirty .
He and his wife , Carole Sonnenfeld Geithner , have two children .
Via : Bloomberg :
The appointment of Timothy Geithner as U.S. Treasury secretary would deprive Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke of his top troubleshooter on Wall Street , compelling the Fed chief to act fast to find a replacement .
Geithner ’s departure would mean the loss of the Fed executive Bernanke has relied on most to keep the financial system from collapsing in this year ’s credit crisis .
His successor may be another official involved in the government ’s response , such as Fed Governor Kevin Warsh or New York Fed markets chief William Dudley , economists said .
Bernanke turned to Geithner , 47 , president of the New York Fed , to carry out the rescues of Bear Stearns Cos. and American International Group Inc. , and to help stem market turmoil after the decision to allow Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. to fail .
Geithner was involved in the weekend ’s government rescue of Citigroup Inc. and oversees most of the Fed ’s special lending programs set up this year to channel more than $ 1 trillion to banks and other financial institutions .
Leadership of the New York Fed is “ always an important post but vastly more important at the moment , ” said former Fed Governor Lyle Gramley , now senior economic adviser at Stanford Group Co. in Washington .
“ It would be very important to fill it as rapidly as possible . ”
Obama ’s Announcement
President - elect Barack Obama announced today that he will nominate Geithner as Treasury secretary , and will appoint Lawrence Summers , Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton , to head the National Economic Council .
The president of the New York Fed serves as the vice chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee and is the only district bank president with a permanent vote on interest rates .
The other 11 presidents rotate votes every two or three years .
The New York Fed is the largest of the 12 district banks and plays a unique role , serving as the central bank ’s chief liaison to securities firms and trading with bond dealers to keep the Fed ’s main interest rate close to the target set by policy makers .
The bank , which employs about 2,800 people , supervises some of the biggest U.S. commercial banks , with examiners reviewing their books on a regular basis .
Should Geithner become Treasury secretary , Dudley , the New York Fed ’s executive vice president for markets , may serve as interim president , Gramley said .
Dudley , 55 , former chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , worked with Geithner on conceiving and operating the special lending programs .
He joined the New York Fed in January 2007 after two decades at Goldman and is in charge of the central bank ’s trading with Wall Street bond dealers .

Nov. 10 , 2008 ( New Orleans ) --
If you 're worried about your blood pressure , you may want to follow the British custom of regularly " sipping a cuppa " -- tea , that is .
In a new study , drinking three cups of herbal tea containing hibiscus each day lowered blood pressure .
" Most of the commercial herbal tea blends in the United States contain hibiscus , " says Diane L. McKay , PhD , of Tufts University in Boston .
She tells WebMD that people with the highest blood pressure at the start of the six - week study benefited the most .
McKay presented the study of 65 healthy men and women with modestly elevated blood pressure at the American Heart Association ( AHA ) meeting here .
Overall , drinking hibiscus tea blends lowered systolic blood pressure -- the top number in the blood pressure reading -- by an average of 7 points .
That was significantly more than the 1 - point drop observed in people who were given a placebo in the form of hibiscus - flavored water , McKay says .
While a 7 - point drop in blood pressure might not seem like much , she says studies have shown that " even small changes in blood pressure ... when maintained over time ... will reduce the risk of stroke and heart attack . "
Past AHA president Robert H. Eckel , MD , says that more study is needed to determine whether herbal tea's blood - pressure - lowering effect can actually be sustained over the long haul .
The degree of blood pressure lowering associated with tea drinking in the study was as much as would be expected with standard blood pressure drugs , he says .
John McCain and Barack Obama took their first steps down the path of reconciliation – and potential cooperation – with a meeting Monday in Chicago .
McCain , Obama carve out rocky alliance
CHICAGO – During his short time in the U.S. Senate , Barack Obama forged alliances with several Republicans , but the only relationship riddled with public drama was with John McCain , who pierced the norm of Senate collegiality in 2006 with a brusque letter accusing the freshman senator of “ disingenuousness . ”
Two years , one spat over an ethics reform bill and a tense presidential campaign later , former rivals who were never close are now trying to start anew .

Obama and McCain took their first steps down the path of reconciliation – and potential cooperation – with a meeting Monday at the president - elect ’s transition headquarters in Chicago .
After months of campaign combat , the men sat side - by - side , flanked by American flags and the confidants who brought them together : Obama ’s incoming White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel and McCain ’s friend Lindsey Graham , a Republican senator from South Carolina .
Both sides stand to benefit from the unusually early show of comity .
For Obama , he can make good on promises to work across party lines and approach governing as a pragmatist – central tenets of his candidacy that were often called into question by Republicans .
McCain , meanwhile , can rebuild his image as a bipartisan workhorse with the clout and skills of compromise to pull off big feats in the Senate .
The foursome smiled for the cameras during a photo opportunity and made small talk about football and the media .
Obama joked that “ the national press is tame compared to the Chicago press , ” and called a reporter “ incorrigible ” for trying to lob more questions .
When asked if he would help the Obama administration , McCain replied , “ Obviously . ”
They spent half the time talking about “ the need to change the way Washington works , ” said an Obama advisor briefed on the hour - long meeting .
Although they disagreed during the campaign over the way to tamp down special interest influence , they had a similar orientation toward Washington and plan to work together on changing the culture , the advisor said .
They also discussed the financial crisis , energy and national security , including closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay for enemy combatants – a position that both men hold .
“ At this defining moment in history , we believe that Americans of all parties want and need their leaders to come together and change the bad habits of Washington so that we can solve the common and urgent challenges of our time , ” Obama and McCain said in a joint statement .
“ It is in this spirit that we had a productive conversation today about the need to launch a new era of reform where we take on government waste and bitter partisanship in Washington in order to restore trust in government , and bring back prosperity and opportunity for every hardworking American family .
We hope to work together in the days and months ahead on critical challenges like solving our financial crisis , creating a new energy economy , and protecting our nation ’s security . ”
The dynamic of their relationship wo n’t be known for some time , but associates to both men said they were committed to trying to make it work .
The meeting itself came together rather easily , aides said , with McCain and Obama initially discussing a sit - down during their phone conversation on election night .
Obama followed up with Graham during a routine post - Election Day courtesy call , and Graham called on Emanuel to nail down details .
Sen. Bob Casey ( D - Pa. ) , an ally of Obama ’s , said “ both possess the capacity to rise above ” the rancor of the campaign .
The Obama advisor added that the president - elect is ready to move on , saying “ it was a heated and competitive race but he is good about when these things are over , he lets bygones be bygones . ”
Steve Duprey , a close friend of McCain ’s who traveled with him nearly every day , downplayed the disdain that the Arizona senator showed towards Obama , particularly in the final weeks of the campaign .
“ Sure , they enjoyed taking it to each other , but it was in the spirit of a good , hard - fought campaign , ” he said .
“ John McCain has shown willingness in the past to reach across the aisle and get stuff done , perhaps more than any other senator .
President - elect Obama is going to need the help of John McCain to put this partisan , hard - fought election behind us and get important stuff done . ”
But Obama and McCain cannot fall back on a relationship that predates the presidential contest .
Their interactions in the Senate were lukewarm at best .
“ It was non-existent but not good , ” said a Republican familiar with their relationship .
“ He fell under the rule of ‘ Who is this whippersnapper ? ’ ”
The worst turn came in 2006 during a very public spat between the two over ethics reform .
McCain came away from a meeting with Obama and other senators convinced that Obama was committed to a bipartisan task force on ethics reform .
The following day Obama wrote a letter to McCain saying that he supported the Democrats legislation over a task force .
McCain was livid and fired off an angry letter to Obama and copied it to reporters .
“ I would like to apologize to you for assuming that your private assurances to me regarding your desire to cooperate in our efforts to negotiate bipartisan lobbying reform legislation were sincere , ” McCain wrote in a sarcasm - laced letter to Obama in February 2006 .
“ As I noted , I initially believed you shared that goal , ” the letter concluded .
“ But I understand how important the opportunity to lead your party ’s effort to exploit this issue must seem to a freshman Senator , and I hold no hard feelings over your earlier disingenuousness .
Again , I have been around long enough to appreciate that in politics the public interest is n't always a priority for every one of us .
Good luck to you , Senator . ”
Obama , in a letter still posted on his Senate website , responded with incredulity :
“ I confess that I have no idea what has prompted your response .
But let me assure you that I am not interested in typical partisan rhetoric or posturing . ”
McCain is a 72 - year - old former Navy officer who spent five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam and has served more than 25 years in Congress .
Four years ago Obama , 47 , was an Illinois state lawmaker who had just been elected to the U.S. Senate .
They are of two different generational mindsets : one that values seniority , putting in one ’s time and awaiting your turn ; and another that takes a “ Why not ? ” approach that has less regard for seniority than innovation .
McCain allies have said in the past that the Arizona senator saw Obama as an upstart who was reaching for the top when he had n’t put in his time .
They patched things up for the cameras , but some of that bitterness lingered and certainly carried through in the presidential campaign , where McCain cast Obama as a community organizer who was too green to lead the nation ; and Obama pitched McCain as part of an old guard it was time to replace .
The meeting of the two formal rivals , followed by pledges to work together , underscores the unusualness of this election .
President Bush made a quick courtesy call to Al Gore in 2000 , but did n't sit down with John Kerry in 2004 .
Bill Clinton traveled to the White House in 1992 , but that trip was to discuss transition matters .
And Clinton met Bob Dole in late December 1996 in the Oval Office for about an hour .
Clinton gave Dole American flag cufflinks and the White House Christmas ornament .
Dole gave Clinton a gift from his dog - a stocking full of cat treats for the Clinton 's cat , Socks .
Presidential historian Robert Dallek pointed out that John F. Kennedy , a leader Obama has been compared to , met with his former Republican challenger , Richard Nixon , after winning election in 1960 .
“ Not that it led to very much , ” Dallek said , adding that such meetings are not commonplace .
“ I would n’t say it ’s fairly customary . ”
Sarah Palin is the rogue elephant in the GOP war room .
The maverick mom is distancing herself from John McCain and blowing off the advice of senior Republican aides , convinced they ’re damaging her reputation and ruining the campaign .
Things have gotten so tense between Palin and her traveling staff , an insider said , that she ’s overruling their advice – which was evident last week when she ignored GOP aides piling into waiting cars at a Colorado event and strolled over to the press corps for an impromptu talk .
In speeches , Palin has contradicted her running mate ’s positions on issues , telling a Christian news outlet last week that she would support a constitutional amendment against same - sex marriage , which McCain opposes .
Though McCain once said he considered Obama ’s relationship with the Rev. Jeremiah Wright to be an old issue , this month Palin said , “ I do n’t know why that association is n’t discussed more . ”
Palin also publicly stated that she thought it was a mistake for the campaign to give up on Michigan , and that she thought voters were annoyed by robocalls – which McCain uses extensively .
The last straw for the vice - presidential candidate was the raft of criticism from the $ 150,000 worth of high - end clothes the Republican National Committee bought her , a campaign source said .
Palin showed how much that gaffe got under her skin yesterday at a rally in Sioux City , Iowa , telling the crowd she ’d stepped off the plane and donned a warm , cream - colored jacket .
“ And it ’s my own jacket , ” she said .
A McCain insider told The Post that relations between Palin and some of the campaign aides with her have soured .
“ She ’s lost faith with the staff .
She knows the $ 150,000 - wardrobe story damaged her , ” the insider said .
But the novice vice - presidential candidate is partly to blame , the campaign official sniped .
“ She ’s an adult .
She did n’t ask questions about where the clothes came from ? ” the source said .
“ She ’s now positioning herself for her own future .
Of course , this is bad for John .
It looks like no one is in charge . ”
Palin is not likely to roll over and let herself be scapegoated if things do n’t go well on Nov. 4 .
“ She ’s a lot savvier , politically speaking , than people give her credit for , ” said a GOP strategist .
“ Everyone is trying to distance themselves from responsibility for the campaign going south .
Why would n’t she do the same ? ”

Linux Game " System of Tomorrow " Ships in Two Weeks
by Ostatic Staff - Nov. 19 , 2008
Related Blog Posts Open Source vs. Proprietary : Both Models Need Each Other
Last month I wrote about the EVO Linux - based gaming console .
The term " gaming console " seemed a bit misleading to me at the time -- it is ultimately where parent company Envizions Computer Entertainment would like the EVO to be -- but it is an early adopter system in the truest sense of the phrase .
The EVO Smart Console was originally scheduled for release on November 18th .
It seems the FCC approval and testing process is taking longer than planned .
Envizions expects the consoles to ship in the next two weeks .
There are also two versions ( in four configurations ) available .
Two versions ?
You guessed it -- Linux and Windows .
Honestly , the EVO 's approach seemed a bit shaky , but I still hoped the model could be workable .
It 's not so much that customers and partners requested a Windows version of the hopeful Linux - based gaming system that surprises ( or even disappoints ) me .
On some level , it 's hard for me to fault Envizions for giving its customers and partners what they want -- until I realize that in doing so , it 's apparent the company was n't all that sold ( or convinced ) on the idea of a gaming console ( Linux or otherwise ) in the first place .
In this press release , Envizions CEO Derrick Samuels says that " ... by offering two versions of the system it will make an easier transition for new customers to gradually experience the EVO Linux platform . "
That seems reasonable , people do buy hardware with Windows pre-installed and eventually switch to Linux .
The next statement makes me question how realistic the " users will switch to the EVO platform " is and how committed and viable the " Linux - based gaming console " idea was in Envizions ' eyes : " The Windows EVO unit wo n't play our custom games but may support our download game platform . "
I am assuming ( perhaps incorrectly ) that " custom games " means those developed for the Linux platform ( which is still a lone future release of Hexxen II ) .
I am assuming that the downloaded games that might be supported are those found on the EVO - Direct game site .
If this is the case -- many ( if not all ) of the games there are available for Windows from the get - go .
The EVO Smart Console is n't solely about games , of course .
But it does n't offer anything more earth - shatteringly innovative than many other system builders provide .
There 's the promise of Linux games , and downloadable games for Windows .
But Envizions ' investment in the " Linux gaming " promise no longer feels remotely firm enough to get a foothold .
And those buying the Windows version probably are n't doing so for the games offered now , and even less so for future game releases -- they 're already using their consoles to that end .
SolFocus Installing World 's Largest Concentrated Solar Project in Spain
November 3rd , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Earlier today , concentrated solar company SolFocus announced that it has signed a deal to install over 10 MW of its systems in Spain for EMPE Solar .
Upon its completion in 2010 , the $ 103 million , multi-site project will be the largest concentrated solar deployment in the world .
SolFocus estimates that the project will be able to meet the domestic energy requirements of 40,000 homes .
SolFocus modules use mirrors and reflective optics to concentrate the sun ’s rays 500 times onto a solar cell .
As a result , the systems use 1/1000 the amount of photovoltaic material typically used in PV modules .
Today ’s announcement comes on the heels of a completed 3 MW SolFocus installation for the Institute of Concentration Photovoltaic Systems in Spain — a project intended to showcase the reliability , scalability , and efficiency of concentrated solar .
Those of us in the United States may not have to wait too long to reap the benefits of a SolFocus project — the company plans on announcing a commercial project in the California desert in the near future .

In one study , 94 percent of bills had pathogenic or potentially pathogenic organisms on them .
( Interestingly , another study showed 92 percent tested positive for cocaine . )
But at the end of the day , are they dangerous ?
No .
Our skin provides a barrier .
Just avoid sucking on dollar bills , and do less cocaine , please .
2 . What 's the popping sound in my hip ( or elbow or knee ) when I do certain stretches or exercises ?
When you stretch a joint , it creates a vacuum that literally sucks gas out of the fluid inside the joint .
Pop .
No big deal .
3 . Does warm water quench thirst as effectively as cold water ?
No .
Cold water actually slows gastric emptying , and because the water hangs around longer , it gives your stomach time to tell your brain that you 're hydrated .
4 . When I notice a new problem , how many days should I wait for it to go away before I talk to a doctor ?
If you have crushing chest pain that feels like an elephant is sitting on your chest , maybe see a doctor , because you 're having a heart attack .
Same if you 're passing out .
But if you 've got diarrhea or the flu , two to three days is very reasonable .
Five to seven days for a sprained joint .
5. Carrots : honestly good for the eyes or old wives ' tale ?
Lutein is the best for eyes — and it's in leafy , green vegetables .
The carrot rumor was started during the Second World War .
The Nazis realized that the British were getting a lot of lucky shots on their aircraft , and so the British started the rumor that their pilots were being given carrots to improve their eyesight .
Which was hogwash .
What they really did was discover radar .
6 . I 've had lower - back pain for years .
Flares up when I run on concrete , like when I play tennis or basketball .
Any athletic shoes or equipment that you can recommend to soften the impact ?
You want orthotics .
They work .
I like Zapz ( masterfitenterprises.com ) .
7 . My dermatologist asked me how many sunburns I got before I was 18 .
Is that when I screwed myself with the melanoma ?
We used to think you got most of your UV exposure before age 18 .
Now we know it 's more like 25 percent .
But even if you burn once , you increase the chance of developing melanoma .
But we 're talking about blistering burns , like in The Heartbreak Kid .
Not just a little redness .
8 . What kind of stories do heart surgeons tell at the bar after work ?
It 's usually jokes .
Medical jokes .
" You hear the one about the constipated accountant ?
Worked it out with a pencil . "
9 . Are fresh berries healthier than frozen ones ?
There 's not that big a difference — probably 20 percent — in the nutrient levels .
But the good thing about frozen berries is they do n't lose those nutrients over time .
Net , frozen berries are a great value .
10 .
My bum knees mean I can't jog .
What are your recommended alternatives ?
And please do n't say elliptical machine .
Boredom 's worse than joint pain .
Elliptical machine .
But if you want something more athletic , cycling or swimming are both high - energy and low - impact .
11 . When it comes to vitamins and supplements , can there be too much of a good thing ?
Yes .
Just go with a complete daily multivitamin plus DHA - omega - 3 fats .
Add some extra vitamin D if the multi does n't give you the 1,000 IUs ( international units ) you need .
12 . Do women really have smaller bladders than men , and is that why they have to stop to pee every 17 miles ?
Yep .

久しぶり にR30さんが ” 「日本語吹き替え番組禁止法」はいかが？”というエントリーを更新していた。ニュースであれ、映画であれ「日本語吹き替え」があらゆるところで、かなり手厚いレベルでなされていることそのものが日本人の英語力の低下を招いている、という骨子でなかなか面白い。「母国語吹き替え」サービスのレベルは国の経済状況によって異なり、貧しい国ほど「母国語吹き替え」サービスに乏しく、英語コンテンツしかみることができないため、英語力が強いという仮説は新鮮かつ納得感がある。
この高度 な 「
日本語吹き替え」サービスを当然のことと思う日本人体質というのは、私のように外資系のIT企業に勤める人間には結構やっかいで、あらゆるものに日本語化が求められ、日本語化の度合いが薄いことイコール日本マーケットへの投資が不十分ととらえられてしまう。確かに、「サービスを提供するお客様の母国語の文書をそろえるなんて当たり前じゃん」と言われれば、それを真っ向から否定することはできないのだが、お隣の中国や韓国と比較してみると「母国語吹き替え」サービスへの日本の要求水準ははるかに高い。この要求水準の高さは、断トツで先進国ナンバー1だろう。資本を持つ本国に「日本語吹き替え」サービスのための予算配分を求め、「他の国はこの書類については英語でOKなのに、何故日本だけここまで徹底的に何でもかんでも翻訳をしないといけないんだ」と言われると、お客様志向という点で強く反論したい反面、国際競争力という点で本当に日本はこのままでいいのだろうかという疑問が頭をもたげるのも事実。
カスタマーの目線でみると、うちの会社はSalesforce.comを使っており、日本語メニューもあるのだが、" Contact ” を" 取引先責任 者 ” と訳したり 、" Commit ” を " 達成最善予 測 ” と訳したり、殆ど意味不明なので、私は英語メニューを使っている*1。お金をかけて訳しているのに、日本語の方がはるかにわかりにくいという逆転現象がおきてしまっているのは何とももの悲しい。
ことIT業界について言えば、販社、代理店、SIerなど様々なプレイヤーが多段階層を構築しており、日本の商慣習にInsensitiveな外資系IT企業になりかわり「日本語吹き替え」及び「日本向けハイタッチ」サービスを提供して食い扶持を稼いでおり、この流れを助長しているように見受けられる。
こういった御用聞きは、いるにこしたことはないが、別の味方をすれば彼らが日本企業の変化を阻害していると言うこともできる。特に「日本向けハイタッチ」サービス（何でもかんでも物納と納品書を求めるとか、見積書には必ず社印を押すとか、署名が不可とか、etc）について階層構造を構成するプレイヤーである、販社、代理店、SIerなどに聞くと、「当然必要である、おたくは日本市場を全く理解していない」と叱責されるが、実際にお客様に話を聞けば実はかれらが言うほど絶対的に必要というわけではない。「日本のお客様はサービスの提供であっても”モノ”の納品が必須」と彼らは声高に叫ぶが、実際にお客様ときちんと話せば、なければダメということは殆どない。
最後は少し話がよれたが、こういったパラダイス鎖国現象はじわじわと日本の競争力をそぐものであり、もう少し緩和する必要がある。「押印禁止法」とか、「役務提供契約時の物納禁止法」とか、「月末締翌月末払い禁止法」などの法律を施行し、世界の視点でみれば奇習といえるおじさんたちの大好きな「日本の商慣習」をまず法的に禁じてしまうのが手っ取り早い。まぁ、それによって職を失う人がでるので一筋縄にはいかないだろうが・・・。

Thank you for respectful reaction .
You can still dislike the candidate but have compassion for him .
Freepers should be careful about some of the cynical and cruel responses about her death .

" Nature , well - being and elegant relaxation await you at the Rifugio ' Valle Grande ' Country House , " promises the English version of the Abruzzo country hotel ’s website , " … surrounded by a vast private forest at the foot of the beautiful historic Mount Queglia .
According to tradition , this is the site where the Italic tribes swore their oath against Rome in 90 BC . "
And according to the Italian police it is also the site where two of the most outrageous fraudsters in recent Italian history retired to count the millions in blackmail takings they had extorted from lonely German billionairesses , to bury at least € 2 m ( £ 1.6 m ) in the hotel grounds , and to launder much of the rest into new luxury cars including a Ferrari , a Lamborghini and a Rolls - Royce .
The owner of the Valle Grande Country House , Ernano Barretta , 63 , is in jail in Italy ; his accomplice , gigolo par excellence Helg Sgarbi , 41 , was arrested in Austria and is in prison in Germany facing trial for extortion .
The story of their incredible swindle , and how greed got the better of them , first emerged in Italy in June with Mr Barretta ’s arrest .
At the time the name of their alleged victim was kept out of the media .
But now that she has been revealed as BMW heiress Susanne Klatten , the richest woman in Germany , the story has taken on a new dimension .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
And not only because of the stratospheric wealth of Ms Klatten , and the hole the affair has punched in the privacy of one of Germany ’s most discreet business dynasties .
But also because Helg Sgarbi – if leaks from the interrogation of his partner are to be believed – was much more than just a staggeringly effective extortioner .
He is also said to be a man bent on exacting revenge for the crimes of BMW against his father , a Polish Jew and , during the war , a slave labourer in a BMW factory .
The group made munitions , aero engines and batteries for U - boats and V2 rockets .
If it is true , as alleged , that Mr Sgarbi bedded Ms Klatten in posh hotels in Monte Carlo , Munich and elsewhere , he was sleeping with the enemy , with a cruel vendetta in mind .
Mrs Klatten , 46 , is the great grand - daughter of Gunther Quandt , the founder of BMW who died in 1954 and whose first wife , Magda , later married the Nazi propaganda chief , Joseph Goebbels .
The heiress has a degree in marketing and management from the University of Buckingham and worked with with Dresdner Bank and McKinsey , the consultants , before she was appointed to the supervisory board of BMW in 1997 .
The fame of her name has dogged her – she narrowly avoided being kidnapped at the age of 16 – and led to her sometimes using a false one .
Her husband , Jan Klatten , a BMW engineer , says when he first flirted with an attractive new trainee called " Susanne Kant " , he had no idea that she owned 12.5 per cent of the company .
Mr Sgarbi is said to have met Mrs Klatten in 2006 and they became lovers .
They met in Monte Carlo and elsewhere for sex , he said , but they were not alone .
Every time they checked into a hotel room , Mr Barretta is said to have booked the room next door .
When they walked on the street together , Mr Barretta was there with his video camera to record it .
When they went to bed , he contrived to film those private moments , too .
During one of these trysts , Mr Sgarbi is said to have unloaded a terrifying personal problem on to his girlfriend : he told her that , while travelling in the United States , he had been involved in a car smash during which a child had died .
The child 's parents were members of the Italian - American mafia , they blamed him for the death and they wanted millions in compensation , or Mr Sgarbi was in trouble .
Mrs Klatten gave him € 7.5 m " to get the mafia off his back " .
But Mr Sgarbi , like the rest of the world , knew Mrs Klatten was worth far more than that .
So in the autumn of 2007 he allegedly contacted her again and this time asked for € 49 m .
The " dead Mafia child " was no longer an issue .
Now he revealed that he had videos of them making love which he would make public if she did not pay up .
Ms Klatten is not a senior BMW executive on account of her name alone , and she succeeded in haggling down to € 14 m .
Which she had no intention of paying .
She arranged a rendezvous , but when Mr Sgarbi turned up to collect the money he met police , with a warrant for his arrest .
Investigators learnt that Mr Sgarbi had been on the telephone all that morning with Mr Barretta , who became the investigation 's next target .
And slowly the story of the Valle Grande began to unfold .

Mr Barretta was a poverty - stricken Abruzzo boy who made good .
As lord of the Valle Grande manor , he has told visiting journalists his rags - to - riches story : how as a child he walked 10 kilometres to school , how he was apprenticed as a stone - mason but threw it up to emigrate , finding work in Germany and elsewhere , before returning to his roots laden with riches to build his fine hotel .
The journalists may have believed him but for the locals , at least the way they tell it now , there was always something fishy about Mr Barretta and his money .
But many in the valley , we are told , were also in thrall to him .
This was a man " of great intelligence " , said Gennaro Varone , the public prosecutor leading the investigation , " with the capacity to get many people to follow him , who were subsequently set to work on his estate " for poor wages .
Information gleaned from telephone bugs has also convinced investigators that he made a name locally as a religious guru , a man with the ability to " induce belief " and " to speak with the voice of God " .
Exploiting these powers , he formed a sort of prayer group , composed mostly of women from the valley , with whom he enjoyed sexual relations in return putting them up for free in his hotel .
Mr Barretta flatly denies all this .
At some point – how and when and why is not yet revealed – he made the acquaintance of the gigolo known as Helg Sgarbi .
And perhaps as many as six or seven years ago , exploiting their respective talents and proclivities , they went to work .
Investigators believe that at least three or four wealthy German women have been shaken down by Mr Sgarbi and Mr Barretta over the years , but Mrs Klatten is allegedly the only one who has been made public .
And leaks from the investigation say that Mr Barretta has made an extraordinary claim on behalf of his partner , in an attempt to extenuate their crime .
Mr Sgarbi 's original name , it appears , was Helg Russak , and while he describes himself as Italo - Swiss , his father ( according to Mr Barretta ) was a Polish Jew .
During the Second World
War this man was forced to work as a slave labourer in a BMW factory producing war materiel for the Third Reich .
This personal history created the undying hatred of BMW , Mr Barretta claimed , which led his friend to seek an extraordinary type of revenge .
Claims that BMW , like many other still - prominent German firms , used slave labour during the war are well - established .
The claims against BMW were most recently re-aired in a television documentary broadcast in Germany in October 2007 .
When Magda Quandt divorced BMW 's founder and married Goebbels , Gunther 's first son , Herbert – Mrs Klatten 's great - uncle – was brought up by Goebbels and his new wife and eventually took control of the company in 1959 .
The Goebbels connection brought the company close to the Nazis .
After the documentary was aired , a BMW spokesman said that the allegations were " not incisively new " , but previously the Quandt family have portrayed themselves as victims of the Third Reich .
DPA , the German press agency , says that " when the German Forced Labour Compensation Programme was established , the [ Quandt ] family declined to make a contribution , claiming they had no reason to do so " .
Yet knowledge of the BMW - Nazi collaboration goes back to the earliest days of the post - war era .
Karl Sommer , an SS officer who headed its Economic and Administrative Main Office from 1944 on , told US interrogators about use of slave labourers by German companies , and BMW was at the top of his list .
One source said BMW admitted using between 25,000 and 30,000 slave labourers , prisoners of war and concentration camp inmates , whose paltry earnings , it is said , went straight into the SS treasury " to fund their own annihilation " .
Only one member of the Quandt family agreed to comment on the charges made in the programme .
Sven Quandt , Mrs Klatten 's cousin , said that children were not guilty of their fathers ' actions .
Whether Mr Barretta 's extenuating claims about his colleague have any basis , or are yet more fabulous inventions by a pair who clearly have the magic touch , remains to be seen .
A controversial entrepreneur Herbert Quandt
* Herbert Quandt , right , was one of Germany 's most successful entrepreneurs whose reputation was blemished by his wartime activities .
As a child , Mr Quandt suffered from a retinal disease making him almost blind at the age of nine .
As a result he was educated from home , but he eventually flew the nest by training with the family 's companies in Germany and America .
By 1940 he was on the executive board of AFA ( now known as VARTA AG ) .
And when his father died in 1954 , Mr Quandt – together with his half brother Harald – inherited VARTA , BMW and Altana AG .
Although the family were active in the First World War – supplying the German army with uniforms among other things – scandal arose from their involvement in the Second World War when Mr Quandt and his father are alleged to have worked closely with Hitler , supplying materials such as batteries and chemicals to his forces .
Conditions for workers in Quandt factories are said to have been poor , and female slave labourers were employed – activities now under investigation at the instruction of the family after a German TV expose .
When Mr Quandt died in 1982 , he had been married three times , leaving his three children an inheritance of billions .
They received stakes in pharmaceutical firm Altana and car company BMW .

DIVIDENDS PAID BY THE COMPANIES IN THE S&P 500 INDEX could plummet 10 % in the fourth quarter -- the biggest drop in 50 years .
The chief culprits are bank failures and the depressed economy .
Standard & Poor 's said Tuesday that there had been 35 dividend cuts and omissions by financial corporations this year , for an aggregate decrease in payouts of $ 31 billion .
In comparison , there were only a dozen reduced or omitted disbursements , totaling just $ 3.1 billion , in the previous five years .
The firm now expects S&P 500 companies to pay a combined $ 28.05 in 2008 dividends , down from $ 28.85 .
Nevertheless , the lower figure represents a 1.2 % increase from 2007's $ 27.73 , notes Howard Silverblatt , S&P 's senior index analyst , and that translates into an aggregate payout of $ 244.7 billion this year .
But that 1.2 % increase would be the lowest since 2001 , when payments fell 3.3 % as the Internet bubble burst .
There are also tax implications stemming from all these dividend cuts .
" The insult to injury ... may come next January , " said Silverblatt , " when investors find out that since their company did n't make any money , [ it ] did n't pay any U.S. federal income taxes . "
Consequently , he explains , the payouts those investors received wo n't represent qualified dividend income , meaning they 'll be taxed at the rate of 35 % , instead of 15 % .
Silverblatt did find a bright side , sort of .
" Since dividend investors usually hold on to their stocks for decades , many of them will still show a gain over the decades ... if the company is still around . "
EVEN AS THE STOCK MARKET took a 500 - point dive Wednesday , Goodrich ( GR ) brightened investors ' dreary day a bit with an 11 % dividend enrichment .
Under its former moniker B.F. Goodrich , the company was one of the world 's largest tire and rubber manufacturers , but it sold that business to Michelin in 1988 .
Now a $ 7 billion global supplier of aerospace , defense and homeland - security products , Charlotte , N.C. - based Goodrich voted a new quarterly on its common of 25 cents a share , versus 22.5 cents .
This is Goodrich 's second consecutive annual boost .
Uninterrupted dividends date back to 1939 .
Disbursement will take place Jan. 2 to stockholders of record Dec. 1 .
The ex-dividend date is Nov. 26 .
Yield : 3.12 % .
Chief Executive Marshall O. Larsen commented that " this increase reflects the continued financial strength of our company and our strong positioning on the newer , more fuel - efficient aircraft around the world . "
Bucking the negative trend of third - quarter earnings reports , Goodrich posted a 32 % jump in profits , to $ 168 million , or $ 1.33 a share , from $ 127 million , or 99 cents ( including an 11 - cent divestiture loss ) , in the corresponding 2007 stretch .
That topped analysts ' consensus estimate of $ 1.13 a share , according to a survey done by Thomson Reuters .
Sales rose 11 % , to $ 1.77 billion from $ 1.6 billion ; analysts had forecast $ 1.81 billion .
Those more fuel - efficient planes have enabled Goodrich " to grow our commercial aftermarket at rates consistently faster than the overall capacity in the global airline system , " Larsen said .
He added that the company expects to be able to sustain that trend .
Goodrich also raised its full - year 2008 earnings outlook for a third time .
It now projects $ 4.90 to $ 5 a share , versus July 's prediction of $ 4.80 to $ 4.95 .
It earned $ 3.89 a share in 2007 .
However , the company lowered its sales view by $ 200 million , to $ 7.1 billion , because of the strike at Boeing ( BA ) .
Goodrich said that its current outlook assumes that the labor disruption will end in late October or early November .
From a 52 - week Big Board high of 75.74 Dec. 11 , the stock was recently quoted at 32 and change .
During the third quarter , Goodrich repurchased some two million of its common shares .
It has about $ 246 million remaining in its buyback program .

Frank Jaksch , CEO and president of ChromaDex , told FoodNavigator - USA.com that “ everyone all of a sudden is popping out of the woodwork with some sort of stevia products ” .​
Steviol glycosides - the extract of the leaves of the plant stevia rebaudiana - are a group of intense sweeteners , which include stevioside and rebaudioside A .
But he said there is confusion in the marketplace because there are a variety of different stevia compounds .
Stevia is permitted for sale in the US as a dietary supplement but it does not have FDA ( Food and Drug Administration ) GRAS status for use in food and beverages .
Merisant and Cargill have notified the FDA that rebiana ( the common name for high - purity Rebaudioside A from stevia ) should be GRAS and a response is expected shortly .
If the FDA issues a letter of no objection , it will signal that the sweetener can be used in food and drink and a “ flood ” ​ of other products is expected .
Meanwhile , ChromaDex announced last week that it has entered into an agreement with Cargill to ensure quality and consistency of stevia as it will supply global analytical reference standards and research materials for the individual sweet components of stevia .
Jaksch said : “ There has been a huge increase of demand for these standards over the past six to 12 months . ​
​
“ It has been mainly in the US but we have seen interest in other countries as well . ​
​
“ If the FDA files no objection to the pending information that has been submitted there is obviously going to be a lot of people out there trying to sell a product . ” ​
However , he questioned what sort of a products people were trying to represent when they say they have a stevia sweetener , as it may not be comparable .
Jaksch added : “ If someone is going to be representing that their material is approved because these other companies had no objection , would n’t you imagine that they probably should be similar . ​
​
“ If it ’s a mixed steviol glycosides product it needs to be represented as that and labeled appropriately . ” ​
He said that having some sort of certification would make it clearer whether a product was a mixture of stevia compounds such as rebaudioside A and B , or if it contained one compound .
Regulation changes ​
The Australian and New Zealand food standards authority recently approved steviol glycosides for use in foods , while in June 2008 the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation ’s Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives ( JECFA ) concluded that stevia extracts containing 95 percent steviol glycosides are safe for human use in the range of four milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day .
Coca -Cola recently teamed up with Cargill to use its rebiana brand Truvia and PureCircle recently signed agreements with Pepsico and Whole Earth Sweetener Company ( a subsidiary of Merisant Company ) to supply rebaudioside A under the PureVia brand .
Condoleezza
Rice built close relationships but failed to bring peace
By Wyre Davies
BBC News , Jerusalem
As Condoleezza Rice left the Middle East , probably for the last time as US secretary of state , no - one could remember exactly how many times she 'd been to the region in pursuit of an elusive Israeli - Palestinian peace deal .
Some commentators and journalists said it was her 19th trip , the United States Embassy in Tel Aviv said it was her 22nd visit .
The exact number of flights clocked up by Condi in the last couple of years , in particular since the Annapolis summit in 2007 , does n't really matter .
What does , is whether she has anything substantial to show for it , besides an awful lot of air miles .
The short answer is " No " .
A deadline , imposed by President George W Bush for a comprehensive peace deal to be reached by the end of his presidency , has proved impossible to meet .
An even more modest " framework agreement " was n't even reachable .
Ms Rice leaves the Quartet with unfinished business
For a diplomat with such undoubted intelligence and personal skills , saying goodbye and leaving empty - handed after her final meeting of the international Quartet in Sharm El Sheikh , must have been hard to take .
It would be churlish to question the secretary of state 's resolve or her personal commitment to the process .
She developed strong relationships both with the Israelis and the Palestinians and did not appear to admit failure until almost the very last moment , telling journalists on her last flight to the Middle East : " Obviously Israel is in the middle of elections and that is a constraint .
I think that whatever happens by the end of the year , you 've got a firm foundation for quickly moving forward to a conclusion . "
Despite a period of relative calm in the region , compared to the violence of previous years , there were ultimately too many obstacles - beyond the control of Secretary Rice or other interlocutors in the Quartet - standing in the way of an agreement .
Internal Palestinian divisions , most notably the violent takeover of Gaza by Hamas , often served to weaken the authority and ability to manoeuvre of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas .
His opposite number , Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , was equally damaged and constrained by allegations of bribery and corruption that eventually forced his resignation .
It was also notable that President Bush did not really engage on a personal level in the peace process until the last year of his second four - year term in office .
He was understandably preoccupied , in foreign policy terms , by US military involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Banging heads together President Bush appeared distinctly reluctant to " bang heads together " to break the deadlock between Israelis and Palestinians .
Whereas Secretary Rice occasionally criticised both the Israelis and Palestinians for breaching the terms of the Annapolis process , some of President Bush 's critics accused him of failing to do anything about continued construction of Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank , which are illegal under international law .
Having said all that , the Annapolis process , the work of the Quartet and the efforts of Condoleezza Rice have not been entirely in vain .
Expecting concrete results within a year was widely seen from the beginning as over - ambitious .
The process will also continue with a Spring meeting in Moscow .
That 's an important next step , given the current fragility of both internal Israeli and Palestinian politics .
Tony Blair says the Mid East should be an ' urgent priority '
As they briefed Secretary Rice for the last time in Sharm el - Sheikh , Palestinian and Israeli representatives reaffirmed their commitment to continue negotiations .
Israel 's Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni said her country still supports the goal of existing alongside a sovereign Palestinian State .
Both sides say they want a comprehensive agreement , not something that is merely temporary and cosmetic , but Ms Livni went on to paint a remarkably positive picture .
" More than 10 teams are working on all the subjects required to solve the conflict , " said the woman who is still hopeful of becoming Israel 's next prime minister .
" We have agreed on the structure of the agreement , paragraphs are already drafted and we 're working on maps . "
Palestinian leaders do n't recognise or admit to such detailed developments .
They accuse Israel of undermining any progress made so far by continuing to build its illegal settlements and restrict the movement of Palestinians in the West Bank .
The " big " issues like the future status of Jerusalem , the exact definition of the border between the two states and whether Palestinian refugees will be allowed the right of return are also still nowhere near being resolved .
There are still many things that could delay and even destroy the fragile process as it heads into a New Year : Will the Gaza ceasefire hold ?
Can the rival Palestinian factions even agree to talk to each other ?
If Likud 's Binyamin Netanyahu becomes Israel 's next prime minister , will he withdraw from the idea of a two - state solution altogether ?
What happens to Mahmoud Abbas when his term as President of the Palestinian Authority ends in January ?
Expectations are high in the Mid East that Barack Obama will ' make peace '
Perhaps the most intriguing question of all is what will the next US president do ?
America is still the most important player in the Middle East and on a visit here , before his election victory , Barack Obama promised to get involved from " the start " .
If he does , notwithstanding America 's other pressing concerns overseas , that will be in marked contrast to the approach of his predecessor .
Like every other American leader before him , Obama will be undoubtedly be " a friend to Israel " but will he be the one to " bang heads together " , to take risks in the elusive pursuit of peace ?
Tony Blair , the Quartet 's Special Envoy to the region , said it was important that the incoming Obama administration " grips this issue from day one " and makes the Middle East an " urgent priority " .
Mr Blair said that , for the new president , there is not only a great obligation but a great opportunity .
As Barack Obama and his foreign policy advisers wrestle with how to take on that obligation and opportunity , the woman who for the last year has dedicated much of her time and energy to the ultimately fruitless pursuit of peace , quietly exits the stage .
" You wo n't hear any more from me ! " , said Condi Rice , barely able to conceal her delight as the weight was lifted from her shoulders , as she said farewell to the Middle East and to the peace process .

Popacular , a site that measures popularity of websites according to the number of related tweets , has a huge counter that counts the overall number of tweets .
I do n't know how accurate this thing can be , given that it 's third party , but if it is , then we 've recently surpassed the billionth tweet mark .
This is just another sign of how big Twitter has become .
For comparison , Facebook recently announced they host 10 billion photos in their database ; however , Facebook is huge and has been around much longer than Twitter .
If anyone ever needed a clear sign that Twitter has gone mainstream - however you define it - this milestone is it .
Also , seeing that counter spin amazingly fast makes us sorry for all those times we 've made fun of Twitter 's engineers for not being able to keep the site up during a traffic rush .
Sorry , guys , we understand now .
Senator Ted Stevens ' opponent now leading by 814 votes John Byrne
Published : Thursday November 13 , 2008
Print This Email This And : Franken wants rejected absentee data as MN preps recount
The dyspeptic Republican senator convicted of taking gifts may soon be out of a job .
Mark Begich , Sen. Ted Stevens ' opponent in the Alaska Senate race , is now leading Stevens by 814 votes -- 132,196 to 131,382 -- with about 40,000 votes left to go .
Begich was behind the day after the election but has made up ground as absentee , early and questioned ballots have been added to the pile .
If re-elected , Stevens would become the first convict ever elected to the Senate .
If his election fails , Begich would succeed the 40 - year Senate veteran .
But if Stevens is elected -- and then kicked out of the Senate by his colleagues as is widely expected , which can be accomplished with a simple majority vote -- Stevens ' replacement would be filled in a special election .
" The state Division of Elections tallied about 60,000 absentee , early and questioned ballots from around the state on Wednesday , " the Alaska Daily News reported Thursday morning .
" The ballots broke heavily in the Democrat 's favor , erasing the 3,000 - vote lead the Republican Stevens held after election night Nov. 4 . "
" The state still needs to count at least 15,000 questioned ballots and an estimated 25,000 absentees , " the paper added .
" With all the absentee votes coming in , this will be one of the biggest turnouts , if not the biggest in terms of ballots cast , the state has ever seen .
That 's despite questions in the media and on blogs about why turnout appeared low on Election Day . "
In Minnesota -- where Republican Sen. Norm Coleman is now in a contested election fight with Democratic comedian Al Franken -- a recount is likely to last at least another month , according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune .
Minnesota wo n't know who won the contested U.S. Senate race until at least mid-December , but now the final arbiters for the recount have been named .
They include a cast of heavy - hitters topped by Minnesota Supreme Court Chief Justice Eric Magnuson , a former law partner of Republican Gov. Tim Pawlenty , three other high - ranking judges and Secretary of State Mark Ritchie , a DFLer , who made the selections Wednesday .
The freshly appointed state Canvassing Board will be charged with certifying vote totals Tuesday and , more important , settling differences over disputed ballots once local officials complete their recount .
The resolution of those disputed ballots may decide the winner of the closest Senate contest in the country , although a court challenge may still be in the offing .
Update : Franken seeks rejected absentee data
The Associated Press reported Thursday that Franken 's campaign is seeking access to information about voters whose absentee ballots were rejected , even if the rejected ballots would not be able to be included in the recount .
" We are not suing to have these in the count , " Franken 's lead attorney , Marc Elias , told AP .
" We are simply looking for the data so that we can identify people who were legal and lawful voters to ensure their ballots are counted . "
That data might be useful only in a future lawsuit , since it's not clear that ballots found to be improperly rejected could even be used in the recount administered by state election officials .
Elias , a Washington - based attorney who was general counsel to John Kerry 's 2004 presidential campaign , argued that the state canvassing board could rule them eligible .
Under questioning , he did n't point to a specific law that allowed for that step .
Meanwhile , Roll Call reports that Franken 's opponent Norm Coleman has dropped his bid to become the next chairman of the Senate GOP 's campaign organization .
Coleman has thrown his support behind Texas Sen. John Cornyn to lead the National Republican Senatorial Committee , the paper reports .
Correction : A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin would appoint a temporary replacement in Alaska if Sen .
Ted Stevens is kicked out of the Senate .
A special election is now required to fill Senate seats vacated during a senator 's term in Alaska .

When is an r/c helicopter not just an r/c helicopter ?
When it ’s large enough to carry passengers .
Continue reading to see more .
Video
Overview
Just a tad smaller than a real helicopter , this radio controlled model is powered by jet turbine engines and touted as the largest in the world .
Unfortunately , no other technical specifications were provided .
Government budgets for fighting wildfires have soared in recent years , reflecting a more assertive approach that critics say places too much emphasis on putting out fires that occur naturally in arid parts of the West .
“ It ’s just bombs away , ” said Timothy Ingalsbee , a former wildland firefighter who now heads Firefighters United for Safety , Ethics and Ecology .
Still , many people who fight wildfires say that some of the resources that people are concerned will be damaged by retardant could potentially be lost to fire .
Even in national parks , where some officials have called off the use of retardant to protect historic structures or wildlife from the chemicals , others have requested more retardant .
And in more developed areas , particularly in California , the loudest critics of fire policy are those who want more use of retardant , not less , fire officials say .
“ The second we do n’t , they ’re calling us : ‘ Where are you ? ’ ” said Mr. Payne , of the state fire department .
Speaking of the environmental threats of retardant , he said , “ It ’s the people whose houses are not on fire that are concerned about it . ”
In the federal lawsuit in Montana , the Forest Service is being sued by a group of current and former employees and others who are demanding that the agency conduct a comprehensive environmental study of the impact of retardant under the Endangered Species Act .
The suit cites a 2002 retardant drop on a river in central Oregon that killed 20,000 fish .
Current federal policy encourages pilots not to drop retardant within 300 feet of a body of water , but it allows for exceptions if flying conditions require it or if lives or property are in danger .
By 2011 , according to officials with the Forest Service in Montana , the most common type of retardant will have lower amounts of ammonia and will therefore be less harmful to fish and aquatic environments .
Private companies have also used other chemicals to develop gels and foams that are popular among some firefighting agencies , though retardant is used by most .
The Forest Service says that the number of cases it has found where retardant affected waterways is so small  14 out of thousands of retardant drops since 2000  that mitigation measures already in place suffice .
VATICAN CITY ( Reuters ) - The Vatican was set to go green on Wednesday with the activation of a new solar energy system to power several key buildings and a commitment to use renewable energy for 20 percent of its needs by 2020 .
Slideshow ( 9 images )
The massive roof of the Vatican ’s “ Nervi Hall , ” where popes hold general audiences and concerts are performed , has been covered with 2,400 photovoltaic panels -- but they will not be visible from below , leaving the Vatican skyline unchanged .
The new system on the 5,000 square meter roof will provide for all the year - round energy needs of the hall and several surrounding buildings , producing 300 kilowatt hours ( MWh ) of clean energy a year .
The system , devised by the German company SolarWorld , will allow the 108 - acre city - state to cut its carbon dioxide emissions by about 225,000 kilograms ( 225 tonnes ) and save the equivalent of 80 tonnes of oil each year .
The Holy See ’s newspaper said on Tuesday that the Vatican planned to install enough renewable energy sources to provide 20 percent of its needs by 2020 , broadly in line with a proposal by the European Union .
The 1971 Nervi Hall is named after the renowned architect who designed it , Pier Paolo Nervi , and is one of the most modern buildings in the Vatican , where most structures are several centuries old .
The hall can hold up to 10,000 people .
It has a sweeping , wavy roof which made the project feasible and the solar panels virtually invisible from the ground .
Church officials have said the Vatican ’s famous skyline , particularly St Peter ’s Basilica , would remain untouched .
An editorial in Tuesday ’s newspaper appealed for greater use of renewable energy .
“ The gradual exhaustion of the ozone layer and the greenhouse effect have reached critical dimensions , ” the newspaper said .
By producing its own energy the Vatican will become more autonomous from Italy , from where it currently buys all its energy .
The Vatican is surrounded by Rome .
Pope Benedict and his predecessor John Paul put the Vatican firmly on an environmentalist footing .
Benedict has made numerous appeals for the protection of the environment .
The Vatican has hosted a scientific conference to discuss the ramifications of global warming and climate change , widely blamed on human use of fossil fuels .
Environmentalists praised the pope last year after he made a speech saying the human race must listen to “ the voice of the earth ” or risk destroying the planet .

New Delhi - India 's moon mission Chandrayaan - 1 was successfully placed in lunar orbit on Saturday , officials at the Indian Space Research Organization ( ISRO ) said .
" The lunar orbit insertion placed the Chandrayaan in an elliptical orbit with its nearest point 400 to 500 kilometres away from the moon and the farthest , 7,500 kilometres , " ISRO director S Satish said from the southern city of Bangalore .
The complex positioning which depended on precision timing was carried out from the space control room in Bangalore .
" The most critical operation has been successful .
All the equipment is working perfectly , " ISRO chairman G Madhavan Nair was quoted as saying by CNN - IBN television .
The 1,380 - kilogram spacecraft , built by the ISRO , was carried into lunar orbit by a four - stage rocket with six strap - on propellants weighing 12 tons each .
The spacecraft is carrying 11 payloads , five designed by the Indian space agency ; three devised and contributed by Germany , Britain and Sweden from the European Space Agency ; two from the US space agency ; and one from the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences .
The spacecraft 's positioning into lunar orbit came after an 18 - day journey .
The manoeuvre was described as crucial and critical by scientists , who pointed out that at least
30 per cent of similar moon missions had failed at this juncture , resulting in space crafts lost in outer space .
" Our heartbeats stood still in the last 20 minutes , " Nair said .
The Chandrayaan - 1 , described as the cheapest moon mission ever , was launched from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre near the southern Chennai city on October 22 .
By November 15 , the spacecraft is expected to be orbiting the moon at a distance of 100 kilometres and sending back data and images .
The Chandrayaan is also scheduled to send a probe to the moon 's surface .
The moon mission 's tasks include high - resolution sensing of the moon , preparing a three - dimensional atlas of its near and far sides , chemical and mineralogical mapping as well as searching for the presence of water in its polar regions .
The project cost is estimated at 3.9 billion rupees ( about 80 million dollars ) , about a fifth of similar missions by other countries .
The success of Chandrayaan - 1 has catapulted India into the club of space - faring countries , which includes the United States , Russia , Europe , China and Japan .
There has been renewed interest in the moon recently with several of the space powers planning missions to study its resources and use it as a base for space exploration .
China and Japan launched moon missions in 2007 while NASA 's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter is due for an April 2009 launch . ( dpa )

8 Diddy's Obama Blog Continue Reading Below Advertisement
In this thoughtful piece , motherfuckin ' Diddy shares his motherfuckin ' thoughts on Sarah fuckin ' Palin .
A rapper as a campaign supporter is a dicey proposition , but on the short list of rappers who would seem to make for a decent endorsement , Diddy is right near the top .
He 's got a ton of cash , he 's fairly well respected as a businessman , and he tends to let other rappers do his shooting for him .
Unfortunately , he also has a video blog .
The premise of the video is simple : " John McCain is fuckin ' up ! "
That 's not a summary , that 's a direct quote .
It seems Diddy is unimpressed with McCain 's decision to select Sarah Palin as his running mate .
In presenting his argument against Sarah Palin , he makes the obvious " lack of experience " point that everyone else does .
But then , he brings some new arguments into the fray .
Among his politically savvy speaking points : Continue Reading Below Advertisement " Alaska motherfucker ? "
" I do n't know if there 's any black people in Alaska . "
" You would let her keep your kids ? "
" There 's not even no crackheads in Alaska ! "
Diddy has a point , Article Two of the United States Constitution clearly states that to be president you must be a natural born citizen , at least 35 years old and have been a permanent resident in a crack infested area of the United States for at least fourteen years .
Until this is amended to include meth , Sarah Palin just does n't qualify .
It 's also important to note that Diddy makes all of these arguments while inexplicably spinning around in circles the whole time .
There may not be crackheads in Alaska , but if this video is any indication , there may be one on the loose in the Hamptons .

Crude oil prices will rally in the near - term , but then investors will see another sharp selloff that will take crude back down to seven - year lows , according to one technical analyst .
Looking at the chart for light , sweet crude , prices will rise to $ 76 to $ 80 in the next two months , Dick Otto from Matrix Asset Management said Friday .
But then another slide is expected .
" What we seen when we look at the move down from $ 130 to $ 50 is an impulsive wave , " Otto said .
After the near - term rise , the next wave will also be " impulsive , " with prices touching the 2001 bottoms of about $ 20 .
Once prices reach those levels , " we have completed the correction down and then we will find , in the next four to five years after that , an up market , " he said .
Looking at the Dow Jones Industrial Average , volatility will go down through the end of the year , but the trend will be down again starting in 2009 , Otto added .

In case you have n’t heard about it , Titanfall : Assault is the newest real - time strategy game you need on your mobile device .
It was announced for the first time a couple of months ago , and now we can finally enjoy it .
The game was released by the developers at Particle City and Respaw and you can play it on your Android and iOS devices .
Among the changes you will notice in the game is the fact that it brought some top - down RTS mechanics instead of the first combat found in the mainline series .
Even so , it comes up with some elements that you would n’t expect from the game .
No worries , you will still have to call down Titans , control the Pilots and use Burn Cards to boost you .
According to Respawn , their purpose was to make you feel it ’s a Titanfall game , despite adopting a new format .
More Welcomed Changes
In some other parts of the game , the Titanfall hardcore fans will see a change in the Hardpoint mode .
The first player who reaches 100 points by destroying the other player ’s base or by having Hardpoints will win .
Moreover , in a way similar to the original series , the maps will have various ways of interacting with the environment .
You will see ziplines for the Pilots , as well as some destructible areas that can open new pathways for the Titans .
It ’s not the first Titanfall mobile project , but for the moment it ’s the only one to get fully released .
Not many people have heard about the Titanfall : Frontline project .
It was another strategy card developed by the Particle City , but they canceled it in the beginning of this year .
All in all , if you want to play the game , head off to the Apple App Store or , if you are using Android , to the Google Play Store
The Ted Stevens / Mark Begich Senate race in Alaska was a toss - up before the jury came back with the verdict of guilty on all seven felony counts for failure to disclose gifts and services totaling more than $ 250,000 .
And , despite the amped up , frenzied Stevens supporters who crowded into an airplane hangar for Stevens ’ Welcome Home rally last night , the scale has started to tip decidedly for Democratic challenger Mark Begich .
It ’s a toss - up no more .
It is n’t over yet , but Uncle Ted ’s chances are looking pretty slim .
Rasmussen released the following numbers , taken the day after Stevens ’ conviction .
Begich ( D ) – 52 %
Stevens ( R ) – 44 %
Bird ( AIP ) – 3 %
Undecided – 2 %
Only 74 % of Republicans say they will vote for the nominee of their party while 21 % of GOP voters will cast their ballot for Begich , the mayor of Anchorage .
Fifty - two percent ( 52 % ) of Alaska voters say Stevens should resign while 39 % disagree .
Republican leaders including John McCain , his running mate Sarah Palin , the current governor of Alaska , and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell have all called upon Stevens to step down .
Stevens is now viewed favorably by 43 % of Alaska voters , down from 54 % before the trial began .
Still , even after the guilty verdict , 52 % of voters say Stevens is about as ethical as most politicians .
Fifteen percent ( 15 % ) say Stevens is more ethical than most of his peers while 31 % say he is less ethical .
These reactions say as much about perceptions of politicians as they do about Stevens .
This must explain why 51 % of Alaska voters say that Sarah Palin is more ethical than most politicians .
Palin earns good or excellent reviews as governor from 61 % of voters in her home state , virtually unchanged from polling last month .
Eighty - five percent ( 85 % ) of Republicans and 59 % of unaffiliated voters give Palin positive marks .
Overall , just 22 % rate her job performance as poor , a figure that includes 44 % of Democrats .
If this makes you want to bang your head on the desk …. stop .
Remember that Sarah Palin ’s approval rating was hovering around 90 % at one point .
So , step back , and think of how it would look on a graph .
Time on the X - axis , and favorability ratings on the Y - axis .
After the third time I banged my head on the desk , a vision of this graph popped in to my mind , and I stopped .
Once the fun of having a local politician on the national stage is over , and she gets back home , the numbers will continue to slide .
Stay tuned .

Once again , Sarah Palin showed her fragile grasp of the Constitution when she claimed that media attacks on her violate her First Amendment right to attack Barack Obama .
The problem is that the First Amendment deals with Congress passing laws regulating speech , not the media .
According to ABC News , Palin asserted to WMAL - AM in Washington D.C. that the media is protecting Obama , “ If [ the media ] convince enough voters that that is negative campaigning , for me to call Barack Obama out on his associations , then I do n’t know what the future of our country would be in terms of First Amendment rights and our ability to ask questions without fear of attacks by the mainstream media . ”
Palin kept up her attack on what she called the mainstream media and elites , “ It ’s sort of perplexing to me , because I ’m a practical person and plainspoken also , but just cutting to the chase and calling things like I see them , just like most Americans .
But this has not left a bitter taste in my mouth , the bitter shots taken by the mainstream media and by some of the elitism there in Washington . ”
Let ’s start with the obvious , the media has nothing to do with supression of speech in the First Amendment .

Here is the First Amendment , “ Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances . ”
Someone really needs to sit Sarah down and explain to her that the First Amendment is about government suppression of speech , not media commentary .
Palin has no idea what is in the Constitution , yet she wants to run for president in 2012 .
She should not even be running for vice president .
Anybody who does n’t know what the vice president does , ca n’t name any Supreme Court cases , and then gets the First Amendment wrong , does not belong in national politics .
Heck , she probably is n’t qualified to be governor of Alaska .
Look long and hard Republicans , and remember when this buffoon was supposed to be your savior .
For several decades , scientists have thought that the Solar System formed as a result of a shock wave from an exploding star — a supernova — that triggered the collapse of a dense , dusty gas cloud that contracted to form the Sun and the planets .
But detailed models of this formation process have only worked under the simplifying assumption that the temperatures during the violent events remained constant .
Now , astrophysicists at the Carnegie Institution 's Department of Terrestrial Magnetism ( DTM ) have shown for the first time that a supernova could indeed have triggered the Solar System 's formation under the more likely conditions of rapid heating and cooling .
The results , published in the October 20 , 2008 , issue of the Astrophysical Journal , have resolved this long - standing debate .
" We 've had chemical evidence from meteorites that points to a supernova triggering our Solar System 's formation since the 1970s , " remarked lead author , Carnegie 's Alan Boss .
" But the devil has been in the details .
Until this study , scientists have not been able to work out a self - consistent scenario , where collapse is triggered at the same time that newly created isotopes from the supernova are injected into the collapsing cloud . "
Short - lived radioactive isotopes — versions of elements with the same number of protons , but a different number of neutrons — found in very old meteorites decay on time scales of millions of years and turn into different ( so - called daughter ) elements .
Finding the daughter elements in primitive meteorites implies that the parent short - lived radioisotopes must have been created only a million or so years before the meteorites themselves were formed .
" One of these parent isotopes , iron - 60 , can be made in significant amounts only in the potent nuclear furnaces of massive or evolved stars , " explained Boss .
" Iron - 60 decays into nickel - 60 , and nickel - 60 has been found in primitive meteorites .
So we 've known where and when the parent isotope was made , but not how it got here . "
Previous models by Boss and former DTM Fellow Prudence Foster showed that the isotopes could be deposited into a pre-solar cloud if a shock wave from a supernova explosion slowed to 6 to 25 miles per second and the wave and cloud had a constant temperature of - 440 °F ( 10 K ) .
" Those models did n't work if the material was heated by compression and cooled by radiation , and this conundrum has left serious doubts in the community about whether a supernova shock started these events over four billion years ago or not , " remarked Harri Vanhala , who found the negative result in his Ph.D. thesis work at the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in 1997 .
Using an adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamics code , FLASH2.5 , designed to handle shock fronts , as well as an improved cooling law , the Carnegie researchers considered several different situations .
In all of the models , the shock front struck a pre-solar cloud with the mass of our Sun , consisting of dust , water , carbon monoxide , and molecular hydrogen , reaching temperatures as high as 1,340 °F ( 1000 K ) .
In the absence of cooling , the cloud could not collapse .
However , with the new cooling law , they found that after 100,000 years the pre-solar cloud was 1,000 times denser than before , and that heat from the shock front was rapidly lost , resulting in only a thin layer with temperatures close to 1,340 °F ( 1000 K ) .
After 160,000 years , the cloud center had collapsed to become a million times denser , forming the protosun .
The researchers found that isotopes from the shock front were mixed into the protosun in a manner consistent with their origin in a supernova .
" This is the first time a detailed model for a supernova triggering the formation of our solar system has been shown to work , '' said Boss .
" We started with a Little Bang 9 billion years after the Big Bang . "

In long days scheduled in 15 - minute increments , presidents are asked to make decisions affecting millions -- sometimes life - or - death decisions .
" When you get to the Oval Office , there are no easy decisions , " says Kenneth Duberstein , who was chief of staff to President Ronald Reagan .
" Any decision that reaches the president 's desk is a close call .
It 's not black and white .
It 's shades of gray . "
Presidents work best when they take regular respites from the burdens of the presidency , according to Duberstein and other White House insiders from the Nixon presidency through the current administration .
" The time off at the ranch or at Camp David was more than an escape , " Duberstein says .
" It was good for his physical and mental well - being . "
" The daily routine of a president is really grueling , " says Ron Nessen , press secretary to President Gerald Ford .
" It 's hard to get thinking time .
Ford talked about how when he was swimming laps , it gave him time to think about things . "

Anecdotal evidence from the previous seven administrations jibes with research into decision making .
Keith Sawyer , a professor of psychology , education and business at Washington University in St. Louis , Missouri , says good ideas come from a combination of hard work and down time .

" Creativity researchers have discovered that there is a cycle .
It is very difficult to have a good idea when you 're working all out .
It typically happens when you take time away , " says Sawyer , author of " Group Genius : The Creative Power of Collaboration . "
" The unconscious mind is really good at bouncing different ideas together , " he says .
" That 's where creative insight comes from .
When you 're working hard , you 're basically blocking the unconscious mind from doing that work . "
No wonder then , that the most recent presidents have turned to sports as a diversion from what 's been called the toughest job in the world .
Presidents have enjoyed mountain biking ( George W. Bush ) , golf ( Bill Clinton , Ford , Dwight D. Eisenhower ) , tennis ( Ford , Jimmy Carter , George H.W. Bush ) , jogging ( Clinton , Carter and both Bushes ) , swimming ( Ford ) , bowling ( Richard Nixon ) , horseshoes ( George H.W. Bush ) and horseback riding ( Reagan ) .
" Exercise was a huge part of his life , " says Jody Powell , Carter 's press secretary .
" He enjoyed tennis very much .
He ran just about every day . "
To blow off steam , Clinton would go to the putting green outside the White House .
" Everyone knew to leave him alone , " says Clinton press secretary Joe Lockhart .
" It had to be a national security crisis to go out and interrupt him . "
Even presidents who were not particularly athletic made a point of taking a break .
Coming this weekend : Fit to Lead »
President Nixon had an office with a comfortable sofa in the Old Executive Office Building ( now the Eisenhower Executive Office Building ) , next door to the White House , says John Dean , former White House counsel .
" He would go over there and stretch out and get a couple hours reading or taking a nap if he was inclined , and that was built into the schedule , " Dean says .
Early in his administration , Clinton worked too hard and his decision making suffered as a result , according to Lockhart .
" The first term , particularly the first couple of years , the president kind of set his own schedule and he worked from very early in the morning until very late at night .
And he wore himself out , and I would argue , his decision - making ability was not nearly as good as it was in his second term , " Lockhart says .
When Ford came down with the flu , he was forced to take four days in the residence .
" His workload was cut way back so he had more time to think , and he came back and decided to make some major , major changes to his staff , " Nessen says .
An avid runner , mountain biker and fisherman , " President Bush is good at finding ways to separate [ from the job ] , " says Ari Fleischer , his former press secretary .
" But even so , you never have an uninterrupted day as president .
Every day , you have a National Security Council meeting .
Every day you get interrupted by an intelligence briefing . "
No matter how the president chooses to unwind , the enormous burdens of the job are never far away .
" Even in moments when you 're physically trying to relax in whatever outlet you have , you have a member of the military within 15 feet with nuclear codes , " Lockhart said .
" That kind of takes the fun out of whatever sport you 're into . "

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson is walking a fine line , pushing the need to help troubled mortgage borrowers without rewarding past risky behavior .
" I have no interest in bailing out lenders or property speculators .
Still , we must recognize the very real harms to families affected by the housing downturn , " Paulson said in prepared remarks for a speech given Tuesday at Georgetown University .
" We must take steps to minimize the neighborhood effects and the macroeconomic effects of this housing market correction , " he continued .
Paulson pointed out that President Bush charged him , along with HUD Secretary Alphonso Jackson , to work closely with market participants to " modify " at - risk mortgages .
Paulson noted that as many as 50 percent of failing borrowers never contact their lenders to address their problems .
Paulson said the industry must increase its outreach efforts .
Last week , Paulson announced the creation of a new alliance of mortgage servicers , counselors and investors called " Hope Now " that was designed to get to more troubled borrowers and find solutions to their mortgage problems .
Tuesday , he called for more flexibility in loan modifications and refinancing .
" For many families , this is the only viable solution , " Paulson said .
But he pointed out that many servicers are not well staffed to provide " mitigation " services even though preventing foreclosures is in the best interest of investors in mortgage - backed securities .
Loan servicers , who handle billing and payments after a loan has been made , must put more trained credit counselors in place to deal with the increases in volume of borrowers in need of help .
Paulson also called upon Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to work closely with private lenders to make affordable mortgage products more available and to increase funds so those in risky adjustable mortgages can refinance .
Starting in April 2007 , Freddie Mac began to dedicate billions to buying refinanced mortgages designed to help troubled borrowers stay in their homes .
Paulson would expand on initiatives like this .
Offering affordable mortgage products , through such agencies as the Federal Housing Administration ( FHA ) , is part of Paulson 's prescription .
In August , President Bush announced a plan to make these loans available to more Americans .
FHA loans carry competitive interest rates , require little in the way of down payments and are popular with lenders because they are backed by the Federal Government .
They are aimed at increasing home - buying opportunities for low - and moderate - income Americans .
Changes in laws and regulations on mortgage borrowing was also addressed by the Treasury head .
He pointed out that the patchwork of rules governing state and federal institutions make regulation more difficult .
Looking forward , Paulson stressed the need for more transparency in mortgage lending .
" We need simple , clear , and understandable mortgage disclosure , " he said .
He pointed out the complexity of paperwork at closing , many of which are designed to shield lenders from liability rather than provide borrowers with useful information .
Paulson advocated for a single - page summary of the most critical facts that borrowers need to know , including actual interest rates and schedules of payments .
To accomplish this , the Treasury Department is reviewing the Truth In Lending Act .
To improve integrity among mortgage originators , Paulson wants to establish nationwide licensing , education and monitoring systems for mortgage broker and loan officers .
That should also help combat predatory lending and Paulson wants regulators to assert more authority in defining and prohibiting unfair and deceptive practices .
The rules would apply to the entire mortgage industry .
Paulson did not allow borrowers to escape without their share of blame .
" Buying a home today is a complex process , but that in no way excuses home buyers from their obligation for due diligence . "
Although the speech seemed to mark a step up in activism on the part of the Treasury Department , Paulson was quick to point out the limitations of the government 's approach during the question and answer following the talk .
Referring to HopeNow , he said , " This is a 100 percent market - based solution .
I believe in markets .
The government is doing nothing here but facilitating people coming together . "
Paulson also downplayed the possibility that the housing crisis could plunge the nation into recession .
" I 've seen turbulence in the market a number of times and I can't think of any situation where the backdrop of the global economy was as healthy as it is today , " he said .
The Indian navy today defended its sinking of a ship in the Gulf of Aden despite official confirmation that it was not a pirate vessel but a hijacked Thai fishing boat .
The International Maritime Bureau said that what the Indian navy described as a pirate " mothership " was the Ekawat Nava 5 , which had been seized by pirates off Yemen on November 18 .
Its crew were kidnapped at gunpoint and tied up .
India 's navy said last week that the Tabar , on patrol in the Gulf of Aden , had blown up one vessel and chased off two smaller pirate speedboats .
It was the first major offensive by a country protecting shipping lanes across 2.6 m sq km of ocean .
Apparent inconsistencies in the story emerged when Bangkok - based Sirichai Fisheries , which owned the trawler , told maritime officials there had been a mistake .
Wicharn Sirichaiekawat , the owner of the ship , said the Ekawat Nava 5 had left Oman for Yemen to deliver fishing equipment and had been taken by Somali pirates .
" The sunken ship , which the Indian navy claimed was a mothership of pirates , was not the mothership at all , " he said .
The only surviving sailor in the crew of 15 , a Cambodian who spent six days adrift , is recovering in a hospital in Yemen .
There is no word on any of the other crew .
The Indian navy said the ship was a pirate vessel in " description and intent " and had opened fire first .
A navy spokesman , Commander Nirad Sinha , said the Tabar had taken action only because pirates on board the ship threatened to attack .
" We fired only after we had been threatened and then fired upon , " he said .
" This is self - defence .
Our ship was attacked by rocket - propelled grenades . "
Naval sources said the Indian frigate hit the Ekawat Nava 5 several times and set off explosions .
" A fire broke out , probably due to the exploding ammunition , " an officer from the Tabar said .
Two speedboats were spotted breaking off to escape .
If it was just another fishing ship why would it have men with rockets on board ? "
Other sources said the Tabar had successfully escorted around 35 ships .
Somalia 's lawless shoreline has made it a haven for pirates , who have been roaming further and further out to sea and attacking bigger ships .
There have been 96 pirate attacks this year in Somali waters , resulting in 39 ships being hijacked .
More than a dozen ships with almost 300 crew are still in the hands of pirates , who are demanding millions of dollars in ransom .
Experts said the Indian navy 's increasingly muscular approach to the problem could not be criticised .
A third of India 's 900 cargo ships are considered at risk from piracy .
" The route through the Gulf of Aden is a link to the Suez Canal ; it is a vital link especially for India 's energy needs .
So they are trying to do something to protect their own interests and shipping , " said Nimal Perera of Aitken Spence , a shipping agency in Colombo .
Perera said the root of the problem – the pirate bases in Somalia – had to be dealt with .

This comes from a Catholic church in South Carolina , where the Priest posted the following newsletter :
In response to this , I am obliged by my duty as your shepherd to make two observations :
Between these two visions of the use of lethal violence against the unborn there can be no negotiation or conciliation , and now our nation has chosen for its chief executive the most radical pro-abortion politician ever to serve in the United States Senate or to run for president .
We must also take note of the fact that this election was effectively decided by the votes of self - described ( but not practicing )
Catholics , the majority of whom cast their ballots for President - elect Obama .
1. Voting for a pro-abortion politician when a plausible pro-life alternative exits constitutes material cooperation with intrinsic evil , and those Catholics who do so place themselves outside of the full communion of Christ ’s Church and under the judgment of divine law .
Persons in this condition should not receive Holy Communion until and unless they are reconciled to God in the Sacrament of Penance , lest they eat and drink their own condemnation .
2. Barack Obama , although we must always and everywhere disagree with him over abortion , has been duly elected the next President of the United States , and after he takes the Oath of Office next January 20th , he will hold legitimate authority in this nation .
For this reason , we are obliged by Scriptural precept to pray for him and to cooperate with him whenever conscience does not bind us otherwise .
Let us hope and pray that the responsibilities of the presidency and the grace of God will awaken in the conscience of this extraordinarily gifted man an awareness that the unholy slaughter of children in this nation is the greatest threat to the peace and security of the United States and constitutes a clear and present danger to the common good .

“ The Wrestler ” has won the top award – Golden Lion – at the
Rourke , who received a rare standing ovation at a press conference , is generating early Oscar chatter .
He told in an interview that “ The Wrestler ” was “ the best … movie I ’ve ever made . ”
NO ‘ PUNISHMENT ’ WHATSOEVER ….
Following up on the last item , at first blush , it seems Senate Democrats chose a minor and inconsequential punishment for Joe Lieberman , instead of a credible and reasonable one .
But a closer look suggests Lieberman literally was n’t “ punished ” at all .
Going into today , Lieberman chaired the Homeland Security Committee , and chaired subcommittees on the Environment and Public Works Committee and Armed Services Committee .
Democrats decided to strip Lieberman of his EPW subcommittee chairmanship .
Sounds like a slap on the wrist , right ?
As it happens , it was n’t even that — Lieberman told reporters this afternoon that the caucus changed the rules this morning so that no member can be chair a committee and two subcommittees at the same time .
Lieberman keeps the two gavels he wanted , and loses the one he did n’t .
A few months ago , it seemed Lieberman ’s role in the caucus was in jeopardy .
After Lieberman dictated what he wanted , Senate Democrats decided not to “ punish ” him for his betrayals in any way .
I ’m trying to get additional information about which Dems voted which way , but for now , the AP reports that Sens. Leahy ( Vt. ) , Sanders ( Vt. ) , and Merkeley ( Ore. ) spoke up against Lieberman during the closed - door meeting .
Sens. Reid ( Nev. ) , Durbin ( Ill. ) , and Kerry ( Mass . ) were among Lieberman ’s vocal supporters .
Kevin hit the note that ’s been bugging me .
I guess they really showed him , did n’t they ?
No Democrat will ever dare to support a Republican candidate for president , speak at the Republican national convention in prime time , and bad mouth the Democratic Party ’s candidate ever again .
If we put everything else aside , the precedent here really is startling .
As I reported last week , in 1964 , Rep. John Bell Williams ( D ) of Mississippi and Rep. Albert Watson ( D ) of South Carolina both endorsed Barry Goldwater ’s presidential campaign , and both were punished by losing their seniority .
Four years later , Rep. John Rarick ( D ) of Louisiana endorsed George Wallace ’s presidential campaign , and the party stripped him of his committee seniority , too .
Now , Lieberman endorsed McCain , spoke at the GOP convention , helped down - ballot Republicans , and smeared the Democratic nominee at every available opportunity , and the caucus decided to let him off the hook entirely .
But the native Egyptian , assisted by a translator , testified today that he and his family are not living a lavish life , and their home is a cramped apartment where his 4 - year - old daughter has to sleep on the couch .
We can bring a change to this country , and , with your help , we will .
You do n't have to be a political expert or have lots of time to have an impact .
You just need to believe in the importance of women 's issues and commit to bringing them to the forefront of our national debate .

I understand the camaraderie of the world 's greatest deliberative body and Stevens ' 40 + years of service , but its pretty surreal to watch the Senate give a standing ovation to someone who was just found guilty by a jury of his peers on a whopping seven felony counts .
I gotta admit : Stevens went out gracefully and his embrace of Senator Byrd is some compelling stuff .
That said , good riddance and congratulations to Senator - elect Mark Begich .

Male pattern baldness affects around 40 % of men Genes that may increase by seven - fold the risk of early baldness amongst men have been uncovered by a team of international researchers .
Analysis of DNA from 5,000 volunteers with and without male - pattern baldness found two stretches of the genome linked with the condition .
One in seven men have both genetic variants , Nature Genetics reported .
Being able to predict hair loss early could boost development of preventive treatments , the researchers said .
An initial study in more than 500 men with early onset hair loss and 500 men without the condition highlighted the two genetic regions which substantially increased the risk of baldness .
Male pattern baldness had a strong inherited aspect and understanding that may well lead to better treatments and novel approaches
Professor Val Randall , University of Bradford
One was the androgen receptor gene and has already been linked to male - pattern baldness .
The other region is on chromosome 20 and is nowhere near any known gene .
Male pattern baldness , or androgenic alopecia , was already k nown to be hereditary and partly caused by male sex hormones .
More work is needed to work out how this influences risk of baldness , the researchers said .
Their findings were confirmed by the researchers in other groups of people with androgenic alopecia - including women in which they found a weaker association - in the UK , Iceland and the Netherlands .
Inheritance A second study also published in Nature Genetics found a similar link between hair loss and chromosome 20 .
The German researchers said the androgen gene which until now had been the only gene identified with baldness was on the X chromosome which is inherited from the mother .
But chromosome 20 is inherited from both mother and father and may provide an explanation for similarities in hair loss between father and sons , they said .
Dr Tim Spector , from Kings College London , said they found around 14 % of men carry both genetic variants .
" At the moment we have a fairly good diagnostic tool for people who might want to know whether they will lose their hair before they are 50 .
" There probably wo n't be many people who want to use that at the moment because there are n't any preventive treatments . "
He added he hoped it would stimulate pharmaceutical companies to develop creams , gels or pills to prevent hair loss before it starts .
" The other thing is understanding how these genes actually work - it 's likely to provide use with new targets for gene therapy which is actually quite easy to deliver to the hair follicle . "
Professor Val Randall , from the Centre for Skin Sciences at the University of Bradford said the work was very exciting , although it was debatable whether men would benefit from finding out about their hair loss risk .
However she added : " It is always easier to prevent than replace hair growth .
" Male pattern baldness has a strong inherited aspect and understanding that may well lead to better treatments and novel approaches . "

What are these ?
We have all been conned .
Even the name suggests industry : the worker bumblebee is , we thought , the epitome of effort as it buzzes around , foraging for food .
But now research has revealed that , far from striving tirelessly for the good of the colony , bees are as prone to slacking as the rest of us when they can get away with it .
Scientists at Queen Mary , University of London , discovered that some bumblebees have a tendency to ignore promptings to go out to get food , choosing to rest instead if there is even a tiny amount of food in their store .
Dr Nigel Raine and his colleague Dr Mathieu Molet studied how bees make sure they have enough food for their needs .
They found that the insects use a sophisticated system to decide whether they need to go out to work or whether they can afford to take it easy .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Bumblebees returning with a large amount of food give off a chemical signal , a pheromone , designed to excite the others and persuade them to rush out to take advantage of good food supplies .
But the message is not always heeded .
" The bees are doing really quite complicated things : assessing how much food they have , looking in the larder to see whether they have got to go out get more , " Dr Raine said .
" It 's like ' Oh no , I 've got to go to Sainsbury 's ' . "
He added : " If they go out and do n't find stuff quickly , they just return to the nest and say : ' Things are n't looking so good today . '
The ones who are less successful will wait for another forager to come back and give them more information about where to look .
" If there is n't stuff to collect , a lot of them are pretty much on standby .
They will be sitting around doing very little , or apparently so . "
The researchers , who have published a paper outlining their research in the journal Behavioural Ecology and Sociobiology , studied colonies in a laboratory using tiny electronic RFID tags – used on clothes to prevent shoplifting – which were fitted to the bumblebees to record when they left the nest to look for food .
Several colonies were then stocked with different levels of food .
Artificial pheromones , mimicking the bees ' chemical communication system , were used to stimulate the inhabitants , and more than 16,000 foraging trips were monitored .
They found the bees often displayed a relaxed attitude towards food when supplies were plentiful , and only when the number of full honeypots fell below 5 per cent did the insects start living up to their reputation for being " busy " , with an 80 per cent rise in foraging .
Dr Raine said it was not that bumblebees are lazy , but that a reasonably relaxed strategy had evolved as the best way to gather food while conserving energy .
" They are busy when there is work to be done , " he said .
The scientists stressed that this is not just esoteric insect research : understanding what motivates the bees could be used to increase their effectiveness as pollinators of commercial crops , such as tomatoes .
Name Members To Committee To Seek Prosecution of Bush For War Crimes

Oct. 14 , 2008 – Massachusetts law school Dean Lawrence Velvel will chair a Steering Committee to pursue the prosecution for war crimes of President Bush and culpable high - ranking aides after they leave office Jan. 20th .
The Steering Committee was organized following a conference of leading legal authorities and scholars from the U.S. and abroad convened by Velvel on Sept. 13 - 14 in Andover , Mass. , titled “ The Justice Robert Jackson Conference On Planning For The Prosecution of High Level American War Criminals . ”
“ If Bush , Vice President Dick Cheney , and others are not prosecuted , ” Velvel said , “ the future could be threatened by additional examples of Executive lawlessness by leaders who need fear no personal consequences for their actions , including more illegal wars such as Iraq .
” Besides Velvel , members of the Steering Committee include :
Ben Davis , a law Professor at the University of Toledo College of Law , where he teaches Public International Law and International Business Transactions .
He is the author of numerous articles on international and related domestic law .
Marjorie Cohn , a law Professor at Thomas Jefferson School of Law in San Diego , Calif. , and President of the National Lawyers Guild .

I just had an alert drop in my mailbox from MTV .
Apparently MTV
Networks , owners of Harmonix , and Apple Corps Ltd , administrators of The Beatles releases of the 1960s , are holding a press conference tomorrow to make some announcement about an " exclusive agreement to develop a global music project . "
The release lists a number of media contacts , including one of the main PR folks for Rock Band 2 .
This seems to back up what the Financial Times reported back in June .
Though at the time it sounded like both Activision and Harmonix were wooing Apple Corps .
Did Guitar
Hero get the shaft or is another announcement , this one with Activision , hitting later this week ?
We 'll update once we can needle out more official word .
Apple Corps Ltd. and MTV to Announce Exclusive Agreement to Develop Unprecedented Global Music Project WHAT : Apple Corps Ltd. and MTV to announce an exclusive agreement to develop a global music project .
WHO : Jeff Jones , CEO of Apple Corps , Ltd. Judy McGrath , Chairman and CEO of MTV Networks Van Toffler , President of MTV Networks Music / Logo Group WHEN : Thursday , October 30 , 2008 2:00 pm UK Time , 10:00 am ET , 7:00 AM PT About Apple Corps .
Ltd. Apple Corps Ltd. was founded by The Beatles in 1968 to look after the group 's own affairs .
The London - based company has administered the catalogue of The Beatles releases of the 1960s that have sold to date more than 600 million records , tapes and CDs .
Since the 1990s Apple has piloted new Beatles projects that have become benchmarks for pioneering accomplishment and which have included The Beatles Anthology projects , the 28 million - selling album The Beatles 1 and the The Beatles LOVE show and CD .

WAUSAU , Wis. —
A homeless man who called police from a Wausau laundry was hospitalized after his preliminary blood alcohol level registered at 0.56 , or seven times the legal limit for drivers .
Police Lt. Mark Pankow said it is rare for someone to have that high a level and survive .
The 53 - year - old man had called 911 at 12:45 a.m. Tuesday and said he did n’t feel well and had a history of heart trouble .
He was taken to Aspirus Wausau Hospital and then to North Central Health Care for treatment .
Pankow said the man has been homeless for eight months and has arrest warrants from outside the Wausau area .
Bruce E. Ivins , the anthrax researcher who supposedly committed suicide , and who the government is now trying to blame for the anthrax attacks , was involuntarily committed to 2 psychiatric hospitals shortly before his death .
Specifically , a month before his death , he was involuntarily committed to the Frederick Memorial Hospital and then transferred to Sheppard Pratt , another psychiatric facility .
Was Ivins crazy ?
Maybe .
Or maybe he was sent to a psych facility for the same reasons that the Soviet Union committed dissidents to psych hospitals .
Maybe Ivins could n't stand it anymore , and was about to blow the whistle on the real anthrax killers , so they ginned up some claims that he was dangerous and had him hospitalized .
IBM , EMC , Microsoft and others have been blasted by the father of Representational State Transfer ( REST ) for making " misleading " and " idiotic " claims about a proposed specification for applications to talk to different vendors ' content management systems ( CMS ) .
Picking on last month 's over - hyped Content Management Interoperability Services ( CMIS ) Specification announcement , Roy Fielding has said he 's getting tired of big companies making " idiotic claims about REST and their so - called RESTful architectures " .
Fielding appears to feel CMIS has been mischaracterized as a RESTful protocol while it's been tailored to accessing data repositories of legacy document management systems - not the hallmark of REST .
" The only similarity between CMIS and REST is that they both have four - letter acronyms , " Fielding said .
Fielding also slammed overzealous IBM and EMC marketing drones for deliberately misleading people by calling CMIS a standard when it 's still a work in progress .
CMIS was only last month submitted to OASIS for ratification as a standard .
Members of the fourth estate also got it in the neck for reporting on CMIS without being able to tell the difference between a standard and a " standards effort " .
Fielding , an Apache Software Foundation co-founder , defined REST in his seminal 2000 University of California dissertation Architectural Styles and the Design of Network - based Software Architectures .
REST describes an architecture for a system where users pass through different pages on the web .
It relies on standards such as HTTP , URL , XML , jpeg and so on .
The crux of Fielding 's problem with CMIS from the architectural perspective seems to be that CMIS is geared to a very specific use : accessing data and folders in vendors proprietary databases while REST is considered a general web architecture using open web standards .
Following on from this , CMIS pays just lips service to REST by employing a RESTlike protocol called AtomPub , which he seems to feel has been added for " marketing reasons " along with WSDL .
Fielding called CMIS a Web Services interface that 's a " thin veneer " on RDBMS - based data repositories - little surprise given those backing the specification are database , CMS and business application vendors .
CMIS is a " classic example of what happens when a control - oriented interface is slapped onto an HTTP - based protocol instead of redesigning the interface to be data - oriented , " he said .
According to Fielding REST was a buzzword used to announced CMIS .
Fielding appears to believe CMIS has more in common with the family of Web Services specs Microsoft and IBM developed and have driven , which have been affixed with the WS * moniker .
" It [ CMIS ] should be " renamed WS - DMS and tossed on the same pile of other specs from that genre " Fielding said . ®
A security guard at the Church of Scientology ’s Celebrity Centre in Hollywood on Sunday shot and killed a man wielding two samurai swords , police said .
Police detained the guard for questioning but said that a surveillance tape at the facility backed his claim that he fired his semiautomatic handgun to protect himself and two colleagues .
“ The evidence is very clear the security officers were defending their safety , ” said Deputy Chief Terry S. Hara of the Los Angeles Police Department .
Police did not release the name of the guard or the man killed in the shooting , which occurred about noon .
An investigator said the man had a history with the church but was not a member now .
The tape showed the man arriving at the Celebrity Centre ’s Bronson Avenue parking lot in a red convertible , getting out of the vehicle and approaching a trio of security guards and waving a sword in each hand , Hara said .

He said the man , who was described as being in his 40s , was “ close enough to hurt them ” when the guard fired .
The man was taken to County - USC Medical Center , where he was pronounced dead .
Det. Wendi Berndt said the man was involved with the church “ a long time ago . ”
“ There was a previous relationship , but it is unclear to what degree , ” she said .
A teenager who saw the man arrive in the parking lot said he stopped the car abruptly in the driveway and climbed out with a 5 - foot sword in his hand and an angry expression on his face .

Tony Marquez , 17 , said the man , who was bald and had tattoos on his arms , walked toward the building , then returned to the car to get the other sword .
“ I thought it was part of a show , ” said Marquez , of Ontario .
He and his mother entered the building before the shooting began .
Police said the guard worked for a private security company .
Detectives cordoned off the Franklin Avenue complex with yellow tape as investigators combed through the man ’s Toyota Solara .
The incident occurred at one of Hollywood ’s most distinctive landmarks .
Originally a luxury hotel , the eight - story building was built in the style of a 17th century French castle with a striking white facade and turrets that loom over the nearby Hollywood Freeway .
The church remade the building into a facility aimed at celebrities 39 years ago .
According to a church website , the Celebrity Centre caters to “ artists , politicians , leaders of industry , sports figures and anyone with the power and vision to create a better world . ”
The complex includes a restaurant , theater and hotel .
Representatives of the church did not return calls .

“ I have no information , ” said a woman who answered the phone at the Celebrity Centre .
The facility is ringed by a fence , and security cameras dot the property ’s perimeter .
Guards on bikes also patrol the area .
“ That is one thing about living here , you get free security , ” said Brant Hoibin , 34 , who lives in an apartment adjacent to the Celebrity Centre .

( CNN ) -- Sen. Barack Obama on Sunday charged that Sen. John McCain 's campaign is launching " Swift boat - style attacks " on him instead of addressing the country 's problems .
Sen . Barack Obama slams John McCain 's health care plan at an event in Asheville , North Carolina .
" Sen. McCain and his operatives are gambling that they can distract you with smears rather than talk to you about substance .
They 'd rather try to tear our campaign down than lift this country up , " Obama said at an event in Asheville , North Carolina .
" That 's what you do when you 're out of touch , out of ideas , and running out of time , " he said .
The comments come a day after Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , McCain 's running mate , claimed that Obama associated " with terrorists who targeted our own country . "
Watch what Obama says about McCain »
The McCain campaign shot back on Sunday , saying its accusations are " true facts , " and not " smears . "
" The last four weeks of this election will be about whether the American people are willing to turn our economy and national security over to Barack Obama , a man with little record , questionable judgment , and ties to radical figures like unrepentant domestic terrorist William Ayers , " McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said in a statement .
" Americans need to ask themselves if they 've ever befriended an unrepentant terrorist , or had a convicted felon help them buy their house -- because those are n't smears , those are true facts about Barack Obama . "
Obama also continued his heightened attack on McCain 's health care plan , calling it " radical " and " out of line with our basic values , " reiterating criticisms he made Saturday in Virginia .
The McCain campaign called Obama 's attack on McCain 's health plan " cynical and deceitful . "
" He will say anything to distract the American people away from his basic intention to force millions of Americans to accept government - run health care , " the campaign said in a statement .
Obama 's health care plan includes the creation of a national health insurance program for individuals who do not have employer - provided health care and who do not qualify for other existing federal programs .
His plan does not mandate individual coverage for all Americans , but requires coverage for all children .
McCain opposes federally mandated universal coverage .
He believes competition will improve the quality of health insurance .
McCain says he would reform the tax code to offer choices beyond employee - based health insurance coverage .
Under the plan , all taxpayers would receive a direct refundable tax credit of $ 2,500 for individuals and $ 5,000 for families .
Read more about the candidates ' health care plans
The back - and - forth comes during a weekend of intensified attacks .
The McCain campaign has said that it plans to step up attacks on the Democratic presidential candidate with just a month left before the November general election .
Palin on Saturday slammed Obama 's association with former anti-war radical Bill Ayers and accused Obama of associating " with terrorists who targeted their own country . "
CNN Fact Check
Ayers was a founding member of the radical Weather Underground , which was involved in several bombings in the early 1970s , including attacks on the Pentagon and the Capitol .
Obama and Ayers , now a university professor , have met several times since 1995 , when both worked with a non -profit group trying to raise funds for a school improvement project and a charitable foundation .
CNN 's review of project records found nothing to suggest anything inappropriate in the volunteer projects in which the two men were involved .
Watch the facts on Palin 's claim »
Obama campaign spokesman Hari Sevugan called Palin 's comments " offensive " and " not surprising " given the McCain campaign 's statement that " they would be launching Swift boat - like attacks in hopes of deflecting attention from the nation 's economic ills . "
The term " Swift boat " refers to how Swift Boat Veterans for Truth launched attacks against Sen.
John Kerry in the 2004 presidential race .
Kerry was criticized for not quickly condemning the personal ads .
In a new ad that begins airing Monday , the Obama campaign calls the new McCain campaign attacks a " dishonest , dishonorable assault on Barack Obama " .
The ad tries to paint McCain as " erratic " and " out of touch , " quotes taken from newspaper editorials .
Sen . Dianne Feinstein , D - California , said she found Palin 's attack on Obama " shocking . "
" He 's leading in the polls .
He 's leading in most of the battleground states .
And this is going to be a month , I think , of character assassination .
And so the Republican position is to try to assassinate Barack Obama 's character and try to place him in a position where the trust that he has built dissipates , the credibility that he has dissipates , " Feinstein said on CBS ' " Face the Nation . "
But McCain supporter Minnesota Gov.
Tim Pawlenty said the attacks are relevant because they point to Obama 's judgment .
Watch more on Palin 's stepped up attacks »
" Now Barack Obama at the time was 8 or 9 years old , or whatever , but that 's not the point -- the point is this same individual , Bill Ayers , hosted some sort of political event at his home for Barack Obama when Barack was running for state legislature in Illinois when he was well into his 30s , " he said on ABC 's " This Week . "
Obama has referred to Ayers as " somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago , when I was 8 . "
" This is n't about Sen . Obama being 8 years old , " Pawlenty said .
" This is his judgment when he was starting his political career in Illinois in the mid 1990s . "
Obama adviser Linda Douglass said on CNN's " Late Edition " that " Obama has denounced everything [ Ayers ] did , found him absolutely reprehensible . "
iReport.com : What do you think ?
Sound off with your video commentary
Nancy Pfotenhauer , McCain 's economic adviser , said , " the point is that Sen .
Obama misrepresents himself , whether it's about his tax policy , his spending policies . "
Douglass quickly denied that charge .
McCain and Obama will have a chance to address the issues face - to - face on Tuesday , when they meet in Nashville , Tennessee , for the second presidential debate .
This debate will be set up like a town hall meeting , and the audience will be made up of undecided voters .
Meanwhile , a spokesman for Joe Biden , Obama 's running mate , said Sunday that the Delaware senator would be canceling campaign events Monday and Tuesday in the wake of his mother - in - law 's death Sunday .
Bonny Jacobs , Jill Biden 's mother , had been sick for a long time and was living in a hospice .
Wade announced Saturday that Sunday and Monday 's events were canceled after doctors told the family to stay close by .
The death comes the same day Biden 's son , Beau , deploys with his National Guard unit to a mobilization station in Texas before a tour in Iraq .
All About U.S. Presidential Election
Back in 2006 , I wrote an entry called Python Tuples are Not Just Constant Lists which , after the Dr Horrible covers is my most visited blog post ever .
In it , I suggest that :
the index in a tuple has an implied semantic .
The point of a tuple is that the i-th slot means something specific .
In other words , it 's a index - based ( rather than name based ) datastructure .
In that same post , I pointed out the connection between the relational algebra and this notion of a tuple and further suggested that :
it might be useful to have the notion of a tuple whose slots could additionally be named and then accessed via name .
I implemented aspects of this in my initial explorations of relational python .
Basically a relation in relational algebra is a set of dictionaries ( called tuples ) where each dictionary has identical keys ( called attributes ) .
In Basic Class for Relations , I actually use Python tuples internally but they go in and out as dictionaries .
As I said in that post :
Basically , I store the each tuple internally as a Python tuple rather than a dictionary and the relation also keeps an ordered list of the attributes which is used as the index into the tuples .
Amongst other things , this gets around dictionaries not being hashable .
It 's also a storage optimization akin to using slots for Python attributes .
Here is a slightly cleaned up version of my code at the time :
class Rel : def __init__( self , * attributes ) : self.attributes_ = tuple ( attributes ) self.
tuples_ = set ( ) def add ( self , ** tupdict ) : self.tuples_.add(tuple( [tupdict[ attribute ] for attribute in self.attributes_ ] ) ) def attributes ( self ) : return set( self.attributes_ ) def tuples ( self ) : for tup in self .
tuples_ : tupdict = {} for col in range ( len( self.attributes_ ) ) : tupdict[self.attributes_[col ] ] = tup [ col ] yield tupdict
One could then say stuff like :
rel1 = Rel ( " ENO " , " ENAME " , " DNO " , " SALARY " ) rel1.add ( ENO = " E1 " , ENAME = " Lopez " , DNO = " D1 " , SALARY = " 40 K " ) rel1.add( ENO= " E2 " , ENAME = " Cheng " , DNO = " D1 " , SALARY = " 42 K " ) rel1.add( ENO=" E3 " , ENAME = " Finzi " , DNO = " D2 " , SALARY = " 30 K " )
and in subsequent posts I started to show how some relational operations could be performed on this datastructure .
Well , now in Python 2.6 , some of this can be simplified .
Python 2.6 introduced a wonderful new collections type called a named tuple — a tuple whose slots can also be addressed by name .
Now I can do something similar to Rel above as follows :
from collections import namedtuple class Rel : def __init__ ( self , typename , field_names ) : self.tuple_type = namedtuple ( typename , field_names ) self.tuples = set ( ) def add ( self , ** tupdict ) : self.tuples.add(self.tuple_type(** tupdict ) ) def attributes ( self ) : return set( self.tuple_type._fields )
and use it as follows :
rel1 = Rel ( " EMPLOYEE " , " ENO ENAME DNO SALARY " ) rel1.add( ENO= " E1 " , ENAME = " Lopez " , DNO = " D1 " , SALARY = " 40 K " ) rel1.add( ENO= " E2 " , ENAME = " Cheng " , DNO = " D1 " , SALARY = " 42 K " ) rel1.add( ENO=" E3 " , ENAME = " Finzi " , DNO = " D2 " , SALARY = " 30 K " )

At least 400 protest outside Mormon Church , thousands more in Sacramento 1 / 17 Back to Gallery
A couple thousand people gathered outside the Capitol in Sacramento this afternoon to rally for the legalization of same - sex marriages just days after voters imposed a constitutional ban .
The gathering follows several similar events around the Bay Area and California .
Earlier today , more than 400 people gathered outside the distinctive Mormon Temple in Oakland to protest the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints ' support of Proposition 8 .
That gathering prompted the Highway Patrol to shut down two Highway 13 ramps to protect pedestrians .
The ramps at Lincoln Avenue and Joaquin Miller Road reopened around 2 p.m .
And amid chants of " Stop Mormon hate " and " Enough is enough , " many protesters worried that they had been complacent before the Nov. 4 election .
A previous protest outside the Mormon Temple on Oct. 25 drew only about 50 people .
" I do n't think people thought it was going to pass , " said Carrie Blanche , 52 , an Alameda schoolteacher who got married Oct. 29 .
In Southern California , about 1,000 gay - rights advocates gathered outside the large Saddleback Church in Lake Forest ( Orange County ) to protest the evangelical congregation 's involvement in passing Proposition 8 .
An estimated 10,000 backers of gay and lesbian marriage gathered Saturday in San Diego .
The rallies have been generally peaceful , with crowd members waving U.S. and rainbow flags and carrying signs .
In Sacramento this afternoon , a few protesters said they were hopeful the courts would strike down the voter - approved ban while others said they would push for another statewide initiative .
Meanwhile , opponents of same - sex marriage have been relatively silent .
At the Mormon Church in Oakland , church spokesman Don Eaton said his congregation had been unfairly singled out .
He pointed out that Mormons make up only 5 percent of California voters and many other religious groups also advocated for the same - sex marriage ban .
" We 're an easy target .
People have been picking on us for years and we can accept that , " said Eaton , who said church leaders asked members to support the initiative .
Mormons are believed to have contributed several million dollars to the campaign , according to estimates .
One of the organizers of the Oakland protest , Ted DeBenedictis , said the church had been forewarned about the rally , which was not held during religious services .
Protesters at the Oakland event waved both American and rainbow flags and held signs that said " I am a child of God " and " Mormon church : latter - day discrimination . "
Two men in a passing car popped out of a sun roof and kissed passionately , drawing applause .
Some of those who gathered advocated for a boycott of travel to Utah , the home of the Mormon Church , and of Mormon - owned businesses .
A flier that was passed out listed several such firms and asked that " gay dollars " not be spent at Utah ski resorts and at the Sundance Film Festival in January in Park City , Utah .
It has been the food of monarchs and commoners ever since John Montagu , the fourth Earl of Sandwich , first pressed some meat between two slices of bread and took a bite .
Billions of butties later , the fast - food giant McDonald 's has set its sights on his invention .
The company has filed patents in Europe and the US that claim the " method and apparatus for making a sandwich " as its intellectual property .
Patent application WO2006068865 relates to the " pre-assembly of sandwich components and simultaneous preparation of different parts of the same sandwich " .
It covers the " simultaneous toasting of a bread component " and heating a " meat and / or cheese filling " .
And it says the company has invented a way to add garnishes and condiments using a " sandwich assembly tool " .
The patent says McDonald 's wants to cut down on the time and labour required to put its sandwiches together .
The company also wants them to look and taste the same and has come up with what it describes as " novel methods " to put them together .
The assembly tool contains a " cavity " into which the sandwich - maker places the garnish ( " including , but not limited to , lettuce , onions , tomatoes , pickles , chilli , coleslaw , giardinera , peppers , spinach , radishes , olives , egg , cooked bacon and cheese " ) and the condiments ( " ketchup , mustard , mayonnaise , sauces , relish , oils , salt , pepper , barbecue sauce , steak sauce , hot sauce , dressings including salad dressings , yogurt , butter , margarine and liquid or semi- liquid cheese " ) .
A " bread component " is then placed over the cavity and the assembly tool " inverted " to tip out the contents .
" Typically , a sandwich filling will thereafter be placed in the bread component , " the 55 - page patent explains .
" Often the sandwich filling is the source of the name of the sandwich , for example - ham sandwich . "
It also describes how to make cocktail sandwiches , by taking a full - sized version that is " cut up into smaller pieces " .
Lawrence Smith - Higgins of the UK Patent Office said : " McDonald 's or anyone else can't get retrospective exclusive rights to making a sandwich .
They might have a novel device but it could be quite easy for someone to make a sandwich in a similar way without infringing their claims . "
McDonald 's would not comment .
This year ’s 4th of July was fairly uneventful for me .
The nearby town of Neche ( where my father went to school ) had it ’s “ all - class reunion ” this weekend , so that pretty much ruled out some sort of family “ reunion ” for fireworks and a cook out .
That morning , Neche had a 4th of July parade , so everyone in my family went there to watch it .
The parade was very long , and consisted mostly of vintage cars and tractors , but we all enjoyed it anyway .
That afternoon was extremely uneventful , with most of my family partly hungover from the night before , we all just hung out around the house and slept for most of the afternoon .
That evening , we all went over to my aunts house and did a little cook out there , with steak and chicken being served .
I guess that dinner was the most eventful thing of the day for me , which I ’m okay with .
We all sat around outside and proceeded with the conventional small talk : how we thought Obama was doing in office , Michael Jackson dying , what we had planned for the rest of the night , and of course everyone wanted to know about my recent trip to Anaheim , California .
That night , my family went back to Neche as there was a street dance that everyone was invited to .
I hung back at the house for two reasons : I never and will never go to school in Neche , and I did n’t want to stay until 2:00 AM while everyone got drunk .
Our town always had a very good fireworks display that they did every year , but for some reason , that ended a few years ago .
I was able to watch a neighbor ’s display , though , which was plenty much for me .
Thumper stayed in the basement the whole night , as he was obviously scared to death of the loud noises .
I went down there a bit later to comfort him , which helped quite a bit .
And that right there is how my fourth went .

When people think Open Source and social networking , usually the first thing that comes to mind is Google and OpenSocial .
What most do n’t know however is that Facebook is almost as much , if not more Open Source focused as Google is .
One unknown fact about the Facebook Platform is that most of the technologies used to create the platform were used in - house before they were released to the public , and because of that they have been able to release many of those projects through OpenSource licenses to the public .
Facebook has an entire page on their developers site that features the Open Source projects they are working on .
On that page are 12 projects that I ’ll describe here :
Facebook Open Platform
As one of the most significant contributions by Facebook , Facebook has made almost its entire developer platform , from FBML to the API , open source for other sites to enable developers to port apps from Facebook .
It was recently made famous through its implementation by Friendster .
Bebo has also implemented the code from this platform enabling developers to easily make the transition of their apps from Facebook to Bebo .
Any developer can download the code , written in PHP , install it , and implement a Facebook - compatible API on their own site .
Thrift
Thrift , according to Facebook , “ combines a powerful software stack with a code generation engine to build services that work efficiently and seamlessly between C++ , Java , Python , PHP , and Ruby ” .
The idea here is that with Thrift , you can easily generate an intermediate layer that will talk between languages .
Facebook uses this in their search , mobile , posts , notes , feed , and platform products currently , but the code is free and open for all to download .
MemcacheD
According to Facebook , they are the largest user of MemcacheD.
MemcacheD is a memory - based caching technology that enables multiple servers to share a common pool of cache , all stored in memory , enabling very fast , scalable response times for web services .
Facebook has made significant contributions to the source code of MemcacheD increasing response times by 20 % .
Twitter is also a significant user of MemcacheD among many other services .
Cassandra
Cassandra appears to be a distributed storage system enabling storage across many servers with no single point of failure .
It ’s unclear what Facebook services are using this currently .
phpsh
Written in Python ( ironically ) , phpsh is a shell intended to make PHP development easier .
Facebook says it was developed internally , but gives access to documentation , tab - completion , and more .
Facebook has coined the term , “ interactive scripting ” , with this new shell .
Could we be seeing the first “ social ” development environment ?
Facebook Animation
Facebook is creating an entire library to enable javascript animation methods in the Facebook Javascript client library .
Going head - to - head with the likes of YUI , the Animation libraries Facebook provides give shortcuts , keeping the Facebook look and feel in Facebook javascript development .
Facebook Firefox Toolbar
Completely open source , the Facebook Firefox Toolbar is an extension for Firefox that enables the user to track their Facebook friends , check messages , and more from the Firefox browser .
It was written as an example of the Facebook Platform desktop client libraries , and Facebook is even allowing developers to submit patches to keep it going .
Facebook Exporter for iPhoto
If you have uploaded photos to Facebook from iPhoto the chances are you ’ve used this plugin .
The exporter takes the photos on your Mac and sends them to Facebook , all integrated into the iPhoto experience .
All code is open source and available to the public , so you can get in as a developer and see how they did it , extend it , and more .
flvtool ++
flvtool ++ is a set of libraries used by Facebook to find and extract data from FLV files ( used to generate Flash videos ) .
Based on the Ruby FLVTool2 libraries , it was rewritten in C++ for performance .
Facebook uses this actively in its Video app .
PHPEmbed
PHPEmbed enables developers writing applications in C++ and other languages to easily embed PHP in their code , making development times faster as developers do n’t have to abandon existing development patterns to get the job done .
Facebook wrote this to speed up their development processes and has released the code to the public .
Public Patches Library
Facebook has released a series of patches to various projects in the public .
Of the patches listed , perhaps the most significant is a change to the PHP MySQL libraries .
Facebook Mirror
Facebook has offered a hosted mirror to the public where projects such as Apache , Linux , and other Open Source projects can mirror their code and others can download .
Facebook is doing the community a service in this case by reducing the load from some of the most used Open Source projects available .
Facebook also uses this mirror to host some of its own Open Source projects .
Conclusion
Facebook may have a bad reputation in the public eye when it comes to open source .
However , I think that reputation may be quite misunderstood .
Facebook is relatively new in comparison to Google , and they appear to be well on their way to being a leader in the Open Source community .
CD Projekt : Publishers " scared " to go DRM - Free CEO Michal Kicinski says publishers need to offer better value to combat piracy

The best way to fight piracy is to compete with it by offering greater value , according to Michal Kicinski , CEO of CD Projekt , but publisher 's are too afraid to release titles without DRM .
Speaking to GamesIndustry .biz about CD
Projekts new digital distribution project , GOG.com , Kicinski explained that publishers have been hesitant to sign up to the service due to its DRM - free policy .
" We 're trying to convince them there is nothing to be afraid of , " he said .
" DRM - free , that is something they are really scared of , but on the other hand we can say 'all of those games are available pirated widely so it 's better to sell them for small money than make the customer 's life difficult and get some more revenues ' . "
Kicinski's comments come as EA suffers from a backlash over the restrictive DRM system implemented in Spore , which despite measures still suffered from high rates of piracy .
" We 're gamers and we are using all these digital distribution platforms , " commented Kicinski .
" I had Steam but I had the problem that my internet provider could not work with it so I could n't use the games I bought .
I think that if somebody is paying for the game then they deserve own it , not with a certain list of conditions and sometimes the list of conditions can be long . "
The boss of The Witcher developer went on to explain that many companies were dropping DRM due to the complications it causes the end users .
" It 's the same with buying music online with DRM , Amazon has decided not to provide it with DRM , iTunes is doing this iTunes plus . "
He added : " DRM makes customer 's lives too complicated , and this is usually because of some corporate ideas , policies and trying to be smart , too smart , in how to get customers and how to keep them and no let them go somewhere else .
We are believers in the free market and bringing freedom to customers . "
Kicinski went on to comment on the recent move by five UK publishers to threaten 25,000 suspected file - sharers with legal action unless a fine of GBP 300 was paid immediately .
" Piracy in Poland is always much , much bigger here than in Western countries so we got used to living with piracy and we grew up in a surrounding where there was no help from governments to actually fight piracy , " he said .
" So we had to learn to compete with pirates "
" For example we believe that GOG.com makes such a good offer that it 's not worth pirating ...
We attract people to buy the original games instead of pirating them and that 's the most efficient way of fighting piracy . "
Update February 9 , 2010 : Although I am very disappointed with Obama , I decided to keep this post up .
I think it shows how much his promises meant to people .
And now those promises have been broken .
So these picture serve as an event in history .

THE NEW York Times and other mainstream media are reporting that the top seven executives at Goldman Sachs have foregone their year - end bonuses .
The Times does n't mention that there are 443 partners at Goldman Sachs , leaving 436 who could still be eligible for bonuses that were to average over $ 4.5 million per partner ( before the top seven 's announcement ) , according to Daily Mail .
The Times does reveal :
In the last several years , Goldman Sachs has posted some of the biggest profits and paid out some of the biggest bonuses in Wall Street history .
The company 's chief executive , Lloyd C. Blankfein , received a salary and bonus package last year worth $ 68.5 million .
Goldman Sachs paid its two co-presidents , Gary D. Cohn and Jon Winkelried , around $ 67.5 million each last year , more than most chief executives .
All three will receive no bonuses this year .
However , as the historically large bonuses had been going on for " several years , " one can only imagine how much Goldman Sachs ( and other Wall Street ) investment bankers have received in bonuses while the economy has been heading for crisis .
The Times does not shed any light on the scope of this profit taking .
The Times also notes that " [ i ] n
September , Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley transformed themselves into bank holding companies that take deposits , take less risk and are subject to more government oversight .
That new structure may limit their ability to generate big profits , because they cannot use as much borrowed money to make big investment bets . "
" Transformed themselves ? "
Are we now to understand that they have undertaken to evolve consciously into " good corporate citizens " by limiting big profits and , in Goldman Sachs ' case , by their top executives forgoing bonuses ?
Just as it did not report on the true scope of the bonuses , the Times is not revealing much about Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley becoming bank holding companies .
The Times neglects the federal role in the transformation .
The federal government approved their requests to become bank holding companies after the collapse of Lehman Brothers , shortly before the bailout ( and shortly before investor Warren Buffet pumped $ 5 billion into Goldman Sachs ) .
Mainstream media largely ignored the transformation , or that there was a five - day waiting period before a " yea " decision by the Feds could take effect .
By becoming bank holding companies , Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley can now seek to acquire banks .
In fact , this is exactly what Goldman Sachs intends to do .
On October 20 , 2008 , Bloomberg News quoted Goldman Sachs spokesman Michael DuVally as saying : " Goldman Sachs intends to grow its deposit base both organically and through acquisitions . "
Also , incoming bank deposits will give Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley cash flows that put them at an advantage compared to other investment firms .
As reported by Bloomberg : " New York - based Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley converted themselves from securities firms into bank holding companies last month so they could gather deposits . "
That the mainstream media is not noticing much about Goldman Sachs is not surprising , as it did not notice that Goldman Sachs was the second largest " contributor " -- at $ 874,207 -- to Barack Obama 's election efforts .
( Donations do not come directly from companies ;
The Web site OpenSecrets.org looks at donations by a company 's PAC and by its partners , employees and immediate families . )
By comparison , Goldman Sachs contributed $ 228,695 to elect John McCain .
( Morgan Stanley 's figures were $ 425,102 for Obama and $ 262,777 for McCain . )
While the Times makes headlines with its story about the Goldman Sachs top seven , it does not reveal much behind the headlines .
The bonuses given up this year by the Goldman Sachs top seven are just the ugly tip of the proverbial iceberg .
And , their becoming a bank holding company will enable Goldman Sachs to carry out its plan to buy up banks .
This will consolidate the banking industry further and build on Wall Streets well - deserved reputation for greed .

You can buy them used .
It 's not too hard , you just have to have the money .
Something like this one would probably only run you about $ 5 million .
If you can afford that and the ungodly amount of maintenance it takes to keep a fighter jet running , it 's completely legal as long as the pilot has the ratings and you obey FAA rules .
If you want to arm the sucker , that 's a whole different thing .
When they sell these privately , they remove all the weapons systems ( electronics , and mounting hardware ) .
To get it firing again would take a lot of black market and less - than - legal work done .
But with enough money , and the right knowledge of military surplus sales , you could do it .
As a Navy Logostics Officer , my Father worked with Navy JAG a couple decades back on a case where some wealthy rancher out in Montana assembled from surplus parts a full functional Marine Cobra Attack Helicopter , complete with guns and rockets .
he used it in his spare time to hunt wolves on his massive piece of property to protect his cattle herds .
Needless to say , the government politely asked him to stop ...
In Abkhazia , hundreds danced and embraced near a government building Western leaders have condemned strongly Russia 's decision to recognise the independence of the breakaway Georgian regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
US President George Bush warned his Russian counterpart , Dmitry Medvedev , that his " irresponsible decision " was exacerbating tensions in the region .
Georgia said Russia was seeking to " change Europe 's borders by force " .
Earlier , Mr Medvedev told the BBC that Russia had been obliged to act because of Georgia 's " genocide " of separatists .
He also said Moscow had felt obliged to recognise South Ossetia and Abkhazia as other countries had done with Kosovo earlier this year .

The president said Russia 's relations with the West were deteriorating sharply and a new Cold War could not be ruled out , but that his country did not want one .
" There are no winners in a Cold War , " he told the BBC's Bridget Kendall in an exclusive interview in the Russian town of Sochi .
The separatist authorities in Abkhazia and South Ossetia , which have had de facto independence since the early 1990s , have thanked Russia .
Fighting between Russia and Georgia began on 7 August after the Georgian military tried to retake South Ossetia by force .
Russian forces subsequently launched a counter - attack and the conflict ended with the ejection of Georgian troops from both South Ossetia and Abkhazia and an EU - brokered ceasefire .
' No easy choice '
In an announcement on Russian television , President Medvedev said he had signed a decree recognising Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states and called on other states to follow his example .
This is 21st century brutal invasion , and 21st century large - scale ethnic cleansing
Mikhail Saakashvili
Georgian President
Foreign reaction in quotes UK urges Russia to ' abide by law ' Assertive Russia poses problems Mr Medvedev said he had " taken into account the expression of free will by the Ossetian and Abkhaz peoples " and accused Georgia of failing over many years to negotiate a peaceful settlement .
" That was no easy choice to make , but it is the sole chance of saving people 's lives , " he added .
International dismay at Russia 's declaration came almost immediately .
President Bush said Russia should " reconsider this irresponsible decision " and " live up to its international commitments " .
" This decision is inconsistent with numerous United Nations Security Council resolutions that Russia has voted for in the past , and is also inconsistent with the French - brokered six - point ceasefire agreement which President Medvedev signed , " he said in a statement .
" Russia 's action only exacerbates tensions and complicates diplomatic negotiations , " he added .

" In accordance with United Nations Security Council resolutions that remain in force , Abkhazia and South Ossetia are within the internationally recognised borders of Georgia , and they must remain so . "
France , the current holder of the presidency of the European Union , also condemned Russia 's decision and called for a political solution .
" We think it is against the territorial integrity of Georgia and we cannot accept it , " Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said .
Nato 's Secretary - General , Jaap de Hoop Scheffer , said the announcement was a " direct violation " of numerous UN Security Council resolutions on Georgia which Russia itself had endorsed .
Earlier , Russia cancelled a visit by Mr de Hoop Scheffer , one of a series of measures to suspend co-operation with the alliance .
Russia 's ambassador to Nato said the trip would be delayed until relations between the two were clarified .
' Completely illegal ' Georgia 's President Mikhail Saakashvili accused Russia of trying to " break the Georgian state , undermine the fundamental values of Georgia , and to wipe Georgia from the map " .

" Today 's step by Russia is completely illegal and will have no legal basis , neither for Georgia nor for the rest of the world , " he said .
Mr Saakashvili described the declaration as " the first attempt in Europe after Nazi Germany and the Stalinist Soviet Union to ... change the borders of Europe by force " .
Speaking later to the BBC , he said the move had been " a blatant attempt to legalise the results of ethnic cleansing [ which ]
Russian troops are continuing to commit , right now as we speak , and that have been committed during the last several years " .
The president accused Russian troops of " throwing out the remaining population , destroying the villages , killing and raping and looting people " in the breakaway regions .
" This is 21st century brutal invasion , and 21st century large - scale ethnic cleansing , " he said .
" How can the world allow them to get away with this ? "
Earlier , the head of European security organisation , the OSCE , Alexander Stubb , also accused Russia of " trying to empty " South Ossetia of Georgians .
The OSCE accused Russia of " trying to empty " South Ossetia of Georgians Mr Saakashvili said the international community had to challenge " Russian aggression " in the strongest possible terms .
" This is not between Georgia and Russia anymore , " he said .
" This is an unparalleled challenge by Russia of international law and order . "
He said the response required Western aid to help Georgia recover , an international peacekeeping force on the ground , and the speeding up of his country 's integration of Nato .
In the South Ossetia and Abkhazia , however , Moscow 's move was warmly welcomed .
The leader of South Ossetia 's separatist government , Eduard Kokoity , said he would ask Moscow to set up a military base on his territory .
In the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali there were scenes of jubilation while residents in Abkhazia took to the streets to celebrate the news , firing into the air .
Cold War fears
In an interview with the BBC at his residency in Sochi , on the border with Abkhazia , Mr Medvedev later said Russia had been obliged to act following a " genocide " started by Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili against separatists in South Ossetia in August .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Making peace is like clapping your hands .
You can't clap with 1 hand MaxMaxmilianMaximusI ] , Indian Caesar in , Singapore
The president compared Russia 's recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia to the West 's recognition of Kosovo , which unilaterally declared independence from Serbia in February 2008 .
He also denied that Russia had breached the ceasefire agreement with Georgia , saying pursuing the security of the two regions included addressing their status .
" The most important thing was to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe to save the lives of people for whom we are responsible , because most of them they are Russian citizens , " he said .
" So we had to take a decision recognising the two states as independent . "
Although most of Russia 's forces pulled out of the rest of Georgia last Friday , it is maintaining a presence both within the two rebel regions and in buffer zones imposed round their boundaries .
Some Russian troops also continue to operate near the Black Sea port of Poti , south of Abkhazia , where Russia says it will carry out regular inspections of cargo .
The US said on Tuesday that its warships would deliver aid to Georgia 's port of Poti , which is under Russian control .
The move could mean US and Russian forces coming face to face .

In “ Best Creative Use of an Undergarment ” news today , State Senator Dianne Wilkerson of Massachusetts is under arrest on accusations that she stuffed cash bribes into her bra .
Wilkerson , who is charged with public corruption , has been under investigation for 18 months , the FBI indicates .
Federal agents released undercover photos that they say show the senator accepting money — and , yes , shoving the bills into her brassiere :
It does n’t end there , though .
Investigators believe Dianne Wilkerson had taken as much as $ 20,000 in exchange for filing certain pieces of law in the Senate .
Some of the other allegations , according to the FBI report — available in its entirety here ( PDF ) — include taking $ 8,500 to help a nightclub obtain its liquor license and proposing a law to help developers avoid legally required bidding procedures .
( The FBI document also contains additional undercover photos . )
This is n’t Dianne Wilkerson ’s first brush with trouble .
The senator admitted violating campaign finance laws in 2004 and paid a $ 10,000 fine as a result .
She has also served time in a halfway house following an income tax evasion investigation , The Boston Herald reports .
If convicted on the new charges , Wilkerson could face 20 years in prison for each count as well as numerous fines .
A video has surfaced of a new innovation in OLED technology which is thought to be from the recent Japanese Flat Panel Display ( FPD ) trade show .
It shows a full - color OLED display by Samsung which is capable of being folded in two , much like a sheet of paper .
The display joins Samsung ’s .05 mm thick OLED that was also present at the show – flapping in the wind .
This cellphone / portable media player is emblazoned with Samsung ’s logo beneath a smaller panel on the front on the device which appears to be a touchscreen .
Tech specs have yet to be seen and we ’re probably a long way off from seeing this on the market , but it is an impressive glimpse of future display tech currently in development .

Chambliss attacks opponent on family in GA senate race Andrew McLemore
Published : Saturday November 22 , 2008
Print This Email This As Republican Sen. Saxby Chambliss battles to keep his senate seat in Georgia , his campaign released ads accusing his Democratic challenger of being a danger to children .
One of the ads paints Jim Martin as soft on crime and responsible for making families less safe .
It says Martin was fired from a government position " after children die[ d ] , " referencing Martin 's 2003 resignation from the post of commissioner of the Department of Human Resources after two toddlers passed away under state supervision .
But that is " hardly the implicit involvement that the charge suggests , " The Huffington Post reported .
Democrats point out that Martin 's daughter was kidnapped at the age of eight , causing the Georgia Democrat to introduce a wide - variety of legislation to protect families from crime , Newsweek reported .
" The memory of how his daughter trembled when forced to face her kidnapper in court has remained with Mr. Martin every day , " said Matt Canter , a Martin spokesman .
The atmosphere is similar to Chambliss ' 2002 run for the same office , when he questioned the patriotism of incumbent Max Cleland , a triple amputee veteran of the Vietnam War .
Chambliss attacked Cleland for his stance on the war in Iraq .
At the time Sen. John McCain criticized Chambliss for his style of campaigning .
" I 'd never seen anything like that ad .
Putting pictures of Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden next to the picture of a man who left three limbs on the battlefield - it 's worse than disgraceful .
It 's reprehensible , " McCain said at the time .
McCain has since campaigned for Chambliss in this election .
Another controversial ad from conservative group Freedom 's Watch suggests Martin 's policies would threaten " your family 's safety . "
Martin 's campaign has run ads of its own , taking the usual strategy of attacking Chambliss -- a long - standing member of the GOP who supported McCain 's campaign for the presidency -- for not backing Obama .
" No wonder he opposes the Obama economic recovery plan , " the announcer says -- in a state that voted 52 % - 47 % for McCain , Talking Points Memo reported .
Part of the M42 has reopened after a six - vehicle crash sent marshmallows and beer spilling out onto the carriageway .
The northbound stretch was closed at junction 10 near Tamworth Services in Staffordshire after six HGVs collided between junctions 12 and 13 on the A42 .
Leicestershire Police said one person was hurt in the collision at about 0414 GMT , which involved some lorries that were parked in a lay - by .
The carriageway was closed for up 10 hours while the debris was removed .
The damaged lorries also had to be lifted off the road .
Police confirmed cans of beer fell onto the carriageway and one person was taken to hospital with minor injuries .
The Highways Agency said the accident occurred where the motorway ends and becomes the A42 .
" It is in an area where lorries cannot overtake and also falls between the control of two police regions , " he said .
Diversions were put in place at junction 10 and drivers were warned to expect long delays and use alternative routes .
With just six days to go , I think far - right social conservatives are running out of names to call their opponents , but do n't underestimate the power of nasty .

Sen. Elizabeth Dole ( R - NC ) , in her first attempt to be re-elected , is running an ad calling her opponent " Godless " because she accepted money from an organization of American voters who organized legally to express themselves politically and are atheist .
Kay Hagan is not atheist , but she is running for office to represent all Americans , including atheists .
Apparently Liddy Dole is not .
Disagree as I might politically with Dole , I never thought she would stoop so low , she did n’t seem like that kind of politician .
Then again , her husband knows a thing or two about dirty tricks .
In his first bid for re-election in Kansas , in 1974 , he was in a very close race with popular Congressman Dr. Bill Roy , an ob / gyn , and in the last days before the election Bob Dole delivered photos of aborted fetuses in the form of door hangers into heavily Catholic precincts .
Bob Dole won because tactics like that , then , were shocking .
After 35 years of far - right tactics that demean the intelligence of voters , one can hope the voters of North Carolina wo n’t fall for such a desperate ploy , and judge the candidates on their records .
Dole has now used this " Godless " attack in mailers , online video and on television .

Here ’s what fact - checking journalists in North Carolina have to say :
Some readers may be left with the impression that Hagan supports the
PAC ’s position on the Pledge of Allegiance , Christmas and the Boy
Scouts — or that Hagan is an atheist .
Hagan ’s campaign said Hagan does not support removing " Under God " from the Pledge of Allegiance .
Hagan is an elder at the First Presbyterian Church in Greensboro .
Hagan
does not support eliminating the Christmas holiday .
Her family often
spends part of Christmas morning at a home for severely handicapped
people , where they cook breakfast , wash dishes and play Santa Claus to
relieve the home ’s staff .
Hagan ’s son is an Eagle Scout .
Her
campaign said that while Hagan opposes discrimination , she believes
questions about who can be troop leaders is a decision for the Boy
Scouts , not Washington , to make .
Is the mailer accurate ?
Yes and no .
Hagan did attend the fundraiser in question .
But the mailer
incorrectly suggests that Hagan shares the view of the Godless
Americans PAC on the Pledge of Allegiance , Christmas and the Boy
Scouts .
A larger question for all Americans is , regardless of your beliefs , do atheists have rights as citizens ?
Is n’t America about debating different ideas , in civil discourse , to determine the direction of the country ?
Faith that is threatened by the opinion of another is n’t really faith at all , it is fear .
Unfortunately Dole has revealed herself to be part of a pattern this election cycle .
Rep. Michelle Bachmann called for an investigation into un-American activities by liberals in Congress .
Sen. Barack Obama has been accused of consorting with terrorists , infanticide , and being Muslim , as if being Muslim is something of which to be ashamed .
Gov. Sarah Palin called Obama a Communist and Sen Joe Biden was asked by a local TV anchorwoman ( married to a GOP consultant ) why Obama is n’t Marxist because of his proposed tax cuts to 95 percent of Americans .
Angry mobs yell epithets and threats at McCain - Palin rallies and the campaign does little to stop them .
As Americans we should stand up for the rights of all Americans to be heard .
As a person of faith , I will stand up for the rights of atheists to be heard as well , and am not the least bit threatened by ensuring they have rights .
Those who will demean or take rights away from any group , will eventually try to take them away from you .
This is the far - right social conservative notion of civil discourse and how they define thier faith and love of country .
This is what they propose we all live in when they talk about a " Christian Nation . "
Fascinating , is n’t it ?

Elite US special - forces troops have now been equipped with special uniforms featuring up to eight built - in drawstring tourniquet systems .
Reports have it that thousands of the new anti-bloodloss trouserlegs and sleeves are already in use on the front lines in southwest Asia .
Arterial wound ?
Suits you , sir
American military couturier and luggage house Blackhawk - providers of pouches , webbing , holsters and so forth to the various elites of the US forces - unveiled their Integrated Tourniquet System ( ITS ™ ) last September .
When an ITS - clad trooper , in the course of putting foot to ass for his country , has a limb severed - or perhaps merely springs a leak in a brachial or femoral artery - he or a nearby buddy can pull open a flap on his uniform and heave briskly on one of several cable - tie - esque assemblies built into his trouserleg or shirt sleeve .
This will clamp off the spurting blood almost at once , avoiding the need to improvise a tourniquet from a bandage , neckwear , belt or whatever .
“ The majority of preventable deaths come from loss of blood resulting from leg and arm wounds that is not protected by body armor .
Sixty percent of preventable combat deaths are from extremity bleeding and 50 - 70 per cent of all combat injuries are extremity wounds , ” said Blackhawk 's " tactial medicine specialist " , Dr Keith Rose .
" The fact that you can always find the tourniquet with the Integrated Tourniquet system and the speed with which you can immediately apply it will dramatically impact not only loss of life but also the amount of time that it takes to recover from extreme blood loss injuries . "
Blackhawk said last year that ITS would be available in " Q1 of Calendar 2008 " .
That appears to have been no empty boast , as Military.com now report that the famous yet secretive US Navy SEALs are wearing the new ziploc bloodspurt - stifling apparel in unspecified warzones to the tune of 1,100 sets .
The SEALs are known for their willingness to try out unconventional combat medicine techniques : rumour has it that they occasionally use feminine - hygiene tampons for staunching bullet wounds .
There was no information as to just how many ITS drawstring tourniquet - cuffs had actually been used , however .
As Blackhawk note , it 's common in military circles for new kit to be tried out first by elite units before filtering down to regular troops if found successful .
It 's also very normal for trendy military togs and accessories to then be taken up by civilians - for instance aviator shades , flight jackets , combat trousers , suit jacket cuff buttons * etc etc .
Blackhawk expect ITS ™ to score well in civvy street , particularly in " the Law Enforcement and Outdoor communities " .
One might suggest that it could be even more of a natural fit for other , less clean - cut groups - intravenous drug users , for instance . ®

Mussels can become stressed by increases in acidity Man-made pollution is raising ocean acidity at least 10 times faster than previously thought , a study says .
Researchers say carbon dioxide levels are having a marked effect on the health of shellfish such as mussels .
They sampled coastal waters off the north - west Pacific coast of the US every half - hour for eight years .
The results , published in the journal PNAS , suggest that earlier climate change models may have underestimated the rate of ocean acidification .
Ocean pH Professor Timothy Wootton from the department of ecology and evolution , University of Chicago , in Illinois , says such dramatic results were unexpected as it was thought that the huge ocean systems had the ability to absorb large quantities of CO2 .
" It 's been thought pH in the open oceans is well buffered , so it 's surprising to see these fluctuations , " he said .
The findings showed that CO2 had lowered the water pH over time , demonstrating a year - on - year increase in acidity .
Increasing quantities of dissolved CO2 will make sea water more acidic
The research involved taking daily measurements of water pH levels , salinity and temperature , off the coast of Tatoosh island , a small outcrop lying in the Pacific Ocean , just off the north - western tip of Washington state , US .
As well as measuring physical factors , the health of marine life present in the coastal ecosystem was also tracked .
Professor Wootton says biological factors were missing from previous models of ocean climate systems - and that life in the ocean , or in this case on the ocean edge , can also affect seawater pH .
" Over a short time , biology is affecting pH , through photosynthesis and respiration , but current models do n't include biological activity as part of the story , " he explained .
Calcium carbonate Every summer , Professor Wootton returned to the same sites on Tatoosh island 's windswept coasts , to look at the abundance and distribution of life at the water 's edge .
He was especially interested in barnacles , algae and the dominant species , the Californian mussel .
Seawater sampling was conducted for eight years
The mussel has a calcium carbonate - based shell , which can be weakened or even dissolved by exposure to acid .
Professor Wootton says the increase in acidity may be responsible for the decline in mussels noted in the study .
" Patterns show the chances of mussels being replaced are higher than for species without calcified shells , " he said .
Other species quickly move into the space previously occupied by the mussels - though one of these species , the barnacle , also has calcified shells .
To explain this apparent anomaly , Professor Wootton says the decline of the dominant species allows a window where another species may thrive - though he expects this to be temporary as the interloper too will eventually be affected by the increasing acidity .
" In the short term , the long term decline is offset by the release from competition , " he explained .
It 's going down 10 to 20 times faster than the previous models predicted
Professor Timothy Wootton , University of Chicago
Chemical oceanography
The researchers say they were surprised that the plants and animals in their study are so sensitive to CO2 changes .
These organisms live in the harsh inter-tidal zones , they may be submerged under water , exposed to the sun , then lashed by waves and storms .
Professor Wootton says the most troubling finding is the speed of acidification , with the pH level dropping at a much greater rate than was previously thought .
" It 's going down 10 to 20 times faster than the previous models predicted , " he says .
The research team are now working together with chemical oceanographers to see how their coastal observations can be matched with large scale observations , to try to explain why the decline in pH levels seems to be happening so quickly .
" We actually know surprisingly little about how ocean acidity is changing over time , we need a broader network of measurements , " said Professor Wootton .

Northcom to train 4,700 service members for “ specialized domestic operations ”

Northcom has announced that two more U.S. military units will be assigned for domestic homeland security missions , bringing the total number of combat ready service members operating inside the U.S. to around 4,700 , as fears grow about the increasing militarization of law enforcement .
The announcement follows the controversy surrounding a September 8 Army Times report ( revised on September 30 ) , which revealed that the 3rd Infantry Division ’s 1st Brigade Combat Team , fresh from combat duties in Iraq , would be operating inside America for tasks including “ civil unrest and crowd control , ” a detail that was later denied by Northcom despite the concession that forces would be armed with both non-lethal and lethal weapons as well as having access to tanks .
“ In the next three years the military plans to activate and train an estimated 4,700 service members for specialized domestic operations , according to Air Force Gen. Gene Renuart , commander of U.S. Northern Command , which was created in 2002 for homeland defense missions , ” reports the Colorado Independent .
“ It ’s to help us manage the consequences of a large - scale event , ” said Renuart .
“ We have one [ unit ] now trained and equipped and assigned to the Northern Command .
We ’ll grow a second one this calendar year of 2009 and a third one in the calendar year 2010 so we can provide the nation three sets of capabilities that could respond to an event of the size of 9/11 or larger . ”
But as Mike German , national security counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union ’s legislative office in Washington . , D.C. , points out , “ This is n’t a military police brigade or a civil affairs brigade .
This is actually a combat brigade being assigned a domestic mission . ”

“ It ’s fine for the general to say that , ” said counter - terrorist operations specialist German .
“ But we want to know what the policies actually are , what the roles are and what the regulations are to see whether this is actually complying with the law . ”
The ACLU has filed a Freedom Of Information Request demanding more information on the purpose and scope of military assets under Northcom control being deployed domestically .
Despite Northcom ’s insistence that the deployments are purely related to natural disaster and mass casualty response , the original Army Times report quoted 1st BCT commander Col.
Roger Cloutier as saying that the unit would be trained in the use of “ nonlethal weapons designed to subdue unruly or dangerous individuals ” for the purposes of “ crowd and traffic control ” .
The use of U.S. troops in law enforcement duties is a complete violation of the Posse Comitatus Act and the Insurrection Act , which substantially limit the powers of the federal government to use the military for law enforcement unless under precise and extreme circumstances .
Section 1385 of the Posse Comitatus
Act states , “ Whoever , except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress , willfully uses any part of the Army or the Air Force as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years , or both . ”
Under the John Warner Defense Authorization Act , signed by President Bush on October 17 , 2006 , the law was changed to state , “ The President may employ the armed forces to restore public order in any State of the United States the President determines hinders the execution of laws or deprives people of a right , privilege , immunity , or protection named in the Constitution and secured by law or opposes or obstructs the execution of the laws of the United States or impedes the course of justice under those laws . ”
However , these changes were repealed in their entirety by HR 4986 : National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 , reverting back to the original state of the Insurrection Act of 1807 .
Despite this repeal , President Bush attached a signing statement saying that he did not feel bound by the repeal .
Fears of active duty military assets being called upon to administer martial law in the aftermath of an economic collapse or a large scale terrorist attack were heightened after we revealed the existence of a FEMA - run program which is training Pastors and other religious representatives to become secret police enforcers who teach their congregations to “ obey the government ” in preparation for a declaration of martial law , property and firearm seizures , and forced relocation .
Debunkers and “ urban myth ” websites – such as The Museum of Hoaxes – dismissed the story as a hoax , yet it was later confirmed in triplicate by mainstream news reports .

ANCHORAGE , Alaska ( CNN ) --
An Alaska judge refused Thursday to throw out subpoenas for members of Gov. Sarah Palin 's administration in the State Legislature 's investigation of her firing of her public safety commissioner .
Gov. Sarah Palin 's campaign has said the investigation is tainted by partisan politics .
Anchorage Superior Court Judge Peter Michalski rejected a request by Palin's Republican allies to shut down the investigation and ruled that the subpoenas were issued properly by the state Senate Judiciary Committee .
Kevin Clarkson , a lawyer for five GOP lawmakers who filed suit in September , said the date was arbitrarily chosen by the lawmakers overseeing the investigation .
" There 's no magic to this October 10 date , " Clarkson said .
The bipartisan committee that authorized the investigation stated only that it be conducted " in a timely manner , " he said .
Peter Maassen , the attorney for the lawmakers leading the inquiry , called the suit " a complete perversion of the process " and said the Legislature had the authority to conduct its investigation .
The former Anchorage prosecutor hired to conduct the investigation , Stephen Branchflower , is slated to complete his report by October 10 .
In an affidavit filed ahead of Thursday 's hearing , he said he has begun to draft his report despite the refusal of several Palin aides and her husband , Todd , to comply with subpoenas issued by the state Senate Judiciary Committee .
Assistant Attorney General Jan Hart DeYoung had asked Michalski to dismiss the subpoenas for top seven members of Palin 's administration , arguing that the committee had no authority to issue them .
Palin , now the Republican vice presidential nominee , sacked Public Service Commissioner Walt Monegan in July , citing disagreements over budget issues .
But Monegan has said he believes that he was fired because he resisted pressure to fire Palin 's ex-brother - in - law , State Trooper Mike Wooten .
Palin has denied any wrongdoing , calling Wooten a " rogue trooper " who threatened her family during his divorce from the governor 's sister .
Though she initially agreed to cooperate with the Legislature 's investigation , her campaign has called it " tainted " by partisan politics since she became Sen .
John McCain 's running mate and insisted that the state Personnel Board handle any inquiry .
Her aides have criticized the lawmaker overseeing the investigation , Democratic state Sen .
Hollis French , for a September 2 interview in which he suggested that the inquiry could yield an " October surprise " for the GOP .
Clarkson said French 's comments created " an appearance of bias " that violated the state constitution 's guarantee of due process .
French was in court Thursday but did not speak during the hearing .
Maassen told the judge that " the way to resolve legislative issues is by discussion and persuasion among legislators , " not by a lawsuit .
The investigation was originally supposed to be completed October 31 .
The deadline was moved up three weeks in response to complaints about French 's remarks to ABC News .

All About Sarah Palin • Alaska
Voters yesterday overwhelmingly approved a ballot initiative to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana , making getting caught with less than an ounce of pot punishable by a civil fine of $ 100 .
The change in the law means someone found carrying dozens of joints will no longer be reported to the state 's criminal history board .
With about 90 percent of the state 's precincts reporting last night , voters favored the Question 2 proposition 65 percent to 35 percent .
" The people were ahead of the politicians on this issue ; they recognize and want a more sensible approach to our marijuana policy , " said Whitney Taylor , chairwoman of the Committee for Sensible Marijuana Policy , which campaigned for the ballot initiative .
" They want to focus our limited law enforcement resources on serious and violent crimes .
They recognize under the new law that the punishment will fit the offense . "
The proposition will become law 30 days after it is reported to the Governor 's Council , which usually meets in late November or early December .
But the Legislature could amend or repeal the new law , as they have done with prior initiatives passed by the voters , said Emily LaGrassa , a spokeswoman for Attorney General Martha Coakley .
Opponents of the proposition said they are concerned about the potential consequences of the vote .
" The administration is clear in its opposition to the decriminalization of marijuana , and we are concerned about the effects of ballot Question 2's passage , " Kevin Burke , secretary of the state 's Executive Office of Public Safety and Security , said in a statement .
He would not comment on whether the administration will try to repeal the law , which will require violators younger than 18 to complete a drug awareness program and community service .
The fine would increase to as much as $ 1,000 for those who fail to complete the program .
Proponents of the initiative , who spent about $ 1 million promoting it , argued the change in the law would maintain the state 's existing penalties for growing , trafficking , or driving under the influence of marijuana , while ensuring that those caught with less than an ounce of pot would avoid the taint of a criminal record .
The opponents , who include the governor , attorney general , and district attorneys around the state , argued that decriminalizing marijuana possession would promote drug use and benefit drug dealers at a time when they say marijuana has become more potent .
They warned it would increase violence on the streets and safety hazards in the workplace , and cause the number of car crashes to rise as more youths drive under the influence .
In a statement , the Coalition for Safe Streets , which opposed the initiative , blamed the loss on being outspent by supporters of Question 2 , which included the billionaire financier George Soros , who spent more than $ 400,000 in favor of decriminalizing marijuana .
" Now these pro-drug special interests will move on to another state as part of their plan to inflict a radical drug- legalization agenda on as many communities as possible , " said the statement .
The Rev. Bruce Wall , pastor of Global Ministries Christian Church in Dorchester , was among several prominent black ministers in Boston who called on fellow clergy to oppose the initiative .
" I guess there are a lot of people smoking the stuff , and they do n't see what we see , " Wall said .
The initiative 's success last night sparked loud cheers from supporters gathered at the Silvertone Bar & Grill in downtown .
" I think this points to how our Legislature is unwilling to represent their constituents on these issues , " said Bill Downing , president of the Massachusetts Cannabis Reform Coalition .

WHAT ATTITUDE do Marxists take to elections and representative government ?
In the history of the socialist movement , there have developed or co-existed two principal and , in the end , quite different and opposing views of the question .
One , reformism , argues that modern representative government affords the working class the opportunity to achieve socialism by electing a socialist majority into office .
This view emphasizes the peaceful , gradual transition to socialism , and sees campaigns around elections and the work of socialist elected officials as the most important aspect of socialists ' activity .
The other trend , first outlined by Marx and Engels , and then elaborated by Rosa Luxemburg and Lenin , argues for a revolutionary overthrow of the state , based upon the mass struggle of the working class , and its replacement by new organs of workers ' power .
The reformist trend flourished in Germany in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , expressed most fully by a former collaborator of Engels , Eduard Bernstein , who wrote in his reformist bombshell Evolutionary Socialism ,
The task of social democracy is to organize the working classes politically and develop them as a democracy and to fight for all reforms in the State which are adapted to raise the working classes and transform the State in the direction of democracy . [ 1 ]
What else to read The International Socialist Review provides regular coverage of U.S. and world politics .
Paul D'Amato's " Marxists and Elections " appeared in the August - September 2000 issue of the ISR .
The recently published The Essential Rosa Luxemburg includes Reform or Revolution , a classic work on the question of socialists and elections .
Paul D'Amato's
The Meaning of Marxism is a lively and accessible introduction to the ideas of Karl Marx and the tradition he founded .
The best introduction to Marxism remains The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels .
Duncan Hallas '
The Comintern tells the history of the Communist International , created after the victory of the 1917 Russian Revolution , with the goal of assembling genuine revolutionary forces in every country .
But even Karl Kautsky , the foremost theoretical leader of the German Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) and a critic of Bernstein 's views , saw " the conquest of political power " as essentially the conquest of parliament .
He wrote , for example , in 1912 ,
The objective of our political struggle remains what it has always been up to now : the conquest of state power through the conquest of a majority in parliament and the elevation of parliament to a commanding position within the state .
Certainly not the destruction of state power . [ 2 ]
Kautsky considered mass action -- street protests and strikes -- to be abnormal methods of struggle , denouncing an emphasis on them as being " one- sided " and reflecting a " cretinism of mass action . " [ 3 ]
In the early socialist tradition , these two tendencies were often blurred by the fact that both reformists and revolutionaries used the term " conquest of political power " by the working class to describe two very different sets of aims .
Marx and Engels on the state , parliament and elections
Throughout their political lives , Marx and Engels always argued that the working class -- whatever its size and state of development -- must organize itself independently as a class " and consequently into a political party , " [ 4 ] as they wrote in the Communist Manifesto .
Just months later , during the revolutions of 1848 that swept across Europe , Marx and Engels , as leading members of a small group of socialists in the Communist League , participated in the revolution in Germany as the far left wing of the radical bourgeois - democratic movement .
With only a few hundred members across Europe , the League was simply not big enough to assert itself as an independent force .
But in the course of the revolution , it became clear to Marx that , due to the cowardly and tentative nature of the radical middle - class elements , it would be necessary for the working class to organize independently to safeguard its own class interests .
In his March 1850 " Address to the Communist League , " Marx recommended that in the future course of the revolution , the workers ' party " ' march with ' the petty - bourgeois democrats against the faction which it aims at overthrowing , " but that it oppose " them in everything whereby they seek to consolidate their position in their own interests . " [ 5 ]
In addition to arming themselves and organizing centralized and independent clubs , the workers ' party should put candidates up for elections in Germany in the event of the creation of a national assembly as a result of revolutionary upheaval :
Even when there is no prospect whatsoever of their being elected , the workers must put up their own candidates in order to preserve their independence , to count their forces , and to bring before the public their revolutionary attitude and party standpoint .
In this connection they must not allow themselves to be seduced by such arguments of the democrats as , for example , that by so doing they are splitting the democratic party and making it possible for the reactionaries to win .
The ultimate intention of all such phrases is to dupe the proletariat .
The advance which the proletarian party is bound to make by such independent action is indefinitely more important than the disadvantage that might be incurred by the presence of a few reactionaries in the representative body . [ 6 ]
The argument for voting against left - wing or socialist candidates on the grounds that they can't win and are therefore helping the right wing into power has , of course , been a time - worn argument in the U.S. against bucking the two - party system .
Engels , in an 1893 letter to an American colleague , pointed out that in the U.S. , the formation of a workers ' party is hindered by the " Constitution ... which makes it appear as though every vote were lost that is cast for a candidate not put up by one of the two governing parties . " [ 7 ]
Marx 's March circular was shelved after revolutionary upsurge ebbed .
But Marx and Engels lived to see the formation of the first mass socialist workers ' party in Germany that was able to use the German parliament , the Reichstag , to advance their cause .
The SPD in Germany was formed in 1875 out of a merger between two different parties -- one influenced by Marxism , the other based on " winning reforms through a compromise with the Prussian state . " [ 8 ]
But as much as they came to consider this their party , Marx and Engels were from the start critical of what they considered its political shortcomings and always fought any attempt to dilute its working - class character .
As early as 1879 , Marx and Engels wrote a circular letter to party leaders in which they asked if the party had not been " infected with the parliamentary diseases , believing that , with the popular vote , the Holy Ghost is poured upon those elected . " [ 9 ]
The circular letter also attacked an article written by , among others , Eduard Bernstein .
The article applauded the idea of a socialist movement led by " all men imbued with a true love of mankind , " and attacked those who " trivialized " the movement into a " one-sided struggle of the industrial workers to promote their own interests . "
The article called upon the party to be " calm , sober and considered " in order not to scare " the bourgeoisie out of their wits by holding up the red spectre . "
It also called for " educated " men to represent the party in the Reichstag . [ 10 ]
Marx and Engels attacked the authors , arguing that they should leave the party if they intended to " use their official position to combat the party 's proletarian character . " [ 11 ]
For Bernstein and the others :
The program is not to be relinquished , but merely postponed - - for some unspecified period .
They accept it -- not for themselves in their own lifetime but posthumously , as an heirloom for their children and for their children 's children .
Meanwhile they devote their " whole strength and energies " to all sorts of trifles , tinkering away at the capitalist social order so that at least something should appear to be done without at the same time alarming the bourgeoisie ...
For almost 40 years we have emphasized that the class struggle is the immediate motive force of history and , in particular , that the class struggle between bourgeoisie and proletariat is the great lever of modern social revolution ; hence we cannot possibly cooperate with men who seek to eliminate that class struggle from the movement .
At the founding of the International we expressly formulated the battle - cry :
The emancipation of the working class must be achieved by the working class itself .
Hence we cannot cooperate with men who say openly that the workers are too uneducated to emancipate themselves , and must first be emancipated from above by philanthropic members of the upper and lower middle classes . [ 12 ]
Engels lived long enough to witness the growing electoral votes of the German party .
In 1884 , the year after Marx 's death , the party got more than a half a million votes .
By 1890 , their vote doubled , doubled again in 1898 , and again by 1912 to more than four million votes .
The Anti-Socialist Laws , in effect between 1878 and 1891 and aimed at curbing socialist influence , actually enhanced social democracy 's reputation as the opposition party .
Engels was effusive over the party 's successes , seeing in parliamentary elections a brilliant means for the party to extend its political influence and membership .
In his 1895 introduction to Marx 's The Class Struggles in France , Engels summed up the significance of the use of the Reichstag elections by German social democracy :
If universal suffrage had offered no other advantage than that it allowed us to count our numbers every three years ; that by the regularly established , unexpectedly rapid rise in our vote it increased in equal measure the workers ' certainty of victory and the dismay of their opponents , and so became our best means of propaganda ; that it accurately informed us of our own strength and that of all opposing parties , and thereby provided us with a measure of proportion second to none for our actions , safeguarding us from untimely timidity as much as from untimely foolhardiness -- if this had been the only advantage we gained from the suffrage , it would still have been much more than enough .
But it did more than this by far .
In election propaganda it provided us with a means , second to none , of getting in touch with the mass of the people where they still stand aloof from us ; of forcing all parties to defend their views and actions against our attacks before all the people ; and , further , it provided our representatives in the Reichstag with a platform from which they could speak to their opponents in parliament , and to the masses outside , with quite a different authority and freedom than in the press or at meetings .
Of what avail was their Anti-Socialist Law to the government and the bourgeoisie when election campaigning and socialist speeches in the Reichstag continually broke through it ? [ 13 ]
But Engels could also see that electoral success was engendering a tendency for party leaders to jettison long - term goals for immediate gains .
The more or less smooth growth of electoral support from year to year , the expansion of the German economy , combined with many years where the class struggle remained at a low ebb , tended to reinforce reformist tendencies inside the party .
This was particularly true among the upper strata of trade union leaders , parliamentary representatives and party administrators , who saw in " precipitate " action the possibility of state repression that might jeopardize the organizations they had so painstakingly built .
The German party leadership , in their desire to bolster their own opportunism , censored Engel 's " Introduction " cited above , removing , for example , a paragraph that argued , in place of the old revolutionary tactics of street fighting around barricades , the need for " the open attack . " [ 14 ]
In his Critique of the Draft Program of 1891 , Engels criticizes the Erfurt program of the German SPD for thinking that in Germany the Reichstag -- which was , after all , a powerless body answerable to the Kaiser - - could be anything more than a fig leaf for Prussian absolutism .
Engels warns of the
opportunism , which is gaining ground in a large section of the Social - Democratic press .
Fearing a renewal of the Anti-Socialist Law , or recalling all manner of over - hasty pronouncements made during the reign of that law , they now want the party to find the present legal order in Germany adequate for putting through all party demands by peaceful means .
These are attempts to convince oneself and the party that " present - day society is developing towards socialism " without asking oneself whether it does not thereby just as necessarily outgrow the old social order and whether it will not have to burst this old shell by force , as a crab breaks its shell ...
This forgetting of the great , the principal considerations for the momentary interests of the day , this struggling and striving for the success of the moment regardless of later consequences , this sacrifice of the future of the movement for its present , may be ' honestly ' meant , but it is and remains opportunism , and ' honest ' opportunism is perhaps the most dangerous of all ! [ 15 ]
The two positions -- one that the shell of the old society must be burst by force ; the other , that the existing state can be taken over peacefully by gaining control of bourgeois representative institutions -- reflect different views of the state under capitalism .
The only change Marx and Engels made to the Communist Manifesto came after the Paris Commune of 1871 -- when for a brief moment the armed workers of Paris seized control of the city and formed their own institutions of direct democracy .
The Commune taught Marx that the working class cannot " lay hold of the ready - made state machinery , and wield it for its own purposes . " [ 16 ]
That is , a state designed to enforce the rule of the most economically powerful class cannot be simply taken over and used by workers to create a new , socialist society .
" From the very outset , " says Engels in his 1891 introduction to Marx 's Civil War in France ,
the Commune was compelled to recognize that the working class , once come to power , could not go on managing with the old state machine ; that in order not to lose again its only just conquered supremacy , the working class must , on the one hand , do away with all the old repressive machinery previously used against itself , and , on the other , safeguard itself against its own deputies and officials , by declaring them all , without exception , subject to recall at any moment . [ 17 ]
In his famous Origin of the Family , Private Property and the State , Engels argues that because the state is the state of the most powerful , economically dominant class , suffrage cannot be a tool to bring workers to power , but can only be a gauge of socialist influence inside the working class .
" The modern representative state , " Engels argues , " is an instrument for exploiting wage labor by capital . "
He continues :
The highest form of the state , the democratic republic , which in our modern social conditions becomes more and more an unavoidable necessity and is the form of state in which alone the last decisive battle between the proletariat and bourgeoisie can be fought out .
But while Engels argues that " in the measure in which [ the working class ] matures towards its self - emancipation ... it constitutes itself as its own party and votes for its own representatives , not those of the capitalists . "
He also argues that universal suffrage is not the key to working - class emancipation .
That will require a clash that votes cannot decide :
Universal suffrage is thus the gauge of the maturity of the working class .
It cannot and never will be anything more in the modern state , but that is enough .
On the day when the thermometer of universal suffrage shows boiling point among the workers , they as well as the capitalists will know where they stand . [ 18 ]
Engels on the United States
But what of countries , unlike Germany , where workers ' parties have not even been formed and the working - class movement is in its infancy ?
This was certainly the case in the U.S. in the last few decades of the nineteenth century , which witnessed a nationwide wave of struggle in which U.S. workers took the first steps to organize themselves economically and politically .
In his advice to socialists in the U.S. , Engels emphasized the importance of them supporting , and participating in , any movement of the working class that , whatever its limitations , would help it to develop its own independent political party .
In 1886 , the Central Labor Union in New York formed the Independent Labor Party of New York and Vicinity in order to participate in New York City 's mayoral race .
The new party chose single - tax advocate Henry George as its candidate .
George himself was not from the labor movement .
Indeed , he was a middle - class populist .
He had recently written a popular book , Progress and Poverty , which attacked poverty and inequality .
In it he advocated a single tax on landed property as a panacea to solve most of society 's ills .
In a hotly contested race in which the local ruling class pulled out all the stops to prevent a labor - party victory , George came in second in a three - way race with 31 percent of the vote .
Engels was positive about the election in spite of its shortcomings :
In a country that has newly entered the movement , the first really crucial step is the formation by the workers of an independent political party , no matter how , so long as it is distinguishable as a labor party .
And this step has been taken far sooner than we might have expected , and that 's the main thing .
That the first program of this party should still be muddle - headed and extremely inadequate , that it should have picked Henry George for its figurehead , are unavoidable if merely transitory evils .
The masses must have time and opportunity to evolve ; and they will not get that opportunity unless they have a movement of their own -- no matter what its form , providing it is their own movement -- in which they are impelled onwards by their own mistakes and learn by bitter experience . [ 19 ]
Engels reserved special criticism for the German socialists in the U.S. for counterposing their " pure " doctrine to the shortcomings of the American labor movement .
He argued that they should work inside organizations like the Knights of Labor - - the first truly mass labor organization in the U.S. that reached its height of popularity in the great labor upsurge of the mid-1880s -- in spite of the fact that its leader Terence Powderly , for example , opposed strikes .
The movement , he argued , " ought not to be pooh - poohed from without but to be revolutionized from within . " [ 20 ]
This was possible , Engels argued , without the socialists simply dissolving themselves in the movement .
I think all our practice has shown that it is possible to work along with the general movement of the working class at every one of its stages without giving up or hiding our own distinct position and even organization . [ 21 ]
Luxemburg and Lenin
Though Lenin was not aware of it until the outbreak of the First World War , the Bolshevik Party was being constructed on a fundamentally different basis than German social democracy .
Whereas the German party , as a party that aimed to represent the German working class , embraced all shades of politics in the movement , from reformist to revolutionary , Lenin fought to create a party independent from any reformist trend in the Russian socialist movement .
Lenin attributed the differences between Russia and Western European socialists to the conditions of illegality faced by socialists in Russia .
But in practice , the Bolsheviks were building not an organization of the whole working class , but only of its most advanced , revolutionary elements .
Hence Lenin engaged in unrelenting polemics against the reformist Mensheviks , who argued for a broad , legal party ( in conditions under which a legal party could be nothing but a reformist party ) , and who argued that Russian workers must not " frighten " the bourgeoisie .
More than that , he also argued that the revolutionary Bolsheviks should have their own , distinctly organized fraction , and , by 1912 , that they should be a separate party that excluded reformists from its ranks .
In Germany , Rosa Luxemburg was far more critical than Lenin of the opportunist character of the German party - - its ossification , bureaucratism and parliamentary " cretinism . "
The kind of parliamentarism we now have in France , Italy and Germany provide the soil for such illusions of current opportunism as overvaluation of social reforms , class and party collaboration , the hope of pacific development toward socialism , etc . [ 22 ]
Luxemburg could write clearly about the proper way in which revolutionaries should approach the state and the use of parliament :
In order to be effective , Social Democracy must take all the positions she can in the present State and invade everywhere .
However , the prerequisite for this is that these positions make it possible to wage the class struggle from them , the struggle against the bourgeoisie and its state . [ 23 ]
Luxemburg was clear that even if socialists were able to achieve a majority in parliament in a given country , this would not signal the victory of socialism .
The ruling class would rally around its most trusted state institutions -- the police , the army , the state bureaucracy and corrupted party politicians -- against parliament if necessary :
In this society , the representative institutions , democratic in form , are in content the instruments of the interests of the ruling class .
This manifests itself in a tangible fashion in the fact that as soon as democracy shows the tendency to negate its class character and become transformed into an instrument of the real interests of the population , the democratic forms are sacrificed by the bourgeoisie and by its state representatives . [ 24 ]
This is not some theoretical debating point , but has often been the bitter historical experience of the workers ' movement internationally .
In Chile , for example , Salvador Allende 's reformist socialist government was overturned in a bloody military coup in 1973 .
Moreover , in many countries , such as China , Saudi Arabia and many others , capitalism and the market go hand in hand with military , monarchic or one - party rule .
Democracy -- even bourgeois democracy -- is in some cases seen as a luxury that those who rule cannot afford .
Luxemburg belonged to a party the majority of whose leaders viewed the state and parliament along the same lines as Kautsky did .
They wanted to " take all positions " in " the present state " not as a means to destroy that state but as an end in itself .
Without a revolutionary party rather than the hodge - podge that was German social democracy , a revolutionary line in parliament could not be , and was not , carried out by the majority of delegates -- though Karl Liebknecht and a handful of other revolutionary delegates did play that role .
The Bolshevik Party was the first to utilize elections in a really revolutionary way .
The fact that the Bolsheviks organized independently of the reformists , the Mensheviks , [ 25 ] freed them to follow the course outlined by Luxemburg , to utilize the rostrum of parliament to conduct revolutionary propaganda and agitation .
Like Germany , Russia had not undergone a bourgeois revolution and was still under the heel of a semifeudal autocracy .
Revolutionaries were driven underground , forced to operate clandestinely in order to escape persecution , arrest , exile and even execution .
In the mass upheaval of the 1905 revolution , the Tsar issued a manifesto announcing the creation of a parliament ( Duma ) as a sop to the revolutionary movement .
This was not to be a real legislative body but a consultative council to the Tsar that the latter could dissolve at will .
Moreover , the Duma election system was weighted to give more representation to big landlords .
The Bolshevik Party advocated an " active " boycott of the first Duma .
But once the revolution began to ebb , Lenin changed his position and argued that socialists should participate in the Duma .
We were obliged to do -- and did-- everything in our power to prevent the convocation of a sham representative body .
That is so .
But since it has been convened in spite of all our efforts , we can not shirk the task of utilizing it . [ 26 ]
Lenin had to wage a determined fight against party members who argued that on principle Marxists should boycott the Duma .
He argued that under changed , nonrevolutionary conditions , the boycott was meaningless :
The boycott is a means of struggle aimed directly at overthrowing the old regime , or , at the worst , i.e. , when the assault is not strong enough for overthrow , at weakening it to such an extent that it would be unable to set up that institution , unable to make it operate .
Consequently , to be successful the boycott requires a direct struggle against the old regime , an uprising against it and mass disobedience to it in a large number of cases . [ 27 ]
Lenin therefore attacked the idea of a " passive " boycott -- that is , simply abstaining from elections or parliament , a refusal to " recognize " existing institutions even if the movement cannot destroy them .
He did not glorify the work , but said , " since the accursed counter - revolution has driven us into this accursed pig-sty , we shall work there too for the benefit of the revolution , without whining , but also without boasting . " [ 28 ]
Even so , Lenin was clear that revolutionaries considered participation in elections as only a small part of their activity , and that the struggle in the workplaces and streets was far more important .
We shall not refuse to go into the Second Duma when ( or " if " ) it is convened .
We shall not refuse to utilize this arena , but we shall not exaggerate its modest importance ; on the contrary , guided by the experience already provided by history , we shall entirely subordinate the struggle we wage in the Duma to another form of struggle , namely strikes , uprisings , etc . [ 29 ]
What did that work consist of ?
For party work , it meant using the election campaigns to conduct propaganda among masses it normally did or could not reach .
And , for the party members who were elected as deputies , it meant using the Duma as a platform to disseminate propaganda , to expose the right wing and the liberal bourgeoisie and to assist in the organization of struggles outside the Duma .
Socialist deputies could use their parliamentary immunity to conduct propaganda that outside the Duma would normally be considered illegal .
They could make Duma speeches that , reprinted in the party and non-party press , could reach a wider audience than other types of party propaganda , and they could use the Duma rostrum to expose , in the form of " interpolations , " the various abuses of the system against peasants and workers .
Unlike in the German SPD , where parliamentary representatives were the stars in the party crown , the Bolshevik Party subordinated their Duma deputies to party control and saw them as servants of the working - class struggle .
The basic approach taken by the Bolsheviks provided the backbone of the position on elections and parliament taken up in the Communist International in 1920 .
The Comintern
The Communist International ( Comintern ) was formed in 1919 on the initiative of the Bolshevik Party after it successfully seized power in Russia in 1917 .
Its aim was to reconstitute a new international of workers ' parties founded on revolutionary principles -- and practice -- that is , on leading the workers ' movement to seize state power . [ 30 ]
Its politics were based not only on the successful seizure of power by the Bolsheviks , but also on the betrayal of the German Revolution by the reformist SPD leaders , who helped organize the counterrevolutionary forces that murdered Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg in 1918 .
Lenin and the Bolsheviks , along with a handful of revolutionaries in other countries , set up the International with the aim of creating new , revolutionary , communist parties that would be independent of the reformist parties and capable of leading the mass upheavals of that period toward victory .
The First Congress in 1919 emphasized the need for socialists to replace parliaments with soviets , or workers ' councils -- to replace sham democracy with workers ' power .
The Comintern hammered away at the importance of building communist parties that could overthrow bourgeois democracy and replace it by workers ' democracy .
Throughout Europe , revolutionary movements were making these ideas not distant dreams but concrete possibilities .
But many militant young revolutionaries in the newly formed German Communist Party ( KPD ) -- impatient and eager for revolutionary change -- interpreted this to mean that revolutionaries should reject in principle all participation in parliaments .
" They were for workers councils and against parliaments , " writes Duncan Hallas .
Therefore , they must have nothing to do with any parliament .
To do so could only confuse the workers : " All reversion to parliamentary forms of struggle , which have become politically and historically obsolete , " a group of the boycottists wrote a little later , " and any policy of maneuvering and compromise must be emphatically rejected . "
Parliamentarism was certainly obsolete from the point of view of the few thousand members of the KPD and even , at that time , for a wider circle of working class militants , perhaps some hundreds of thousands .
But it was evidently not at all obsolete from the point of view of the millions of workers who voted for the SPD . [ 31 ]
At the Second Congress of the Comintern , held in 1920 , Lenin had to carry on a fight against these " ultralefts " in Germany and elsewhere .
It was one thing , argued Lenin , to recognize that parliaments were historically outmoded and another to be powerful enough to defeat them in practice .
Parliamentarism has become " historically obsolete . "
That is true as regards propaganda .
But everyone knows that this is still a long way from overcoming it practically .
Capitalism could have been declared , and quite rightly , to be " historically obsolete " many decades ago , but that does not at all remove the need for a very long and very persistent struggle on the soil of capitalism ....
Participation in parliamentary elections and in the struggle on the platform of parliament is obligatory for the party of the revolutionary proletariat ...
As long as you are unable to disperse the bourgeois parliament and every other type of reactionary institution , you must work inside them , precisely because there you will still find workers who are stupefied by the priests and by the dreariness of rural life ; otherwise you risk becoming mere babblers . [ 32 ]
In the Comintern floor debates on parliament , Lenin 's main adversary was the Italian delegate Bordiga , who argued that " the tactical experience of the Russian revolution cannot be transported to other countries where bourgeois democracy has functioned for many years . " [ 33 ]
Any participation in parliament , according to Bordiga , contained the " twofold danger " of assigning too much importance to elections and wasting valuable party time that could be spent on mass work .
In effect , Bordiga was arguing that the parliamentary cretinism of the pre-war Socialist parties was the only possible experience that socialists could have in the electoral arena -- even revolutionary socialists .
" You say that parliament is an instrument with the aid of which the bourgeoisie deceives the masses , " Lenin answered Bordiga ,
but this argument should be turned against you , and it does turn against your thesis .
How will you reveal the true character of parliament to the really backward masses , who are deceived by the bourgeoisie ?
How will you expose the various parliamentary maneuvers or the positions of the various political parties if you are not in parliament , if you remain outside parliament ?...
If you say , " fellow workers , we are so weak that we cannot form a party disciplined enough to compel its members of parliament to submit to it , " the workers will abandon you , for they will ask themselves , " How can we set up a dictatorship of the proletariat with such weaklings ? " [ 34 ]
To the smaller and still - divided revolutionary movement in Britain , Lenin advanced a somewhat different argument .
The Labour Party , which drew its support from the trade unions , was as thoroughly reformist as the SPD in Germany -- Lenin in fact called it a " bourgeois workers party . "
He encouraged various revolutionary groups in Britain to unite into a single communist party , but he also urged them to affiliate with the Labour Party and , according to Hallas , " carry on the fight for revolutionary politics inside its ranks . " [ 35 ]
Lenin argued that in order to move beyond the reformism of the Labour Party , workers would have to experience the Labour Party in power .
Revolutionaries , therefore , needed to stand alongside the majority of workers who looked to Labour as " their " party and give Labour critical support in elections , and in this way win workers to communist politics .
( Lenin hastened to add that the Communists should only work inside the Labour Party if they were given full freedom to operate as an independent organization with its own publications . ) [ 36 ]
The fact that the majority of workers in Great Britain still follow the lead of the British Kerenskys or Scheidemanns and that they have not yet had the experience of a government composed of these people ... undoubtedly shows that the British Communists should participate in parliamentary action , that they should from within Parliament help the masses of workers to see the results of a Henderson and Snowden government in practice , that they should help the Hendersons and Snowdens to defeat Lloyd George and Churchill combined .
To act otherwise would mean placing difficulties in the way of the revolution ; for revolution is impossible without a change in the views of the majority of the working class , and this change is brought about by the political experience of the masses , and never by propaganda alone . [ 37 ]
The Comintern 's " Thesis on the Communist Parties and Parliament , " drafted by Leon Trotsky , summing up decades of experience of revolutionary socialists in Russia and elsewhere , outlined the approach taken in general by revolutionaries to the question of parliament and elections :
Communism rejects parliamentarism as a form of the future society ...
It rejects the possibility of taking over parliament on a permanent basis ; its goal is to destroy parliamentarism .
Therefore it is possible to speak only of using bourgeois state institutions for the purpose of destroying them .
The question can be posed in this sense and in this sense alone .
The Proletariat 's most important method of struggle against the bourgeoisie , that is , against the bourgeoisie 's state power , is first and foremost mass action .
The activity in parliament consists primarily of revolutionary agitation from the parliamentary rostrum , unmasking opponents , and ideological unification of the masses , who , particularly in areas that lag behind , are still prejudiced by democratic illusions and look to the parliamentary rostrum .
This work must be completely subordinate to the goals and tasks of the mass struggle outside parliament . [ 38 ]
Revolutionaries in the U.S. and elections
Rosa Luxemburg pointed out in her famous debate with Bernstein ,
People who pronounce themselves in favor of the method of legislative reform in place of and in contradistinction to the conquest of political power and social revolution , do not really choose a more tranquil , calmer and slower road to the same goal , but a different goal .
Instead of taking a stand for the establishment of a new society they take a stand for surface modification of the old society . [ 39 ]
Reformism in modern times has degenerated to an even lower point than that set by Bernstein .
Many European social democratic parties who formerly espoused the classic reformist view -- so brilliantly skewered by Luxemburg - - now argue , in today 's " globalized " economy and since the collapse of Stalinism , that socialism is no longer possible .
The best we can do is tinker with the system to make it more humane .
Though this has always been the real practice of reformism , it now openly proclaims socialism as an impossible goal .
As Luxemburg points out , the debate is not about whether socialists are for reforms or whether socialists should turn their backs on the electoral system .
As socialists we fight for all reforms that improve the conditions of life for workers under capitalism and give workers the confidence to fight for more .
But any real fight for reforms requires struggle to achieve them .
Reformists tell workers to sit passively and rely on elected officials .
By doing so , they weaken and demobilize the class struggle that makes real reform possible and prepares workers consciously , organizationally and politically to overturn capitalism .
The U.S. has historically been dominated by a bourgeois , two - party system to the exclusion of a third party -- let alone labor or social - democratic -- alternative .
Moreover , organized , revolutionary socialist organization is still far too small to even consider running its own candidates .
More often than not , socialists have found themselves -- when not sucked into the maelstrom of the Democratic Party -- placed in the role of arguing what is essentially a negative position : socialists should have nothing to do with the two capitalist parties .
This has often meant , out of sheer necessity , an argument that those who are looking for real change should sit out the presidential election .
But as Engels ' writings on the U.S. in the 1880s show , there have been moments when working - class , third - party alternatives have , if only for a time , been on offer .
In those cases socialists could call for at least a protest , class vote against the two major bourgeois parties , in the hope of cracking the two - party system and creating an opening for independent , working - class politics .
Whatever the tasks that lay ahead , when dealing with the question of elections in the U.S. , socialists must remember Lenin 's concluding remarks in Left - Wing Communism :
It is far more difficult -- and far more useful -- to be a revolutionary when the conditions for direct , open , really mass and really revolutionary struggle do not yet exist , to defend the interests of the revolution ( by propaganda , agitation and organization ) in non-revolutionary bodies and even in downright reactionary bodies , in non-revolutionary circumstances , among the masses who are incapable of immediately appreciating the need for revolutionary methods of action .
The main task of contemporary Communism in Western Europe and America is to learn to seek , to find , to correctly determine the specific path or the particular turn of events that will bring the masses right up against the real , last , decisive , and great revolutionary struggle . [ 40 ]

Here is the omitted paragraph : " Does that mean that in the future street fighting will no longer play any role ?
Certainly not .
It only means that the conditions since 1848 have become far more unfavorable for civilian fighters and far more favorable to the military .
In future , street fighting can , therefore , be victorious only if this disadvantageous situation is compensated by other factors .
Accordingly , it will occur more seldom at the beginning of a great revolution than at its later stages , and will have to be undertaken with greater forces .
These , however , may then well prefer , as in the whole great French Revolution or on September 4 and October 31 , 1870 , in Paris , the open attack to passive tactics . "

Marx and Engels did make some pronouncements that seem to say that socialism could be achieved peacefully through gaining a majority in parliament .
But it was always qualified , as in this passage in Engels ' preface to the first English edition of Capital : " [ A ]t least in Europe , England is the only country where the inevitable social revolution might be effected entirely by peaceful and legal means . "
He certainly never forgot to add that he hardly expected the English ruling class to submit , without a ' pro- slavery rebellion , ' to this peaceful and legal revolution .

The death knell of the previous International , the Second , which was dominated by the German party , was sounded when the SPD Reichstag deputies voted in favor of war credits for the German state , indicating their support for the German war machine .
Only one SPD deputy , Karl Leibknecht , voted against war credits , and then only six months after the first vote .
Though previous conferences had passed resolutions calling for socialists of their respective countries to unite across borders and resist war by all means , and in the event of an outbreak of war , to arouse mass struggle against it in their respective countries , all of the major Social Democratic parties capitulated to their own ruling classes and became patriotic supporters of the war .

Read it for yourself .
You ca n’t make this shyt up .
From Ben Smith at Politico – he got an email from a ReThug Consultant who said those “ Obama As Terrorist ” ads being run in the heartland did their job a lil’ too well .
Hat tip to John Aravosis at Americablog as well :
Reagan Dems and Independents .
Call them blue - collar plus .
Slightly more Target than Walmart .
Yes , the spot worked .
Yes , they believed the charges against Obama .
Yes , they actually think he ’s too liberal , consorts with bad people and WON ’T BE A GOOD PRESIDENT … but they STILL do n’t give a f***.
They said right out , “ He wo n’t do anything better than McCain ” but they ’re STILL voting for Obama .
The two most unreal moments of my professional life of watching focus groups : 54 year - old white male , voted Kerry ’ 04 , Bush ’00 , Dole ’ 96 , hunter , NASCAR fan …hard for Obama said : “ I ’m gonna hate him the minute I vote for him .
He ’s gonna be a bad president .
But I wo n’t ever vote for another god -damn Republican .
I want the government to take over all of Wall Street and bankers and the car companies and Wal - Mart run this county like we used to when Reagan was President . ”
The next was a woman , late 50s , Democrat but strongly pro-life .
Loved B. and H. Clinton , loved Bush in 2000 .
“ Well , I do n’t know much about this terrorist group Barack used to be in with that Weather guy but I ’m sick of paying for health insurance at work and that ’s why I ’m supporting Barack . ”
Wow .
Although they believe the ads , these individuals are refusing to vote on idealogical basis , or so they say .
They admit they do n’t like Obama … but plan to vote for him , anyway .
Color me skeptical on this one , but I ’ll believe it when I see it .
How many times people lie to pollsters about who they voted for ?
There are African - Americans who know damned well they voted for Bush , both times , simply because he was a “ Christian ” and now refuse to take responsibility for the eff - up that is the Federal Government ; the Wall Street Collapse , and everything else .
They refuse to own up to voting for the fool .
Do n’t believe me , ask them who they voted for back in 2004 .
If they do n’t come back with “ I voted for Kerry ” in a direct manner , or even “ I voted for the Green Party Candidate ” – you have your answer .
And that ’s one reason why I do n’t trust polls .
People say one thing and do something else .
So forgive me if I do n’t break out into the happy dance until January 20 , 2009 , when I see Obama standing on Pennsylvania Avenue , with Sasha and Malia standing next to him , and Michelle holding the Bible , and I hear these words coming out of his mouth :
“ I , Barack Hussein Obama , do solemnly swear , that I will faithfully uphold , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States , so help me God … ”
Fonts are like candies : you can never get enough of them .
So if you are getting tired of the fonts that come with your system , here is a hand - picked collection of a few open source fonts that deserve a closer look .
The Liberation fonts are designed as drop - in replacements for the widely - used proprietary fonts like Times New Roman , Arial , Helvetica , Courier New , etc .
The Liberation font pack consists of three sets : Sans ( a substitute for Arial , Albany , and Helvetica ) , Serif ( a substitute for Times New Roman ) and Mono ( a substitute for Courier New , Cumberland , and Courier ) .
The SIL organization offers an impressive collection of fonts released under the Open Font License .
Here you will find fonts designed for specific purposes ( e.g. , the Antika font is designed especially for literacy education ) and specific languages ( e.g. , Arabic Script Unicode fonts ) as well as all - around high - quality fonts like Gentium and Charis .
If you need a serif font that looks every bit as good as Times New Roman , try the Linux Libertine font family .
It comes in the regular , italic , bold , bold italic , and small caps styles .
The MgOpen typeface collection offers four font families : MgOpenCanonica ( similar to Times Roman ) , MgOpenCosmetica ( similar to Optima ) , MgOpenModata , and MgOpenModerna ( similar to Helvetica ) .
Each font contains four styles : regular , italic , bold , and bold italic .
Arev is a nice sans serif font which can come in handy when you work with languages based on non-Latin alphabets .
Since the font provides extensive support for diacritical signs , it ’s also suitable for use with “ diacritic - heavy ” languages like Vietnamese .
The Droid font family designed by Ascender for Google ’s Android platform consists of the Droid Sans , Droid Sans Mono and Droid Serif fonts .
Each font provides support for Western European , Eastern / Central European , Baltic , Cyrillic , Greek , and Turkish languages .
While the Droid fonts are released under the Apache license , neither Google nor Ascender offers a downloadable version of the fonts .
But , with a little perseverance , you can get the font working on your system .
Download the system .
tar.gz archive , unpack it , and you will find the Droid font in the fonts directory .
Finally , if you want to spice up your documents with a pinch of handwritten text , then take a look at the Rufscript font .

Another pirate girl that loves supporting the ARRRts .
I 've actually lost count of reasons why downloading music is good .
But I 'll list a few main ones which I 'd be interested in hearing your counterpoint , keep in mind that I 'm speaking in terms of the type of music I listen to since I do n't listen to much on the radio but more near " independent " type bands : #1
The music is free anyways .
Go to your favourite indie artist site or myspace : Arcade Fire , Magneta Lane ,
The Lovely Feathers and you 'll either see a song list to download , or a band radio to listen to .
I fail to see why I should inconvenience myself to have to listen to it through a browser when I can easily do it through another software .
Almost 95 % of my downloads come from the band 's own website or myspace .
#2
If you refuse to listen to artists who condemn downloading then that leaves you with artists who realize the benefits of downloading .
This means , I have even more reason not to listen Metallica and even more reason to support Radiohead , System of a Down and the Arctic Monkeys who 've publicly supported either a donation or download system .
#3
It makes the artists more money b/c it brings people like me out to the concert .
Do you really think I 'd be as willing to go smaller bands like the Mountain Goats if I did n't have a chance to download their tracks and give it a few listens to get into it ?
Buying a CD would just add an extra $ 15 to my concert ticket , and would be too risky since I may not like it .. so I would n't do it .
In the case of the Mountain Goats , instead of making no money from the CD I would never have bought from the Mountain Goats , they 'll make the $ 10 from when I go see them .
On top of this , it saves me money to use it more wisely on good music ... before Bedouin Soundclash got popular on the radio I was about to buy a ticket for $ 10 to give them a listen , luckily I downloaded their music and decided to re-invest the cash into a $ 40 Bright Eyes ticket who sounded better .
#5
Ever since I started downloading rather than listening I 've been spending MORE money on music than ever before .
I 've calculated it and realized that the amount spent was so significantly greater that there 's no way someone can tell me otherwise .
Look , I bought 10 CDs while at school and a few others but did n't like enough of the modern mainstream bands to bother going to concerts ( I still do n't like them ) .
That 's about $ 200 over the span of 8 years =$ 25 a year before I started downloading .
In the last 3 years I spent more than $ 200 at a rate of something like $ 60 / year because I 've had a chance to explore so many great bands that do n't regularly make it onto the radio like A Northern Chorus or Bright Eyes .
#6 CD lovers should stay CD lovers , and concert lovers should simply be more encouraged to more concerts by downloading .
#7
The technology is awful .
I do n't use CDs .
My laptop and my PDA are my sources and I use the .mp3 not .wav format .
But alot of the music you download from Amazon and iTunes is DRM locked .
When it 's locked I can't move the music around when new technology comes along that plays mp3s .
So I never actually fully - own the songs unless I pirate them .... which takes me to # 8 ...#8
I 'm too picky with what software I use to bother waiting for major labels that have little to do with a lot of the bands I listen to , to invent a solution .
If I want to use Amarok instead of iTunes , then I should use it now .
Why does Universal Records , a major label , have a say in what software I use in downloading when I rather listen to a more independent label like CreekWater records anyway ?
If Universal wants to stop my access to artists like " Lil Wayne " and " Ja Rule " then good !
In fact , please stop my access from hearing their names on ANY media form and do us all a favour !
And in this hypothetical scenario , if that means I 'll lose access to a good artist like Erykah Baduh ... well that 's her fault for signing , not mine .
Besides , if that really became the case then I 'd just have to log into Universal 's own website to hear the music give out for free on their site but protect from anyone else .

After voicing my " vote flipping " concerns , David M. Farrell , Deputy Assistant Secretary of State and Director of Elections Office of the Ohio Secretary of State , reassured me that my county of residence , Cuyahoga County , does not use ES&S Ivotronic voting machines .
Instead , Cuyahoga County uses ES&S Model 100 optical scan voting machines .
I then asked Mr. Farrell , " Has the software that operates the ES&S Model 100 optical scan voting machines been examined or would this violate proprietary agreements ? "
I 'm still waiting for a reply .
( The difference between an ES&S Ivotronic voting machine and an ES&S Model 100 optical scan voting machine is the nomenclature . )

We can't stop with Connell .
Tabulators rerouting thru GWB43.COM is just the tip of the story .
Triadd needs to be subpeonaed as well , and they need to explain WHY 9 county tabulator hard drives were swapped out on the day after elections .
Fudging the numbers presented on a public web site the night of the election is not enough for a very public process , you would also need to ensure that the underlying data used to generate those numbers " squares " with the data that was presented to the public .
Those underlying numbers live on the county GEMS tabulators .
Swapping hard drives " AFTER THE FACT " allows the underlying numbers to be fudged in such a way as to meet the relative data presented to the public .
It 's not much of a stretch , to me , to seek a subpeona for any and all communications between SMARTECH and TRIADD ( The Rapp family owned elections technology contractors for a big chunk of the state of Ohio ) .
You can't just present false data .
That data would need to be able to pass at least 1 or 2 layers of scrutiny .
Swapping the hard drives of select GEMS tabulators " after the fact " allows for this layer of " credibility " .

Oh , it was a learning experience : Hans Zipfel , government teacher at Defiance High School , prefaced the rally with prompts of what the students were to look for while there .
" That included Secret Service agents , security measures , crowd reaction to the speakers and their comments , participant 's reaction to the crowded environment itself , participant 's reaction to the security measures taken , etc. , " said Zipfel .
" Also , we informed them of what potentially transpires in other less democratic countries where people amass politically , " he explained .
" Assemblies such as the one the students were a part of would be dispersed with rocks , gas , clubs , or strafed bullets if it was antithetical to the powers - that - be .
We wanted to express how truly blessed we are to live in this country with the freedoms our predecessors provided and that we strive to maintain .
We especially focused on the First Amendment 's free speech clause and the right to peaceably assemble .
We then will discuss all these various components of the event when we reconvene on Friday . "

Odds are , since Rove is no IT expert , they hatched the plot together .
Connell should go to jail as well .
Giving him complete immunity , rather than sentencing consideration , is going too far .
If anyone could fake an email " threat " it would be Connell .
I seriously wonder if Rove would dare threaten Connell knowing what Connell has on him .
At this point Rove would be desperately trying to make nice , and offering Connell as much of the Republican coffers as he( Rove ) could get his hands on .
Connell is a deranged fundie fanatic from whom society needs to be protected ( reading between the lines of Spoonamore 's remarks about him ) .

A couple extra thoughts :
Why did Ohio ( Blackwell ) find it necessary to contract for those services out of state ?
Was there NO company in Ohio or in the state government structure that could set up the site for the elections ?
Is it THAT hard and specialized to do ?
I know what the answer appears to be but how did Blackwell justify spending state money out of state , for starters ?
SMARTECH and TRIADD -
Where are the records for the bidding process on their services ?
WAS there any bidding process at all ?
Or was this another " no bid " contract ?
Dan -in - PA , Post # 14 , has it exactly right .
The threads of this have to be examined , all of them .
I read the Raw story on this and while I have a lot of respect for David Dill , and he has a good point , I would not assume that every election officer would check and recheck that the " echo " coming back from the state totals reflects what was sent ; or the potential if the connection existed , to " fudge " the tabulator totals at the source ; to what had been stated that some officials seem to have been instructed to make the results " fit , " much like polls are manipulated to fit the results when they do n't agree .
It would n't have had to been state wide .

Especially this part : I believed on election night 2004 , due to my long expertise and work in computer attacks on Banking , Government and Communication systems reversed the outcome of the 2004 Ohio Presidential Race was subjected to a KingPin attack reversing Kerry votes and making them Bush Votes .
All information that has come forth since then has further confirmed this belief , and the actions of some parties , notably Triad in removing Hard Drives which would have shown these actions and the refusal of Mr. Connell to testify about what he knows about the SmartTech KingPin set up , further confirm my professional opinion .

Ancient !~ # 23 : Your comment fascinates !
You triggered my own very detailed memory of this event ( deeply buried under 4 years of drink and pain ) , so I googled " Karl Rove " + " bat cave " + " 2004 " and your ( our ) memory is perfectly preserved , complete with picture - perfect happy Bushes , from this Washington Post article , dated November 3 , 2004 ...
http://www.nytimes.com/2...mpaign/03bush.html?fta=y ... " Karl Rove , the president 's chief political adviser , had been so concerned about the polls that he spent part of his afternoon sending e-mail messages to influential Republicans , telling them to disregard the polls , which he said were not an accurate barometer .
Mr. Rove noted that those polls were wrong in 2000 , when they had Al Gore beating Mr. Bush by three or four percentage points .
By shortly after 9:30 p.m. , the president had a small group of reporters and photographers up to record what appeared to be a relaxed family tableau .
" Why do n't you all take the rest of the night off , " Mr. Bush told reporters .
He said : " We 're very upbeat , thank you .
I believe I will win . "
While Mr. Bush entertained some 30 family members and friends at a buffet dinner upstairs in the residence , Mr. Rove was downstairs in what he jokingly described as his " bat cave , " a temporary office set up in the old family dining room on the state floor of the White House to monitor returns .
He had links there to Bush campaign headquarters in Arlington , Va. , and the offices of the Republican National Committee on Capitol Hill ... "
The whole article is a freaky - deaky read with four years hindsight ; with all the ' what we know now ' vs. ' what we suspected then ' info layered on top of the turd eclair like a criminal cherry .
Thanks , Ancient !

" ... Spoonamore is ... currently supporting McCain ... Can we trust Spoonie ? "
There are some honest Republicans who actually care about the future of that party , perhaps he is one .
As for Blackwell having to go to Tennessee for IT support ; that may have as much to do with rewarding a party member who is high up in the chain as it does with any shennanigans , although I 'm certainly not ruling out any illegalities .

My understanding is that Spoonamore USED to support McCain or maybe work for his campaign but quit it some time ago .
Have n't seen anything about him going back .
Listening to him talk about the kind of Republican he is ( on one of those videos posted at Velvet Revolution ) I 'd be surprised if he was supporting the current incarnation of McCain .
And the integrity of the vote seems to be his primary concern whomever he 's supporting any particular moment .

" We 're winning Ohio , " Mr. Rove relied .
" And we will win Ohio . "

McCain Guarantees Victory – June 30th , 2008 June 30 , 2008 - [ McCain ] tells voters in an afternoon Pickersville , Pennsylvania town hall that the state will pick the winner in November --- and he will be behind until right before the polls close .
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Politico McCain Guarantees Victory – October 26th , 2008 10/26/08 - Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) said Sunday on NBC ’s “ Meet the Press ” that he can “ guarantee ” a win on Nov. 4 in a squeaker victory that wo n’t be clear until late that night .
“ I guarantee you that two weeks from now , you will see this has been a very close race , and I believe that I 'm going to win it , ” McCain told interim " Meet " moderator Tom Brokaw .
“ We 're going to do well in this campaign , my friend .
We 're going to win it , and it 's going to be tight , and we 're going to be up late . ”
Remember :
Don Siegelman - Republican Bob Riley edges out a narrow victory over incumbent Democrat Don Siegelman , in a MIDNIGHT VOTE RECOUNT in Baldwin County , Alabama .
Remember 2004 :
Walden O'Dell the CEO of Diebold said he is " ... committed to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes to " [ bush . ] [ 2004 ]

And we 'll take care of the counting . "

By most accounts , this one included , McCain 's beliefs are pretty out there .
I 'm telling myself that if they really do steal it , or already have , whutever , there can't help but be oceans of evidence the public will not be induced to overlook this time .
I 'd say the real likelihood is they will let Obama have his landslide and that will take all the wind out of the election integrity movement 's sails .
Really , he is n't going to be that much harder to control , the McCain / Palin ticket has to be too absurd even for them , and there 's so much to be gained while letting Obama try to put our house back in order .
I do n't discount that the sociopaths would do anything , but why in the fuck would Fudd endorse him if he wanted him to win .

Oh , and the Repubs PAID their " poll monitors " , whereas we Dems just volunteered .
I do n't object to doing the service , the problem was he fought like hell in court to have Repubs in the polls to try to commit even more suppression .

From Mark Crispin Miller on today 's Democracy Now !
There ’s a lot of things people can do and must do on Election Day to keep this thing from being stolen .
They ’ve got to make sure they ’re registered .
They have to know the hotlines : 1-866-OUR-VOTE and 1-866-MY - VOTE - 1 . If anything happens to you on Election Day , if you ’re told you ’re not registered when you know you are , when people tell you that , you know — when the machine flips your vote , for example , when you ’re intimidated , if there ’s a police presence at the polls , if you get disinformation telling you your election day is the next day , anything at all happens , let somebody know .
Call those numbers .
If there are people from the media there , tell them .
If there are Election Protection people there , tell them .
But make sure the story gets out , because this is the kind of evidence that has to be gathered and preserved , because on election night , sure as shooting , on the networks they ’ll all say , “ Well , things went really well today .
There were nowhere near as many problems as we thought there were . ”
But finally , and most important , in the event something untoward happens and John McCain is right and he wins late at night on Election Day , as he recently said he ’s going to do , any kind of an upset like that , people should be prepared to attend voter assemblies .
This is something that ’s being run by Liberty Tree as part of their pledge for No More Stolen Elections !
The website is [ libertytreefdr dot org ] .
The aim here is to organize voter assemblies so that on November 5th people will turn out , nonviolently , convene , discuss what ’s going on and press for the proper kinds of investigations .

I THINK THIS IS MISDIRECTION BY SPOONAMORE .
HE ADMITS TO BEING CONNELL'S FRIEND .
WHY SHOULD WE TRUST HIM ?
THE RIGGING IS INSIDE THE MACHINES THEMSELVES .
IT 'S ALREADY BEEN PROVEN WITH THE HACKS BY HURSTI AND OTHERS .
WHY IS THIS INVESTIGATION FOCUSED ON THE TABULATORS AND THE SERVERS ?

Just got home from calling & canvassing in northern Ohio .
Word is that NE Ohio numbers are bad ; would not be suprised if OH goes red once again .
RE : Spoonamore & Connell ; why could it not be that both ends of the system are polluted ?
I believe there is evidence that this is the case .
After all , the approach has always appeared to be to target many avenues to Democratic votes , from purging to unreasonable barriers to register to ACORN attacks to hacking .
God I 'm mad at Ohio .

Ninth Circuit Rejects Challenge to UC Evolution Website
By SHERRI M. OKAMOTO , Staff Writer
A plaintiff lacked standing to pursue an establishment clause claim based on a University of California websites treatment of religious and anti-religious views on evolution , the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held Friday .
Affirming the district judges dismissal of Jeanne Caldwells complaint , the appellate court ruled that Caldwells asserted interest in being informed about how teachers teach the theory of evolution and general disagreement with how the website addressed the subject did not constitute a cognizable constitutional injury .
Caldwell alleged that she was the parent of children enrolled in public schools , and that she was actively involved in elections and debates about the selection of instructional materials for the schools science classes .
In order to participate as an informed citizen in these election and debates , she claimed that she regularly made use of a website called  Understanding Evolution ,  which was developed and administered by the University of Californias Museum of Paleontology and the Integrative Biology Department at UC Berkeley , and funded in part by a grant from the National Science Foundation .
Her complaint focused on a section of the website entitled  Misconception :  Evolution and Religion are Incompatible ,  which linked to a National Center for Science Education web page containing statements by many religious organizations in support of the position that the theory of evolution did not conflict with properly understood Christian religious beliefs .
She argued that the website sought to proselytize public school students and the public to adopt these viewpoints , and that she was offended by the governments endorsement of religions and religious denominations when she visited the website .
Caldwell requested an injunction restraining publication of the website and a judgment declaring that inclusion of the religious and anti-religious materials in the Understanding Evolution website was unconstitutional .
U.S. District Judge Phyllis J. Hamilton of the Northern District of California found that Caldwells allegations were generalized grievances and dismissed the complaint on the ground that Caldwell had not shown injury in fact .
Writing for the appellate court , Judge Pamela Ann Rymer explained that Caldwells asserted interest in being able to have informed participation in public discourse was one we hold in common as citizens in a democracy . 
Rymer categorized Caldwells claim as no more than an abstract objection to the websites presentation of the ongoing debate over whether science and religion can coexist .
The jurist differentiated Caldwells situation from that in School District of Abington v. Schempp , ( 1963 ) 374 U.S. 203  which conferred standing on the parents of public school children who were directly exposed to unwelcome religious exercises in the classroom  by a state law mandating the reading of the bible in schools reasoning that the plaintiffs in Schempp had been directly affected by the laws and practices of which they complained .
In comparison with Schempp , Rymer concluded there was simply too slight a connection between Caldwells generalized grievance and the government conduct about which she complain[ed ] to sustain her standing to proceed . 
Senior U.S. District Judge Kevin Thomas Duffy of the Southern District of New York , sitting by designation joined Rymer in her opinion , and Senior Judge Betty B. Fletcher wrote a separate concurrence .
Like Rymer , Fletcher also noted that Caldwell did not allege she or her children were directly affected by the websites content in the same manner as the plaintiffs in Schempp , and distinguished Caldwells situation from Vasquez v. Los Angeles County , ( 2007 ) 487 F.3d 1246  which conferred standing on a plaintiff who had daily unwelcome contact with an allegedly anti-religious county seal because Caldwell had not alleged she had visited the offending website more than once .
Fletcher also distinguished Buono v. Norton , ( 2004 ) 371 F.3d 543  which held that a plaintiff who was unable to freely use land in a national park because of the presence of a religious symbol had standing because the offending material did nor prevent Caldwell from using the remainder of the website .
Although Fletcher suggested that the inability to access a government - run website due to allegedly unconstitutional content could possibly confer standing in some future situation , she concluded Caldwells injury was too de minimis .
The case is Caldwell v. Caldwell , 06-15771 .

As the 2008 presidential campaign neared its final week , Democrat hopeful Barack Obama breezed through Las Vegas to give a speech at Bonanza High School .
( See photo above . )
It was the usual ready - for - change - we - need stump speech , one he'd given dozens of times before and he probably hardly needed the text for reference .
And the crowd was enthusiastic and eager , as usual .
At the end of the speech , the candidate , who would go on to be elected the 44th president of the United States , left the podium to greet supporters nearby .
Someone identifying himself or herself as " a volunteer staff member " very thoughtfully " retrieved " the speech binder .
And is now kindly offering the packet for sale on EBay .
Starting price : $ 2,500 .
Deadline : Nov. 25 .
Bids : 0 .
The unidentified seller calls the item " Rare Sen. Obama authored speech , " which may be what Mark Twain would call " a stretcher . "
Obama is said to have written last winter 's seminal speech on race by himself , but most of the others are authored by staff and " given " by the candidate .
And , in fact , the Democratic candidate gave the same speech the same day in Reno , presumably with another binder .
Because of the seller 's professed fear of copying , the text 's individual pages , encased in plastic covers , are not shown up close .
( See photo . )
But the seller suggests the plastic covers do contain the now president - elect 's fingerprints , something that might also interest the Secret Service .
Oh , and shipping would be an extra $ 25 .

Coming on Friday , November 14th , is the 22nd James Bond installment , Quantum of Solace .
One of many Bond traditions is selecting the part of the leading lady or ‘ Bond girl ’ of the next film .
This time the producers granted that honor to Olga Kurylenko , a model turned actress .
Let ’s take a little time to get to know her .
The green - eyed star was born in the former Soviet Union in Berdyansk , Ukraine on November 14 , 1979 .
She ’ll be celebrating her 29th birthday when the movie premieres here in the United States .
Happy Birthday Olga !
At age sixteen she moved to Paris to further her career as a model , and would quickly appear on the cover of magazines like Vogue and Elle .
In 2005 , she made the move into films .
Before her Bond role , she was most recognized for her roles in the action thrillers Hitman and Max Payne .
Here are some photos to help you get better acquainted with Ms. Kurylenko :

I think I want a Power House and a Wind Power kit for myself !
New accusations have emerged during the appeal of the bribery conviction of former Gov. Don Siegelman of Alabama that could buttress Democrats ’ claims that the case against him was politically tainted , even as he prepares to argue against his conviction in a federal appeals court in Atlanta early next month .
The accusations , from a Justice Department employee , suggest that the Republican United States attorney whose office prosecuted Mr. Siegelman remained substantially involved in the case , long after she insisted that she had removed herself from it because of her partisan connections .
And the formal complaints by the employee , a legal aide in the office of the United States attorney in Montgomery , Ala. , have brought to light an episode in the 2006 bribery and corruption trial that Mr. Siegelman ’s lawyers now say could have led to a key juror ’s removal : flirtatious messages sent by jurors to the prosecution about the marital status of an F.B.I. agent who was working with prosecutors .
Other jurors have said that they felt pressured by the judge to reach a decision in order to go home and that some jury members read about the case on the Internet during the trial .
Mr. Siegelman was convicted and sentenced to seven years in prison in June 2007 .
In March , he was ordered freed on bond after nine months in a federal penitentiary by the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit , which cited “ substantial questions ” raised in his appeal .
I ’m not so sure I believe the wild speculation part of this ( last para ) , but I know Jon Markman , and he is a thoughtful and sober guy .
He writes :
Shares of Warren Buffett ’s insurance holding company are on the ropes this month , plunging 30 % in part because the famed investor dabbled in an area of the market he has long publicly derided : derivatives .
And due to a tangled web of financial relationships , they may be taking Goldman Sachs shares down with them .
Investors are concerned about a $ 37 - billion bet that Buffett made last year that U.S. and world equity values would be higher in 15 to 20 years than they were then , when the Dow Jones Industrials were trading around 13,000 .
Through his firm , Berkshire Hathaway , Buffett sold option contracts , known as “ naked puts ” to an undisclosed group of investors for around $ 4.85 billion , reportedly using Goldman as broker .
The buyers saw the puts as a type of insurance that would pay off royally if stocks fell over the next decade .
They were seen by Buffett as an easy way to pocket a quick $ 4 billion - plus , which was booked much like an insurance premium , even though he is famous for scoffing at derivatives as “ weapons of mass financial destruction . ”
But easy money is the worst kind .
The problem is that stocks worldwide have gone downhill in a hurry , and with a lot of the sort of volatility that makes put contracts swell in value .
And due to accounting rules , this has made Buffett already need to mark down a $ 6.7 billion loss on the trade even though the trade has another 14 years to work out .
Because of its solid - gold credit rating , Berkshire Hathaway was not required to put up collateral to make this trade .
But now rumors are flying on Wall Street that the owners of the contracts have demanded that broker Goldman Sachs put up collateral for the rest of the amount due .
Since the value of the trade could be enormous , the collateral demands are said to be very large , and fears that Goldman will struggle to make good on its obligation has panicked shareholders .
Indeed one theory making the rounds this week is that Buffett put $ 5 billion into Goldman at around $ 125 per share in September not as an investment but to help provide funds for the collateral .
Alas­ka Gov. Sarah Palin was the star of the Chris­t­ian Right ’s 2008 Val­ues Vot­er Sum­mit in mid-Sep­tem­ber , even though she was a last minute no -show .
The Repub­li­can vice pres­i­den­tial candidate ’s name was tossed around fre­quent­ly to euphor­ic applause at the event in Wash­ing­ton , D.C. , while the few men­tions of pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Sen. John McCain ( R‑Ariz . ) drew only polite claps .
Top­ping the list of con­cerns at the con­fer­ence were abor­tion and same - sex mar­riage , while oth­er pre­sen­ta­tions sound­ed the alarm on the threats to God and coun­try posed by stem cell research , immi­gra­tion from Mex­i­co , Islam­ic ter­ror­ists , sec­u­lar pub­lic schools , sex edu­ca­tion and lib­er­als , in general .
Atten­dees knew the stakes for this elec­tion are high .
The next pres­i­dent will appoint Supreme Court jus­tices who will shape legal mat­ters for decades , a point that was made repeat­ed­ly from the stage .
While some speak­ers out­lined the polit­i­cal bat­tles ahead in prac­ti­cal terms , oth­ers implied that this elec­tion reflect­ed a cul­ture war between god­ly Chris­tians and the forces of Satan – embod­ied , of course , by Sen. Barack Oba­ma ( D‑Ill. ) and the Demo­c­ra­t­ic Party .
One thing was clear : Many in the Chris­t­ian Right now view elect­ing Palin as a task ordained by God .
The unan­swered ques­tion for the rest of us is : How does Palin see her­self ?
Is she some­one who mere­ly asks God for guid­ance – a fair­ly com­mon prac­tice for reli­gious peo­ple in pub­lic office ?
Or does she see her­self as car­ry­ing out God ’s will on the polit­i­cal stage ?
The lat­ter would sug­gest a theo­crat­ic world­view that runs counter to the sep­a­ra­tion of church and state .
But because she has so far declined most inter­views , we ’re left to sift through Palin ’s polit­i­cal and reli­gious his­to­ry for clues .
Back in Wasilla
All of the four church­es Palin has reg­u­lar­ly attend­ed as an adult fall on the right of the polit­i­cal spec­trum , sup­port con­ser­v­a­tive social poli­cies – such as oppo­si­tion to abor­tion and gay rights – and have ties to key insti­tu­tions on the Chris­t­ian Right , from Focus on the Fam­i­ly to Chris­tians Unit­ed for Israel .
Some are pas­tored by men with strong domin­ion­ist lean­ings – a desire to bring gov­ern­ment under the ​ “ domin­ion ” of Chris­t­ian theology .
One church Palin briefly attend­ed is a non­de­nom­i­na­tion­al evan­gel­i­cal con­gre­ga­tion , but the oth­er three are Pen­te­costal , includ­ing the Wasil­la Assem­bly of God , which Palin and her fam­i­ly joined when she was a child .
She was bap­tized there at the age of 12 and remained a mem­ber until 2002 , when she first ran for statewide office ( in an unsuc­cess­ful bid for lieu­tenant governor ) .
For­mer Attor­ney Gen­er­al John Ashcroft is the most famous politi­cian to come out of the Pen­te­costal tra­di­tion , which grew out of some­thing called the Holi­ness Move­ment in the late 1800s .
Its church­es are known for a live­ly and ener­getic style of wor­ship .
They also tend to be , like Ashcroft , the­o­log­i­cal­ly con­ser­v­a­tive and doc­tri­naire .
Its fol­low­ers have typ­i­cal­ly been ​ “ born again ” as adults and are infused by the Holy Spir­it dur­ing wor­ship , man­i­fest­ed through danc­ing or speak­ing in tongues .
They also tend to uphold rig­or­ous tra­di­tion­al moral stan­dards in the face of what they see as a sin­ful world , believe God ’s will is revealed to believ­ers through prayer and signs , insist on the impor­tance of prophe­cy , and view the Bible as the lit­er­al word of God .
There are no indi­ca­tions that Palin is atyp­i­cal in any of these par­tic­u­lars .
Indeed , con­sis­tent with Pen­te­costal doc­trine , she has tak­en posi­tions in favor of out­law­ing abor­tion and same - sex mar­riage , as well as insti­tut­ing absti­nence - only edu­ca­tion and the teach­ing of cre­ation­ism in the pub­lic schools .
And she has come close to attribut­ing her elec­tion as gov­er­nor to divine inter­ven­tion , thank­ing a vis­it­ing pas­tor , Thomas Muthee of Kenya , for her win .
​ “ He just prayed for it , ” she recalled ear­li­er this year .
​ “ He said , ​‘Lord make a way and let her do this next step . ’
And that ’s exact­ly what happened . ”
The Assem­blies of God – the fun­da­men­tal­ist denom­i­na­tion shared by Ashcroft and Palin – is gen­er­al­ly extreme­ly con­cerned with Jesus ’ Sec­ond Com­ing and the con­struc­tion of the King­dom of God on Earth .
Ashcroft trans­lat­ed these beliefs direct­ly into pub­lic life :
One of his first acts as attor­ney gen­er­al was to cov­er the exposed breast of the giant Spir­it of Jus­tice stat­ue in the Jus­tice Department ’s Great Hall and to con­vene dai­ly morn­ing prayer meet­ings in his office .
More sub­stan­tive­ly , Ashcroft stepped up pornog­ra­phy pros­e­cu­tions and tamped down pros­e­cu­tions relat­ed to threats and vio­lence direct­ed at abor­tion clin­ics .
Like Palin , Ashcroft opposed abor­tion even in the case of rape or incest .
As a sen­a­tor , he fought for what lat­er became Pres­i­dent Bush ’s faith - based ini­tia­tive , which chan­neled tens of mil­lions of dol­lars into Chris­t­ian Right orga­ni­za­tions .
As attor­ney gen­er­al , he increased inves­ti­ga­tions of Mus­lim charities .
Palin ’s own thin pub­lic record is less deci­sive :
She cam­paigned for gov­er­nor against ben­e­fits for same - sex part­ners , but once gov­er­nor , she did not block imple­men­ta­tion of a court rul­ing that ordered the state to pro­vide such ben­e­fits .
Nor has she tried to man­date the teach­ing of cre­ation­ism or absti­nence - only sex ed in Alaska ’s schools .
But two inci­dents are troubling .
One is by now quite famil­iar :
In 1996 , Palin approached Wasilla ’s librar­i­an about whether she ’d be will­ing to cen­sor some books , pos­si­bly out of con­cern over a local pastor ’s book argu­ing for accep­tance of gay Chris­tians .
The librar­i­an refused to coun­te­nance the idea , and a few months lat­er , Palin sought to fire her ( though com­mu­ni­ty protest saved the woman ’s job ) .
The sec­ond has received less atten­tion : Last win­ter , when Vic Kohring , the state rep­re­sen­ta­tive from Wasil­la was con­vict­ed of bribery , Palin appoint­ed an elder from Wasil­la Bible Church to replace him .
That man , Wes Keller , has since spon­sored a bill to make per­form­ing late - term abor­tions a felony and intro­duced leg­is­la­tion lob­bied for by the Alas­ka Fam­i­ly Coun­cil – a Focus on the Fam­i­ly affil­i­ate – requir­ing pub­lic libraries to install fil­ters to pro­tect young peo­ple from ​ “ inap­pro­pri­ate ” material .
In Sep­tem­ber , Keller told the Anchor­age Dai­ly News that he hopes to win leg­is­la­tion requir­ing that intel­li­gent design be taught in pub­lic schools .
' The vote - for - this - because - God - says - so approach means that those who oppose a particular policy are violating God 's will .
It turns policy issues into religious conflicts . '
The Stock Market Continues to Take a Beating , Should You Really Just Stay the Course ?
Are you tired of hearing it yet ?
Most advisors and personal finance gurus continue to urge investors to stay the course , invest for the long run , and everything will be fine .
Of course we know this is what history and conventional wisdom tells us , but when you ’re seeing your nest egg drop by 5 % in a single day , and drop by 30 % or more in just a year , it can be quite annoying to keep hearing everyone tell you just to sit tight .
Besides , it ’s not their money , so what do they care if your account is dropping like a rock ?
I ’ve been meeting with a ton of people over the past few weeks , and I ’ve encountered almost every type of investor you can imagine .
I ’m working with 25 year olds who are just getting started , to people who have already filed their paperwork to retire in a few weeks .
As you can imagine , there is a big difference in priorities when you compare someone with 40 years until retirement with someone who will start drawing their pension and Social Security in a matter of weeks .
But even with such different scenarios , the concerns are the same .
Where is the market headed ?
Everything from Opportunity to Complete Disaster
Depending on who you are and how close you are to retirement , you might view this situation as a great opportunity , or a complete disaster that ’s going to force you to delay retirement .
I ’ve had some people in my office this week recognize the long - term opportunity and increase their contributions to their retirement plan significantly .
I ’ve also had people in my office that completely break down and start crying because of the impact this is having on their lives .
It ’s easy for pundits to say what a tremendous buying opportunity this is , and it is true that if you have a number of years before needing the money , you will be rewarded .
But when you ’re talking about someone who ’s already spent the last 20 or 30 years building up their portfolio , the market declines can far outweigh the benefits of buying a few investments on sale .
If you have a $ 200,000 portfolio that drops 30 % in a year , that $ 60,000 loss looks far greater than the $ 10,000 you might have contributed during that time .
When people look at it that way , it ’s easy to see why investors are quick to discount the boring advice of staying the course and continuing to invest .
Many Investors Act Like the Companies We ’re Bailing Out
Many people right now would like to see financial company executives dragged into the street to be drawn and quartered after the government bails their companies out when they made bad decisions based on greed .
But what most people fail to realize is that they often do the exact same thing when it comes to their own finances .
That ’s right , if you ’re portfolio is in bad shape right now , there ’s a chance it is due to greed .
People love to chase returns , and most investors do so not by trying to time the market , but by taking on more risk when times are good , while ignoring the possible downside and getting burned when things reverse course .
Just like banks took on excessive risk lending to people , when the money was there , why not ?
The same is true for many investors .
When the stock market is on a roll , people will gladly move out of their comfort zone to take advantage of the market .
If the market has been returning 12 - 15 % per year , why not take on a little more risk to grab some better returns ?
And then , just like the bell tolled for the banks who took on too much risk , the same thing happens to investors .
The market turns sour , and suddenly people who got greedy and tried to take a little more risk in the market are faced with losses they are n’t comfortable with .
When you play with fire , you get burned .
Proper Asset Allocation is More Important Than Ever
This is where most people fail and struggle to find answers .
I meet with a lot of people who are inside of five years until retirement , yet they come in upset that their 90 % stock portfolio took a big hit .
Of course , I always ask why they are so heavy in stocks if they are so close to retirement and ca n’t stomach the losses .
The answer is almost always the same .
Somewhere between 2003 - 2005 , most people abandoned their recommended asset allocation in favor of holding more stocks because the market was doing well .
They talk about how little interest the bond funds and fixed accounts were paying , so they figured it was better to own more stock .
They soon found out that doing so creates a case of feast or famine .
That does n’t mean you ca n’t be close to retirement and invest heavily in stocks , but for most people who are so shocked about the losses they ’re seeing , it ’s obviously more risk than they are willing to take .
It ’s important to remember that if you create a diversified portfolio , you ’re probably not going to capture all of the gains in a bull market , but more importantly , you ’re also not going to realize all the losses in a bear market .
This is exactly what a diversified portfolio is supposed to do , but if you abandon your plan because you get greedy and want to reap the rewards of taking on a little more risk , you have to realize that things can and do change course , and with that risk comes the potential for greater loss .
The Past 20 Years of Investment Returns
You Ca n’t Time the Market as Well as You Think
People who do n’t want to stay the course and bail out of stocks think that they can beat the market .
Is it true that if you dumped everything in favor of a money market or fixed account that you can virtually guarantee no future losses ?
Sure , but who ’s to say you ’re getting out at the right time ?
For all we know , the day after you make this decision , the market begins to stabilize and recover , and you ’re left holding the bag on a fund with a 3.5 % APY while the market made up 10 % of its losses in just a week .
The way I see it , is that if you did n’t see the peak of the market back in October of 2007 and it took you a year of losses to make a decision to get out , what is the likelihood that you ’ll be able to spot the exact bottom of the market and jump back in so you can recover all of the losses ?
Very slim .
If it takes another six months or longer of a market recovery before you decide to get back in , you just missed the boat , and you ’re going to be selling low and buying high .
So What Should You Do ?
I ca n’t tell you what the best thing is to do , but before taking any drastic action you should ask yourself a few questions .
Why are you upset over the recent performance ?
Is it because you ’re close to retirement and holding too much in stocks ?
Is it because you ’ve taken on more risk in the past few years and realize it might have been a mistake ?
Or are you just upset that you ’re losing money even though you ’re doing everything right ?
It does n’t matter what your situation is , but you need to recognize what is causing you to feel this way so that you can remedy the situation so that it does n’t happen in the future .
This might mean readjusting your portfolio , putting more money into bonds , or even increasing how much you ’re investing .
If you ’re doing all the right things , taking on the appropriate level of risk , and understand the role each investment plays in your financial plan , then staying the course is n’t such a bad thing after all .
But if you ’re doing the wrong things and are taking more risk than you ’re willing to stomach , it might be time for a change .
Just make sure you understand the ramifications of the change and that you have all the information necessary to make an informed decision instead of reacting to headlines or sound bites on TV .

Your body has a signature odor , just as your fingers have unique prints .
And that " eau d'you " remains even if you change what you eat , a new study finds .
Mammals such as mice and humans are known to have unique , genetically determined body odors , called odortypes , which act something like olfactory nametags , helping distinguish to individuals from one another , even pick out a mate .
An individual 's odortype is determined in part by genes in a genomic region called the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) , which plays a role in the immune system and are found in most vertebrates .
Sweat and urine
Odortype information is transmitted through body fluids such as sweat and urine , which contain numerous airborne chemical molecules known as volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) , many of which give off an odor , as anyone who 's been in a gym locker room probably knows .
Meanwhile , the type of food an animal or person eats can influence their body odor ; garlic , when consumed in large amounts , is a well - known example .
So researchers at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia looked into the question of whether or not changes in diet could possibly get in the way of one 's genetically determined odortype and thus mask aromatic identity .
In behavioral tests , " sensor " mice were trained to use their sense of smell to choose between pairs of test mice that differed in MHC genes , diet or both .
Researchers used chemical analyses to examine the array of VOC 's in urine of mice having different MHC backgrounds and fed different diets .
The results , detailed in the October 31 issue of the online journal PLoS ONE , indicate that genetically determined odortypes persisted regardless of what the mice ate , even though dietary changes did strongly influence the odor profiles of individual mice .
Both the sensor mice and chemical analyses could still detect the underlying odortypes .
Like a fingerprint
" The findings using this animal model support the proposition that body odors provide a consistent ' odorprint ' analogous to a fingerprint or DNA sample , " said study author Gary Beauchamp , a behavioral biologist at Monell .
" These findings indicate that biologically based odorprints , like fingerprints , could be a reliable way to identify individuals , " said lead author Jae Kwak , a Monell chemist .
" If this can be shown to be the case for humans , it opens the possibility that devices can be developed to detect individual odorprints in humans . "
Beauchamp added that similar methods are being used to look for body odor differences associated with disease .
Such research could lead to the development of electronic sensors for early detection and rapid diagnosis of disorders such as skin and lung cancer and certain viral diseases .
Video ( 03:03 ) : Norm Coleman held a press conference today to claim victory over opponent Al Franken even as a recount is possible .
Sen . Norm Coleman 's narrow lead over DFL challenger Al Franken in the U.S. Senate race narrowed even more Wednesday , guaranteeing a recount that would be the state 's biggest ever and could stretch well into next month .
Coleman declared victory Wednesday morning , when his unofficial lead over Franken stood at 725 votes out of nearly 2.9 million cast , according to the secretary of state 's tally .
By the end of the day , as county officials from around the state forwarded adjusted figures to the state , that margin had shrunk to 477 votes , and Thursday morning it shrank further , to 438 votes .
Early Wednesday , Franken announced his support for a recount , which would be automatic because of the closeness of the vote .
He said that his campaign was investigating alleged voting irregularities at some polling places in Minneapolis and that " a recount could change the outcome significantly . "
" Let me be clear :
Our goal is to ensure that every vote is properly counted , " he said .
The standoff promised to throw the already long and bitterly contested race into overtime , where the main players will be canvassers and lawyers .
The recount involves examining every ballot by hand .
Recounts are required in races with a winning margin of less than one - half of 1 percent , although a losing candidate may request that it not go forward .
Coleman and Franken each received 42 percent of the vote , and Independence Party candidate Dean Barkley got 15 percent .
A few hours after Franken spoke , Coleman went before relatives , friends and supporters at his campaign headquarters in St.
Paul to say he was " humbled and grateful for the victory that the voters gave us last night . "
His campaign website flashed the word " VICTORY . "
Coleman urged Franken to waive his right to a recount , saying that the prospect of changing the result was remote and that a recount would be costly to taxpayers ( about $ 86,000 ) .
" I just think the need for the healing process is so important .
... hopefully , you do n't have TV ads during an election recount , " Coleman said .
Franken , who was unavailable for interviews Wednesday , gave no hint that he would follow Coleman 's suggestion .
The Senate race was so tight Wednesday that the Associated Press declared Coleman the winner before 7 a.m. and two hours later withdrew its declaration , saying that it had been premature .
Also Wednesday , a blog reported allegations that a Somali campaign worker for Coleman had been encouraging Somali voters at a polling place to back the senator .
Coleman campaign officials said that the worker was there as an interpreter and not on behalf of the campaign , and he denied telling voters how to cast their ballot .
Mid-November recount
In a news briefing Wednesday , Secretary of State Mark Ritchie , a DFLer , said that a recount would n't begin until mid-November at the earliest and would probably stretch into December .
It would involve local election officials from around the state .
" No matter how fast people would like it , the emphasis is on accuracy , " Ritchie said .
Ritchie 's office ran a September recount of a close primary race for a Supreme Court seat in just three days , but he said the Senate race is entirely different .
" Having a ton of lawyers and other partisans injected into the process , that will change the dynamics of it , " Ritchie said .
The scope of that recount was also substantially smaller , with somewhat more than 300,000 votes cast in that race .
Former U.S. Attorney Tom Heffelfinger , who has been involved in recounts during his career in private practice , described a grueling process for observers .
You " stand or sit or put your foot on a chair , " he said .
" You 're all huddled over this one document , one at a time .
It 's a lot of work . "
After the state Canvassing Board meets on Nov. 18 to certify unofficial election results , the recount process would begin Nov. 19 , Ritchie said .
At nearly 100 county and city election offices across the state , an appointed recount auditor will examine each ballot by hand to determine the voter 's intent .
With representatives from each candidate looking on , auditors will sort each ballot into the proper stack .
According to the 2008 Recount Guide put out by Ritchie 's office , " a ballot or vote must not be rejected for a technicality if it is possible to decide what the voter intended , even though the voter may have made a mistake or the ballot is damaged . "
According to a KARE - TV report , it 's conceivable that up to 6,000 Senate votes might have been missed by the optical - scan machines because they were n't properly marked .
The report cited Ramsey County elections chief Joe Mansky as saying that as many as two in 1,000 ballots might be so " spoiled " in a given election .
If the intent was clear , those votes would be counted in a hand count , he said .
It all harkens back to the 2000 presidential race and hanging chads in Florida , said David Schultz , a Hamline University professor who teaches an election law class .
Schultz said case law has established Minnesota 's tradition of not penalizing voters for failing to fill out ballots properly if their intent can be determined .
If campaign observers challenge the recount auditor 's decision and there 's no agreement on whom the voter picked , the disputed ballots are sent to the five - member state Canvassing Board , which will include Ricchie , two state Supreme Court justices and two Ramsey County district court judges .
That group will vote on any disputes and come up with the official totals for each candidate .
Former U.S. Attorney David Lillehaug , who has acted as counsel to the Franken campaign , said he will be one of the attorneys involved in the recount .
He said the campaign was talking to attorneys here and in Washington .
On the Coleman side , attorney Tony Trimble said his firm has been working with the campaign on the recount issue since Tuesday night .
Those faced with the prospect of staring at ballots for hours actually will be energized , he said .
" It 'd be the Super Bowl of political law or election law , " he said .
" It 's a serious thing .
We 're talking about control ... at the U.S. Senate . "
Schultz said the statewide recount will give Minnesotans a good idea of how sound their voting tallies are , and also may raise the question of our tolerance for error .
In the summer of 2007 , my wife and I purchased our first home .
As a first - time home buyer , I knew we needed to spend a considerable amount of time researching our purchase .
So that ’s exactly what we did – we read as much as we could , educated ourselves on the local real estate market , and explored every aspect of the home buying process .
But even then , we still made a few rookie mistakes .
Of course , it ’s easy to see that now – after the fact .
You know how the saying goes : “ Hindsight is 20 / 20 . ”
Although we are still happy with our purchase overall , there are definitely a few things I wish we would have done differently .
Valuable Lessons for First - Time Home Buyers
But you live and you learn .
And in the end , that ’s all anyone can do .
With that said , I wanted to share some of our mistakes and other things we ’ve learned since we bought our house , in case they might prove helpful to someone else going through the home buying process .
Looking back on my own experience , here are some tips I ’d recommend to any first - time home buyer :
Start saving right away
The earlier you start saving for that down payment , the easier it gets .
We did n’t start worrying about it until it was too late , and we had to get a mortgage for more than 80 % of our home ’s value .
If we had been on the ball even two years earlier , we would n’t have had to do that .
If you want to avoid paying private mortgage insurance , or PMI , in most cases you need to save up at least 20 % of your future home ’s value to use as a down payment .
That ’s easier said than done , but it becomes a much more realistic concept if you start saving right away .
Even if you are n’t ready to buy in the foreseeable future , you can put yourself in a better position by stashing $ 50 or $ 100 per month into a new home fund .
The bottom line :
The sooner you start , the better .
Do n’t rush things
Because of the timing of my wife ’s pregnancy , we felt rushed into our home purchase .
With a baby on the way , we knew our apartment would soon be exploding at the seams .
Although I ’m happy with our home purchase , I wish we had n’t rushed it so much .
There are lots of factors to consider when buying a home , and you can often benefit by searching in different areas and neighborhoods before you pull the trigger .
I feel as though we settled in a way , and that ’s one mistake I still regret .
Build your emergency fund
When you ’re a first - time home buyer , it ’s easy to be shocked by the many “ extras ” that appear in your monthly budget .
Things that did n’t exist before – like larger utility bills , home repairs , and lawn maintenance – start adding up and making a huge difference in your bottom line .
If you want to be as prepared as possible , build your emergency fund for several months – or even years – before you commit to the home buying process .
The money will be there when you need it that way , which will make the entire purchase a lot less stressful .
Price - shop for a mortgage
The easiest way to get the best mortgage rates is to shop around as much as you can .
When we were going through the home buying process , I was surprised at how much lower ( and higher ) mortgage rates from different firms could be .
We ultimately chose the lowest rate out of three and went with our credit union .
However , I really wish we would have taken the time to explore different loan options , as well as rates from at least a few more mortgage brokers .
Saving just a half a percentage point on an average - priced home could lead to tens of thousands of dollars in savings over the years .
Pay attention during the home inspection
During the home inspection process , we thought we did everything right .
We followed the home inspector through every room .
We asked questions .
We took notes .
One thing we did n’t do , however , was check things out for ourselves .
Unfortunately , in our case , our failure to explore the entire property meant that we overlooked an extremely old and almost unusable hot water heater .
We ’ve since replaced it , but we might have been able to ask the seller for a credit had we known at the time .
The bottom line – always inspect the home on your own and pay attention to the details .
Get a second ( or third ) opinion
When you ’ve fallen in love with a house , it ’s easy to overlook things that may not be quite right .
Unfortunately , those “ love blinders ” can cause expensive mistakes if you fail to notice something wrong with the property .
That ’s why it ’s important to bring a family friend or relative along .
Since they are n’t buying the property themselves , they ’re more likely to see it for what it is .
So get a second or third opinion from someone who is n’t blinded by love goggles .
Different eyes spot different things , and friendly eyes will tell you the problems they see .
Shop around for homeowners insurance
It can really pay off to shop around for the best homeowner ’s insurance policy you can find .
And do n’t be afraid to move your other insurance policies and bundle them together — most insurers offer a generous discount if you package both your auto and homeowners policies , for instance .
But your search should n’t just be for the cheapest policy you can find ; this is likely the biggest investment you ’ll ever make , so you want a high - quality policy that will serve its purpose if you should ever need it .
So do n’t shop just on price alone – consider the quality of the policy and its coverage options .
If you ever need to file a claim , you ’ll be glad you did .
Another way to save some money on your homeowners insurance is to evaluate the actual value of your house ’s contents , and insure them accordingly .
At first , we went with a default amount suggested by our insurance agent , simply because we did n’t know any better .
Later , having actually calculated the value of everything in the house , we adjusted that figure downward quite a bit .
Remember , do n’t count irreplaceable items – you would n’t replace them anyway , and they have no real replacement value .
Do n’t go furniture shopping the day after you move in
When you ’re a first - time home buyer , it ’s easy to forget that your new home will bring with it a whole new set of expenses you ’ve never had to worry about before .
So before you go on a furniture - shopping spree , take some time to figure out what your new budget might look like , and what you actually need for your new home .
If you take some time and shop around enough , you might even find an awesome furniture sale or liquidation , or discover some used furniture on Craigslist that suits your needs perfectly .
Do n’t rush into a furniture purchase .
You have plenty of time , so use it .
We had a bunch of cheap furniture from our college days at our old apartment that we did n’t bring with us .
By pure luck , we happened to stumble upon a liquidation sale at a furniture shop and outfitted our living room very cheaply , but it was really a mistake to decide that we needed new furniture for our new house .
Upgrade it later on – you can have a few empty rooms for a while .
Save up until you can afford what you actually want instead of buying furniture just to fill a room .
Offer to help others move for years in advance
How does this help you ?
Well , imagine over a three - year period that you help 10 different families move .
When you move , you can call any of these people to help you move — and five families can unload a truck and unpack boxes at an astounding rate .
Our big mistake was n’t the help we received , but how I managed it .
Do n’t have everyone come and help you at once .
Ask two friends to come one day and two friends to come another day instead of having them all come at once — you ’ll be far more productive that way .
Know what you can change , and what you can ’t
When you buy your first home , the whole process feels daunting .
The idea of spending thousands of dollars to replace or update old or unsafe systems or outdated appliances is especially unsettling and can seem like an insurmountable obstacle .
But every home has some issues .
Some of them are things you can live with , while some are things you can’t ; some are things you can change , and some are permanent features .
The number - one thing you ca n’t change about a house is its location , so remember :
When you buy a home , you ’re not just buying a house , you ’re buying the neighborhood .
Explore the surrounding area before you submit an offer and fully commit to the purchase .
Meanwhile , other problems can be fixed , or at least endured until you are able to fix them .
For example , that problematic hot water heater was something we could change about the house .
But if we had let that issue scare us away from buying it , we might have missed out on the chance to live in a family - oriented community with great neighbors .
More Tips to Improve the Home Buying Process
Your home will probably be the most expensive purchase you ever make .
That ’s why it ’s important to research every aspect of the home buying process – and make sure you do things right from the start .
Part of that process involves getting your own financial house in order .
Here are some steps you should consider taking as you prepare your finances for the prospect of a mortgage :
Make sure your credit is in good shape
If you want to qualify for the best mortgage rates possible , it ’s essential that you get your credit score in tip - top shape .
If your credit score needs work , there are plenty of steps you can take to improve it .
Some of them include paying down debt , diversifying the types of credit you use , and paying your bills on time , every time .
Pay down your debts
Not only can paying down debt improve your credit score , it can increase your chances of getting qualified for a mortgage — and improve your financial well - being , too .
Once you owe less money , you should have more expendable income each month that you could save for your new home ’s down payment – or for repairs or upgrades once you move in .
Paying down your debts can also help you qualify for a mortgage , since lenders prefer to have your total debt obligations — including your new mortgage — to represent no more than 43 % of your income .
Avoid new debts
Another piece of the puzzle while you ’re preparing for a mortgage is staying away from new debts .
Remember , any monthly obligations you have could stand in the way of taking out a mortgage for the home you really want to buy .
As you prepare to buy a new home , try to stay away from taking out any new loans , including car loans .
You ’ll be in a much better place to get your ideal mortgage , and ideal mortgage terms , if you are debt - free .
Resist the urge to buy all the home you can ‘ afford ’
This one is really important .
When you first apply for a mortgage , the bank may be willing to lend you more than you really need .
However , there are a lot of really good arguments in favor of buying less house than you can afford .
For example , the lower payments that come with having a smaller mortgage can be beneficial when you ’re getting ready to start a family or saving for retirement .
Meanwhile , a smaller home can mean less money needed for repairs , utilities , and upkeep .
Regardless , you should only buy as much home as you need and only spend as much as you ’re comfortable with .
Who cares what the bank says you can afford ?
As intimidating as it can be , buying your first home is a wonderful , exciting experience — especially if you educate yourself about the process beforehand .
Do the readers have any more suggestions for things they ’d do differently with their first home purchase ?

Rick Warren has always struck me as a decent man , a passionate believer in doing good work , alleviating poverty and bringing people together .
Warren tries not to involve himself in politics , and has urged evangelicals to move beyond labels of Left and Right .
But Warren has injected himself and the power of his massive church into the Gay marriage rights issue , and insisted his followers support Proposition 8 that bans Gay marriage .
As The Daily Beast writer Max Blumenthal writes :
A week before Election Day , here is what “ America ’s Pastor ” told the
22,000 members of his Saddleback Church in Orange County : “ Here ’s an
interesting thing : there are about 2 % of Americans [ who ] are
homosexual , gay , lesbian people .
We should not let two percent of the
population determine — to change a definition of marriage that has been
supported by every single culture and every single religion for 5,000
years .
This is not even just a Christian issue , it is a humanitarian
and human issue , that God created marriage for the purpose of family ,
love and procreation .
I urge you to support Proposition 8 and to pass
that on . ”

Warren has also supported every major ballot measure opposing gay
marriage that sprouted up in his native California in the past ten
years , a fact that is barely mentioned in accounts of him as the
pioneer of a “ New Evangelical ” movement that sees beyond the old
hobgoblins of the far right .
Warren waged a sub rosa campaign to
re-elect George W. Bush , but was still described as never having been
” written or talked about …in the context of any political issue , ”
according to the non-partisan Religion News Service .
Fighting
the culture war with a velvet glove , Warren has constructed an
international platform using two powerful constituencies few figures
before him have been able to reconcile : conservative evangelicals
hungry for more sophisticated leadership and opinion elites frantically
searching for post - partisan heroes .

I 'm disappointed in Warren on this issue , as he had an opportunity to lend a voice to an oppressed minority and instead reverted to homophobia and prejudice , a hall mark of religious fundamentalism .
One day the church will recognize Gays as equal members of society , just as it accepted blacks , women and minorities .
It 's a shame Warren decided to remain behind the times .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Even as markets tumbled around them , Asian and European leaders expressed confidence on Friday that they could overcome the deepest global financial crisis in more than 70 years .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy speaks during the opening ceremony for the 7th Asia Europe Meeting ( ASEM ) held in Beijing October 24 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Ng Han Guan / Pool
Opening a two - day Asia - Europe Meeting ( ASEM ) of 27 EU member states and 16 Asian countries , President Hu Jintao urged a rapid response to the turmoil , which he said increased the challenges confronting the world ’s fourth - largest economy .
“ For China ’s economy to maintain a healthy state is itself an important contribution to global financial stability and economic development , ” Hu said .
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said the crisis was generating “ a severe shock to global economic growth . ”
The European Union wants Asia to play a full part at a crisis summit that U.S. President George W. Bush is convening next month to help shape global financial reforms and tackle the economic imbalances at the root of the crisis .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said reforms should focus on more transparency in markets , new compensation schemes for financial institutions , stricter supervision and closer international cooperation .
“ This is about no less and no more than the creation of a new financial constitution , ” she said .
Merkel said it was too early to say how long the crisis would last .
As if to reinforce the point , financial markets went into fresh convulsions on Friday .
European stocks shed 9 percent after shares in Japan slumped nearly 10 percent .
The yen rose at dizzying speed , while the pound , the euro and oil prices sank like a stone .
ENTERING THE 21ST CENTURY
President Nicolas Sarkozy of France , which currently holds the rotating EU presidency , said he hoped Asia and Europe could forge a common front at next month ’s talks in Washington .

“ Europe would like Asia to support our efforts , and we would like to make sure that on November 15 we can face the world together and say that the causes of this unprecedented crisis will never be allowed to happen again .
“ If we manage to make sure that this is done , maybe this crisis will go down in history as the day on which we managed to enter the 21st century and start resolving this crisis , ” he said .
Welcoming Bush ’s plan for a summit , ASEM leaders committed themselves to comprehensive reform of the international monetary and financial systems .
Better supervision and regulation of all financial actors was a particular priority .
“ Leaders believed that authorities of all countries should demonstrate vision and resolution and take firm , decisive and effective measures in a responsible and timely manner to rise to the challenge of the financial crisis , ” said the final draft communique , which was obtained by Reuters .
“ Through such concerted efforts , leaders expressed full confidence that the crisis could be overcome , ” it said .
FINANCIAL ORDER
Europe is looking to Beijing in particular to give a lead .
With more than $ 2 trillion in reserves and the fastest - growing major economy , China is seen by many outsiders as tomorrow ’s economic superpower .
But China ’s leaders are more cautious about assuming greater global responsibility .
They stress China is still a developing country and their focus is on raising living standards at home .
Still , Merkel said China was receptive to taking part an international drive for new rules financial rules of the road .
“ There ’s support over here for the idea that we need order in financial markets and a financial market constitution with international character , ” said Merkel , who earlier met Hu .
In a step they billed as contributing to regional stability , the ASEAN group of Southeast Asian states agreed with Japan , China and South Korea to upgrade a long - established $ 80 billion web of currency swap lines among central banks across Asia .
The purpose is to allow a country facing a foreign exchange crisis to rapidly call up financial firepower by swapping its currency for those of its neighbors , or for dollars .
Asia has fared better during the latest bout of turbulence on global markets .
ASEAN ’s leaders expressed confidence that the group ’s financial sector remained “ solid and sound . ”
“ Nevertheless , precautionary actions are needed to send a clear and unequivocal signal that ASEAN is resolute and better prepared than 10 years ago when the financial crisis hit the region in 1997 , ” ASEAN said after its own pre-summit talks .
ASEAN groups Cambodia , Malaysia , Indonesia , Singapore , Vietnam , Philippines , Laos , Thailand , Myanmar and Brunei .
Not all the talk over the two days will be financial .
The ASEM meeting will also discuss food security and global warming .
Polish Prime Minister Donald
Tusk said he wanted countries to reaffirm their commitment to achieving progress in talks on climate change and not use the global credit crisis as an excuse .
“ If we give up this process , that could bring disastrous consequences , especially for poor countries , ” he told reporters .

Cooking once per month is a great way to save time and money .
Simply choose recipes that you can make in large batches , like soups , stews , and casseroles , and set aside one whole day to cook all of them .
Once the meals cool off , store them in airtight containers , label each container , and pop them in the freezer .
All you have to do is thaw and reheat the food when you ’re ready to enjoy a warm , home - cooked meal .
Your recipe sheets or label notes will definitely save you time when it comes to thawing and reheating the food .
Simply follow the instructions you noted earlier and enjoy your pre-cooked meals !
Be sure to thaw dishes out properly to preserve the flavor and texture of the food .
Label everything clearly with a permanent marker so the information will stay put !
Write the dish name , the cook date , and the number of servings on the label .
If you like , you can also include brief thawing and baking / warming instructions on each container .
Use small plastic containers for sauces , gravies , and dressings .
Use larger airtight containers , like Tupperware , for the entrees .
Use aluminum foil to cover dishes like meatloaf or lasagna , then wrap it in plastic wrap before freezing it .
If you ’re putting meal components in freezer bags , press out as much air as possible or use a vacuum sealer .
Let the meals sit out on heat - safe surfaces for at least 30 minutes before you start to package them up for the freezer .
If you need to , touch the top of the food or insert a fork to check the temperature in the center .
Some dishes can be worked on simultaneously , so take advantage of that if you can .
For example , you can stir - fry meat on the stove while you bake a casserole in the oven and simmer a stew in the slow cooker .
It ’s usually best to get the harder meals out of the way first , but you can approach the sequence however you ’d like .
The amount of time it takes you to prepare ingredients for your meals will vary depending on what you ’re making , but you can expect about 3 hours ’ worth of meal prep work .
If you get the chopping , defrosting , marinating , and so on done the day before , you can focus on mixing , assembling , and cooking each meal on cooking day .
Go shopping early in the day , since your shopping list is probably pretty long and if you rush , an ingredient can easily be forgotten .
Shopping the day before is also helpful for dishes that include vegetables , since they ’ll be fresh and crisp when you prepare them .
Look for sales and use coupons to cut down on your grocery costs .
Pick a quiet day when you have the whole kitchen to yourself and clear your schedule .
If your schedule does n’t allow you to take an entire day for cooking , break the task into 2 half - days .
Have a friend or family member help out with the cooking , if possible .
It ’s going to be a lot of work , but you ’ll enjoy the benefits all month long !
To help you stay organized , create recipe sheets with a shopping list , prep instructions , cooking day instructions , the recipe , storage labels , and even a thaw sheet .
This will reduce the amount of work you have to do later and make it easier for you to replicate the same meal in the future .
You may need to do a little math here , especially if you ’re doubling or tripling recipes .
Then , simply write down every ingredient you need for every meal along with how much you need to buy .
Depending on what you ’re making , this list might get pretty long !
Your needs will vary depending on how many servings you need for each meal and whether you want to include breakfast and lunch meals .
If you ’re just doing dinners , you will need a minimum of 4 large - batch meals .
Each meal should include enough servings for a whole week , depending on how many people you 're cooking for .
If you have a family of 2 , you 'll need 2 servings per day for each day of the week , so each recipe should make at least 14 servings .
Most meat - based dishes , casseroles , soups , stews , and chilis are great for freezing and are very easy to thaw .
1 - dish meals like these are n’t your only options , though .
You can make meal components , package and label them separately so that you know to reheat them together , and do the rest of the assembly when you thaw and reheat the meal .
No matter what you choose , make sure all of the components freeze well .
Avoid foods that do n't freeze well , such as :
Soups , chili , stews , lasagna , and casseroles are some of the easiest meals to make in large batches , but do n’t feel limited to those dishes !
Pizza , pot pies , curries , enchiladas , stir - fry , fried rice , meat dishes , and steamed vegetables are just a handful of options .
Choose recipes that are " hits " in your household for the really big batches .
Experiment with new recipes in smaller batches .

Lawyers said hoodies are a symbol of youthful rebellion A judge was within his powers to ban an anti-social youth from wearing a hoodie , the High Court has ruled .
Jerome Barnes , 18 , of Greenwich , south - east London , had argued that the order exceeded the powers of the Anti-social Behaviour Order ( Asbo ) against him .
Mr Barnes ' lawyers argued that banning hooded sweatshirts was more an expression of distaste than a matter of compelling public safety .
But the High Court ruled the ban was justified and reduced public fear .
Public menace Mr Barnes was given the Asbo along with other members of the Cherry Boyz gang that was gathering and abusing members of the public in the Greenwich and Bexley areas of London .
Wearing a hoodie is not criminal or anti-social
Jonathan Lennon , barrister Greenwich Magistrates '
Court district Judge Riddell said he was imposing the condition banning hoodies to aid identification and to stop Mr Barnes and his associates from menacing the public .
But Mr Barnes ' lawyer , Jonathan Lennon , told the High Court that hoodies were signs of youthful rebellion not unlike Doc Marten boots in the 1970s or leather biker jackets in the 1950s and 60s .
He said it was beyond the role of government or the courts to dictate what people should wear .
" No Asbo can address the appearance of young people and the way they dress .
" If the State said we all have to dress in pin-striped suits , then I expect this court would have something to say about it .
Wearing a hoodie is not criminal or anti-social . "
But Lord Justice Latham said the district judge had found that Mr Barnes was wearing a hoodie with the intention of causing fear and reducing the risk of being recognised .
He said the hoodie condition was " appropriate and necessary " and dismissed the application to have the condition overturned .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The debate over government spending is heating up on the campaign trail and raising greater focus on which presidential candidate will really change the way Washington does business .
Sen .
John McCain has criticized politicians who request millions in so - called earmarks .
But will that sway the American electorate ?
Sen .
John McCain has been a crusader against so - called earmarks and says his opponent , Sen. Barack Obama , has asked for almost $ 1 billion in pork - barrel projects for his state in just less than four years in the Senate .
" Nearly a million dollars for every day that he 's been in office !
And that 's change ?
My friends , do n't be fooled , " McCain said September 9 .
Earmarks are requests for money by a specific legislator , usually for her or his constituency , added onto often - unrelated government spending bills .
According to the nonpartisan watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense , Obama has asked for nearly $ 1 billion in earmarks during his Senate term .
But the group gives him credit for disclosing his requests , which most members of Congress do n't do .
Obama has not made any requests for the next fiscal year , and even when he was asking for earmarks , he was far from the worst offender , the group says .
" Just to put it into perspective , he got $ 98 million worth of earmarks in fiscal year 2008 .
Sen . [ Hillary ]
Clinton got more than $ 300 million in earmarks , and Sen . [ Thad ] Cochran , Republican of the [ Senate ] Appropriations Committee , got $ 800 million in earmarks , " Steve Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense said .
Obama 's running mate , Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware , does n't come close to that .
But Biden also has never disclosed what he 's asked for , until this year .
Biden 's office said he 's requesting about $ 300 million .
The Obama campaign points out that although McCain has n't asked for earmarks , his running mate hardly has room to talk .
Watch McCain rail against earmarks »
" When you 've been taking all these earmarks when it is convenient and then suddenly you 're the champion anti-earmark person , that is not change , " Obama said Monday .
According to state records and Taxpayers for Common Sense , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has asked for about $ 450 million in federal money since she became governor .
But she also gets some credit .
" As governor , she has , by all records , started to reduce the number of earmark requests ... so it 's a downward trajectory by our analysis but still significant earmark requests , " Ellis said .
Palin also got into the earmarking game early , before she became governor .
According to state records and Taxpayers for Common Sense , she helped get about $ 27 million , some of which went to the small Alaskan town of Wasilla , during her second term as mayor there , from 1998 to 2002 .
The watchdog group said one of the reasons was that she hired a lobbying firm run by a former staffer for Sen .
Ted Stevens , R - Alaska , one of Washington 's most legendary earmarkers .

DENVER  GMAC Financial Services has applied to become a bank holding company , which would allow General Motors ' financing arm to be eligible for aid under the government 's $ 700 billion bank rescue plan .
GMAC said Thursday that the change in status would shore up its capital position and allow it to continue providing auto and mortgage financing .
GMAC is majority owned by the private equity firm Cerberus , which also owns most of Chrysler .
General Motors , which itself is running out of cash , owns a 49 % stake in GMAC .
GMAC also is launching cash tender offers to buy or swap debt held by its units and mortgage business Residential Capital .
It is offering to swap the debt for cash , new notes or preferred stock , in a move to boost capital and reduce debt .
The financing arms of Ford and Chrysler may also apply to become bank holding companies , and therefore become eligible for a piece of the financial bailout being administered by the Treasury Department .
Earlier this month , GMAC reported its third - quarter loss widened to $ 2.52 billion compared with a loss of $ 1.6 billion a year ago .
Steep losses at the company 's insurance division weighed heavily on the results .
GMAC also warned that its mortgage lending division , ResCap , could fail .
In September , GMAC announced it would close its 200 retail offices and lay off about 5,000 employees , with the bulk of cuts coming at ResCap .
The division lost $ 1.91 billion in the third quarter .
GMAC has tightened its criteria for U.S. consumers seeking financing , including limiting purchases to those with a credit score of 700 or above and limiting how much financing new car buyers can receive .

The arteries of many obese children and teenagers are as thick and stiff as those of 45 - year - olds , a sign that such children could have severe cardiovascular disease at a much younger age than their parents unless their condition is reversed , researchers said Tuesday .
“ It ’s possible that they will have heart disease in their 20s and 30s , ” said Dr. Geetha Raghuveer of the University of Missouri at Kansas City , who led the study presented at a New Orleans meeting of the American Heart Assn .
“ There ’s a saying that ‘ you ’re as old as your arteries , ’ meaning that the state of your arteries is more important than your actual age in the evolution of heart disease and stroke , ” she said .
“ We found that the state of the arteries of these children is more typical of a 45 - year - old than of someone their own age . ”
Experts did not find the results surprising , but they did view it as “ alarming . ”

“ We ’re facing an epidemic of childhood obesity , ” said Dr. Michael Schloss , co-director of the lipid treatment program at the New York University School of Medicine , who was not involved in the study .
“ We are raising a generation of children that are going to have a significant increase in vascular disease as they get older . ”
A May study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 16.3 % of U.S. children and teenagers are obese and an additional 15.6 % are overweight .
Raghuveer runs a preventive cardiology clinic for children who have high cholesterol levels , obesity and a family history of cardiac deaths .
She and her colleagues used ultrasound imaging to measure the thickness of the inner walls of the carotid arteries on 70 children considered at risk .
The carotid arteries supply blood to the brain , and the thickness of their inner walls is routinely used as a surrogate for the condition of the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart .

The children all had abnormalities in one or more types of cholesterol , and 40 of them had a body mass index , or BMI -- a calculation of weight and height routinely used as a measure of obesity -- in the 95th percentile .
Because the researchers did not have access to healthy children for comparison , they compared the measured values to readily available data for 45 - year - olds , using an arbitrary cutoff value of the 25th percentile , Raghuveer said .
They found that three - quarters of the children had artery thickness above this level .
The artery thickening was most advanced in patients who were the most obese and had the highest levels of a type of cholesterol known as triglycerides , so that combination “ should be a red flag to the doctor that a child is at high risk of heart disease , ” she said .
Their long - term prospects “ are not good ” unless they can reverse the condition .
The findings suggest the potential for “ a major public health problem ” down the road , said Dr. Albert Bove of the Temple University School of Medicine , president - elect of the American College of Cardiology , who was not involved in the study .

“ If we begin to see people disabled in their 30s and 40s because of heart disease , we could lose a significant fraction of the workforce , ” Bove said .
But there is some hope .
“ If we can identify the condition early and start modifying triglycerides , we can probably prevent progression and perhaps even promote regression , ” said Dr. John P. Kennedy , director of prevention cardiology at Marina del Rey Hospital .

Councils around Britain have deposits with the failed Icelandic banks Fears are growing that some local government workers may not be paid this month , because councils have payroll tied up in failed Icelandic banks .
Council leaders are understood to have asked the government to help tide them over the current financial crisis .
About 100 councils in England , Scotland and Wales have deposits in collapsed Icelandic banks worth £ 842.5 m .
Council leaders are to meet the Icelandic ambassador next week to seek assurances over their investments .
They plan to press the government in Reykjavik to ensure that deposits held by UK councils in the now nationalised Icelandic banks are fully repaid .
Most of the money invested by local authorities in Icelandic banks is over the longer term , although some councils deposit payroll money to earn interest - money which is now out of reach because of the collapse of Iceland 's banks .
Talks are also continuing between the British Treasury and Icelandic officials over frozen UK deposits held in the banks .
Council reserves Councils affected want the government to tide them over by allowing them to keep the revenue from business rates , which they normally pass onto government first .
Unions are watching with concern and want to know how many workers could be affected .
The Local Government Association ( LGA ) , which represents councils in England and Wales , said all councils held reserves and in the majority of cases there would be no impact on staff pay or services .
The government has ruled out any large - scale bail - out of councils , instead promising assistance to those facing severe short - term difficulties .
Taxpayers ' cash
The LGA said the meeting with the Icelandic ambassador would take place next week .
It wants taxpayers ' money to be a top priority when repayments are made , and says if it fails to win assurances from the ambassador , it will take its case directly to the Icelandic government .
It insisted councils had not been " reckless " with taxpayers ' cash by depositing it in Icelandic banks .
The UK chancellor has said all UK private accounts affected by the Iceland bank crisis will be protected .
A Treasury delegation , which includes officials from the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority , is in Reykjavik trying to establish a claims procedure for British depositors to get their money back as soon as possible .
The talks are expected to last all weekend and the early signs are that significant progress has been made .

PLEASANT GROVE CITY , Utah 
Across the street from City Hall here sits a small park with about a dozen donated buildings and objects  a wishing well , a millstone from the city ’s first flour mill and an imposing red granite monument inscribed with the Ten Commandments .
Thirty miles to the north , in Salt Lake City , adherents of a religion called Summum gather in a wood and metal pyramid hard by Interstate 15 to meditate on their Seven Aphorisms , fortified by an alcoholic sacramental nectar they produce and surrounded by mummified animals .
In 2003 , the president of the Summum church wrote to the mayor here with a proposal : the church wanted to erect a monument inscribed with the Seven Aphorisms in the city park , “ similar in size and nature ” to the one devoted to the Ten Commandments .
The city declined , a lawsuit followed and a federal appeals court ruled that the First Amendment required the city to display the Summum monument .
The Supreme Court on Wednesday will hear arguments in the case , which could produce the most important free speech decision of the term .
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp has developed prototype shoes with a device that generates electricity when the wearer walks .
NTT officials said each shoe is equipped with two tiny water tanks positioned below the toe and heel .
The tanks are connected by a pipe , and with each step , pressure forces water from one tank to another through the pipe .
Water flows created in this way power a turbine to generate electricity , the officials said .
The electricity can be stored in a battery or accessed through a cable .
The power output of the prototype is small and only enough to power a digital music player , according to the officials .
NTT , which is aiming to put the power generation system into practical use as early as in 2010 , hopes to improve the device so that it can generate electricity sufficient to operate a mobile phone that consumes twice as much power as that used by a digital music player , the officials said .
The company also hopes to reduce the size of the power generation unit , the officials said .
The price of shoes equipped with the power unit would likely be only a few thousand yen higher than the average shoes price , according to the officials .
NTT also plans to collaborate with a shoes maker to improve the safety , durability and design of the power - generating shoes before it puts them on the market .

The Kuiper belt is strange .
Most of this strangeness probably comes from the fact that we are only just beginning to uncover this mysterious region of the Solar System .
Unlike the Oort Cloud which ( possibly ) lies beyond 3 × 1012 km away ( over 20,000 AU , or a whopping 0.3 light years ) , we can actually observe the objects inside the Kuiper belt as , compared to the Oort Cloud , the Kuiper belt is on our interplanetary doorstep .
But that does n’t mean it ’s close .
The Kuiper belt exists in a region of space 30 –55 AU from the Sun ; this is where Pluto lives ( as Pluto itself is a “ Kuiper belt object ” , or KBO ) .
As astronomical techniques become more advanced however , we are able to discover more KBOs in the zoo of icy - rocky bodies that live in this region .
Having just written about an oddball pair of “ highly split ” KBOs , I feel compelled to list my top five favourite KBOs .
Here are my favourites , as some are really funny - lookin ’ and others have some serious personal issues …
5 . The identical twins : Antipholus and Antipholus
Having discussed this pair of attention - seeking misfits on Thursday , I ’ll keep this brief .
The guys at the Canada France Ecliptic Plane Survey ( CFEPS ) have been keeping an eye on this cubewano pair for seven years — as their name suggests , 2001 QW322 was discovered in 2001 .
However , what their name does not suggest is that 2001 QW322 is a binary asteroid ( so I suppose they can be called 2001 QW322a and 2001 QW322 b ) .
But not being content with the “ official ” designation , the CFEPS astronomers have found a rather clever and descriptive name for the pair .
Antipholus and Antipholus .
So why do they have the same name ?
Because as far as the Kuiper belt hunters can discern , 2001 QW322 “ a ” and “ b ” are almost exactly the same size .
In fact , from luminosity measurements , astronomers have only measured a variation of 1 - 5 % in the brightness of each .
This means that they not only have the same dimensions ( 100 km in diameter ) , they also have very similar albedo ( reflectiveness ) .
However , just because they are twins does n’t make them good enough to be in this list ( although it is impressive to find identical twins orbiting each other ) , it is the distance at which they are orbiting each other which is strange .
They have an orbit separated by a whopping 125,000 km .
This distance is so huge for two comparatively small objects , it takes Antipholus and Antipholus 25 - 30 years to complete one orbit .
Apparently they have been this way for a billion years and are expected to last another billion .
But eventually they will succumb to gravitational disruption and be separated forever .
4 . The one with the identity crisis ( and family problems ) : Pluto
Pluto has had a rough ride lately .
Firstly , in 2006 , the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) controversially kicked Pluto out of the Planetary Rotary Club , demoting it to a “ dwarf planet ” .
The IAU had its reasons , but the world was shocked and upset at the decision to change its status .
Pluto was Plutoed .
While Pluto slowly pottered through the Kuiper belt on its 258 year orbit of the Sun , the argument raged here on Earth as to what Pluto actually was .
Many wanted Pluto to be re-instated as a planet , but there was a bigger body out there , the trans - Neptunian object ( TNO ) Eris , that is bigger than Pluto .
At first Eris was called the “ tenth planet ” when it was identified in 2005 , but quickly astronomers realised the term “ planet ” might not apply to the increasing number of “ minor planets ” in the Kuiper belt and beyond .
Unfortunately , Pluto was in the firing line and the IAU made its decision .
However , all was not lost .
This year , a new class of dwarf planet was defined , named after the demoted ninth planet : the “ Plutoid ” .
The IAU defines a Plutoid as :
… celestial bodies in orbit around the Sun at a semimajor axis greater than that of Neptune that have sufficient mass for their self - gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that they assume a hydrostatic equilibrium ( near - spherical ) shape , and that have not cleared the neighbourhood around their orbit .
Satellites of plutoids are not plutoids themselves .
So is this the last we ’ve heard of the “ Pluto debate ? ” Probably not .
Although a whole class of objects have been designated as “ Plutoids ” ( including Eris , Haumea , and Makemake ) this will be of little comfort to Pluto .
The dwarf planet may have an identity crisis , but it has another problem .
It looks like Pluto ’s two small moons , Nix and Hydra ( orbiting at 48,700 kilometres and 64,800 kilometres from Pluto respectively ) , did n’t originate from the dwarf planet .
Pluto ’s kids are illegitimate ( why do I feel Charon had something to do with this ? ) .
Poor Pluto .
3 . The controversial potato : Haumea
Why is Haumea shaped like a potato ?
Although the dwarf planet has never been directly observed , its elongated shape has been calculated from its light curve .
Haumea ’s length is twice that of its width .
It is believed that the KBO suffered a massive collision , causing it to spin rapidly and become deformed .
According to the IAU rules , Haumea meets the criteria as being a dwarf planet ( although it is not spherical , it has settled into hydrostatic equilibrium ) , a Plutoid and a KBO .
As it ’s orbiting beyond Neptune , it is also a TNO .
So far , so good .
It looks strange .
Is that it ?
Actually , there has been a fair bit of controversy surrounding this little Plutoid .
Two teams , one from the US and the other from Spain , claimed to have discovered Haumea at around the same time .
In 2005 , the Spanish team took credit , but allegations of fraud by the Spanish researchers overshadowed the discovery and delayed the official naming .
Before the name “ Haumea ” ( after an Hawaiian godess ) , it was called 2003 EL61 , and it was n’t officially named by the IAU until September this year .
Haumea was only the second dwarf planet discovered since Pluto was discovered back in 1930 .
2 . It walks on walls : Drac
2008 KV42 has been nicknamed Drac for a very good reason .
In the story of Dracula , the mythical vampire is known for his ability to walk on walls and 2008 KV42 is doing a similar thing .
This strange KBO has an inclination of more than 90° from the ecliptic , meaning that when compared with all the planets and other KBOs , Drac appears to orbit the Sun in a retrograde motion ( i.e. the wrong way ) .
Drac is approximately 50 km in diameter and is n’t thought to originate from the Kuiper belt , it probably came from a region of space much further away .
Its extreme inclination ( normally reserved for long period comets — although comets make a closer pass to the Sun ; Drac only comes as close as the orbit of Uranus ) indicates that it probably originated from a region either above or below the Solar System ’s ecliptic plane ( see Drac ’s orbit above ) .
This means it may have come from the inner Oort Cloud after being gravitationally disrupted by a passing star .
It appears to have maintained its current orbit for hundreds of millions of years , although this might change in the future .
It seems possible that Drac is a “ transition object ” , a nomad from the Oort cloud that is gradually getting closer to the Sun .
Perhaps its orbital trajectory will eventually make Drac swing through the inner Solar System in a few million years , before becoming a comet itself .
Perhaps Drac will spread its wings and become more “ bat - like ” during its transition from KBO to comet …
1 . The kidnapped KBO : Triton
Remember the sad story about Pluto ’s illegitimate children , Nix and Hydra ?
Well it seems the gas giant Neptune has a few paternity secrets of its own .
Usually the Kuiper belt is a comparatively stable and peaceful region of the Solar System .
That is until one of the outlying gas giants , such as Uranus or Neptune steam past , causing all sorts of gravitational chaos .
In fact , the orbital motion of Neptune dictates the orbits of many of the KBOs , nudging them into natural bands , or “ resonances ” .
But it seems that Neptune has done more than influence the orbit of one large KBO , the gas giant stole it .
Astronomers have always known that Triton is a little strange .
For starters , it has a retrograde orbit around Neptune .
This is an indication that the 2700 km - diameter moon ( 40 % larger than Pluto ) did n’t originate in the same solar nebula Neptune was born in ; meaning Triton did n’t come from the Neptunian system at all .
Secondly , Triton is very similar in composition and density to Pluto , suggesting that both Pluto and Triton may have evolved in a common location ( i.e. the Kuiper belt ) .
Thirdly , Neptune has very few moons ( only 13 ) when compared to Saturn ( ~200 ) , Jupiter ( 63 ) and Uranus ( 27 ) , supporting the theory of Triton ’s abduction by Neptune .
The dwarf planet will have entered the Neptunian system with an extremely eccentric orbit taking Triton across the orbits of the other natural moons , disrupting and scattering them from Neptune .
Eventually Triton settled into its present - day stable orbit , happily orbiting Neptune , watching the gas giant ’s other natural - born satellites whizz past it , orbiting in the opposite direction .
So , Triton is my number one strange Kuiper belt object .
It was once at home with all the other Plutoids , cubewanos , TNOs , comets and dwarf planets , but it was abducted by Neptune , never to return …
Enlarge By Jacquelyn Martin , AP " As we see significant reductions , we 'll be seeing increased response times , fewer cases solved and reduced services for victims of crime , " says Prince William County , Va. , Police Chief Charlie Deane , seen here in February .
RISING PROPERTY CRIME RISING PROPERTY CRIME
In a survey released last week , 74 % of law enforcement officials cited a recent increase in at least one category of property crimes .
Of those : • 68 % saw more burglaries • 66 % saw more larceny - theft • 28 % saw more motor vehicle theft Source : Police Executive Research Forum
The collapse of U.S. financial markets is forcing deep cuts in local police agencies and stoking fears among police chiefs that mass home foreclosures are bringing more crime to suburbs .
Problems created by the financial meltdown are starting to touch everything from police response times to unsolved crimes .
" As we see significant reductions , we 'll be seeing increased response times , fewer cases solved and reduced services for victims of crime , " says Prince William County , Va. , Police Chief Charlie Deane .
His $ 73 million budget could drop up to 30 % next year because of declining property tax revenues .
Blocks of homes vacant from foreclosures are becoming magnets nationwide for gang members , drug users , prostitutes and thieves , who steal appliances and fixtures , Deane and other officers say .
At the same time , police agencies are dramatically reducing their forces as local governments struggle to allocate shrinking revenue from property and sales taxes to fund basic services .
" In this crisis , there are no good answers , " says Sacramento Police Chief Rick Braziel , who is slashing 200 positions and may need to cut more .
In a survey of 180 police chiefs released last week by the Police Executive Research Forum , 45 % said the economy had affected their agency 's " ability to reduce crime . "
Three - quarters of those polled by the law enforcement advisory group in late July cited a recent rise in at least one category of property crimes .
Nearly 40 % said the economic slowdown had resulted in decreased funding .
Cook County , Ill. , Sheriff Thomas
Dart has cut 200 jobs in two years because of falling revenues .
Last week , he declared a moratorium on evictions from homes because many " innocent " renters were getting tossed out after owner - landlords defaulted on mortgage payments .
The hundreds of vacant homes are expanding a blighted zone from traditionally troubled inner-city areas to wealthy suburbs northwest of Chicago .
Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis says falling revenues have moved a plan to install 36 surveillance cameras in high - crime zones " off the table . "
" We see this as just the first in a long series of reductions , " Davis says .
" It 's hard to say how this is all gonna shake out .
This is a time for real concern . "
In the shadow of Palm Springs , Calif. , Indio Police Chief Brad Ramos says Indio passed a law in April forcing owners of dozens of vacant homes to register the properties with the city .
It holds them responsible for the upkeep of their properties .
" Crime and the economy go hand in hand , " he says .
Yet David Muhlhausen , a crime analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation , says the relationship between crime and the economy " is n't always clear . "
During the Great Depression , there was no crime surge .
" Crime is a function of opportunity , " he says .

If you 're trying to save money , leave your credit cards at home and pack cash only .
A four - part study found what many financial planners already knew : People spend more money when using credit cards compared to cash purchases .
People also spend less when they look at their expenses in detail , the researchers found .
Consumers simply feel the pain of paying more when they part with cash , the researchers , led by Priya Raghubir at New York University , write in the September issue of the Journal of Experimental Psychology : Applied .
In one study , 114 participants estimated how much they would spend using cash vs. credit for a well - described restaurant meal .
" People are willing to spend ( or pay ) more when they use a credit card than when using cash , " the authors wrote .
In a second test , researchers highlighted the future pain of paying by having 57 participants estimate food expenses for an imaginary Thanksgiving dinner item by item , rather than just as a total .
When they did this , the cash - credit spending gap closed .
When people confronted the detailed reality of expenses , it no longer mattered whether they used cash or something else , the scientists conclude .
Then 28 participants were given a detailed shopping list to work with .
In a questionnaire format , spent more when they used a $ 50 gift certificate instead of $ 50 cash .
Finally , 130 participants were given $ 1 cash or a $ 1 gift certificate to buy candy .
At first , they were more willing to spend the gift certificate than the cash .
But after holding the gift certificate in their wallets for an hour , they became less likely to spend it , indicating the the certificates came to seem more like real money .
" The studies suggest that less transparent payment forms [ such as credit cards ] tend to be treated like [ play ] money and are hence more easily spent ( or parted with ) , " the researchers argue .
Financial planners have long encouraged people to avoid credit - card purchases as a way to save money .
Doug Borkowski , director of Iowa State University 's Financial Counseling Clinic , counsels students on the subject .
" I have found that if a young person understands that the same amount of money they pay every month for a minimum payment on their credit card could potentially make them a millionaire by the time they reach 65 , they might think twice about using that credit card , " Borkowski says .

Millions of people across southern California have been taking part in what organisers say is the biggest - ever US earthquake drill .
Schools , hospitals and businesses joined in the exercise known as " The Great Southern California Shake - out " .
The drill was based on the hypothetical scenario of a magnitude 7.8 earthquake striking the southern portion of the San Andreas Fault .
It was devised by scientists to help people prepare for future earthquakes .
At precisely 1000 local time ( 1800GMT ) , when the earthquake is supposed to have struck , millions of participants followed instructions to " drop , cover and hold on " - drop to the ground , take cover under a sturdy desk and hold on until the shaking stopped .
They were guided by a public service message sent to buildings and broadcast by television and radio stations .
Search and rescue
At the University of Southern California in Los Angeles , a sports field was set up as a triage centre , with " injured " victims , some wearing gory make - up , being ferried to hastily erected hospital tents .
At the California Institute of Technology ( Caltech ) in Pasadena , search and rescue teams were deployed to find victims trapped in a maze of cardboard boxes simulating survivors buried in rubble .
Fire crews , police and medical emergency services also took part in exercises at several locations .
" If you are prepared , it gives you an automatic sense of calmness because you have the tools and equipment necessary to function , " Los Angeles Fire Department Captain Steve Ruda told reporters .
Organisers say 300 scientists have worked together on the scenario for the drill
The imagined earthquake would , they say , cause 2,000 deaths , 50,000 injuries and $ 200 bn ( £ 134bn ) in damage .
California is one of America 's most earthquake - prone states .
The US Geological Survey says it faces a 46 % chance of being hit by a magnitude 7.5 or higher earthquake in the next 30 years .
The last major earthquake to strike California was in 1994 , when a magnitude 6.7 strike left 57 people dead .
The great San Francisco earthquake of 1906 was about 7.8 and caused some 3,000 deaths in collapsed buildings and fires .
「 Scheme？聞いたことねぇな」と思いのそこのあなた。
ちょっと立ち寄ってみませんか？
Schemeの基礎の基礎から初めてScheme中級者（世に存在する難しめのScheme解説サイトを見て理解できるくらい）を目指します。
Perlなどと同じスクリプト言語である。
プログラム全体が 「リスト構造」という構造を持っている。（分かりやすく言うと、プログラム全体がカッコでくくられた一つのリストになっている）
Perlの代わりに使ってcgiとかも書けちゃう。
C等より抽象度が高い。（例えば整数の実装が表に出ておらず、100!を計算するときに「intだと溢れるから･･･」などと悩まなくてよい）
その他難しいことはよく知りません。
Schemeは言語仕様の小ささも売りであり、そのため多くの実装が存在します。
ここで はGaucheという処理系を使うことにします。

実はこのプログラムは、
( ( lambda ( ) ( begin ( display " Hellow , world " ) ( newline ) ) ) )

いきなりわけが分からなくなりましたが、今はこのコードを理解する必要はありません。
後に関数呼び出しやlambda式をやると理解できます。
次は計算をさせてみましょう。

これを見て色々思い浮かぶでしょうが、一つ一つ見ていきましょう。
( 1 + 2 ) じゃないの？ Schemeでは 「 ポーランド記法」という書き方を使いますので(+ 1 2 ) となります。
簡単に言うと、 ( 演算子 被演算子1 被演算子2 … 被演算子n ) の形に式を書けばよいです。( 詳しく知りたい方は検索してください。)
例えば {- b＋ √( b^2 -4ac ) } / 2a は (/ (+ - b ( √ (- b^2 4 ac ) ) ) 2a ) などとなるでしょう。( これは正し いScheme式の書き方ではありません。ポーランド記法の一例です。)
簡単に言うと、 の形に式を書けばよいです。( 詳しく知りたい方は検索してください。 ) 例えば {- b＋ √( b^2 - 4ac ) } / 2a は などとなるでしょう。( これは正し いScheme式の書き方ではありません。ポーランド記法の一例です。) 外側のカッコは何？ この式の意味は、 「+という手続きを、1と2を引数にして呼び出す」ということです。
( これはたとえではなく本当の話です 。Schemeでは + は基本構文ではなく定義された手続きで、自分の好きなように再定義できます。)
Schemeでは関数呼び出しは外側にカッコをつけることになっていますので、カッコがいります。
という関数があって、 +( 1,2 ) を計算したと思えばいいでしょう。
( display (+ 1 2 ) ) じゃないの？ 対話式実行時は 、Scheme処理系は 「 与えられたリストを評価して、評価結果を印字する」ということを行います。
なのでdisplayは必要なく、答えが3になる式を与えれば3と表示されます。
（ HelloWorldの時のようにファイル名を与えて実行するなら、display (+ 1 2 ) ) でよいです。 ）
計算もできたので、今度は手続き（一般に言う関数）を定義してみましょう。
まず下のコードをエディタで打ち込んで保存してみてください。
( define ( inc x ) (+ x 1 ) )
goshを単体で起動し、今作ったプログラムをloadします。
gosh >( load " D:/programs/scheme/inc.scm " ) #t
となるはずです。注意事項として、windowsではディレクトリの区切りに
\ を使いますが、gaucheでは / でないと認識してくれません。
ちなみに#t は( load … ) を「 評価した結果」です。（Schemeでは全ての式は評価されてなんらかの結果を返します。）
さしあたり は 「 Cで関数が成功したら1が返ってくるようなもの」だと思えばよいでしょう。#tというのはtrueの意味です。
loadが出来たら実行します。
gosh >( inc 1 ) 2 gosh >( inc 10 ) 11
などとなります 。
（カッコを忘れないことと、inc(1) ではないことに注意。）
ちなみに言語の特徴のところでも書きましたが、
gosh >( inc 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 )
としてもあふれてマイナスになったりしません。
( define ( inc x )
incという手続きを、次に与えるリストで定義します。
xは仮引数と呼ばれ 、C風に書くと
int inc( int x ) ;
のxにあたります 。
(+ x 1 )
これは 計算しよう でやったのと同じです 。
この式を評価するとxに1を足したものになります。
)
defineの終わりです。前にも書いたとおりプログラム全体が一つのリストになっているのが分かるかと思います。
手続きを定義して呼び出す方法をやりました。
次はプログラムをする上で必要なifなどの構文についてです。
ifなどをやる前に、評価されるとはどういうことかをやります。ちょっと難しいかも。
Schemeでは全ての式は評価されて何らかの値（または別の式）を返します。
例えば、Cでは
if(x >=0 ) { printf ( " xはプラスです " ) ; } else{ printf ( " xはマイナスです " ) ; }
は、x≧0の時は上側のパスを、それ以外のときは下側のパスを通ってプログラムが実行されると考えます。
しかし 、Schemeで上と同じコードを（Schemeの文法に則って）書いたとすると、
「 評価すると条件が真なら printf ( " xはプラスです " ) が、偽なら printf ( " xはマイナスです " ) が返る」ような式ができあがります。
分かりにくいですね。先にifのところを読んで例を見てからもう一度読んでもらえれば分かるかもしれません。
構文
( if 条件 式 1 式 2 )
条件が真なら式1が、偽なら式2が返ります。
条件設定は一つだけ で、else if とかにあたるものは次 のcondの方で実現されます。
例 1 ：
( define ( abs x ) ( if ( >= x 0 ) x ( * - 1 x ) ) )
xの絶対値を返すプログラムです。条件ももちろんポーランド記法で書きます。
例 2 ：
( define ( abs2 x ) ( * ( if ( > = x 0 ) 1 - 1 ) x ) )
xの絶対値を返すプログラムその2です。
これは全ての式が評価されることを理解するよい例です。
処理系 は( if ( >= x 0 ) 1 -1 ) を評価し、(>= x 0 )が成り立てば（さらに言えば、(>= x 0 ) を評価して#t(真) が返れば）1を返し、そうでなければ-1を返します。
Cで書くとすれ ば( if … ) は
( x>=0 ? 1 : - 1 )
となるでしょうか 。
例 3 ：
評価した結果は数字や式（例1での(* - 1 x)など）だけではなく、手続きになることもできます。（これは難しいかもしれないので読み飛ばしてもよいです）
( define ( abs3 x ) ( ( if ( >= x 0 ) identify abs ) x ) )
但し
( define ( identify x ) x )
( if … ) は(>= x 0 ) が成り立てばidentifyになるので、全体として( identify x ) となりxが 、
成り立たなければabsになるので( abs x ) となり|x|が返ります。
（別にはじめか ら( abs x ) とすればよいのですが、まぁ例なので。）
構文
( cond ( 条 件 1 式 1 ) ( 条 件 2 式 2 ) … ( 条件n 式n ) )
条件を1から順番に評価し、一番最初に成り立ったもの（#tを返したもの）に対応する式を返します。
例 1 ：
( define ( divide2 x ) ( cond ( ( odd ? x ) x ) ( ( even ? ( / x 2 ) ) ( / x 4 ) ) ( else ( / x 2 ) ) ) )
xが奇数ならxを、それ以外で（つまりxが偶数で）x/2が偶数ならx/4を、それ以外（つまりxは偶数でx/2は奇数）ならx/2を返します。
odd?とeven?ははじめから定義されている手続きで、(odd ?
x ) はxが奇数なら#tを 、( even ? x ) はxが偶数なら#tを返します。
最後の条件であるelseは意味的にはC等のelseと同じです。
式の評価という観点から見ると、elseは常に真を返すといえます。
つまり、
( define ( divide2 x ) ( cond ( ( odd ? x ) x ) ( ( even ? ( / x 2 ) ) ( / x 4 ) ) ( #t ( / x 2 ) ) ) )
と書いても同じ結果がえられます。
例 2 ：
( define ( divide2 - 2 x ) (/ x ( cond ( ( odd ? x ) 1 ) ( ( even ? (/ x 2 ) ) 4 ) ( #t 2 ) ) ) )
divide2と同じ結果を生じます。
( cond … ) が評価されてxを割る数が決まるわけですね。
「 式が評価されて結果が返る」ということがだいぶ分かってきたでしょうか？
構文
( begin 式 1 式 2 … 式n )
beginは与えられた式を1から順に最後まで実行します。
beginを評価した結果は、式nを評価した結果と同じになります。
例 1 ：
gosh >( begin ( display " test " ) ( newline ) # t )
画面にtestと表示して改行し、#tを返します。
実行すると、評価された結果も印字されるので、
gosh >( display - test ) test #t
となります 。
begin式を評価した結果は最後の式を評価した値と同じになりますから、
gosh >( if ( begin ( display " test " ) ( newline ) # t ) 1 0 ) test 1
のようになります 。
まずdisplayとnewlineを実行したのでtestと改行が印字されます。
次にbeginの評価結果は#t（真）ですからifの条件が成り立ち、if式の評価結果が1となって1が印字されます。
今までなんとなく使ってきた#tですが、ここで一応説明しておきます。
これらは評価されると、#tは真を、#fは偽をあらわします。 つまり、
gosh >( if #t 1 0 ) 1 gosh >( if #f 1 0 ) 0
ということです 。
( 演算子 引数 1 引 数2 )
の形で、評価されると計算結果または真偽を返します。
、-、*、/、=、>、<、>=、<=、and、orがあります。
（但し+、*、and、orは3つ以上の引数を取れます。）
厳密にはこれらは演算子ではなく手続きなのですが、演算子だと思って実用上問題はありません。
( 演算子 引数 )
の形で、評価されると真偽を返します。
not、number?、null?などがあります。
（これらも本当は手続きですが演算子だと思って問題ありません。）
Cでは !1 は偽、 !0 は真ですが 、Schemeでは
gosh >( not 1 ) #f gosh >( not 0 ) #f
のように両方とも偽になります。
これは 「評価して値が返ってきたものは#tとみなす」からです。
gosh >( if 1 #t # f ) #t gosh >( if 0 #t # f ) #t
但し、もちろん#fのnotは#tですので
gosh > ( not ( if #t #f # t ) ) #t
となります 。
例えば引数がnameなら名前を、ageなら年齢を表示するにはどうしたらよいでしょうか？
試しに次のようにしてみましょう。
例 1 ：
( define ( private - information type ) ( cond ( (= type name ) Hiroyuki ) ( (= type age ) 1000000 ) ( #t Error ) ) )
このプログラムは大いに問題ありですが、ともかくloadは成功します。
（なぜ成功するかはすぐ後で明らかになります。）
では実行してみましょう。
gosh > ( private - information name ) *** ERROR : unbound variable : name
name が見つからないといわれてしまいました。
これは処理系が「 nameという名前の変数を探しにいったから」です。（変数については次々節：変数を使おうを参照）
そんな変数は定義していないので当然見つかりません。
（逆に言うと、もしnameやらageやらErrorやらがdefineされていたならば、エラーは起こりません。つまりこのプログラムを見ただけではおかしいのかおかしくないのか判断がつかないわけです。loadしたときに処理系がおかしいと言ってこなかったのはそういう理由です。）
Schemeでは変数名と文字列を区別するために、文字列は手続き( quote)を通します。 また、文字列と文字列が等しいかどうかを見るには = ではなく手続き eq ? を使います。
例 2 ：
( define ( private - information type ) ( cond ( ( eq ? type ( quote name ) ) ( quote Hiroyuki ) ) ( ( eq ? type ( quote age ) ) 1000000 ) ( #t ( quote Error ) ) ) )
loadして実行すると、
gosh > ( private - information ( quote age ) ) 1000000 gosh > ( private - information ( quote name ) ) Hiroyuki
となります。正しく動きました。
（引数として与える文字列もquoteを通さないといけないことに注意です。）
しかし、いちいち( quote …)と書くのは面倒なので、簡略化した書き方が用意されています。
それが 「 '」です。
例 3 ：
( define ( private - information type ) ( cond ( ( eq ? type ' name ) ' Hiroyuki ) ( ( eq ? type ' age ) 1000000 ) ( #t ' Error ) ) )
このプログラムは例2と同じ結果を生じます。
呼び出すときも( private - information ' age ) のように ' を使うことができます 。
注：
gosh > ( eq ? ( quote test ) ' test ) #t
では今までのことを使って多少複雑なプログラムを書いてみましょう。
例 1 ：
( define ( factorial n ) ( if ( = n 0 ) 1 (* n ( factorial (- n 1 ) ) ) ) )
n!を返します。
このように再帰呼び出しもできます。
例 2 ：
( define ( pascal x y ) ( cond ( ( or ( = y 0 ) ( = y (+ x 1 ) ) ) 0 ) ( ( = x 1 ) 1 ) ( #t (+ ( pascal (- x 1 ) (- y 1 ) ) ( pascal (- x 1 ) y ) ) ) ) )
パスカルの3角形のx行y列の値を返します。
次は変数を使ってみましょう。
( define 変数名 値)
で変数を定義することができます。
例 1 ：
gosh >( define a 10 ) a gosh >(+ a 1 ) 11
となります 。
またいくつか疑問が湧きそうですのでみていきましょう。
手続き定義の式とそっくり、ってか同じじゃない？ そうです。
( define a b ) は、文字通 り「 aをbで定義する」という意味です。
ですか ら( define a 10 ) とすれば以後処理系はaを10だと思いますし、
( define ( inc x ) (+ x 1 ) ) とすれば( inc 5 ) を(+ 5 1 ) だと思って6を返します。
( define a b ) は、文字通 り 「 aをbで定義する 」 という意味です。 ですか ら( define a 10 ) とすれば以後処理系はa を10 だと思いますし、 ( define ( inc x ) (+ x 1 ) ) とすれば( inc 5 ) を(+ 5 1 ) だと思っ て6 を返します。 aをdefineした直後に表示される a って何？ 全ての式は評価されるということを書きました。そして対話式実行時は評価された結果は印字されます。
つま り( define …) の返り値が第1引数をあらわす文字だというだけです。 gosh >(+ 1 ( define a 10 ) ) *** ERROR : operation + is not defined between 1 and a
( define …) を使って関数の外側で定義した変数は全ての手続きから見えます。
これでは名前などが衝突して不便なので、ある手続きからだけ見える変数を定義したいと思います。
次の例を見てください。
例 1 ：
( define ( inc - 5 x ) ( define n 5 ) (+ x n ) )
これをloadして( inc -5 1) を呼び出すと確かに6になります。さらに、
gosh >n
とすると
*** ERROR : unbound variable : n
となります 。
これは変数が定義されていない時に出るエラーです。
つまり、inc-5の中でdefineされた変数nはinc-5の外からは見えないということです。
上述したdefineでもよさそうですが、通常はletを使います。
( なぜdefineでなくletを使うのか自分は知りません。どなたか教えてください)
構文
( let ( ( 変数名1 値 ) ( 変数 名2 値 ) … ( 変数名n 値 ) ) 変数を使った式 )
上のinc-5をletを使って書き直すと次のようになります。
( define ( inc - 5 x ) ( let ( ( n 5 ) ) (+ x n ) ) )
定義したい変数が1つの時も( 変数名 値)の周りにもう一つカッコがいることに注意してください。
letでは、変数は全てまとめて定義されるため、たとえば次のようなことはできません。
( define ( distance x y ) ( let ( ( xx (* x x ) ) ( yy (* y y ) ) ( disdis (+ xx yy ) ) ) ( sqrt disdis ) ) )
( sqrt n ) はnの平方根を返す手続きで、はじめから用意されています。
変数が全てまとめて定義されるので、disdisを定義する時点ではxxとyyはまだ定義されていません。
ですから実行する と
*** ERROR : unbound variable : xx
といわれてしまいます。
そこで登場するのがlet*です。
( define ( distance x y ) ( let* ( ( xx (* x x ) ) ( yy (* y y ) ) ( disdis (+ xx yy ) ) ) ( sqrt disdis ) ) )
これは上のプログラムのletをlet*に変えただけですが、正しく動作します。
let*では変数を前から順番に定義するため、disdisを定義する時点ではxxもyyも定義されているということになります。
変数名と同じく手続きも衝突するとやっかいです。
そこで 「ある手続きからしか見えない手続き」を定義してみましょう。
例 1 ：
( define ( fact - iteration n ) ( define ( inner n count ans ) ( if ( = count n ) (* n ans ) ( inner n (+ count 1 ) (* count ans ) ) ) ) ( inner n 1 1 ) )
n!を返すプログラムの「繰り返し処理」版です。
まずinnerという内部関数を定義して、( inner n 1 1 ) を返り値として返します。
（このnはinnerのdefineよりも外側にありますから、innerの仮引数nではなくfact-iterationの仮引数nと対応していることに注意してください。）
最初は何をやっているのか分かりにくいでしょうから順に見ていきましょう。
試しに( fact- iteration 3 ) を評価してみます。
#( fact - iteration 3 ) が呼び出されると 、( inner 3 1 1 ) が呼ばれる
# 3≠1 なので、( inner 3 2 (* 1 1 ) ) が呼ばれ る
# 3≠2 なので、( inner 3 3 ( * 2 (* 1 1 ) ) ) が呼ばれ る
# 3＝3 なので、( inner 3 3 ( * 2 (* 1 1 ) ) ) の評価結果はans×count= (* 3 (* 2 (* 1 1 ) ) ) =3 !となる
#順に呼び出し元の手続きに値を返し、結局( fact- iteration 3 ) の評価結果は3!となる
階乗が計算されていく様子が分かりやすいように(* count ans ) は式のままで書きましたが、実際に評価されるときには計算されてから次の手続きに渡されます。
このように 、 「計算結果を引数として再帰した自分にもう一度渡す」ということはSchemeではよく行われます。
fact-iterationの外からはinnerは見えませんので、
gosh > inner *** ERROR : unbound variable : inner
となります 。
これで手続きに一般的な名前をつけても他人と衝突する心配がなくなります。
例 2 ：
( define ( add x y ) ( define (- a b ) (+ a b ) ) (- x y ) ) gosh > ( add 1 2 ) 3 gosh > (- 1 2 ) - 1
このように、手続きの内部で定義した手続きは外にはまったく影響を与えません。
SchemeをはじめとるするLisp系言語が得意とされるリスト演算を見ていきます。
はじめは何の意味があるのか分からないかもしれませんが、気長に読んでもらえればその威力が分かるかと思います。
構文
( cons 引 数1 引 数2 ) ( car ペア ) ( cdr ペア )
consは引数1と引数2を要素に持つペアを作ります。
car（カーと読む）は与えられたペアの第一要素を返します。
cdr（クダーと読む）は与えられたペアの「第一要素を取り除いたもの」を返します。
（これは第二要素と同じではありません。例えば「ペアのペアのペア」のcdrなどを考えればよいでしょう。）
gosh > ( cons 1 2 ) ( 1 .
2 ) gosh > ( define x ( cons ' a ' b ) x gosh > ( car x ) a gosh > ( cdr x ) b gosh > ( cdr ( cons 1 ( cons 2 ( cons 3 4 ) ) ) ) ( 2 3 . 4 )
一個だけあるドットが非常に気になるのさっ という方は次のlistの説明を読んでから 、 Schemeにおけるlistの実際を読んでください。
ペアのペアのペアのペアノ…などという面倒なことをしなくても、listを使えば要素が3以上あるリストを一気に作り出すことが出来ます。
構文
( list 引 数1 引 数2 … 引数n )
例：
gosh > ( list 1 2 3 4 ) ( 1 2 3 4 ) gosh > ( car ( list 1 2 3 4 ) ) 1 gosh > ( cdr ( list 1 2 3 4 ) ) ( 2 3 4 ) gosh > ( cdr ( list 'a ' b ) ) ( b )
はい、今回は気になるドットがありませんね。さらに最後の例は結果がconsのときとは少し違うようです。
( ちなみにこれ は 「 要素がbだけのリスト」が返ってきており、さらにcarをとるとbが返ります。)
とりあえずは気にしないで構いませんが、余力がある人や気になりすぎて眠れない人はSchemeにおけるlistの実際を読んでください。
append リストはappend を使って結合することができます。 gosh > ( append ( list 1 2 3 ) ( list 4 5 6 ) ) ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 ) gosh > ( append ( list 1 2 3 ) ( cons 4 5 ) ) ( 1 2 3 4 . 5 ) consで作ったペアもappendできます 。
「 それじゃあペアとリストは同じなの？」とか「4と5の間のドットはなんじゃい！」という疑問についてはSchemeにおけるlistの実際へどうぞ。
（さしあたりは 「 ドットを表示したくなかったらlistにしとけばいい」くらいに思っておけばいいです。）
( 1 2 3 4) というリストから4を取り出すことを考えてみましょう。
gosh > ( define x ( list 1 2 3 4 ) ) x gosh > ( cdr x ) ( 2 3 4 ) gosh > ( cdr ( cdr x ) ) ( 3 4 ) gosh > ( cdr ( cdr ( cdr x ) ) ) ( 4 ) gosh > ( car ( cdr ( cdr ( cdr x ) ) ) ) 4 gosh >
ようやく取り出すことができました。
非常に面倒だし、最後の方はカッコが多くてわけがわかりません。
そこで用意されているのが、caarやcadddr等です。
caarはcarとcarを合わせたもの、cadddrはcarと3つのcdrを合わせたものです。
( 他にも、carとcdr合わせて4つまでの組み合わせなら全て用意されています。)
gosh > ( cadddr x ) 4 gosh > ( cadr ( cons ( cons 1 2 ) ( cons 3 4 ) ) ) 3
この組み合わせ演算は、後ろから順番にリストにかかります。
たとえば 、( caddr x ) は『「 " xのcdr" のcdr」のcar』となります 。
与えられたリストが空かどうかを判定するには、手続きnull?を使います。
例えば要素が一つしかないリストのcdrは空リストです。
gosh > ( define x ( list 1 ) ) x gosh > ( null ? ( cdr x ) ) #t
この手続きは、リストを扱う再帰プログラムでの終了判定にとてもよく使われます。
（数字で言えば再帰ごとに1減らしていって「0ならば…」というようなもの。）
また、空リストを直接表すには '( ) を使います 。
（これはlistを引数なし（つまり要素なし）で呼び出した( list)の略記であり、( list 1 2 3 ) を'( 1 2 3 ) と略記することもできたりします。）
gosh > ( null ? '( ) ) #t gosh > ( append ' ( 1 2 3 ) ( list 4 5 6 ) '( ) ) ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 )
今回やったcons、list、append、null?を使って、行列式を求めるプログラムを書いてみましょう。
（使っている項目は上に挙げた4つにif、cond、結果を引数として渡す再帰と全てここまででやった内容なので、読むのが面倒な人は飛ばしてもよいです。）
リスト演算の威力が少しでも伝われば幸いです。
( define ( det A ) ( define ( scholor ? matrix ) ( if ( and ( null ? ( cdr matrix ) ) ( null ? ( cdar matrix ) ) ) #t # f ) ) ( define ( delete - elm j vector ) ( define ( delete - elm - inner j count top middle end ) ( if ( = j count ) ( append top end ) ( delete - elm - inner j (+ count 1 ) ( append top ( list middle ) ) ( car end ) ( cdr end ) ) ) ) ( delete - elm - inner j 1 ' ( ) ( car vector ) ( cdr vector ) ) ) ( define ( delete - column j matrix ) ( if ( null ? ( cdr matrix ) ) ( list ( delete - elm j ( car matrix ) ) ) ( cons ( delete - elm j ( car matrix ) ) ( delete - column j ( cdr matrix ) ) ) ) ) ( define ( acum - det vector smallen - matrix ) ( define ( acum - det - inner vector retu matrix result ) ( let ( ( hugou ( if ( even ? retu ) - 1 1 ) ) ) ( cond ( ( null ? vector ) result ) ( (= ( car vector ) 0 ) ( acum - det - inner ( cdr vector ) (+ 1 retu ) matrix result ) ) ( else ( acum - det - inner ( cdr vector ) (+ 1 retu ) matrix (+ result (* hugou ( car vector ) ( det ( delete - column retu matrix ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( acum - det - inner vector 1 smallen - matrix 0 ) ) ( if ( scholor ?
A ) ( caar A ) ( acum - det ( car A ) ( cdr A ) ) ) ) gosh > ( det ( list ( list 1 0 ) ( list 0 1 ) ) ) 1 gosh > ( det ( list ( list 2 0 0 ) ( list 0 2 0 ) ( list 0 0 2 ) ) ) 8
引数はリストのリスト（数のリストを行ベクトルだと思い、さらにそのリストを行列だと思う）にしてください。
delete-elemは与えられたベクトル（リスト）の第m番目を削除したリストを、delete-columnは与えられた行列の第m列目を削除した行列を返します。
（行列式の計算には第1行に関する余因子展開を使っています。）
mapは（1引数の）関数とリストを引数にとり、「与えられたリストの各要素に関数を作用させたもののリスト」を返します。
つまり、組{f ( x ) , ( 1 2 3 4 ) }からリス ト ( f ( 1 ) f( 2 ) f( 3 ) f( 4 ) ) を作り出すといえます。
構文
( map 関数 リスト )
例 1 ：
gosh > ( map inc ' ( 0 1 2 ) ) ( 1 2 3 ) gosh > ( map even ? ' ( 1 2 3 4 ) ) ( #f #t #f # t )
mapをつかって初心者用課題の素数の問題を解いてみます。
例 2 ：
( define ( n- primes n ) ( define ( make - list n ) ( define ( make - list - inner n count result ) ( if ( = count n ) ( append result ( list count ) ) ( make - list - inner n (+ count 1 ) ( append result ( list count ) ) ) ) ) ( make - list - inner n 1 ' ( ) ) ) ( define ( is - prime ? n ) ( define ( is - prime ? - inner n count ) ( cond ( (= n 1 ) # f ) ( (> count ( sqrt n ) ) # t ) ( ( integer ? (/ n count ) ) # f ) ( else ( is - prime ? - inner n (+ count 1 ) ) ) ) ) ( is - prime ? - inner n 2 ) ) ( define ( predicate p ) ( define ( test x ) ( if ( p x ) x # f ) ) test ) ( define ( remove - f sequence ) ( cond ( ( null ? sequence ) '( ) ) ( ( car sequence ) ( cons ( car sequence ) ( remove -f ( cdr sequence ) ) ) ) ( else ( remove -f ( cdr sequence ) ) ) ) ) ( remove -f ( map ( predicate is - prime ? ) ( make - list n ) ) ) ) gosh > ( n - primes 100 ) ( 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71 73 79 83 89 97 )
但し、内部手続きmake-listは1以上n以下の自然数を全て含むリストを返す手続き、is-prime?は与えられた数が素数かどうか判定する手続き、remove-fは与えられたリストから#fのみを取り除く手続きです。
下から2行目のmapの第2引数が分かりにくいと思うので説明しておきます。
( predicate is - prime ? )
を評価すると定義からtestになるわけですが、testの定義の中にあるpはpredicateの引数のpと対応しているので、ここではis-prime?になっています。
つまり、( predicate is - prime ? ) を評価すると「1変数の関数test」が返ってきて、testは引数が素数なら引数をそのまま返し、違えば#fを返す、と理解できます。
ここで「testはpredicateの内部手続きだから、外からは見えないんじゃなかったの？」という疑問がわきます。
答えとしては、「 mapから直接は見えないが、predicateを通してのみ見ることができる」と言えます。
（これによ りSchemeでオブジェクト指向のようなこともできますよ。）
大切なことは、プログラムが『モジュール化』されているということです。
モジュール化することにより、例えばn以下の偶数を全て返すプログラムを作りたければis-prime?の代わりにeven?を渡してやるだけでよいですし、素数判定に原始的な割り算ではなくフェルマー法を使いたければis-prime?のみを修正すればできます。
（これ はSchemeに限らずどの言語にも共通する重要な考え方です。）
list演算 はSchemeを使いこなす上で非常に重要なので、練習問題を用意しました。─解答例（未執筆）
問 題1 (易 ) ：
mapのところで作った素数を求めるプログラムは、各モジュールの入力と出力を理解すれば
( remove -f ( map ( predicate is - prime ? ) ( make - list n ) ) ) を見ただけですぐに理解できます。
その反面、一度1からnまでのリストを作り出す必要があり、nを大きくすると大量のメモリを消費します。
これを解消するために、先にリストを作ってしまわないで、素数が求まるたびにリストを伸ばしていくようなプログラムを作りなさい。 ただし手続きis-prime?はすでに与えられているものとしてよい。
問 題2 (難 ) ：
「 エラトステネスの篩」を使って2以上n以下の素数のリストを出力せよ。
前節でmapをやったときに、引数の中に関数が入っていました。
Schemeでは手続きの名前を書いてやるだけで手続きを引数として渡してやることができます。
Cでは 「関数の本体」を値渡ししてやることはできないのでアドレスを渡しますが、Schemeでは引数として渡すと
きに名前が評価されて 「本体をあらわす式」になり、その式が渡されます。
こ の 「本体をあらわす式」がここでやるlambda式です。
しかしいきなりlambdaは難しいのでとりあえずは手続きを引数に渡す例を見てみましょう。（実はもう1回出てきていますが。）
例 1 ：
( define ( double f x ) ( f ( f x ) ) ) ( define ( inc x ) (+ x 1 ) ) gosh > ( double inc 5 ) 7
( double f x ) は（一般的な書き方で言うと）f ( f( x ) ) を返します 。
簡単ですね 。
上の例で、incを渡してやるのにわざわざ一度incという名前を介するのはもどかしい感じがします。
また、例えばmapで素数を表示した時のpredicateのようにわざわざ名前をつけるほどでもない、一度しか使われない手続きもあります。
そこで、lambdaを使って「名前のない、手続きの本体」を表現します。
構文：
( lambda ( 引数並び ) 手続きの内容を表す式 )
この式を評価すると、 「 手続きの本体」が返ります。
見てのとおり、手続きの名前はどこにもあらわれません。
使い方になれるまで若干分かりにくいですので、例で見ていきます。
例 1 ：
gosh > ( ( lambda ( x ) (+ x 1 ) ) 1 ) 2
( lambda･･･ ) が手続きの本体で、それを引数に1を設定して呼び出しています。
引数並びに現れているxが内容を表す式のxに対応します。
例 2 ：
gosh > ( ( lambda ( ) (+ 1 2 ) ) ) 3
( lambda ( ) (+ 1 2 ) ) は(+ 1 2) という無引数の関数を返します。
外側にもう一組カッコがあるのは、 「 無引数の関数lambdaを呼び出すためのカッコ」です。
（ Schemeでは関数呼び出しにたとえ引数がなくてもカッコがいるのでした。getchar( ) ;にカッコがいるのと同じです。）
lambdaを使って、先ほどのプログラムは次のように実現できます。
例3 ：
gosh > ( double ( lambda ( x ) (+ x 1 ) ) 5 ) 7
lambdaで作り出した手続きの本体にdefineを使って名前をつけるとどうなるでしょうか？
例1 ：

Last month , the New Delhi - based human rights group Anhad , along with some 90 other organizations , held a two - day national convention on the theme , ‘ Countering Fascism : Defending the Idea of India ’ .
It was attended by scores of social activists from various parts of the country .
Predictably , it received hardly any mention in the so - called ‘ mainstream ’ Indian media .
The first session of the convention was devoted to discussions about Hindutva .
In his introductory remarks , the noted social activist Ram Puniyani dwelt on the ideology and politics of Hindutva , which he , as did many other speakers after him , characterized as the Indian form of fascism .
He argued for the need to examine the links between Hindutva terrorism and free - market terrorism represented by Western economic and cultural imperialism , and also to recognize the fact that Hindutva fascism poses a graver danger not just to Muslims and Christians , but in fact , to all marginalized groups in the country , particularly Dalits and Adivasis , since it represents the worldview , interests and agendas of entrenched ‘ upper ’ caste elites .
He pointed out that in this regard there was little difference between the ‘ hard ’ Hindutva of the BJP and the ‘ soft ’ Hindutva of the Congress , and noted the deep inroads that Hindutva forces have made into every pillar of the state , including the bureaucracy and the judiciary , besides in the educational field and the media .
Elaborating further on the theoretical analysis of Hindutva as fascism , noted historian K.N. Panikkar spoke about how the Hindutva agenda is now being advanced not so much by communal riots , as in the past , but by what he termed as ‘ organized attacks on Muslims and Christians , amounting to genocide ’ , often in complicity with agents of the state .
Earlier , he said , communal riots were largely localized affairs , but now these organized attacks are happening simultaneously in different parts of the country , particularly in states ruled by the BJP or by coalitions in which the BJP is a major partner .
In other words , he said , ‘ There is a convergence between the state and Hindutva fascist organizations since the state promotes or allows these attacks ’ .
These well - planned attacks on Muslims and Christians , Prof .
Panikkar pointed out , are characterized by far greater brutality than previously , and no effective action is taken against their perpetrators , whether by the Central or state governments .
He indicated that although the present Government in the Centre had come to power on what it had touted as a ‘ secular ’ platform , it has taken no effective action against Hindutva terrorism .
In this way , he argued , ‘ There is no fundamental difference between the present UPA Government and the previous BJP - dominated NDA Government vis -à - vis fascism .
The only distinction is that while the latter was aggressively communal , the former appears passively communal .
But both allow and create spaces for fascism to advance ’ .
In the last four years of Congress - led rule , he noted , groups like the RSS , the Bajrang Dal and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and their allied social and cultural outfits have made rapid inroads across the country , ‘ so much so that today there is hardly a village in India where they do not operate ’ .
He also argued that many of the terror attacks and bomb blasts that have occurred in India in recent years might have been orchestrated by Hindutva groups in order to justify attacks on Muslims and Christians , whip up Hindu sentiments and thereby consolidate their vote - bank .
Noted academic and legal luminary Prof. Upendra Baxi spoke about what he called the ‘ Modi- fication ’ of India , a process of ‘ regression ’ , exemplified in the form of the Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi , which , in his words , ‘ represents a totalitarian order and a politics of immunity and impunity ’ , a situation where those in power ‘ can do as they want without any pull of accountability or tug of constitutionality and can practise genocidal governance , a form of governance that continuously destroys democracy ’ .
The ‘ Modi- fication ’ of India , he added , also signifies a particular relationship between ‘ development ’ and ‘ destruction ’ , characterised by a close alliance of Hindutva fascism with Western economic imperialism in the garb of ‘ globalisation ’ that is wreaking havoc with the lives of the poor .
Prof .
Baxi demanded that the international convention against genocide should be incorporated into the Indian Constitution and law and that the state ’s ‘ anti- terrorism ’ policy be made ‘ ethical and constitutional ’ .
Remarking about the lack of political will to punish perpetrators of violence against minorities , and lamenting that ‘ law reforms have become a joke in India ’ , he insisted on the need for a ‘ legal framework through which obstruction of the administration of justice is made a serious and punishable offence ’ .
‘ Hindutva is identical with fascism ’ , declared the noted social activist and Arya Samaj leader Swami Agnivesh .
‘ The RSS is the single major source of strife and danger to the unity and prosperity of India ’ , he announced .
He argued that Hindutva was a formidable threat to the Hindus themselves , and that it aimed not just at the suppression of Muslims and Christians but also of the so - called ‘ lower ’ castes , who together form the vast majority of the Indian population .
Hindutva terrorists , he said , ‘ are a blot on the face of India and the Hindu religion ’ .
He also castigated the Congress for providing covert support to Hindutva fascism , and argued the need for a new , united political struggle for social justice and communal harmony and against capitalist depredation and Hindutva fascism .
The same point was made by John Dayal , spokesperson for the Catholic Church .
He noted how scores of middle - class Hindus send their children to study in Christian schools but yet passionately support , or else remain silent on , Hindutva fascism .
He also pointed out the close alliance between Indian and foreign capitalists and the Hindutva lobby , remarking that it was by no means accidental that the favourite destinations for large investments are now BJP - ruled states , such as Gujarat , Orissa , and Karnataka , where labour and people ’s movements have been harshly repressed .
He argued the need for the Church to work closely with Muslim groups in the struggle for social justice for religious minorities as they are the common targets of Hindu fascism .
Since Hindutva fascism aims also at the suppression of the ‘ low ’ castes , and the poor in general , the struggle for social and economic justice must form a central plank of popular mobilization against Hindutva , opined noted social activist and former Vice - Chancellor of Lucknow University , Rooprekha Verma .
She also dwelt at length on what she opined was the growing communalization of sections of the judiciary , which , she warned , posed ominous portents for prospects of genuine democracy and secularism in the country .
Magsaysay Award winner Sandeep Pandey pointed out that possible links between Hindutva radicals and certain terror attacks urgently needed to be probed .
He critiqued the growing military and ‘ counter - terrorism ’ collaboration between India , Israel and the United States , as well as the manufacturing of the image of Muslims as ‘ terrorists ’ which global powers are propagating so assiduously in order , among other things , to boost their weapons industries .
The second session of the convention dealt with ‘ Fascist Terror Networks in India ’ .
In her introductory remarks , Shabnam Hashmi , coordinator of Anhad , spoke about the widespread and deep - rooted communalization of not just the political sphere but also of popular consciousness on what she called a ‘ massive and unprecedented scale ’ .
The Congress is equally responsible , she said , for the rise of Hindutva fascism as the BJP , and she minced no words in claiming that certain actions and statements of the present Union Home Minister are no different from what one would expect from an RSS - leader .
She came down heavily on the present government for its lack of political will to sternly counter Hindutva terrorism despite there being ample evidence of this , for its targeting innocent Muslims by arresting or shooting them dead in fake encounters in the name of countering terrorism , and for its dismal failure to prevent attacks on Christians .
Well - known journalist Subhash Gatade spoke about the involvement of Hindutva terror groups in various bomb blasts that have taken place in different parts of the country .
He lamented the fact that in several such cases no action at all has been taken against the perpetrators , and pointed that intelligence agencies and the police have sought to cover up many of these incidents .
He spoke about the ‘ media ’s conspiracy of silence on Hindutva terrorism ’ , adding that large sections of the media had failed to highlight the issue at the same time as they are engaged in a concerted campaign to declare scores of innocent Muslims arrested by the police as terrorists .
The same view was expressed by the Nagpur - based writer and human rights activist Suresh Khairnar , who claimed that many terror attacks for which the media , the police and the intelligence agencies had blamed Muslims might actually have been the handiwork of fiercely anti-Muslim Hindutva groups , who , by seeking to attribute these attacks to Muslims , have sought to whip up anti-Muslim hatred , consolidate the Hindu vote - bank and , thereby , create a climate whereby oppression and demonisation of Muslims can be easily justified .
Noted senior Supreme Court advocate and head of the Delhi - based Human Rights Law Network Colin Gonsalves argued that it was crucial to examine the direction in which the courts were moving in India on the issue of communalism and secularism as reflected in their judgments .
This would indicate both the ideology of the judges as well as what future judgments might be expected .
Providing details of various Supreme Court decisions , he expressed his pessimism in this regard , suggesting that several of its recent judgments appeared to be clearly supportive of the Hindutva agenda and ideology .
This , he opined , represented a decline of the judiciary ’s secular foundations .
‘ As a lawyer ’ , he remarked , ‘ I do n’t think the judiciary will help much in our struggle to counter communal violence , and to protect the rights of minorities , Dalits and the working classes .
It has n’t helped much in the past , and it is increasingly moving in the direction of the rich .
I do n’t say that all , or most , of the judges are pro-Hindutva , only that the doors of the law to uphold the rights of the oppressed are gradually closing ’ .
This , he suggested , should be seen in tandem with the mounting communalization of the police and of government - appointed commissions .
He also noted the total unwillingness of the government to take any action against Hindutva terror groups as suggested by some commissions that it itself had appointed to look into cases of massacres of minorities .
In many such cases , the perpetrators of violence against minorities have been left unscathed and complicit police officers protected and promoted , instead of being punished .
Another legal luminary and fellow advocate in the Supreme Court , Prashant Bhushan , referred to the menacing rise of Hindutva fascist forces that have started resorting to terror bomb blasts and are threatening to export what they consider as the ‘ Gujarat model ’ of genocidal attacks on minorities to the rest of the country .
In this regard , he pointed out how scores of innocent Muslims have been arrested and languish in jail for bomb attacks for which they have no responsibility at all , and in this the police , the intelligence agencies and influential sections of the media are in league with Hindutva forces and the state .
Hindutva outfits blatantly flout the law of the land by engaging in terror against minorities but yet the state takes virtually no action against them , he regretted .
To prevent the hounding of innocent Muslim youth by an increasingly communalised police in the name of fighting terror , Bhushan suggested the need for an independent statutory prosecution body , separate from the police and not amenable to political manipulation , which could prosecute the police if it acts as a silent spectator or a willing accomplice in hounding innocent people who are arbitrarily branded by it as ‘ terrorists ’ .
In this regard , he also suggested the setting up of an independent police complaints authority , which had been earlier recommended by the Supreme Court but about which the Government has as yet taken no action .
Bhushan referred to communal bias in sections of the judiciary , in addition to other arms of the state .
The judiciary , he said , lacked answerability , it being very difficult to impeach a judge if he was swayed or influenced by communal prejudice .
To remedy this , he suggested that an independent judicial complaints authority be set up , which might make it more difficult for judges to be influenced by communal prejudices .
He cited in this regard the recent report of the Nanavati Commission , stating that ‘ Nanavati did such a bad job that he could be tried for criminal conspiracy ’ .
Bhushan also argued the need for India to sign the treaty of the International Criminal Court , so that if it is feared that judges might be swayed by Hindu communal prejudices in serious cases related to persecution of minorities these could be taken to the International Criminal Court instead .
‘ India is one of the very few countries that has not as yet signed this treaty , and if it does so we can take the case of Narendra Modi ’s - sponsored genocide of Muslims in Gujarat and other such cases to this court if justice cannot be had here ’ , he remarked .
The third session of the convention was devoted to the theme ‘ Fascism and Neo- Liberal Economic Policies ’ .
To consider Hindutva fascism simply as a religious or cultural or political phenomenon is misleading , suggested medical doctor and social activist Abhay Shukla .
Rather , fascism , including in its Hindutva garb , also has to be understood as reflecting a certain economic agenda of entrenched and oppressive local and global elites .
It is intricately related to the new ‘ global ’ face of rapacious ‘ neo- liberal ’ capitalist exploitation , and , as the case of Gujarat shows , is perfectly compatible with communal violence , which serves it by diverting the attention and wrath of oppressed classes / castes from their real caste / class oppressors onto imaginary and manufactured ‘ enemies ’ , such as Muslims and Christians .
The ‘ neo - liberal ’ development policies adopted by the Indian elite are generating widespread and mounting unemployment and pauperization of the poor , and Hindutva fascism thus serves as a tool to stamp out dissent and resistance of the subaltern classes , he said .
Elaborating on this thesis further , noted development economist and documentary film - maker Jaya Mehta remarked how increasing economic insecurity caused by the ‘ neo - liberal ’ economic policies leads to social psychological crises , which makes it easy for Hindutva outfits , representing the interests of entrenched elites , to play on these insecurities of the poor and the middle classes and whip up anti-Muslim , and now , increasingly , anti-Christian hatred and violence .
In such a climate of economic insecurity , added independent journalist and social activist Satya Shivaraman , obscurantist religious cults flourish , holding out the illusory promise of hope amidst despair , while at the same time further exacerbating the commercialisation and politicization of religion .
Anil Chaudhary , co-ordinator of INSAF , a Delhi - based activist group , further elaborated on this argument , stating that fascism , capitalism and war go hand - in - hand and that fascism must be seen as an ‘ economic project ’ .
Hindutva fascism , he suggested , must be seen in the context of the current stage of the crisis of global capitalism , where , because global capital has taken over and the Indian state has given up many of its commitments to the poor , the state is now faced with what he termed as a ‘ moral crisis about its rationale ’ .
Increasingly , the only rationale that it finds is ‘ security ’- maintenance in the face of the civil - war - like conditions that the neo-liberal economic policies have themselves generated .
It is in this context , he pointed out , that the manufacture of the notion of the ‘ Muslim - as - terrorist ’ must be examined , for it is on the claim of countering ‘ Muslim terrorism ’ that today numerous states seek to gain legitimacy and , indeed , their very rationale .
Invoking Lenin , Choudhry described the state as the armed wing of the ruling class , and pointed to the symbiotic relationship between state terrorism and other forms of terrorism , neither of which can be understood in isolation .
The lively and immensely productive convention concluded with the announcement of a long list of plans for practical action to be taken to galvanise the struggle against communal fascism .
But as to how and when and by whom these well - meaning and certainly very urgent suggestions will be taken up remains to be seen .

Google released its second web browser yesterday afternoon , adding additional headroom for web applications stretching the limits of what it ’s possible to accomplish within a web browser .
The Google Chrome team assembled domain experts in various fields over the past six years , both through direct hires and acquisitions , to create a new browser and its critical components from scratch .
GMail and Google Maps pushed the Web to its limits , taking advantage of browser technologies invented in Redmond but left dormant for far too long .
Contributing to Firefox ’s core , writing browser extensions , and championing HTML could only take the $ 150 billion company so far : they needed to own the full browser to push their Web efforts forward at full speed .
Growing Frustrations
Brian Rakowski joined Google in July 2002 as the company ’s first associate product manager .
His first assignment ?
Launch GMail with features and responsiveness to rival desktop mail clients .
Gmail tapped into relatively dormant browser features such as XMLHttpRequest , sockets , prefetch , and more to create a web applications stretching the limits of what was possible inside web browsers of 2004 .
Today ’s Gmail continues to run into a browser ’s limits , setting minimum requirements of Internet Explorer 7 + and Firefox 2 +.
Google web apps teams such as Maps and Mail continually bump their heads against the latest capabilities of web browsers and in some cases invent their own runtimes .
Ian Hickson first learned the inner workings of web browsers while an intern at Netscape .
After working on Opera for a few years and creating tests for Firefox Ian joined Google to continue his work on new browser features .
HTML5 and browser compliance “ acid ” tests are significant attempts by Ian and others to redefine Web browsers through specs , test , and implementations but until now Google could only offer development help and browser extensions such as Gears to accelerate browser capabilities .
Google extended what it could not immediately add to the browser core .
Gears for new application functionality on multiple browsers .
Browser Sync to synchronize browser settings and data across multiple computers .
Safe Browsing to create more web trust .
Teams from each of these extensions are now working on Google Chrome .
Acquisition Boost
Google released its first official Web browser on August 18 , 2008 with the beta release of the Android mobile operating system .
Google acquired Android in August 2005 to establish a foot - hold on the fastest growing computer ( and Web ) market : mobile handsets .
Android highlights
Google ’s web properties through its WebKit - based browser and dependent applications .
Google acquired Ottawa - based Reqwireless and its mobile web browser in the summer of 2005 to team up with the Android team on its web interface .
Web views are an integral part of Android and Google Chrome shares much of Android ’s code , including its graphics engine .
Google Chrome and Android both take advantage of the Skia vector graphics library developed by a small company in North Carolina Google acquired in 2005 .
The Skia team formerly worked on Openwave ’s popular mobile browser ’s graphics engine .
Google Chrome browser includes Skia graphics engine ports for Windows , Mac , and Linux .
Google acquired application security company GreenBorder in May 2007 .
GreenBorder technology automatically sandboxes web code and network traffic by creating a bridge between applications .
The GreenBorder technology isolated Internet Explorer or Firefox instances into a “ sandbox ” inside virtual machine instances .
These sandboxes form the code isolation layers of Google Chrome , protecting other tabs and the parent operating system from the code executing on each web page .
A New Browser from Scratch
Ben Goodger , Google Chrome ’s tech lead , is best known for assembling the Firefox web browser out of Mozilla ’s SeaMonkey application suite .
Manticore , Camino , and later Firefox were all attempts in 2001 to rethink the Web browser for the modern age .
Browsing took center stage away from a communications suite , user interfaces reimagined for Web efficiency , and ( some ) legacy cruft tossed to the side .
Google hired Ben in 2005 to strengthen its own browser contributions and eventually fully rearchitect a web browser for the modern Web .
Google hired top Firefox developers in 2005 and 2006 such as Darin Fisher , Pam Greene , and Brian Ryner .
In Spring 2006 the team began work on a new browser prototype built on top of WebKit designed for broadband - connected , always - on , web applications such as Gmail or Google Maps .
Could the browser experts give web apps some breathing room ?
Modern computers feature multi-core multi-gigahertz CPU s , gigabytes of memory , megabits of bandwidth , and bulky hard drives .
Our web browsers should separate browser tabs into their own processes , multi - thread all communications with the operating system , boost cache sizes , and not be afraid to command more bandwidth when available .
Internet Explorer 8 , Firefox 3.1 , and Apple Safari are taking fresh approaches to web browsers for modern machines but Google Chrome has the advantage of a fresh start to achieve some features not currently possible in other browser architectures .
Features such as tab- isolation and task monitoring are difficult tasks to add inside an existing browser architecture of shared run-times and window models ( as John Resig mentioned ) .
Internet Explorer 8 ’s Loosely Coupled IE partially abstracts browser tab instances and the industry is generally headed in this direction .
Web application - specific resource monitoring should motivate more websites to reduce their browser bloat now that they ’ve been identified .
Individual users can also compare web application resource usage directly with their desktop counterparts .
Rev your JavaScript Engines
Lars Bak and his team in Århus , Denmark have spent many years writing virtual machines : the run-times that translate programming code into machine code .
Lars wrote Sun ’s Java VM , HotSpot , and later slimmed down the VM for J2ME ( CLDC HI project Monty ) .
A few years ago Lars and his team in Denmark began work on a new interpreted JavaScript engine optimized for x86 and ARM architectures .
The V8 engine is specifically tuned for recursive JavaScript tasks , optimizing commonly used components of your application .
V8 is multi - threaded , opening up new parallel processing on multiple computing cores .
V8 guesses how you might use your JavaScript code , and backtracks over any faulty assumptions .
It ’s just one of the new engines we ’ll see inside our web browsers by the end of 2008 .
Google Chrome could have used the same JavaScript interpreter as its WebKit rendering engine ( JavaScriptCore , Squirrel Fish ) but the team had an opportunity , and the funding , to rewrite an interpreter from scratch for desktop and mobile runtimes .
The V8 engine enables new feature sets for Google ’s web applications such as Gmail and Google Maps .
Web application developers avoid adding features that visibly slow down browsers or cause processing pauses in your application experience .
New speed in new areas adds functionality to existing apps .
Google programmers should create more efficient code , tested against multiple interpreters , and optimized for modern computers as a result of V8 .
Even if Google Chrome gains no significant browser market share I still expect it will be the best single - site browser for Google web applications .
Google Chrome adds additional JavaScript functionality through Gears .
Gears is bundled with every Chrome install , adding new features to the web browser faster than previous plugins .
The Gears libraries include support for new local cache structures , local databases , location data , background tasks , and file handling .
Chrome boosts the available Gears footprint for web developers , including Google ’s own apps such as Google Reader and Google Docs ( and my blog ) .
The current Gears code included in Chrome replicates V8 and sqlite code already present in the browser , a bolt - on that will hopefully be integrated in the near future .
Chrome , V8 , and Gears will be a new testing ground for Google ’s HTML 5 efforts , winning a new seat at the table as an implementor with upstream standards groups such as W3C .

Summary
Google ’s business depends on the speed and availability of Web access to search , advertising , and applications .
Chrome is Google ’s second attempt to better control the front - door to its content with full applications optimized for its heavy apps .
Google Chrome builds on top of the work of Android by adding individual applications to already popular operating systems .
Google has flirted with the idea of its own web browser for many years but has only recently released working implementations of its own full browser applications .
Android , Chrome , and Gears will continue to grow in unison and extend individual pieces into established operating systems .
Google is building a new suite of application extraction layers that should have strong leverage across Windows , Mac , and Linux to directly control the company ’s destiny on these platforms .
It ’s an exciting time for new browser technologies as Internet Explorer , Firefox , and WebKit each compete over standards implementations and performance .
Officially adding Google Chrome to the browser space only strengthens Google ’s position strengthening the future web and delivers strong single site browsing experiences for their core web applications .

The gap between rich and poor has grown A UN report on China says the lives of its people have been vastly improved over the last three decades .
Poverty has fallen , adult literacy has climbed and Chinese people are now living longer than ever , it says .
But despite rapid economic progress , new problems have emerged , such as the gap between rich and poor .
The United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) , which published the report , says these problems need urgent attention .
The report , entitled Basic Public Services for 1.3 Billion People , comes just weeks before China celebrates 30 years of economic reforms .
During this period , the Chinese government has largely ditched central planning in favour of the free market .
' Stunning achievements '
These reforms , started by the late , former leader Deng Xiaoping , have brought spectacular results , as the report makes clear .
" The speed , scope and magnitude of the improvements rank among the most stunning achievements in the history of human development , " says the UN 's chief representative in China , Khalid Malik , in the report .
Between 1978 and 2007 , rural poverty fell from 30.7 % to just 1.6 % , according to the UN .
But new problems have emerged , with not everyone benefiting equally from rapid economic expansion .
Rural areas lag behind urban areas , the east coast is richer that the western hinterland and there is a large wealth gap between different social groups .
Schoolchildren in the wealthy coastal city of Shanghai receive 10 times more funding than some rural pupils , the report says .
Rural registration According to the UNDP , one problem is the Chinese system that requires all citizens to be registered in one particular place .
People usually receive welfare benefits in the area they are registered , which brings difficulties if they move .
This is a particular problem for the tens of millions of rural people who move to the cities to find work .
Chinese leaders have already acknowledged the existence of some of these problems , and have launched programmes to solve them .
The report makes it clear that the country now has the money to fix some of these problems .

Since mid-October , Dodge has been rolling out its 2009 Ram truck with a set of commercials that run during NFL and college football games and elsewhere testosterone flows .
These ads " feature " Dodge Ram trucks being driven into flaming buildings and around , through and over other kinds of obstacles .
The slogan is " Never Back Down . "
The " shock - and - awe " ads direct you to a Yahoo website : ramchallenge.com for a series of webisodes .
Here 's the trailer , all part of a multimillion , multimedia extravangza that 's enough to make you sick .
What we have here are four groups of grunting set - extras billed as actual contestants on a pseudo - reality show set in a hostile environment .
They are labelled : Military , Cowboys , Contractors , and Firemen , which made me think of the Village People .
Presumably each pair reflects a well - researched segment of the American truck - buying population who might just get so excited by these commercials that they 'd actually buy a gas - guzzling Ram truck , something that many will have trouble affording .
Remember , during this same period Chrysler has also been desperately trying to persuade GM to buy them .
Step back from the flash and fury here and you 'll see a metaphor for the challenges faced by US auto industry ; you 'll see these ads as a story about what 's happening not in the desert but in Detroit .
Quick , jump in an oversized American - made truck , see how fast it can go downhill without crashing , next tow a heavy trailer ( pensions ? ) along hair - pin curves without tumbling down a hillside , and then go try to build and cross a makeshift bridge without dropping into a deep gully .
During this race to the finish , you 're running out of time and trying to avoid disaster .
The media in helicopters hover above you , following your every move , waiting to move in .
Even if you make it , the group that finishes last is eliminated .
It 's like we 're watching a dream sequence from a movie about a US auto industry exec !
Wake up , wake up !
To place a bet this size selling the wrong product at the wrong time is like pushing all your chips to the middle of the poker table and bluffing with a pair of threes .
Is there any way any of the auto companies win ?
Do you and other US taxpayers want to add your own money to their pile ?
Never Back Down ?
Never Surrender ?
How is this for a new slogan : " Hold On ! "
It 's better than " Fold . "
The oddest thing about the Ram Challenge reality - ad is the warning that accompanies it : " Chrysler , LLC , Dodge and its Agencies insist that no one attempt to replicate the activity on this site . "
No , few of us have this kind of budget , even if such " stupid fun " somehow made sense for anyone to want to do .
Perhaps Dodge and its Agencies should go back and look at this Depression - era truck ad also produced at a time when it was equally tough to sell cars .
This is back when car companies could look their customer in the eye and speak with some honesty about their products .

Johns Hopkins scientists who have spent decades researching the effects of caffeine report that a slew of caffeinated energy drinks now on the market should carry prominent labels that note caffeine doses and warn of potential health risks for consumers .
" The caffeine content of energy drinks varies over a 10 - fold range , with some containing the equivalent of 14 cans of Coca - Cola , yet the caffeine amounts are often unlabeled and few include warnings about the potential health risks of caffeine intoxication , " says Roland Griffiths , Ph.D. , one of the authors of the article that appears in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence this month .
The market for these drinks stands at an estimated $ 5.4 billion in the United States and is expanding at a rate of 55 percent annually .
Advertising campaigns , which principally target teens and young adults , promote the performance - enhancing and stimulant effects of energy drinks and appear to glorify drug use .
Without adequate , prominent labeling ; consumers most likely wo n't realize whether they are getting a little or a lot of caffeine .
" It 's like drinking a serving of an alcoholic beverage and not knowing if its beer or scotch , " says Griffiths .
Caffeine intoxication , a recognized clinical syndrome included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and the World Health Organization 's International Classification of Diseases , is marked by nervousness , anxiety , restlessness , insomnia , gastrointestinal upset , tremors , rapid heartbeats ( tachycardia ) , psychomotor agitation ( restlessness and pacing ) and in rare cases , death .
Reports to U.S. poison control centers of caffeine abuse showed bad reactions to the energy drinks .
In a 2007 survey of 496 college students , 51 percent reported consuming at least one energy drink during the last month .
Of these energy drink users , 29 percent reported " weekly jolt and crash episodes , " and 19 percent reported heart palpitations from drinking energy drinks .
This same survey revealed that 27 percent of the students surveyed said they mixed energy drinks and alcohol at least once in the past month .
" Alcohol adds another level of danger , " says Griffiths , " because caffeine in high doses can give users a false sense of alertness that provides incentive to drive a car or in other ways put themselves in danger . "
A regular 12 - ounce cola drink has about 35 milligrams of caffeine , and a 6 - ounce cup of brewed coffee has 80 to 150 milligrams of caffeine .
Because many energy drinks are marketed as " dietary supplements , " the limit that the Food and Drug Administration requires on the caffeine content of soft drinks ( 71 milligrams per 12 - ounce can ) does not apply .
The caffeine content of energy drinks varies from 50 to more than 500 milligrams .
" It 's notable that over - the - counter caffeine - containing products require warning labels , yet energy drinks do not , " says Chad Reissig , Ph.D. , one of the study 's authors .
Griffiths notes that most of the drinks advertise their products as performance enhancers and stimulants – a marketing strategy that may put young people at risk for abusing even stronger stimulants such as the prescription drugs amphetamine and methylphenidate ( Ritalin ) .
A 2008 study of 1,253 college students found that energy drink consumption significantly predicted subsequent non-medical prescription stimulant use , raising the concern that energy drinks might serve as " gateway " products to more serious drugs of abuse .
Potentially feeding that " transition " market , Griffiths says , are other energy drinks with alluring names such as the powdered energy drink additive " Blow " ( which is sold in " vials " and resembles cocaine powder ) and the " Cocaine " energy drink .
Both of these products use the language of the illegal drug trade .

From 1:43 to 2:16 , check out how swift and nimble the reading of that poem is !
The first person who tries to draw a line between W.H. Auden and hip - hop history gets sneered at , but it 's still very interesting to see that something so much LIKE a certain kind of latter - day hip - hop was innovated back then .
I 've heard poems set to music before of course but that was singularly percussive for a blend of considered imagery and rhythmic device .
And now Buck 65 does basically the exact same thing at least some of the time .

Mesothelioma , which often follows asbestosis , is rare .
But since I have a writing assignment on these topics , I thought I ’d share some websites .
I really wanted to do a post on refugees – and still have it planned for the future – but I ’ll need more time .
Since I had an electric problem in the house that led to living over a week with no electricity and some overdue deadlines , I had to force myself to skip my blog writing .
I found it interesting that while I was gone my blog post on Plane Crash Statistics was the most popular post .
Kinda wish the people were searching for ways to stop world poverty instead .
And I wish this war in Congo would stop .
Every time I read articles on refugee children and orphaned babies I want to cry .
Back in the US , and other areas of the world , some of the older folks are suffering from a cancer called mesothelioma .
Mesothelioma is caused from exposure to asbestos , although cases have been reported where asbestos exposure was n’t evident .
Asbestos use has not been eliminated , but it is subject to regulations in the US and many parts of the world .
Unfortunately , there are many countries that have not yet regulated its use .
The statistics for mesothelioma are grim , and survival is usually estimated to be less than a year after diagnosis .
But there are survivors and stories of hope and survivors .
Clinical trials , persistent research , and ignoring statistics seem to be the secret to mesothelioma survival .
In the hopes of helping someone find treatment , I 'm going to end this short post with some links that will help in a search for a clinical trial .
Time is short .
The faster people can find information for help , the greater the possibility of a cure .
If you 're worried about asbestos in your home , You can easily order an Asbestos Test Kit to test for asbestos in your home .
This at - home asbestos kit is under $ 10.00 , and only costs $ 20.00 to get test results that meet ( and exceed ) EPA standards using the latest polarized light microscopy .
A home mold testing kit is available for the same price , as are other home health hazard kits that can notify you of harmful invisible dangers in your home .
Each of these test at home kits are far cheaper than the hundreds of dollars it would cost to have an inspector investigate your home ( plus their laboratory fees ) - yet all testing follows the same EPA standards .
Do you know someone who has had mesothelioma ?
There might be compensation available through a Mesothelioma trust fund .
You can also help them find clinical trials for treatment .

Doctors working in a hospital where all the bodies , including that of the terrorists , were taken said they had not seen anything like this in their lives .
" Bombay has a long history of terror .
I have seen bodies of riot victims , gang war and previous terror attacks like bomb blasts .
But this was entirely different .
It was shocking and disturbing , " a doctor said .
Asked what was different about the victims of the incident , another doctor said : " It was very strange .
I have seen so many dead bodies in my life , and was yet traumatised .
A bomb blast victim's body might have been torn apart and could be a very disturbing sight .
But the bodies of the victims in this attack bore such signs about the kind of violence of urban warfare that I am still unable to put my thoughts to words , " he said .
Asked specifically if he was talking of torture marks , he said : " It was apparent that most of the dead were tortured .
What shocked me were the telltale signs showing clearly how the hostages were executed in cold blood , " one doctor said .
The other doctor , who had also conducted the post - mortem of the victims , said : " Of all the bodies , the Israeli victims bore the maximum torture marks .
It was clear that they were killed on the 26th itself .
It was obvious that they were tied up and tortured before they were killed .
It was so bad that I do not want to go over the details even in my head again , " he said .
Corroborating the doctors ' claims about torture was the information that the Intelligence Bureau had about the terror plan .
" During his interrogation , Ajmal Kamal said they were specifically asked to target the foreigners , especially the Israelis , " an IB source said .
It is also said that the Israeli hostages were killed on the first day as keeping them hostage for too long would have focused too much international attention .
" They also might have feared the chances of Israeli security agencies taking over the operations at the Nariman House , " he reasoned .
On the other hand , there is enough to suggest that the terrorists also did not meet a clean , death .
The doctors who conducted the post mortem said the bodies of the terrorists were beyond recognition .
" Their faces were beyond recognition . "
There was no way of identifying them , " he said .
Asked how , if this is the case , they knew the bodies were indeed those of the terrorists , he said : " The security forces that brought the bodies told us that those were the bodies of the terrorists , " he said , adding there was no other way they could have identified the bodies .
An intelligence agency source added : " One of the terrorists was shot through either eye . "
A senior National Security Guard officer , who had earlier explained the operation in detail to rediff.com , said the commandos went all out after they ascertained that there were no more hostages left .
When asked if the commandos attempted to capture them alive at that stage , he replied : " Unko bachana kaun chahega ( Who will want to save them ) ? "
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A senior U.S. lawmaker plans to introduce a bill in January that would bar Internet providers like AT&T Inc from blocking Web content , setting up a renewed battle over so - called network neutrality .
Democratic Senators Harry Reid ( R ) and Byron Dorgan talk in Bogota November 28 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Daniel Munoz
Sen . Byron Dorgan , a North Dakota Democrat , believes a law is essential to prevent telephone and cable companies from discriminating against Internet content , even though regulators have taken actions to enforce free Web principles , a top Dorgan aide said on Thursday .
“ We feel that legislation is definitely necessary , ” said Frannie Wellings , telecom counsel to Dorgan , speaking at a University of Nebraska law school event on changes in telecom law after the election of Democrat Barack Obama .
Dorgan has been influential on the issue , and will be among the highest ranking Democrats on the Senate ’s Commerce Committee when it reconvenes in January .
The net neutrality fight pits Internet service providers ( ISPs ) like AT&T against content companies like Google Inc and Microsoft Corp .
The ISPs , which also include Verizon Communications Inc. and cable company Comcast Corp , say they need to manage the ever - growing traffic on their networks without government interference .
Content companies say the ISPs hold too power much to block or slow down traffic requiring more bandwidth , such as movie downloads , or certain content altogether .
President - elect Barack Obama supports net neutrality legislation .
The election of Obama and more Democrats who back the concept adds momentum to the cause , Wellings said .
A recent Federal Communications Commission decision ordering Comcast to stop impeding the sharing of certain content between users proves regulators already have the authority , an AT&T official said .
“ The current ( FCC ) principles already deal with unreasonable discrimination , ” said Jim Cicconi , AT&T executive vice president for regulatory affairs , pointing to the Comcast case .
The public would not pay for its Internet services if AT&T discriminated against content , he added .
“ We ’d be shooting ourselves in the foot . ”
Comcast is suing the FCC over the issue , and much depends on the outcome of that case , experts said .
If the court sides with Comcast , legislation will become much more likely .
“ The telephone and cable companies say trust them , ” said Markham Erickson , director of the Open Internet Coalition , a trade group that lobbies for net neutrality , with members such as Google and eBay Inc .
“ We will trust but verify . ”
Hypo Real Estate is Germany 's second biggest property lender A top German bank is on the brink of collapse after a 35bn euro ( $ 48 bn ; £ 27.2 bn ) rescue plan collapsed .
Germany 's second - largest commercial property lender , Hypo Real Estate , said a banking consortium had withdrawn their support for the deal .
Correspondents say its failure will put further strain on financial institutions in other countries .
The news came after EU leaders at a Paris summit refused to commit to a US - style rescue plan for banks .
Hypo Real Estate , which has large amounts of bad debt , has suffered from the credit squeeze in international markets .
The bank said a consortium of German financial institutions involved in a government - led rescue plan pulled out of the negotiations after refusing to come up with nearly 35bn euros ( $ 50 bn ; £ 28 bn ) for a bail - out .
The reasons why the consortium pulled out are unclear but a Hypo Real Estate spokesman said the property lender was fighting for its survival .
Some analysts are saying the bank will not last more than a few days without a rescue package , so action must be taken before the markets open on Monday .
Another meeting of government representatives and private bankers is expected to take place on Sunday .
Executive ' sanctions ' Correspondents say if Hypo Real Estate does collapse it could plunge already volatile markets even further into debt .
It has to be indicated to the markets ... that European countries will not react as every man for himself

How to solve crisis
Send us your comments
No business rush to Irish banks News of the failed plan came as leaders of the major European economies met in the French capital for talks hosted by President Nicolas Sarkozy .
Britain , Germany , Italy and France all agreed to work together to support financial institutions but did not agree to set up a big rescue fund similar to that of the US .
They decided instead to seek a relaxation of the EU rules governing the amount of money individual states can borrow .
The leaders also issued a joint call for a G8 summit " as soon as possible " to review the rules governing financial markets .
Mr Sarkozy announced a series of other measures - including unspecified action against the executives of failed banks .
Speaking after the meeting at a joint news conference , he said the four had agreed that the leaders of a financial institution that had to be rescued should be " sanctioned " .
The French president added : " Each government will operate with its own methods and means , but in a co-ordinated manner . "
Meanwhile German Chancellor Angela Merkel called on EU countries not to take steps at home that could cause problems for other member states .
The Irish and Greek governments have been criticised within the EU for deciding to act independently by guaranteeing to protect all savings deposited in their banks .
' Trial by fire ' UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown , meanwhile , called on European leaders to send the message that " no sound , solvent bank should be allowed to fail through lack of liquidity " .
EU leaders are under pressure to contain the financial contagion
He also said the meeting had agreed to ask the European Investment Fund to release 15bn euros ( $ 21bn ; £ 12 bn ) in loans to help small businesses operate .
The head of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , Dominique Strauss - Kahn , had earlier urged EU action , saying the financial crisis was presenting Europe with a " trial by fire " .
He held talks with Mr Sarkozy before the EU leaders ' meeting and said although the EU was a more complex organisation than the US , Europe needed to take " concerted collective action " .
Mr Strauss - Kahn said it had to be " indicated to the markets ... that European countries will not react as every man for himself " .
He also said he would be scaling back his world economic growth forecasts .
Calls for European action followed the bail - out of both Bradford and Bingley in the UK and Fortis Bank by the governments of Belgium , Luxembourg and the Netherlands .
But the president of the European Parliament has criticised the summit , warning that the leaders of Europe 's four largest economies have no power to decide for the entire European Union .

What are these ?
But mocking religious " nut cases " is cheap and easy .
By heaping scorn on the worst examples of anything , including medicine , law , politics , or even atheism , one can make it look evil .
But the culture war of competing anecdotes becomes a standoff .
One person counters religion - inspired 9/11 leader Mohammed Atta with religion - inspired Martin Luther King , Jr. Another counters the genocidal crusades with the genocidal atheists , Stalin and Mao .
But as we social scientists like to say , the plural of anecdote is not data .
Religious belief is irrational .
The harm caused by religious belief outweighs the good that comes from religious belief .
These indications of the personal and social benefits of faith do n't speak to its truth claims .
And truth ultimately is what matters .
( If religious claims were shown to be untrue , though comforting and adaptive , what honest person would choose to believe ?
And if religious claims were shown to be true , though discomfiting , what honest person would choose to disbelieve ? )
But they do challenge the anecdote - based new atheist argument that religion is generally a force for evil .
Moreover , they help point us toward a humble spirituality that worships
God with open minds as well as open hearts , toward an alternative to purposeless scientism and dogmatic fundamentalism , toward a faith that helps make sense of the universe , gives meaning to life , opens us to the transcendent , connects us in supportive communities , provides a mandate for morality and selflessness , and offers hope in the face of adversity and death .
By presenting case after case of the most vile examples of Christian extremism , atheists are ignoring the greater good religion brings to most people .
This is the claim of psychology professor David G. Myers .
According to Dr. Myers , focusing on anecdotes while neglecting large scale data from the social sciences obscures the picture and deepens America 's cultural divide .
I think he may have a point , but I also think that his analysis is missing something of critical importance .
Here is the crux of Dr. Myers ' argument in his own words : Perhaps we should call Dr. Myers out on his misunderstanding of what motivated Stalin , Mao , and others ( hint : it was n't atheism ) .
After all , the difference between the anecdotes of religious extremists and atheists is that the former is fairly clear - cut and rarely disputed while the latter is based on ignorance and misinterpretation of facts .
Fair enough , but let 's set this aside for now .
What Dr. Myers is claiming is that while religious belief can be destructive in individual cases , it is a positive social force if we focus on group data .
Perhaps we should take him to task for apparently forgetting that correlation does not equal causation .
Nothing in his data can be interpreted as suggesting that religious beliefcharitable behavior .
That someone who has authored reputable introductory psychology texts would forget this is suspicious to say the least .
But let 's also set this aside for now .
Instead , I want us to take Dr. Myers at his word that religious belief is positively correlated with " human happiness , health , and altruism . "
How does this cast any doubt on the claims of the so - called " new atheists " Myers seeks to scold ?
The atheistic objection to religion centers on two claims
The first claim is rarely disputed today , even by theists .
I have addressed this extensively in countless posts and will thus present only a brief summary here .
As Carl Sagan reminded us , the sort of evidence needed to verify a claim is proportional to the nature of the claim .
Religious claims have nothing approaching the sort of evidence needed for verification .
Theists know this and resort to faith instead .
In fact , they make faith into a virtue and praise each other for their willingness to take the leap of faith necessary to believe religious claims .
But believing things without evidence and on the basis of faith is the very definition of irrationality Unlike the first claim ( i.e. , religious belief is irrational ) , which enjoys wide acceptance among theists and atheists alike , the second is a source of great controversy .
Unfortunately , this claim is precisely what Dr. Myers seems to have misunderstood , intentionally or otherwise .
No atheist author I have encountered claims that no good whatsoever can come from religious belief .
No atheist author Myers cites has claimed that in any of their books , and I have read them all .
What they claim is that the bad outweighs the good .
At no point is the good denied .
Most atheists are fully aware of the data Dr. Myers presents .
We just do n't find it sufficiently compelling that we 're willing to ignore the other side .
I 've read enough of Dr. Myers ' work to be familiar with his data on religion and happiness .
There are many positive correlates of religious belief and religious practices .
I 've yet to meet an informed atheist who would deny this .
The straw man Myers has constructed for this article is hollow indeed .
By making precisely the sort of error of which he accuses the " new atheists , " Myers reveals that he is motivated by something other than scientific understanding or healing the cultural divide .
Nevertheless , Myers must be commended for this admission :
If only he had stopped there .
But he continues the preceding paragraph in such a way that his motives and misunderstanding of atheism are once again revealed : Again , the claim is not that " religion is generally a force for evil " but that the harm caused by religion outweighs the benefits .
Science is anything but purposeless , and if Dr. Myers really feels this way , one can only wonder why he chose a scientific career .
I had sincerely hoped that he would dig himself out of the hole of his own making , but I was disappointed in this regard .
U.S. Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) greets supporters during a rally in Toledo , Ohio October 19 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Carlos Barria
UNITED NATIONS ( Reuters ) - John McCain ’s U.S. presidential election campaign has solicited a financial contribution from an unlikely source -- Russia ’s U.N. envoy -- but a McCain spokesman said on Monday it was a mistake .
In the letter , McCain urged Russia ’s U.N. Ambassador , Vitaly Churkin , to contribute anywhere from $ 35 to $ 5,000 to help ensure McCain ’s victory over Democratic rival Sen. Barack Obama , currently ahead in voter preference polls .
“ If I have the honor of continuing to serve you , I make you this promise :
We will always put America -- her strength , her ideals , her future -- before every other consideration , ” McCain assured Churkin .
Moscow ’s mission to the United Nations issued a terse statement on the Republican presidential candidate ’s letter , saying that the Russian government and its officials “ do not finance political activity in foreign countries . ”
A spokesman for McCain , a long - time critic of Russia , had a simple explanation for the fundraising letter ’s arrival at the Russian mission in New York : “ It was an error in the mailing list . ”
The letter was addressed to Churkin and sported a McCain signature near the bottom .
Earlier this month , both McCain and Obama harshly criticized Russia for invading Georgia two months ago , but neither was willing to say yes when asked if Russia under Prime Minister Vladimir Putin was the “ evil empire ” .
It is illegal for U.S. presidential candidates to accept funds from foreign sources .
The McCain campaign accused Obama earlier this month of not doing enough to screen for illegal contributors and asked U.S. election officials to investigate .
McCain has agreed to public financing for his campaign and therefore cannot accept funds from private donors .

Jonathan Haidt studies how — and why — we evolved to be moral and political creatures .
Why you should listen
By understanding more about our moral psychology and its biases , Jonathan Haidt says we can design better institutions ( including companies , universities and democracy itself ) , and we can learn to be more civil and open - minded toward those who are not on our team .
Haidt is a social psychologist whose research on morality across cultures led to his 2008 TED Talk on the psychological roots of the American culture war , and his 2013 TED Talk on how " common threats can make common ground . "
In both of those talks he asks , " Ca n't we all disagree more constructively ? "
Haidt's 2012 TED
Talk explored the intersection of his work on morality with his work on happiness to talk about " hive psychology " -- the ability that humans have to lose themselves in groups pursuing larger projects , almost like bees in a hive .
This hivish ability is crucial , he argues , for understanding the origins of morality , politics , and religion .
These are ideas that Haidt develops at greater length in his book , The Righteous Mind : Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion .
Haidt joined New York University Stern School of Business in July 2011 .
He is the Thomas Cooley Professor of Ethical Leadership , based in the Business and Society Program .
Before coming to Stern , Professor Haidt taught for 16 years at the University of Virginia in the department of psychology .
Haidt 's writings appear frequently in the New York Times and The Wall Street Journal .
He was named one of the top global thinkers by Foreign Policy magazine and by Prospect magazine .
Haidt received a B.A. in Philosophy from Yale University , and an M.A. and Ph.D. in Psychology from the University of Pennsylvania .

Google really did capture those scenes when it sent a car equipped with cameras down the Pittsburgh street Sampsonia Way in May to take photographs for its online maps .
But these images and most of the other scenes caught on Sampsonia were staged by artists Ben Kinsley and Robin Hewlett .
The two set out to explore the boundaries of the real and virtual worlds after Pittsburgh became included in Street View .
The feature on Google Maps allows viewers to click on pictures providing panoramic street - level views so online users can get a feel for wherever they might be heading .
Is there metered parking ?
A place to eat ?
What 's the neighbourhood like ?
Like many first - time Street View users , Kinsley and Hewlett , then roommates , typed in their address and found their house .
Kinsley and Hewlett soon found themselves discussing surveillance and virtual reality , and began considering how they might explore those issues and Street View through art .
" But instead of dwelling on the darker undertones of these issues , we began to think about ways of playing with the system , " Kinsley said in an email interview from Iceland , where he is participating in an artist residency .
The Street With a View project was his master of fine arts thesis project at Carnegie Mellon University .
" We were interested in interjecting something staged , something fictional , into Street View and playing with - and subtly questioning - the notion of reality in something that we perceive as a factual representation of our world , " said Kinsley , 26 .
This idea draws some of its inspiration from the way that Google Street View has preserved many random , mundane moments in time as its cameras have swept through cities capturing images .
In one city , a woman can be seen leaning over in the seat of pickup truck with its door open , inadvertently flashing her thong underwear .
Elsewhere a man is climbing a building , apparently breaking in .
Another photo in Street View finds a man passed out on the ground .
Street View has a video game - like quality that lets users navigate through a street , and Hewlett said she considers the scenes she and Kinsley created as a sort of virtual reward for online explorers .
" We attempted a balance between the subtle and the spectacular , " said Hewlett , 28 .
" Seen individually , any one of these things may not raise your curiosity that much ... but coupled together , you may start to question a little more . "
Google - whose own employees posed outside the company 's headquarters in Mountain View , California , as its Street View vehicle rolled by - joined in the fun in Pittsburgh after Kinsley and Hewlett contacted the company .
Google sent its cameras down Sampsonia on a prearranged day .
" There are all sorts of quirky things that appear organically in Street View , such as a giant rocking chair in Indiana or a wedding in France , which is why this art project was so fascinating , " Google spokeswoman Elaine Filadelfo said .
" It spoke to the fact that you never know what you may discover , natural or man-made , while exploring the world via Street View . "
The Mattress Factory , a contemporary art museum on Sampsonia , also helped by connecting the artists with volunteers who staged the scenes .
Though the Google car photographed all the scenes in one day , Kinsley said it took months to plan .

Celebrities Not So Perfect Pictures
Now - we have all had those days where it would benefit everyone if we did not get our picture taken .
These celebrities are probably wishing they had an ounce of control of where there faces would end up .
These photos are not horrible , they are just the ones that you would quickly rip up before anyone had a chance to see them .

It 's a hard life raising crops in Australia , as farmers often remind the 85 per cent of Australians who live on the coast .
Recent rains in New South Wales provided a bit of relief from the worst drought in a century , but now those living on the land face another challenge : locusts .
Swarms of the crop-munching insects are sweeping across drought - affected areas and feasting on grass and weeds sprouting at roadsides following the rain .
In western New South Wales , near the country town of Condobolin , a swarm measuring four miles long by 560 feet wide was spotted last week .
The extra food could increase the number of eggs that the locusts lay , with the next generation expected to begin hatching in mid-December .
That is a nightmare prospect for farmers as they prepare to harvest their crops , in some cases for the first time in several years , after successive crop failures caused by the drought .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The Australian Bureau of Meteorology , meanwhile , is forecasting a swelteringly hot summer that will add to farmers ' woes , as well as increasing the likelihood of bushfires and their ferocity .
On the coast , amid rising ocean temperatures , record numbers of jellyfish have been recorded , along with giant schools of baby sharks .
The locusts have been sighted in plague numbers across large areas of New South Wales , where the state government has distributed enough chemicals to spray nearly 200 square miles on hundreds of properties .
The state 's primary industries minister , Ian Macdonald , said that many hoppers , or juveniles , would grow wings over the next few weeks , so it was important to control numbers before that happened .
Nine locust - busting planes are also on standby to treat the swarms if they grow larger or thicker .
At the moment , they are rated as low or medium density .
Mr Macdonald sought to reassure farmers , saying there was no need to panic .
" We are monitoring the situation , " he said .
" It 's important to realise that most of the state 's crops are in the final stages of maturity and close to harvest , so are brown in colour .
Fortunately this means they are not as attractive to locusts , which prefer green plants . "
He warned , however , that " anything growing at this point of time would be attacked fairly severely by locusts " .
The insects are notoriously voracious , swarming through an area and consuming everything in sight , particularly green vegetation .
There are stories of them eating green clothes hanging on washing lines , stripping green paint off walls or water tanks , and destroying green shade - cloth .
Adult locusts can travel more than 400 miles in a single night 's flight , and they lay up to 50 eggs each at one time .
This year 's outbreak is forecast to be the worst since 2004 , when locusts bred furiously following floods and went on to devastate crops in two states .
In 2001 , swarms containing 100 billion insects were recorded .
Australian authorities battling the pests have sometimes been assisted by good fortune .
In the past , large numbers have perished after landing in the ocean by mistake .
Mr Macdonald said : " We 're calling on farmers to remain very vigilant and to keep checking their properties , because if we do get further hatching and further development of locusts , these swarms could end up quite large and pose further problems . "
One farmer , Selwyn Geddes , told Country News website that he had no time to spray the insects because he was too busy harvesting .
" At one end of the paddock we have sheep and at the other we have hoppers , " he said .
The air turned blue this evening as Tory mayor Boris Johnson 's novelist sister Rachel Johnson beat Labour 's notorious spin doctor Alastair Campbell to take this year 's Bad Sex in Fiction award .
The Literary Review 's annual award was presented to Johnson for her novel Shire Hell at a ceremony at London 's In and Out club .
A lifetime achievement award was also given to John Updike after the American author realised the " unique achievement " of four consecutive nominations for the award .
Johnson was singled out for her novel 's slew of animal metaphors , including comparing her male protagonist 's " light fingers " to " a moth caught inside a lampshade " , and his tongue to " a cat lapping up a dish of cream so as not to miss a single drop " .
Literary Review deputy editor Tom Fleming was also disturbed by the heroine 's " grab , to put him , now angrily slapping against both our bellies , inside " .
" You sort of think it might be a typo , but she is actually referring to his penis as him .
It 's a mixture of cliché and euphemism , but it 's also very spirited – A plus for effort , " he said .
" All the entries were equally awful this year , but Rachel Johnson had the worst metaphors , and the worst animal metaphors . "
Johnson said it was an " absolute honour " to win , taking her place alongside former winners including Norman Mailer , Sebastian Faulks and Tom Wolfe .
" I 'm not feeling remotely grumpy about it .
I know that men with literary reputations to polish might find it insulting , " she said , " but if you 've had a book published in the year any attention is welcome , even if it 's slightly dubious attention of this sort . "
She received a plaster foot – intended to be an abstract representation of sex , according to Fleming - presented by The Wire actor Dominic West , at tonight 's ceremony , attended by 400 guests .
Updike was not present to accept his lifetime achievement award .
" Four times in a row is unique , " said Fleming .
" He 's written great sex in the past but this seems to be gratuitous . "
Updike , famous for his close attention to sex , was shortlisted this year for his novel The Widows of Eastwick , in which an abundance of sperm greets the performance of oral sex .
" She said nothing then , her lovely mouth otherwise engaged , until he came , all over her face .
She had gagged , and moved him outside her lips , rubbing his spurting glans across her cheeks and chin , " he writes .
" God , she was antique , but here they were .
Her face gleamed with his jism in the spotty light of the motel room , there on the far end of East Beach , within sound of the sea . "
Alastair Campbell failed to get past the judges ' first post with his debut novel All in the Mind , as did fellow shortlistees Kathy Lette , James Buchan , Simon Montefiore and Isabel Fonseca .
Johnson praised the award for discouraging authors from using " awful phrases " such as last year 's winner Norman Mailer 's " soft as a coil of excrement " description of a penis .
" The truth is that anyone who writes sex scenes has [ the award ] at the back of their mind , " she said .
" It makes you even more self - conscious when you 're lubricating your book with sex . "
While vowing to attempt to emulate Updike 's achievement – " he sets the bar very high " – Johnson admitted that , as yet , her new novel is so far devoid of sexual content .
She is the 16th winner of the award , established by Auberon Waugh to " gently dissuade " authors from including " unconvincing , perfunctory , embarrassing or redundant passages of a sexual nature in otherwise sound literary novels " .
Food is not only necessary for our survival but it can also provide a way to manage stress .
Stress can create a lot of problems to our mental and physical health .
Managing stress with food is about consuming those foods that can give your body those ingredients and energy to cope with the daily life obligations that are the major causes of stress .
Foods that can help you manage stress
Foods rich in protein – Gain More energy
You can manage stress by consuming foods rich in protein .
The proteins are broken into amino acid during the process of digestion .
A particular amino acid , the tyrosine , contributes to the increase of chemicals dopamine and epinephrine , which have the capacity to give the body energy and to keep you vigilant .
Foods that have high concentration of protein are meat , poultry , fish , eggs and dairy products .
Carbohydrates – Calm and relaxation
Consuming foods containing carbohydrates can help you relax and get relief from stress .
Carbohydrates , during the digestion process create serotonin , a substance that causes a sense of relaxation and makes you calm .
Foods to help you reduce stress are cereals , pasta , rice , pulses , fruits and vegetables that are rich in complex carbohydrates .
Folic Acid – Manage Bad mood and depression
Treat possible symptoms of grief and depression by consuming foods that contain folic acid .
Lack of folic acid in the organism is responsible for reducing the levels of serotonin .
Folic acid is detected in spinach and natural orange juice .
Selenium – Manage Emotional Stress
Treat the emotional stress and possible depression crisis by hiring selenium .
The selenium exists in sunflower , cereal or even in a tuna sandwich .
Choline – Boost your memory
Enhance your memory and boost your concentration by consuming foods rich in choline .
The choline belongs to B complex vitamins and contributes to the secretion of the chemical acetylcholine in the brain , which is related to the strengthening of memory .
The Choline is present in eggs .
It is proven that people who lack this nutrient experience memory problems and they are more vulnerable to Alzheimer ’s disease .
Foods that cause stress
Caffeine .
The caffeine acts as a stimulant .
In reasonable quantities improves mental abilities by causing vigilance .
Excessive consumption of caffeine may lead to stress , anxiety and insomnia .
Try to limit the daily intake of caffeine and you will notice that this will also reduce your stressful reactions and we help you manage stress better .
Alcohol .
Many are those who consume alcohol in order to reduce their anxiety and stress .
It is scientifically proven that consuming small amounts of alcohol helps to relax .
Large quantities are more likely to increase stress and cause sleep disorders .
Nicotine .
Although many believe that nicotine and smoking contributes to relaxation , in reality it actually increases stress levels .
Many former smokers report that , when they stop smoking , they experience a better mental well - being and feel morerelaxed and in general they have better confidence in managing their stress .
The body through healthy diet is able to effectively manage stress and to cope with the hectic pace of our lives .
So if the tension and anxiety are prevalent in your daily life , adjust your diet to your daily needs , in order to improve your well - being and vitality and be able to cope with your obligations .
Amy Winehouse Cocaine Cotton Candy
has found a new use for her $ 1200 cotton candy machine , mixing cocaine with the candy confection .
Winehouse , 25 , was introduced to the cotton candy and cocaine combination when Babyshambles guitarist Mik Whitnall mixed the drug into a batch as a joke .
According to News of the World , “ He and some pals sprinkled a wrap of coke into the mixture and Amy started eating it before she realized what they ’d done .
She now thinks it ’s a hoot to do the same . ”
A source says that Amy has now started making the concoction a regular at parties she hosts in her house .
Brilliant idea .
Now the drug - addled singer can get her cocaine and sugar high all at once .
As you can see in the photos of Amy Winehouse below , drugs are taking a toll on the songstress .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- U.S. weekly jobless claims remained at their highest level in seven years , the Labor Department reported Thursday , as people in the hurricane - hit states of Louisiana and Texas filed for benefits .
For the week ended Sept. 27 , seasonally adjusted first - time claims for unemployment benefits rose 1,000 , to 497,000 - the highest level since late September 2001 .
Without the hurricane - related effects , initial claims would have been about 439,000 .
The four - week average of claims rose 11,500 to 474,000 -- the highest since October 2001 .
For the week ended Sept. 20 , continuing claims rose 48,000 to 3.59 million -- the highest since September 2003 .
The four - week average of continuing claims rose 46,750 to 3.53 million -- the highest since October 2003 .
In the letter al - Qaeda 's leadership pays tribute to Iran 's generosity , stating that without its " monetary and infrastructure assistance " it would have not been possible for the group to carry out the terror attacks .
It also thanked Iran for having the " vision " to help the terror organisation establish new bases in Yemen after al - Qaeda was forced to abandon much of its terrorist infrastructure in Iraq and Saudi Arabia .
As noted here here , one of Obama ’s transition “ team members is Reed Hundt , who was Bill Clinton ’s FCC Chair from 1993 through 1997 .
Hundt is slated to work on the agency review team in charge of international trade and economics agencies . ”
In a 2006 Forbes op - ed , Hundt had various suggestions for patent reform .
They are not all terrible , but they continue to miss the point by struggling to find some way to make the system work better .
Part of his proposal is to reduce the number of patents granted , increase fees , and increase funding of the USPTO .
Writes Hundt : “ First , we should slash the number of patents granted each year by 90 % .
In 2004 the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office issued 165,000 patents .
Sixteen thousand is more like an optimal number . ”
He proposes a $ 500 k fee companies can pay for a “ fast - track ” one - year patent application review .
Typical bureaucratic hubris to think he knows the “ optimal ” number of patents –though technically he is right that 16,000 is “ more like ” an optimal number than is 165,000 , since the optimal number is zero .
This is not dissimilar to another recent proposal to improve patent quality and reduce the number of patents granted by radically increasing filing fees from the $ 1000 level to about $ 50,000 .
As Manuel Lora noted to me , this is like the Laffer Curve of Patents ( see Rothbard ’s evisceration of the Laffer Curve ) .
Such high fees would of course reduce the number of patents , but would also tend to benefit large corporations .
These guys ought to give up trying to fine - tune an inherently unjust system and just admit it ought to be scrapped .
Hundt writes ,
“ We have a horribly expensive system , with huge backlogs and a daunting litigation risk .
No wonder the Chinese do n’t want to adopt it .
Let ’s get rid of it and start from scratch . ”
Well , he ’s half - right .
A few more responses to selected comments by Hundt :
Second , we need to spend more money on the system .
The budget of the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office is $ 1.5 billion .
That ought to be tripled to $ 4.5 billion . . .
Who do you mean , “ we , ” kemosabe ?
Not if it requires taxpayer funding .
We do n’t want grossly overworked professionals trying to figure out whether specific algorithms used to refresh the pixels on a computer monitor screen ought to be patented .
No , we want bright young Clintonite master bureaucrats !
Fourth , all patent case awards should be forward looking and linked to lost sales .
In other words , plaintiffs who win patent - infringement challenges should be able to enjoin only future competition .
I thought he was onto something with his first sentence , but then he shys away from radical reform by not urging the abolution of all patent injunctions .
A cool new browser event just recently landed in the latest Firefox nightlies : an event announcing when the browser re-draws a portion of the page .
This particular event , called MozAfterPaint fires whenever something is drawn to the screen .
The event object contains two properties : .clientRects and .boundingClientRect , both of which refer to the result of the associated DOM methods .
In a nutshell , boundingClientRect gives you a single rectangle encompassing the entire area in which a paint operation could ’ve taken place whereas clientRects gives you a number of rectangles , each encompassing an individual area that was drawn .
To test this I created a quick demo using CNN.com ( only works in the latest Firefox nightlies ) .
To use the demo let the page load then move your mouse around ( triggering new paint events ) .
When you ’re done simply click anywhere on the page to draw the overlay .
You can use the tracking script on any page , simply copy this bookmarklet to your toolbar in a Firefox 3.1 nightly : Track Paint .
Then activate it on a page where you wish to track paint events .
( Clicking anywhere on the page will show the results . )
For example I ran the bookmarklet on the jQuery.com homepage , moved my mouse over the navigation , hovered over the tooltips , and finally focused on the checkboxes before clicking – creating this complete visual effect :
The important part of the tracking code is as follows :
function log(e ) { store.push ( e.clientRects ) ; } //
To start logging ... window.addEventListener( " MozAfterPaint " , log , false ) ; //
After logging is done ... window.removeEventListener(" MozAfterPaint " , log , false ) ;
You have to be sure to do all of your logging in a separate part of the application ( do n’t do any rendering inside the MozAfterPaint event handler , otherwise you ’ll cause some recursion to occur ) .
Thus before you render the results the MozAfterPaint handler should be removed from the page .
It ’s likely that the primary use of this event will be within extensions ( such as Firebug ) mostly due to the fact that the overhead incurred by initiating this event is so high .
Nonetheless
I think this addition to the browser is absolutely fantastic .
Developers have been craving more information about what ’s going on underneath the hood and this is starting to provide exactly that .

Two genuine , officially issued and rather cheeky car numbers have gone for sale in UK for an impressive GBP 250,000 ( $ 463,000 ) .
Because the numbers ORG 45 M and PEN 15 are officially registered , anyone might mount them on their UK vehicle .
The price for the number that resembles the word " orgasm " is GBP 150,000 ( $ 278,000 ) and the one that looks like the word " penis " has a price of GBP 99,995 ( $ 185,000 ) .
The sellers , however , warn that those willing to buy the numbers should be ready for some extra attention .
No doubt that these numbers will attack a lot of attention .
A spokesman for regtransfers .
co.uk said that while they were driving with one of the numbers installed on their Smart car , motorists that passed by made a lot of " interesting " gestures and used their cell phones to take pictures .
The spokesman also mentioned that there were certain problems with selling the number plates due to the fact that newspapers refused to advertise them .
A popular British newspaper banned the advertisement of the number plates , though it publishes pictures of naked women on a daily basis .

Is Impeachment Too Little , Too Late ?
Less than six months before Bush leaves office , panel talks impeachment .
WASHINGTON , July 25 , 2008  --
Less than six months before President Bush leaves office , the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing today on whether he should be impeached .
As could be predicted , the hearing was highly partisan .
Democrats said they wanted accountability .
Republicans called the hearing a show trial .
People on both sides showed anger and emotion .
The hearing was about executive power and its constitutional limitations .
The Democrat - controlled Judiciary Committee is concerned the Bush administration exceeded its authority in several areas including the following : improper politicization of the Justice Dept ; misuse of presidential signing statements ; misuse of surveillance , detention , interrogation and rendition programs ; manipulation of intelligence and misuse of war powers ; improper retaliation and obstruction of justice in the Valerie Plame CIA agent outing case ; and misuse of executive privilege .
There were 13 witnesses , including current and former members of Congress , most of whom accused the Bush administration of abuse of power .
Democrats and Republicans on the Committee spent an hour on opening statements presenting their opinions either justifying Bush 's actions or accusing him of being the worst president in U.S. history .
Rep. John Conyers , D - Mich. , chairman of the committee , defended holding such a hearing while the president was on his way out of office .
" And we 're not done yet , " Conyers said .
" We do not intend to go away until we achieve the accountability that the Congress is entitled to and the American people deserve . "
Ranking Republican member Rep. Lamar Smith , R - Texas , disagreed .
" This week it seems that we are hosting an anger management class , " he said .
" Nothing is going to come out of this hearing with regard to impeachment of the president . "
But Democrat member Rep. Robert Wexler of Florida was angry at the president .
" Never before in the history of this nation has an administration so successfully diminished the constitutional powers of the legislative branch , " Wexler said .
" It is unacceptable , and it must not stand . "
Rep. Zoe Lofgren , D - Calif. , did n't mince words in her feelings about Bush .
" It is my judgment that President Bush is the worst president our country has ever suffered , " she said .
" Making judgments that have jeopardized our national security , impaired our economy , and diminished the freedom and civil liberties of the American people . "
Rep. Dan Lungren , R - Calif. , ridiculed the hearing .
" One wonders what we are becoming here .
When I was a kid growing up , we used to watch Friday night fights .
Now it looks like we have the Friday morning show trials , " he said .
His colleague , Rep. Trent Franks , R - Ariz. , agreed .
" It conducts a do - over hearing that amuses our terrorist friends greatly , and that would make Alice in Wonderland roll her eyes , " he declared .
One of the witnesses , Bruce Fein , a former Justice Department official , testified that he believes the president committed impeachable acts .
" The executive branch has vandalized the constitution every bit as much as the barbarians sacked Rome in 410 A.D. , " he told the committee .
Vincent Bugliosi , a former L.A. prosecutor , agreed .
" Whether Republican or Democrat , all Americans should be absolutely outraged over what the Bush administration has done , " he said .
" How dare they do what they did ?
How dare they ? "
But George Mason University law professor Jeremy Rabkin tried to bring the hearing into perspective .
" You should all remind yourselves , " he said , " that the rest of the country is not necessarily in this same bubble in which people think it is reasonable to describe the president as if he were Caligula . "
There is a line that a writer crosses when they decide that they want to be a writer , not a hobbyist .
The hobbyist can leave their writing for months on end and content themselves with the drudgery of their lives , never picking up a pen and never stressing at the vacuum of inspiration .
When someone crosses that line into budding author , they are doomed to feel the invisible ropes of writer ’s block tug them backwards from the page or the keys .
They must face the hunger of the empty page without the food of inspiration .
This post is born out of writer ’s block .
There are many types of writer ’s block .
In this post I aim to guilt you out of having them .
Symptoms : Unable to translate plan into paragraph .
Ca n’t think of how to start the first page .
Constantly crushing the page or deleting what you ’ve written .
Cause :
Your standards are too high and you ’re trying to be Harper Lee on your first draft .
Your perfectionism is killing your creativity .
Solution :
Be willing to write crap .
As Hemingway put it , “ The first draft of everything is shit . ”
If you ’re not writing , you ’re not a writer , so write .
It does n’t matter what you write , just write it and do n’t edit it until you ’ve written more than you ’re willing to discard .
As a writer you have to have faith in what you can do .
The day I knew I could become a writer was the day I realised I was supposed to edit my first draft , not publish it .
Symptoms : Constantly distracted , always finding something to do other than writing .
Real life keeps getting in the way .
Cause :
You ’ve forgotten how easy it is to write .
You ’re either building it up in your mind as something horribly difficult or tedious or even worse , you just do n’t care enough to hunger for it .
This is made worse by poor organisational skills or thinking that being a writer is any less demanding than any other job .
Solution :
Do n’t tackle a big project as the first thing you do when you sit down .
If you ’re writing a novel , write a diary entry or a blog post first .
If you do n’t feel inspired by your first scheduled task , do the second .
Whatever you do , write .
If you ’re at the point where you are n’t hungering to put down words and you have n’t written anything that day , start thinking about a nine to five job , it ’ll either scare you back to your work or be preparation for when you realise you wo n’t cut it as a writer .
Symptoms :
Do n’t know what happens next in the story .
Unable to ‘ feel ’ the story or some part of it such as characters .
There is no logical next step that you can feel immediately .
Causes : Lack of emotional involvement in your work .
Your mind is overloaded .
Solution : Step away from the page or keyboard , lock yourself in a room and just imagine the setting .
Do n’t think logically or structurally about the work , just get into a deeply mental space and let the parts of your subconscious mind that have been dwelling on this very question speak .
Your subconscious knows where to go next , it knows what it wants to write .
All story tellers , all writers , all artists have a part of their subconscious that will latch onto an idea and run with it whether you realise it or not .
There ’s a part of your subconscious for every idea you ’ve ever had .
Give it a chance to speak .
You wo n’t hear it if your thinking , you ’ll drown it out .
Listen to some Eckhart Tolle .
Symptoms : Ca n’t maintain focus on a single project until completion .
Started too many projects and can’t devote enough time to them .
Always starting never finishing .
This is a valid and crippling form of writer ’s block .
Cause :
Your muse is strong but you lack understanding of your muse and you lack discipline .
Solution :
Get your life sorted out .
Understand yourself or you ’ll never understand what you are trying to say .
Understanding what you are trying to say is just as important as understanding what you want to talk about .
You may think you want to talk about pirates , space ships and goblins but what you really want to express is discontent at the treatment of women in the workplace .
You may think you want to write a marketing blog but what you really want to express is your wonder at the human ability to socialise .
Symptoms :
You ca n’t think of a single thing to write about .
No idea about what kind of project , format , style , universe or issue you wish to tackle .
You have nothing that needs to be expressed .
Cause :
You ’ve shut yourself down due to stress .
Solution :
You were once a child with a boundless imagination , either a boy with a cowboy hat and a plastic six - shooter or a girl with a box full of mummy ’s old clothes with which you would play dress - up .
There is no reason for a person to be completely devoid of wonder unless they ’ve shut themselves down from stress or fear or pain or any number of grown - up reasons .
Chances are you ’d be better able to write something pained and dark during these kinds of moods , even if you are n’t aware of the effect stress is having on you .
Go scream at the top of your lungs in an empty field in the middle of nowhere .
CHICAGO ( AP )  Warning : young children should not keep hedgehogs as pets — or hamsters , baby chicks , lizards and turtles , for that matter — because of risks for disease .
That 's according to the nation 's leading pediatricians ' group in a new report about dangers from exotic animals .
Besides evidence that they can carry dangerous and sometimes potentially deadly germs , exotic pets may be more prone than cats and dogs to bite , scratch or claw — putting children younger than 5 particularly at risk , the report says .
Young children are vulnerable because of developing immune systems plus they often put their hands in their mouths .
That means families with children younger than 5 should avoid owning " nontraditional " pets .
Also , kids that young should avoid contact with these animals in petting zoos or other public places , according to the report from the American Academy of Pediatrics .
The report appears in the October edition of the group 's medical journal , Pediatrics .
" Many parents clearly do n't understand the risks from various infections " these animals often carry , said Dr. Larry Pickering , the report 's lead author and an infectious disease specialist at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
For example , about 11 % of salmonella illnesses in children are thought to stem from contact with lizards , turtles and other reptiles , Pickering said .
Hamsters also can carry this germ , which can cause severe diarrhea , fever and stomach cramps .
Salmonella also has been found in baby chicks , and young children can get it by kissing or touching the animals and then putting their hands in their mouths , he said .
Study co-author Dr. Joseph Bocchini said he recently treated an infant who got salmonella from the family 's pet iguana , which was allowed to roam freely in the home .
The child was hospitalized for four weeks but has recovered , said Bocchini , head of the academy 's infectious diseases committee and pediatrics chairman at Louisiana State University in Shreveport .
Hedgehogs can be dangerous because their quills can penetrate skin and have been known to spread a bacteria germ that can cause fever , stomach pain and a rash , the report said .
With supervision and precautions like hand - washing , contact between children and animals " is a good thing , " Bocchini said .
But families should wait until children are older before bringing home an exotic pet , he said .
Those who already have these pets should contact their veterinarians about specific risks and possible new homes for the animals , he said .
Data cited in the study indicate that about 4 million U.S. households have pet reptiles .
According to the American Veterinary Medical Association , all kinds of exotic pets are on the rise , although generally fewer than 2 % of households own them .
The veterinarian group 's Mike Dutton , a Weare , N.H. , exotic animal specialist , said the recommendations send an important message to parents who sometimes buy exotic pets on an impulse , " then they ask questions , sometimes many months later . "
But a spokesman for the International Hedgehog Association said there 's no reason to single out hedgehogs or other exotic pets .
" Our recommendation is that no animal should be a pet for kids 5 and under , " said Z.G. Standing Bear .
He runs a rescue operation near Pikes Peak , Colo. , for abandoned hedgehogs , which became fad pets about 10 years ago .

October 25 , 2008 --
Talk of assassination plots and rising concerns about a high abstention rate have marked the beginning of the November 23 regional elections race here in Venezuela .
Formally at stake are 23 governorships , more than 300 mayorships and hundreds of representatives on the state legislative councils .
However , the result of these elections could also have an important impact on the future of the Bolivarian Revolution led by the Chavez government .
During the November 2004 regional elections , the pro-Chavez forces , on the back of the thumping victory in the August 2004 recall referendum on Chavez ’s mandate , painted the electoral map red as they swept into 21 of the 23 governorships up for election ( they later rewon the governership of Amazonas to make it 22 out of 24 all up ) .
This time , Chavismo comes into the elections on the back of its first electoral defeat .
Last December , Chavez ’s proposed constitutional reforms , aimed at increasing popular power and introducing progressive measures such as a six - hour workday , along with some feature criticised by Chavistas and all wrapped up in a confusing package of 69 changes were narrowly defeated at the polls as a result of significant abstention from Chavez ’s support base .
While in the 2004 elections , the right - wing US - backed opposition in large part abstained , this time the opposition is united and urging participation .
A lacklustre campaign , however , seems to indicate an opposition that will be unable to fully capitalise on the momentum it built up last year , when earlier this year it seemed they could win as many as eight governorships .
Today , they may possibly win more states , but potentially stand to lose control of the strategic oil - rich state of Zulia .
‘ Get Hugo ’
During a PSUV campaign rally in Zulia on October 12 , security authorities detained three men who breached the security perimeter .
According to an October 13 Venezuelanalysis.com article , “ the men told interrogators that they were paid by Fabian Masias , a campaign manager for … A New Time ” , the party of current Zulia governor Manuel Rosales .
Following the incident , PSUV leader Jorge Rodriguez stated that Rosales confessed to being linked to the men , saying they belonged to a “ group that attends all political activities to take photos and evaluate the activity ” , Venezuelanalysis.com reported .
At the rally , Chavez denounced Rosales as “ a coup monger ” and accused him of ties with paramilitary groups and the CIA .
Chavez declared he had documents in his possession that point to a conspiracy to overthrow his government , with Maracaibo , the capital of Zulia , as the coup plot ’s “ epicentre ” .
The accusations follow on from the revelation in September of a coup plot involving retired and standing military officials .
A number of caches of illegal arms have since also been uncovered .
The threat of assassination against Chavez is a very real one .
As the leader of a revolutionary process , backed by the mobilisation of millions of the poor , which provides inspiration for millions more around the globe , US imperialism and the domestic opposition are desperate to get rid off him and the socialist revolution he leads .
Counter - revolutionary forces have already attempted a military coup , economic sabotage , political destabilisation and an international campaign to discredit and isolate the Chavez government .
Today , sections of the opposition believe the only way to get rid of Chavez is to kill him .
Chavez continues to have tremendous mass support — a 75 % approval rating according to an IVAD poll in early October — reducing the possibilities of removing him electorally to a distant dream .
Polls
However , asked if elections were held today for president , while Chavez would clearly win , his support dropped to 51.4 % , while 32.3 % said they would vote for the opposition .
When asked which party respondents supported , the PSUV came out on top with 37 % — less than half Chavez ’s approval rating .
The other pro-revolution parties that , with the PSUV , comprise the Chavista Patriotic Alliance , got around 6 % combined .
The opposition combined support only mustered up 24 % .
Meanwhile , 31 % stated that they supported “ independent candidates ” .
Asked how they felt about the general situation in the country , 49.6 % believe it has improved and 44.3 % believe it has worsened , while 56.5 % believe it will improve , as opposed to 31.3 % who think it will worsen .
In relation to the recent denunciations of a possible assassination attempt , 24.1 % responded that the statements were used to cover up the scandal involving allegations that the government sought to help fund Argentinean President Cristina Kirchner ’s election campaign , while 18.9 % said it was just simply a lie by Chavez .
Only 37.7 % said Chavez was speaking the truth — including 2.8 % who said not only did they believe it was true but supported the attempt to kill Chavez !
Analysing these results , Ultimas Noticias editor Eleazar Diaz Rangel wrote on October 20 : “ Who led the majority of Venezuelans ( 43 % ) to believe that this denunciation was a lie by the government ?
Well , without a doubt , the media . ”

Rangel when onto argue that the power of the media , more so than the opposition parties or any other factor , helps explain why the opposition has been able to maintain some 40 % support since Chavez was first elected in 1998 .
The polls do seem to coincide with a reality in which the real threat to the revolution in these elections is not from the opposition votes but from abstention .
The fact that it is local candidates , not Chavez , that the voters have to choose will only increase this tendency .
Some in the PSUV national leadership are becoming concerned about internal polling figures indicating that they do not have as many secure votes as they had figured .
In response , special election campaign commissions have been established in various strategic states , while regular meetings in the presidential palace are closely analysing how to reverse this trend .
Chavismo ’s internal problems
Behind this phenomena is continued discontent with what many feel as the lack of resolution of some of their most urgently felt needs .
In most cases , it is a discontent directed at local mayors and governors whom many feel are not working with , but rather against , community attempts to organise and resolve these problems .
Meanwhile , the lack of resolution of a rising number of labour conflicts — particular in the state sector — has fuelled disenchantment among workers .
Two states that have Chavista forces worried are precisely the two states where the industrial working class is strongest .
In many of these cases , it is hard to avoid the obvious conclusion that some in the government and state bureaucracy — at all levels — are consciously working to stoke this dissatisfaction .
Moreover , in fighting to defend their privileges , candidates in a number of places have actively excluded other forces within the PSUV from being part of their election campaign .
In the states of Lara , Merida and Tachira , PSUV militants have raised alarm over the fact that the PSUV candidate is supporting candidates for mayors and legislative councils that are aligned with them , but standing against the PSUV .
Lara state provides an example of why even many PSUV members are planning to abstain .
Earlier this year , the PSUV leadership announced the expulsion of now - PSUV candidate Henry Falcon for initiating his election campaign before having been preselected .
Announcing he would stand on another ticket , the PSUV backflipped and claimed he had never been expelled , most likely due to his high showings in some polls .
Instead , a manoeuvre occurred to drop popular left - wing Carora mayor , Julio Chavez , from the list of candidates for preselection .
A rank and file rebellion forced the reappearance of his name of on the ballot paper .
Having won internal preselection , Falcon moved to exclude Julio and other opponents from his campaign team and set up another party on which he is now running candidates for the state legislature — against the PSUV .
And as the opposition puts the finishing touches to its unity agreements for the key positions up for election , the Patriotic Alliance seems more divided that ever .
Both the Communist Party of Venezuela ( PCV ) and the Homeland for All Party ( PPT ) , part of the alliance , have launched rival candidates against the PSUV in at least six states — in some cases supporting candidates that failed to win preselection in the PSUV internal elections .
With very little chance of winning , the most these candidates could achieve is ensuring an opposition victory due to a split Chavista vote .
Reinvigoration of the base ?
Despite the problems , the campaign has generated some positive features .
Through the process of elections for the PSUV national leadership , and even more so with the participation of almost 2.5 million people in Venezuela ’s first ever internal pre-selection vote for candidates , an important re-engagement occurred between the PSUV ranks and a leadership that seemed increasingly disconnected during 2007 and early 2008 .
The election campaign has also breathed new life into the PSUV as the party starts to move into action , bringing with it an important core of activists that have been part of its construction .
In a number of places , the campaign has involved continuous meetings between PSUV militants and activists from social movements and community organisations to help design a plan for a “ socialist ” municipal or state government .
This is not just occurring in the electoral sphere , either .
With the coup plot revelations , important mass meetings of the coordinators of territorial defence commissions from each battalions were convened , and an important mobilisation of the battalions occurred to discuss how to prepare for a coup scenario .
A certain reinvigoration of the “ hard ” Chavista base seems to be taking place — against the trend that developing in the recent period and accelerated last year .
However , this has not yet transformed into a galvanising , cohering force capable of turning around the broader situation of discontent and relative demobilisation and pushing the election campaign forward towards a definitive victory .
It is likely that the “ hard ” Chavista vote , if fully mobilised , would be enough to secure an important victory , with just a tiny number of governorships falling into the hands of the opposition .
Once again forced to take the reins of the campaign to attempt to turn the situation around , Chavez stated to a PSUV election campaign launch , “ what we are dealing with is not just a question of making gains in the elections , it is about making gains at the level of organisation — in the capacity for mobilisation , it is about increasing revolutionary and socialist consciousness ” .
Such a victory could create “ the necessary revolutionary acceleration , a revolution within the revolution … a battle that we need to have against deviations that still survive , a battle to the death against corruption … against inefficiency , against bureaucratism , a battle to give shape to the spirit of socialism . ”
Unfortunately , with less than a month to go in the campaign , numerous signals seem to point away from such an outcome .

Analysis
As everyone knows , runaway piracy is a terrible threat .
Unchecked , pirates might destroy the very business models which underpin much of our economy , bringing legitimate commerce to a halt - with devastating consequences both for those who make things and for those who use them .
That may or may not be true on the internet : but just lately , a headline featuring the word " piracy " has actually been more likely to refer to the hijacking or looting of ships at sea , as in the pre-digital era .
Specifically , most of the recent coverage has been focused on modern - day freebooters operating from the lawless coast of Somalia .
This is one way of chasing pirates
Just this Tuesday , in fact , Royal Marine Commandos * in seaboats got into a gunfight with the crew of a small pirate dhow which had previously attempted to seize a Danish merchantman not far away .
Having been fired on by the foolhardy freebooters as they approached , the Marines killed two of the pirates and the rest surrendered smartly - but this does n't signal the end of piracy in the area .
Indeed , the following day , even as the news of the success broke , a Turkish tanker was seized in the very same waters .
Somali and Yemeni buccaneers are a particular problem for international trade as they are ideally situated to prey on traffic passing through the Bab el Mandeb ( " the Gate of Tears " ) - the narrow strait at the southern end of the Red Sea , which carries all the traffic between the Suez Canal and the Indian Ocean .
Wherever there 's a maritime chokepoint like that , and a poor or lawless region nearby to act as a safe haven , you get piracy .
Another well - known hotspot , for instance , is the Singapore Strait .
So the Bab - el - Mandeb has been a somewhat risky area for peaceful mariners time out of mind , and riskier still since the collapse of any effective government in Somalia .
Nowadays piracy off the Somali coast is endemic , with gunmen in speedboats seizing entire ships as often as once a week - then often holding them for ransom in the infamous pirate port of Eyl .
( So far there is n't all that much reselling of ships and cargoes , apparently .
Ransoms are seen as simpler and more profitable . )
There 's been a good deal of arm - waving about all this in the British press lately .
For instance , this remarkable effort from Times columnist Libby Purves , headed : " It 's time to take on the gangsters of the sea - We run down British naval power at our peril .
Without it we would have little food , fuel , or goods - or safety " .
( Emphasis mine . )
Purves has plainly been having a chat off the record with a serving or former Royal Naval officer or two - as also seemed rather likely in the case of the recent Lloyds List piece which sought to place the blame for the Navy 's failure to stamp out piracy in the region on political - correctness - gone- mad at the Foreign Office .
The CIA is often credited with ' advice ' on Hollywood films , but no one is truly sure about the extent of its shadowy involvement .
Matthew Alford and Robbie Graham investigate
Everyone who watches films knows about Hollywood 's fascination with spies .
From Hitchcock 's postwar espionage thrillers , through cold war tales such as Torn Curtain , into the paranoid 1970s when the CIA came to be seen as an agency out of control in films such as Three Days of the Condor , and right to the present , with the Bourne trilogy and Ridley Scott 's forthcoming Body of Lies , film - makers have always wanted to get in bed with spies .
What 's less widely known is how much the spies have wanted to get in bed with the film - makers .
In fact , the story of the CIA 's involvement in Hollywood is a tale of deception and subversion that would seem improbable if it were put on screen .
The model for this is the defence department 's " open " but barely publicised relationship with Hollywood .
The Pentagon , for decades , has offered film - makers advice , manpower and even hardware - including aircraft carriers and state - of - the - art helicopters .
All it asks for in exchange is that the US armed forces are made to look good .
So in a previous Scott film , Black Hawk Down , a character based on a real - life soldier who had also been a child rapist lost that part of his backstory when he came to the screen .
No matter how seemingly craven Hollywood 's behaviour towards the US armed forces has seemed , it has at least happened within the public domain .
That can not be said for the CIA 's dealings with the movie business .
Not until 1996 did the CIA announce , with little fanfare , that it had established an Entertainment Liaison Office , which would collaborate in a strictly advisory capacity with film - makers .
Heading up the office was Chase Brandon , who had served for 25 years in the agency 's elite clandestine services division , as an undercover operations officer .
A PR man he is n't , though he does have Hollywood connections : he 's a cousin of Tommy Lee Jones .
But the past 12 years of semi-acknowledged collaboration were preceded by decades in which the CIA maintained a deep - rooted but invisible influence of Hollywood .
How could it be otherwise ?
As the former CIA man Bob Baer - whose books on his time with the agency were the basis for Syriana - told us : " All these people that run studios - they go to Washington , they hang around with senators , they hang around with CIA directors , and everybody 's on board . "
There is documentary evidence for his claims .
Luigi Luraschi was the head of foreign and domestic censorship for Paramount in the early 1950s .
And , it was recently discovered , he was also working for the CIA , sending in reports about how film censorship was being employed to boost the image of the US in movies that would be seen abroad .
Luraschi's reports also revealed that he had persuaded several film - makers to plant " negroes " who were " well - dressed " in their movies , to counter Soviet propaganda about poor race relations in the States .
The Soviet version was rather nearer the truth .
Luraschi's activities were merely the tip of the iceberg .
Graham Greene , for example , disowned the 1958 adapatation of his Vietnam - set novel The Quiet American , describing it as a " propaganda film for America " .
In the title role , Audie Murphy played not Greene 's dangerously ambiguous figure - whose belief in the justice of American foreign policy allows him to ignore the appalling consequences of his actions - but a simple hero .
The cynical British journalist , played by Michael Redgrave , is instead the man whose moral compass has gone awry .
Greene 's American had been based in part on the legendary CIA operative in Vietnam , Colonel Edward Lansdale .
How apt , then , that it should have been Lansdale who persuaded director Joseph Mankewiecz to change the script to suit his own ends .
The CIA did n't just offer guidance to film - makers , however .
It even offered money .
In 1950 , the agency bought the rights to George Orwell 's Animal Farm , and then funded the 1954 British animated version of the film .
Its involvement had long been rumoured , but only in the past decade have those rumours been substantiated , and the tale of the CIA 's role told in Daniel Leab 's book Orwell Subverted .
The most common way for the CIA to exert influence in Hollywood nowadays is not through anything as direct as funding , or rewriting scripts , but offering to help with matters of verisimilitude .
That is done by having serving or former CIA agents acting as advisers on the film , though some might wonder whether there is ever really such a thing a " former agent " .
As ex-CIA agent Lindsay Moran , the author of Blowing My Cover , has noted , the CIA often calls on former officers to perform tasks for their old employer .
So it was no problem for CBS to secure official help when making its 2001 TV series The Agency ( it was even written by a former agent ) .
Langley was equally helpful to the novelist Tom Clancy , who was invited to CIA headquarters after the publication of The Hunt for Red October , an invitation that was regularly repeated .
Consequently , when Clancy 's The Sum of All Fears was filmed in 2002 , the agency was happy to bring its makers to Langley for a personal tour of headquarters , and to offer access to agency analysts for star Ben Affleck .
When filming began , Brandon was on set to advise - a role he repeated during the filming of glamorous television series Alias .
The former agent Milt Beardon took the advisory role on two less action - packed attempts at espionage stories : Robert De Niro's The Good Shepherd from 2006 , which told an approximate version of the story of the famed CIA head of counter - espionage , James Jesus Angleton ; and Charlie Wilson 's War , the story of US covert efforts to supply the Afghan mujahideen with weaponry during the Soviet occupation of the 80s .
In reality , this was a story that ended badly , as the Afghan freedom fighters helped give birth to the terrorists of al - Qaida .
In the movie , however , that was not the case .
As Beardon - who had been the CIA man responsible for the weapons reaching the Afghans - observed shortly before the movie came out , the film would " put aside the notion that because we did that [ supply arms ] , we had 9/11 " .
Beardon 's remark provides a clue to the real reason the CIA likes to offer advice to Hollywood , a clue that was expanded on by Paul Kelbaugh , the former associate general counsel to the CIA - a very senior figure in Langley .
In 2007 , Kelbaugh spoke at Lynchburg College of Law in Virginia - where he had become an associate professor - about the CIA 's relationship with Hollywood .
A journalist present at the lecture ( who now wishes to be anonymous ) reported that Kelbaugh spoke about the 2003 Al Pacino / Colin Farrell vehicle The Recruit .
A CIA agent had been on set as a " consultant " throughout the shoot , he said ; his real job , however , was to misdirect the film - makers .
" We did n't want Hollywood getting too close to the truth , " the journalist quoted Kelbaugh as saying .
Peculiarly , though , in a strongly worded email to us , Kelbaugh emphatically denied having said such a thing , and said he remembered " very specific discussions with senior [ CIA ] management that no one was ever to misrepresent to affect [ film ] content - EVER . "
The journalist stands by the original report , and Kelbaugh has refused to discuss the matter further .
So , altering scripts , financing films , suppressing the truth - it 's worrying enough .
But there are cases where some believe the CIA 's activities in Hollywood have gone further - far enough , in fact , to be the stuff of movies .
In June 1997 , the screenwriter Gary DeVore was working on the screenplay for his directorial debut .
It was to be an action movie set against the backdrop of the US invasion of Panama in 1989 , which led to the overthrow of dictator Manuel Noriega .
According to his wife , Wendy , DeVore had been talking to an old friend - the CIA 's Chase Brandon - about Noriega 's regime and US counternarcotic programmes in Latin America .
Wendy told CNN : " He had been very disturbed over some of the things that he had been finding in his research .
He was researching the United States invasion of Panama , because he was setting the actual story that he was writing against this ; and the overthrow of Noriega and the enormous amounts of money laundering in the Panamanian banks , also our own government 's money laundering . "
At the end of that month , DeVore had been in Santa Fe , New Mexico , working on another project .
He was travelling back to California when , at 1.15 am on June 28 , he called Wendy , a call she says has been excised from phone records .
She told CNN she was " terribly alarmed " because he was speaking as though he were under duress .
She was sure " someone was in the car with him " .
That was the last time Wendy DeVore heard from her husband .
A year passed , but the case refused to die and speculation mounted .
Even the Los Angeles Times began contemplating CIA involvement .
DeVore was presumed dead , but there was no body , and no end to the questions .
Lo and behold , just nine days after the LA Times reported the case , DeVore 's body was found , decomposing in his Ford Explorer , in 12 feet of water in the California Aqueduct below the Antelope Valley Freeway , south of Palmdale - a city located in " aerospace valley " , so dubbed by locals for its reputation as a US military - industrial - complex stronghold - fuel to the fire for conspiracy theorists .
The coroner went on to declare the cause and manner of DeVore 's death to be " unknown " , but police eventually reached the tentative conclusion that the screenwriter 's death was an accident : he had fallen asleep at the wheel , they said , before careening off the highway and into the water , where he drowned .
But loose ends remain : DeVore 's laptop computer containing his unfinished script was missing from his vehicle , as was the gun he customarily carried on long trips ; after his disappearance , a CIA representative allegedly showed up at DeVore 's house to request access to his computer ;
Hollywood private investigator Don Crutchfield noted that previous drafts of DeVore 's script were inexplicably wiped from said computer during the same timeframe ; police claimed that DeVore 's vehicle careened off the highway , yet DeVore 's widow was troubled by the absence of visible damage to the guardrail at the scene of the alleged accident ; and how come no one noticed an SUV sitting in the water beneath a busy highway for a whole year ?
Perhaps the whole incident is too like a conspiracy movie to be a real conspiracy - but many remain troubled by De Vore 's death .
Despite the CIA 's professed desire to be more open about the role it plays in Holly - wood , it 's hard to take its newfound transparency too seriously .
After all , what use is a covert agency that does not act covertly , even if some of its activities are public ?
And if it is still not open about the truth of events decades ago , many of which have spilled into the public domain accidently , how can we be sure it is telling the truth about its activities now ?
The spy may have come in from the cold , but he still finds shelter in the dark of the cinema .
• Body of Lies is released next Friday
Earlier this week , we covered the debate in Congress over a bill that would define net neutrality as part of the nation 's official broadband policy and direct the FCC to ensure that it happens .
But regulating communications may not be the only way to get net neutrality enacted ; a bill introduced today by Representatives John Conyers ( D - MI ) and Zoe Lofgren ( D - CA ) treats it as an antitrust issue and amends the Clayton Act accordingly .
The bill , the Internet Freedom and Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 , will enter the record as H.R. 5994 .
The text does not differ significantly from a previous attempt that went by the same name in 2006 .
The bill is intended to " promote competition , to facilitate trade , and to ensure competitive and non-discriminatory access to the Internet . "
It does so by outlawing discriminatory fees for providing content , applications , or services over the ' Net .
Internet providers also have to interact fully with the networks of their competitors and provide equal access to all users and any devices they wish to put on the network .
Network providers would be allowed to provide favored service to specific types of data but , if they do , they have to provide that same favoritism to anybody transmitting the data , and could n't charge for it .
The primary differences from the previous version of the bill come in the exceptions .
As in the earlier bill , ISPs would be allowed to manage network traffic in a nondiscriminatory manner , and could discriminate to favor emergency communications or to comply with law enforcement .
Three new provisions , however , add additional exceptions for marketing purposes , parental controls , and improving quality of service in a nondiscriminatory manner .
John Conyers
Ben Scott of Free Press , who testified in favor of net neutrality at the earlier hearing , was , as expected , pleased with this bill .
" We applaud Chairman Conyers and Representative Lofgren for their leadership and commitment to the public interest on this critical issue , " he said in a statement , " Congress must step in to defend the open Internet . "
Given that one of its sponsors ( Conyers ) is the House Judiciary Committee Chairman , the bill is likely to at least receive some consideration .
The Clayton Act dates to 1914 , but the new provisions seem to fit nicely into its general scope .
Among other things , the Act forbids charging different buyers different prices for the same product or service or engaging in tying or bundling agreements that harm competitors .
How these provisions operate in practice has largely been settled through the courts , so it seems probable that , even if the 2008 version of this bill passes , it may take a while before we 're sure what sorts of behavior it actually prohibits .
Flipping madness !
Police offer free flip - flops to binge drinkers who keep falling over in heels
Itsh not their fault , you shee .
Itsh the shoesh .
Drunk women who stagger about in high heels are to be protected - at public expense - from twisting their ankles .
They will be handed flip - flops to wear by police outside nightclubs as they wend their way home .
The scheme is part of a £ 30,000 drive by police and councillors to prevent ' alcohol - related harm ' .
Superintendent Chris Singer poses with two pairs of flip - flops .
As part of a £ 30,000 health and safety scheme , flip - flops are to be given free to drunk women to prevent injuries on their walk home
It has been prompted by fears that women wearing stilettos or similar footwear could tumble over .
Officials also claim that female revellers are at risk of cutting the soles of their feet by walking barefoot .
The flip - flops will be given to anyone whose footwear is ' uncomfortable , inappropriate or soiled ' and will be paid for with a Home Office grant .
The scheme is to begin next month in the centre of Torquay , Devon , a popular destination for hen and stag parties .
It will be run by Safer Communities Torbay , a partnership between police , Torbay Council and the Local Education Authority .
Police officers will carry bags of coloured flip - flops on their rounds and will hand them to those who look unsteady on their feet .
Off balance : Drunk women will be handed flip - flops outside clubs
The rubber shoes , which carry printed messages about safe drinking , will also be available free from the council 's ' Safe Bus ' on the harbourside .
The force has already been handing out condoms and sexual health advice to revellers , and ordered drunken men who urinate in the street to clean up their own mess with a mop and bucket .
Inspector Adrian Leisk , from Safer Communities Torbay , said : ' Sometimes people get drunk and you see them carrying footwear which is inappropriate .
' The emphasis is on providing replacement footwear for people to get home in , should they find their footwear uncomfortable , inappropriate or soiled .
' We have consulted with people who work on our night - time economy areas and this is just one of a number of measures designed to keep people safe . '
The initiative has attracted criticism from campaigners , who said it was a waste of money and police time .
Matthew Elliott , chief executive of the TaxPayers '
Alliance , said : ' This is an idiotic waste of money .
' People do n't pay their taxes for drunk women to get free flip flops .
They want the police to fight crime .
' The police are n't there to be an emergency supply of flat shoes . '
But the potential recipients seemed quite pleased yesterday at the prospect of a free pair of flops .
Danielle Bolton , 19 , who was out in Torquay , said : ' My heels hurt me at the end of the night so I tend to take them off .
' It 's a hell of a lot easier to walk with flip - flops than high heels . '
Leanne Thomas , 21 , added : ' I go out clubbing at the harbourside most weekends and I usually walk home barefooted because my heels hurt .
I think it 's a great idea . '
The £ 30,000 will cover the cost of free condoms , rape alarms and personal safety information which will also be available on the Safe Bus .
Superintendent Chris Singer , Torbay Police Commander , said : ' Linking in with our partners , this funding represents a significant opportunity to make a real difference in relation to alcohol related harm and disorder .
' We 're hopeful that this new initiative will help protect dozens of women who are vulnerable to injury after a night out with friends . '
[ UPDATED , 11/27 ]
Black Friday , long considered a bellwether for the state of the consumer economy , is here again .
( It was a truly Black — and deadly — last year at a Wal - Mart on Long Island . )
In 2007 , I wrote about the “ Buy Nothing Day ” advertising campaign , which may have the most value simply in reminding us how much we ’re pummeled by advertising ( something like $ 660 billion a year ) and as a suggestion that another approach is warranted .
Worldchanging.com has a post up exploring the merits of buying local instead of buying nothing , something we touched on here in the context of farmers markets .
Buying local builds community and has potential environmental benefits .
I thank the fates we still have a local hardware store — one left — amid all the big boxes .
There ’s also the buying ( or exchanging ) movement for used stuff ( remember those Buddhist Dumpster divers ? ) .
I ’m proposing another option : What about Making Something Day ?
When possible , I like to try to make or fix things .
Of course , this is only marginally , and sporadically , doable in a world where work , family , bills and daily crises consume most of us .
But sometimes this approach can produce a useful object ( or food ) while also building relationships , saving money and knitting a community .
Hey , if the economy truly collapses , knowing how to fix things or make your own could come in very handy , so why not polish that skill set ?
The toys I ’ve made with my sons by scavenging driftwood on the riverbank and retreating to the wood shop , while not their favorites , have clearly introduced them to the idea that something can come from nothing , that using your own hands has value beyond the end product .
I ’m about to start making a dining table from some marvelous old - growth hickory boards my neighbor Sandy Saunders gleaned from a fallen tree many years ago and has stored in a barn .
Mind you , I do n’t do millwork , so I ’m compromising .
I bought a set of table legs and apron parts from a place I found online ( in Vermont ) that just sells table legs .
The Web is a marvel .
I ’ll do a video as that comes together ( and this public proclamation will help keep it on a front burner :-) .
[ UPDATE , 11/17/09 :
Well , this project still does linger in the basement !
I ’m trying . ]
What have you made or fixed that provides at least a hint of self - sufficiency , thrift or environmental integrity ?
There are books out there that can help you do it yourself , and a documentary ( and book ) called “ Handmade Nation , ” chronicling the world of hand craft .
Has anyone seen it ?
I completely lost interest in the game , though I must say this ad was very nice .
How about a big microscope with an even smaller ad ?
Paul ’s Admonition to Christians
About Their Responsibility to Those in High Positions
1 Timothy 2:1-7
First of all , then , I urge that supplications , prayers , intercessions , and thanksgivings be made for all people , for kings and all who are in high positions , that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life , godly and dignified in every way .
This is good , and it is pleasing in the sight of God our Savior , who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth .
For there is one God , and there is one mediator between God and men , the man Christ Jesus , who gave himself as a ransom for all , which is the testimony given at the proper time .

I get asked a lot of questions about my tree experiments , such as sakura and interactive elm .
I thought I would write up a simple explanation to point people in the right direction .
The easiest place to start is with recursion .
Trees are beautiful examples of recursion in the natural world .
Recursion is a deep and very important topic , but for our purposes can be simplified to the idea of code calling itself .
In the example below , each time you click the stage , all of the “ active ” ( outermost ) branches call code to draw two more branches at their ends , the next time you click , those new branches call the same code .
Move your mouse around to vary the angle of all of the branches .
As an aside , this example also has an interesting “ emergent ” property of drawing hexagons ( try moving your mouse to the bottom when all of the branches are drawn ) .
This looks slightly like a tree , but is too uniform .
To make it look more like a natural system , we need to introduce some randomness .
By taking the example above , and simply adding a bit of logic to randomly vary the length and angle of each branch , as well as decreasing the branch thickness with each generation .
Now it looks quite a bit like a tree .
From here , you just need to add in wandering branch drawing logic , so that branches curve and bend , and it will start to look a lot like the demos I linked to above .
For help getting started with this , I ’d recommend downloading my Varicose - g source code .

Sen .
John McCain and his Republican allies are readying a newly aggressive assault on Sen. Barack Obama ’s character , believing that to win in November they must shift the conversation back to questions about the Democrat ’s judgment , honesty and personal associations , several top Republicans said .
With just a month to go until Election Day , McCain ’s team has decided that its emphasis on the senator ’s biography as a war hero , experienced lawmaker and straight - talking maverick is insufficient to close a growing gap with Obama .
The Arizonan ’s campaign is also eager to move the conversation away from the economy , an issue that strongly favors Obama and has helped him to a lead in many recent polls .
“ We ’re going to get a little tougher , ” a senior Republican operative said , indicating that a fresh batch of television ads is coming .
“ We ’ve got to question this guy ’s associations .
Very soon .
There ’s no question that we have to change the subject here , ” said the operative , who was not authorized to discuss strategy and spoke on the condition of anonymity .
Anti-government protesters have taken over the airport The Thai Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat has said he will take action to end anti-government protests in Bangkok 's two main airports .
In a TV address , Mr Somchai said the police would be assisted by some military units in halting the protests .
Emergency rule has been declared around the two airports .
Thousands of passengers have been left stranded by the protest action , just the latest stand - off in a long - running political struggle gripping Thailand .
Protesters from the People 's Alliance for Democracy ( PAD ) occupied a government complex in the capital for months .
At the start of this week said they were embarking on the " final battle " of their campaign to unseat the government , and they have vowed to resist attempts to disable their airport protests .
' Temporary ' emergency Mr Somchai was speaking to the nation after an emergency cabinet session was held in the city of Chiang Mai .
" It is wrong for protesters to take the entire Thai nation hostage , " Mr Somchai said , according to AFP news agency .
" The government is not intending to hurt anybody ... and the emergency will be temporary , " he added .
The [ ruling party ] 's strategy for months now has been to turn the other cheek to the PAD 's provocations

The prime minister said air force and naval units would be deployed to assist police in ending the protests , which he said had caused " massive damage " .
Under emergency rule , troops may be deployed , groups of more than five civilians are forbidden from forming , subject to immediate arrest , and a media blackout can be enforced .
Protesters remain resolute that their show of force will continue .
" We will not leave .
We will use human shields against the police if they try to disperse us , " PAD leader Suriyasai Katasila told Reuters news agency .
The BBC's Quentin Sommerville says moving the protesters will not be easy - they have shown they are willing to put up a fight , and have already called on supporters to set up roadblocks near terminal buildings .
Reports from Bangkok say tank movements there have sparked fears of an impending military coup .
On Wednesday Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat rejected a call by army leader Gen Anupong Paochinda for new elections to end the political deadlock , saying his government was legitimate .
Gen Anupong has denied any coup plot .
Economic blow
The protesters have occupied both Suvarnabhumi international airport and Bangkok 's domestic airport , Don Mueang .
On Thursday , the Associated Press quoted Tourism Minister Weerasak Kohsurat as saying stranded passengers with " urgent needs " could be flown out of military bases around Bangkok .

The blockade comes at the height of the tourist season and threatens an industry which is one of the country 's biggest earners .
Thailand has been in political turmoil since former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra was ousted in a military coup in 2006 .
The PAD - a loose alliance of royalists , businessmen and the urban middle class - claim that the government is corrupt and hostile to the monarchy .
They also accuse it of being a proxy for Thaksin , who remains very popular among Thailand 's rural poor .
Fresh elections at the end of 2007 failed to resolve the crisis , when a party made up of former allies of Mr Thaksin returned to power .
And since August PAD protesters have launched an all - out assault on the government , occupying government buildings and seeing former Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej forced out of office , though on an apparently unrelated matter .

Scratch Input
We present Scratch Input , an acoustic - based input technique that relies on the unique sound produced when a fingernail is dragged over the surface of a textured material , such as wood , fabric , or wall paint .
We employ a simple sensor that can be easily coupled with existing surfaces , such as walls and tables , turning them into large , unpowered and ad hoc finger input surfaces .
Our sensor is sufficiently small that it could be incorporated into a mobile device , allowing any suitable surface on which it rests to be appropriated as a gestural input surface .
Several example applications were developed to demonstrate possible interactions .
We conclude with a study that shows users can perform six Scratch Input gestures at about 90 % accuracy with less than five minutes of training and on wide variety of surfaces .

Male Disposability
The sex roles that drove a man's and a woman 's behavior for thousands of years had great impact on each sex .
One of the impacts of the sex role on men was the attitude of disposability that developed over the years .
By that I mean the tendency of people to be less likely to get emotionally close to men and to see them as expendable .
Why would that be ?
Imagine we are living long ago and the women were caring for the hearth and the children and making forays to gather while the men were more likely to go out and hunt .
The relative danger of those two behaviors is not subtle .
Going out to hunt is decidedly more dangerous and the liklihood of the man returning home after a hunt was much smaller than the same liklhood for the woman performing her daily activities .
When we dont ' expect someone to return what impact does that have on our interest in making an emotional attachment to them ?
It diminishes .
We are less likely to invest our emotional ergs into someone or something that we fear may not be with us .
This was obviously not just around the issue of hunting .
Men were expected to guard the perimeter and to repel attacks by intruders .
This was a dangerous activity and again , increased the liklihood that the man would be dissappearing .
We tend to not invest in folks who we fear will not be returning .
Yet another example is war time .
Men were the ones who were expected to go to war and die protecting the village / community / country .
This diminished investment is not subtle but very few people are aware of their own tendency to do this .
Let 's try an exercise to evaluate your way of thinking .
Has it ever bothered you that only males are expected to sign up for the selecttive service ?
That it is only males expected to go and die in case of a national emergency ?
Does that bug you ?
Okay , now imagine that congress in all its wisdom has changed the law and decided that we need to draft only girls and women until an equal number of women and girls have died in combat to the numbers of men and boys who have died .
Would that upset you ?
Why ?
Do you value women and girls more than boys and men ?
How about if we decided to draft only Black people ?
Maybe only Jews ?
Would either of those groups being sacrificed upset you ?
Would you protest for any of those to not be the only group drafted ?
Can you feel in your bones how upsetting that would be ?
If you answered yes to any of those questions , how was your response different from thinking it is okay to draft only men ?
If you had a different reaction then you are likely holding some of that tendency to consider men and boys to be more disposable .
You can see this tendency in many places .
Boys and men comprise almost 80 % of suicides and yet we have no outcry or services specifically for this .
Men and boys are over 90 % of the workplace deaths in the Unted States but no one seems to notice .
Over 97 % if the deaths of U.S. servicemen in Iraq are men and boys and yet we hear no protest in support of men and boys or calls for equality .
Men are the victims of domestic violence in considerable numbers and yet we have no services directed towards their needs .
All we need to do is open our eyes to see the extent that men and boys are seen as expendable .
It is all around us .
Ever heard of the wife telling the husband she will go investigate the loud noise that awoke them from a deep sleep ?
The age old sex role for men has trickled down into a straight - jacket that harnesses men to be the expendable ones .
Most people are simpy unconscious of this and treat men according to their own unconscious programming .
How abut you ?

CNN : Obama Tried to Rescue Meeting , McCain Was Silent
by EmperorHadrian [ Subscribe ]
Thu Sep 25 , 2008 at 08:38:41 PM
PDT
Fourty years of republican misrule has brought us to this .
Financial ruin at every level .
But CNN reported on what happened inside the meeting at the White House today .
Its failure seems to have caused the failure of this deal , and this meeting would not have occured if McCain had n’t demanded it .
He took another huge gamble , and lost .
After the cameras left , Boehner started ranting about the right wing “ plan ” ( deregulation , capital gains tax cuts , and an insurance plan that Paulson said wo n’t work ) .
Bush was silent , and McCain said nothing .
It seems as though Obama was the only one who tried to lead the meeting to some productive conclusion .
CNN said that Obama first tried to reason with Boehner , and ask him to detail what his plan was .
After he did this , Obama calmly asked Paulson if it would work , and Paulson said that it definately would not work ( which was why house republicans did n’t ask him about this at the meeting yesterday ) .
Obama continued with his attempts to salvage the mess that McCain created and refused to correct , but was unable .
Again we see how much we need Obama and his leadership , and how disastrous McCain would be .
Barney Frank just said that Lindsey Graham is now saying that the plan to allocate 20 % of profits made to housing assistance for low income home owners is not acceptable , even though Senators Corker and Bennett said it was acceptable this morning .
This goes further to the point that McCain is actively trying to kill this deal .
You ca n’t reason with a house full of ideologues any more than you can teach a dog calculus .
It is plainly obvious that McCain was principaly responisble for the failure of this bailout deal .
And , for everyone here , this is a bailout of main street , not wall street .
Without credit , main street cannot function .
Plus taxpayers will probably make a profit , or at least lose very little money .
Without it , we are possibily looking at Great Depression II , and the sequel is always worse than the original .
Update : The New York Times does mention this incident in a new article .
At the bipartisan White House meeting that Mr. McCain had called for a day earlier , he sat silently for more than 40 minutes , more observer than leader , and then offered only a vague sense of where he stood , said people in the meeting .
…
Still , by nightfall , the day provided the younger and less experienced Mr. Obama an opportunity to , in effect , shift roles with Mr. McCain .
For a moment , at least , it was Mr. Obama presenting himself as the old hand at consensus building , and as the real face of bipartisan politics .
Instead he [ McCain ] found himself in the midst of a remarkable partisan showdown , lacking a clear public message for how to bring it to an end .

Update 2 : Remember this Kossacks , what do all great presidents have in common ?
Think Lincoln or FDR .
They all came into office during a time of extreme crisis .
Good times do n’t make great presidents .
Bad times make great presidents , or in McCain ’s case , absolute disasters .
Obama being Presidential .
I ’m not surprised .
McCain is a joke , a fraud and a Punk .
Ass .
Bitch .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Levels of climate - warming methane -- a greenhouse gas 25 times as potent as carbon dioxide -- rose abruptly in Earth ’s atmosphere last year , and scientists who reported the change do n’t know why it occurred .

Methane , the primary component of natural gas , has more than doubled in the atmosphere since pre-industrial times , but stayed largely stable over the last decade or so before rising in 2007 , researchers said on Wednesday .
This stability led scientists to believe that the emissions of methane , from natural sources like cows , sheep and wetlands , as well as from human activities like coal and gas production , were balanced by the destruction of methane in the atmosphere .
But that balance was upset starting early last year , releasing millions of metric tonnes more methane into the air , the scientists wrote in the Geophysical Research Letters .
“ The thing that ’s really surprising is that it ’s coming after this period of very level emissions , ” said Matthew Rigby of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
“ The worry is that we just do n’t understand the methane cycle very well . ”
Another surprise was that the rise in methane levels happened simultaneously at all the places scientists measured around the globe , instead of being centered near known sources of methane emissions in the Northern Hemisphere , said Rigby , one of the study ’s lead authors along with Ronald Prinn , also of MIT .
A rise in methane in the Northern Hemisphere might be due to a year - long warm spell in Siberia , where wetlands harbor methane - producing bacteria , the scientists said , but had no immediate answer on why emissions also rose in the Southern Hemisphere at the same time .
There is considerably less methane than carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
Pre -industrial concentrations of methane were about 700 parts per billion -- that is , for every billion molecules of air , there were only 700 of methane -- but that level rose gradually to 1773 parts per billion by the late 20th century , Rigby said in a telephone interview .
The rise in 2007 was about 10 parts per billion over the course of a year , a real jump for such a short period of time .
By contrast , there are about 385 parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
However , methane is much better at locking in the solar radiation that heats up the planet .
Methane is destroyed by reaction with an atmospheric “ cleanser ” called the hydroxyl free radical , or OH .
The researchers theorized that the rise in methane might be due in part to a decline in OH .
The researchers said it is too soon to tell whether the one - year rise in the amount of atmospheric methane is the start of an upward trend or a short - lived anomaly .
A new lawsuit filed this week against Apple and AT&T charge the companies with a host of offenses related to the speed of the 3G network and the performance of the iPhone .
The lawsuit , brought by San Diego , California resident Peter Keller , and filed in the United States District Court , Southern District of California , accuses the two companies of Negligence , Breach of the Express Warranty and Implied Warranty of Merchantability , Fraud and Deceit , Negligent Misrepresentation , Unlawful Business Practices , and False and Misleading Advertising .
Keller says Apple markets the iPhone 3G because of its speed , but the phone and the network do not live up to the advertising that Apple and AT&T have given to it .
The lawsuit also says that users only experience 3G connectivity a fraction of the time .
" Consumers are unable to choose any other network or carrier when using their iPhone 3G , " the lawsuit reads .
" Through this joint agreement , Apple and AT&T have engaged in a collaborated scheme to deceive plaintiff and other consumers , since the iPhone 3G and AT&T 3G Network is faulty and rarely provides 3G connectivity to its customers . "
The lawsuit seeks corrective labeling and advertising on the iPhone 3G , a constructive trust on all monies obtained by Apple and AT&T for the iPhone 3G , and punitive , compensatory and statutory damages .
This is n't the first lawsuit Apple and AT&T face over the speed of the 3G network .
In August , an Alabama woman sued the companies for failing to deliver on the promise of fast speeds on the iPhone 3G .
This story , " $ 5 Million Lawsuit Charges Apple With Fraud Over 3G Speeds " was originally published by Macworld .
Fifth Ring
FOR a man who believes that the world as we know it is coming to an end , as least as far as energy is concerned , Matthew Simmons is remarkably cheerful .
He magnanimously excuses
The Economist 's poor record of predicting the price of oil : our suggestion in 1999 that oil would remain dirt cheap was conventional wisdom at the time , he says soothingly .
He also shrugs off our more recent scepticism about his belief that the world 's production of oil has peaked : he , too , hopes that “ peak oil ” proves to be a myth , he says .
But over a 40 - year career in investment banking , Mr Simmons adds , he has learnt never to rely on wishful thinking .
Most of the world 's oil analysts , he believes , are far too optimistic about how long existing fields will last , the prospects for new discoveries , technology 's ability to unlock new sources and to extend the life of existing ones , and so on .
He prefers to rely on data rather than daydreams .
And according to the American government 's own numbers , the world 's oil output has been more - or - less flat since 2005 .
It was data that made Mr Simmons famous .
He spent the summer of 2003 at his holiday home in Maine , poring over technical studies describing the state of Saudi Arabia 's oilfields .
Although the Saudi authorities do not release much evidence to support their claims of vast oil reserves , engineers from Saudi Aramco , the state - owned oil firm , do give talks at conferences and publish papers about their experience of reservoir modelling and management .
Based on these , Mr Simmons concluded that Saudi Arabia 's biggest fields were already past their peaks , required ever more expensive technological fixes to prop up production and would soon enter a period of inevitable and rapid decline .
Saudi grandees pooh - poohed Mr Simmons 's 2005 book on the subject , “ Twilight in the Desert : the Coming Saudi Oil Shock and the World Economy ” .
But others held it up as convincing proof of the notion that the world 's oil production would soon reach a pinnacle , never to be exceeded .
Saudi Arabia , after all , is already the world 's biggest producer , and is expected to cater to most of the growth in demand for oil over the next few years by expanding its output yet further .
If , instead , it pumps less , there is little hope that other countries could make up the shortfall .
In that scenario , as demand for oil continues to grow despite dwindling supplies , and as the search for substitutes proves fruitless , economic catastrophe ensues .
Mr Simmons helps to lend credence to this view in part because he is an old and respected hand in the oil business .
He first stumbled into it in 1969 , thanks to a chance encounter at a hotel in Palm Springs .
He was two - thirds of the way through a doctorate in economics and had planned to join his father 's bank in Utah when he finished .
Instead , he ended up abandoning his studies to help raise venture capital for a pioneering firm of divers working on California 's offshore oil - rigs .
Simmons & Company , the investment bank Mr Simmons went on to found ( along with Michael Huffington , an oilman and politician ) , helped to funnel money and financial advice to the nascent “ oil services ” industry , which performs tasks such as seismic surveys and drilling wells on behalf of oil firms .
Indeed , Mr Simmons says it was his bank that coined the very phrase “ oil services ” .
It has handled over 500 merger - and - acquisition deals in the industry — 49 of them last year alone .
All this means that Mr Simmons can draw upon long experience and deep knowledge of the oil industry .
He does not dispute the main criticism of the “ peak oil ” theory : that improvements in technology , spurred by high prices , will eventually allow new fields to be found , more oil to be recovered from existing fields and artificial oil to be conjured from substances such as tar sands , coal and shale .
But he thinks such advances will take longer to appear and have less of an impact than his detractors assume .
As it is , he points out , all the world 's drilling rigs are working flat out , and old ones are being retired faster than new ones can be produced .
The same is true of geologists and many more of the industry 's essential inputs .
This is slowing the development of new fields and pushing up the cost .
By the same token , the technology being used to extract oil today has been in the works since the 1970s .
It will take a long time for the next generation of clever kit to come into widespread use .
Besides , many technological improvements seem to have simply speeded up the extraction of oil , rather than increasing the share of each reservoir that can be recovered .
Oil clocks out
In short , as Mr Simmons readily concedes , the debate between proponents and critics of “ peak oil ” boils down to an argument about timing .
The optimists think that technology will advance quickly enough to offset declining production from mammoth fields such as those Mr Simmons studied in Saudi Arabia .
But he and his disciples think the declines will come too soon , and be too sharp , for the world to adapt in time .
The whole row could easily be solved , he says , if Saudi Arabia would only allow independent auditors to assess its reserves .
In the meantime , Mr Simmons is taking no chances .
He plans to start up a farm near his house in Maine , in case the supply chain that provides America with food breaks down for lack of fuel .
He plans to fertilise his fields with manure , rather than chemicals derived from oil and natural gas .
He thinks globalisation must stop , and that as much trade as possible should be conducted by boat , to conserve whatever oil remains .
But Mr Simmons has not despaired .
He holds out great hope for wave energy , and believes that at least one of the many different species of seaweed found along Maine 's coast will yield oil that can be turned into biofuel .
He has got Simmons & Company involved in alternative energy .
It is a brave choice for someone who is so pessimistic about technology .
Obama camp seizes on ' divorced ' comment
After a week on defense , Barack Obama 's campaign is roaring back with a new theme for attacking John McCain : “ out of touch . ”
In a conference call with reporters on Friday morning , the Obama campaign seized on a comment by McCain in Thursday night ’s ServiceNation forum in New York , where the candidates appeared separately on the seventh anniversary of 9/11 .

McCain was defending his running mate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , a former mayor of Wasilla , Alaska , population 9,800 .
Asked by Judy Woodruff of PBS about Palin 's stint as “ a small - town mayor , ” McCain replied : “ Listen , mayors have the toughest job , I think , in America .
It 's easy for me to go to Washington and , frankly , be somewhat divorced from the day - to - day challenges people have . ”
Sen. Richard J. Durbin ( D - Ill. ) told reporters on the call that is “ a critical comment by John McCain that evidences why he really is n’t going to bring change . ”
“ I have been with John McCain in Washington , and I think what he said reflects the reality of many people , ” Durbin said .
“ But even worse is the situation that his economic policies that he wants to continue with George Bush have failed .
If he would , you know , be in the real world of American families in New York , Illinois or Florida , he would understand that . ”
Rep. Rahm Emanuel ( D - Ill . ) : “ I think he said it because he knows , in fact , he ’s removed from the day - to - day challenges people have faced in their lives .
And you see it manifest itself in the thing when he says , you know , I do n’t use a computer .
I do n’t use e-mail .
There ’s a whole economic revolution going on .
And it fundamentally changed the economy , and fundamentally changed people ’s lives , and he is removed from it . ”
Democrats say the remark could open him to the sort of attacks that undermined President George H.W. Bush when he lost to Bill Clinton in 1992 .
A new Obama ad out this morning uses the phrase “ out of touch ” and mocks McCain ’s confession that he was still learning to go online by himself : “ Things have changed in the last 26 years .
But McCain has n’t .
He admits he still does n’t know how to use a computer , ca n’t send an e-mail .
Still does n’t understand the economy .
And favors $ 200 billion in new tax cuts for corporations , but almost nothing for the middle class .
After one president who was out of touch , we just ca n’t afford more of the same . ”
An Obama official says the campaign ’s message is “ out of touch , out of touch , out of touch . ”
“ John McCain ca n’t bring about change when he is completely out of touch with the lives of regular Americans , ” the official said .
Obama made a similar coment about mayors at the forum : " Mayors have some of the toughest jobs in the country , because that ’s where the rubber hits the road .
We yak in the Senate .
They actually have to fill potholes and trim trees and make sure the garbage is taken away . "
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - SEC Chairman Christopher Cox has called on Congress to pass legislation that would make so - called credit default swaps more transparent , including requiring that dealers in over - the - counter swaps publicly report their trades and the trades ’ value .
Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox testifies at the U.S. House Financial Services Committee about financial market regulatory restructuring in Washington July 24 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Larry Downing
Writing in Sunday ’s New York Times ,
Cox noted that the $ 55 trillion credit defaults market is more than the GNP of all the world ’s nations combined , and that credit default swaps “ play an important role in the smooth functioning of capital markets . ”
But , he said , “ our markets function best when they are highly transparent , ” while credit default swaps have “ operated in the shadows , ” with “ no public discourse nor any legal requirement for these contracts to be reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other agency . ”
Having been bought and sold widely and in many cases anonymously , ” trapping large financial institutions “ in a web of transactions , ” the swaps market has left government regulators with “ no way to assess how much risk is in the system . ”
“ All investors ... are paying a price today for the lack of oversight ” of credit default swaps , which Cox describes as being “ like insurance contracts on bonds and any other assets that are meant to pay off if those assets default , ” he stated .
Noting the market for credit default swaps has doubled in just the past two years alone and that “ private counterparty discipline has proven inadequate , ” Cox proffers several suggestions :
Congress should pass legislation to increase the swaps ’ transparency and give regulators “ the power to rein in fraudulent or manipulative trading practices and help everyone better assess the risks involved . ”
It should also require dealers to report over - the - counter swaps and their value publicly , he wrote , while the SEC “ should be given explicit authority to issue rules against fraudulent , deceptive or manipulative acts and practices in credit default swaps . ”
Lastly , he posits that Congress could provide support for federal regulators “ to mandate the use of one or more central counterparties -- financially stable clearance and settlement organizations -- and exchange - like trading platforms for the credit - default swaps market . ”
The SEC , he said , is “ working with the Federal Reserve , the Commodities Futures Trading Commission and industry participants to accomplish these goals on a voluntary basis , using the authority we already have . ”
But “ we will need to work closely with governments in other major markets , ” Cox warns .
He concluded that giving regulators authority “ to bring the credit derivatives market into the sunshine ” would constitute a “ giant step forwarding in protecting our financial system and the well - being of every American . ”

Nonprofits stressing over the sinking economy and capital markets should focus on the big picture and work to make sure their finances , operations and supporters are secure , says an expert on nonprofit finance .
“ At the end of the day , the biggest risk is to the people we serve , ” says Clara Miller , founder and CEO of the Nonprofit Finance Fund , a New York City - based nonprofit that provides financial and advisory services to nonprofits and their funders .
Nonprofits should take a hard look at their finances to be sure their bank accounts are safe and their cash is accessible , and they also should assess their revenue streams , she says .
While the looming recession may cause giving by individual donors to dip , for example , and while causes like the arts that depend on discretionary giving could suffer a bigger decline than social - services , she says , individual giving historically has not declined as much during recessions as some nonprofits may fear .
Government funding could decline , Miller says , and while some nonprofits actually could see an increase in government support to cover rising demand for services , the reimbursement rate for services nonprofits provide could decline .
So while a nonprofit that makes home - care visits might receive more government dollars to cover more visits , for example , it might receive fewer cents per dollar on the cost of each visit .
The expected tightening in government funding for nonprofits likely will increase the need for charitable giving to fill the gap , “ and that ’s a tough place to be , ” Miller says .
So nonprofits should move carefully and not look for quick fixes .
“ It ’s important not to panic and over - diversify lines of business , ” she says .
“ This is a time to be watchful and keep the powder dry .
” Uncertainty about the economy represents an opportunity for nonprofits to “ reach out and communicate with the board , staff and funders , ” Miller says .
“ That will make everybody feel better .
Information is important .
” Nonprofits “ do have a tendency to grit our teeth and make it through bad times , ” she says .
“ That ’s a strength .
But it can be a weakness if in fact it ’s so bad we need to be talking to one another and making contingency plans .
” And in working with foundations , which often make grants based on a “ two - year rolling average ” and “ often , especially in bad times , maintain their giving levels , ” she says , “ conversation is very important , reaching out is very important .
” Still , nonprofits should recognize that “ foundations are not going to fill the breach lost by government cutbacks , ” she says .
“ If you get most of your revenue from fundraising from government sources , it ’s unrealistic to expect philanthropy to replace those funds , ” she says .
“ If government is looking at very bad economic times and cutbacks in direct services , that ’s where we are going to feel some pain .
” And instead of working on strategic plans for the long - term , nonprofits should focus on contingency planning that looks at specific financial scenarios , Miller says .
Ultimately , surviving and thriving in tough economic times requires leadership , she says .
“ We want to be here for people who need us , so part of what we ’re trying to do is live to fight another day , ” she says .
“ This is about making sure we preserve our programs and services for the people who absolutely need them . ”

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Records from a cell phone used by President - elect Obama were improperly breached , apparently by employees of the cell phone company , his transition team said Thursday .
An Obama spokesman said the transition team was told employees at Verizon Wireless looked through billing records .
Spokesman Robert Gibbs said the team was notified Wednesday by Verizon Wireless that it appears an employee improperly went through billing records for the phone , which Gibbs said Obama no longer uses .
In an internal company e-mail obtained by CNN , Verizon Wireless President and CEO Lowell McAdam disclosed Wednesday that " the personal wireless account of President - elect Barack Obama had been accessed by employees not authorized to do so " in recent months .
McAdam wrote in the e-mail that the phone in question has been inactive for " several months " and was a simple voice flip - phone , meaning none of Obama 's e-mail could have been accessed .
The CEO also wrote the company has alerted " the appropriate federal law enforcement authorities . "
Gibbs said that while the Secret Service has been notified , he is not aware of any criminal investigation .
He said he believes it was billing records that were accessed .
Gibbs said that anyone viewing the records likely would have been able to see phone numbers and the frequency of calls Obama made , but that " nobody was monitoring voicemail or anything like that . "
Verizon Wireless , meanwhile , has launched an internal probe to determine whether Obama 's information was simply shared among employees or whether " the information of our customer had in any way been compromised outside our company , and this investigation continues , " according to McAdam .
In the e-mail , McAdam said that employees who were permitted access to these records will be allowed to return to work , but employees who accessed the account for " anything other than legitimate business purposes will face disciplinary action , up to and including termination . "
CNN White House correspondent Ed Henry contributed to this report .

Open wireless networks have served as a successful defense strategy for several alleged filesharers , as it is often impossible for content owners to prove that the person they accuse , has actually distributed the files they claim they did .
Unfortunately , for the customers of the UK ISP Karoo , running open WiFi might also get them disconnected - even if it 's unintentional .
Open wireless networks can be found on every street corner .
Some people leave their network open , simply because they are clueless about how to secure it .
Others do n’t mind that others use their network to access the Internet , or use a router that enables them to share Internet access safely with others .
In copyright infringement cases , having an unsecured wireless router creates plausible deniability .
In recent months , we have seen several cases where accused filesharers have successfully argued that someone else may have used their WiFi to share copyrighted material .
Because anyone could have accessed the network , it is impossible to prove that the defendant was the one who shared files illegally .
Not all ISPs are happy with customers who have open WiFi , however , and some even threaten to disconnect those who do .
In the September 2008 terms and conditions of UK ISP Karoo , we read ( pdf ) :
“ We shall be entitled to terminate the Service immediately if We discover that you have permitted ( whether knowingly or not ) a third party ( or third parties ) to access the Service using a wireless connection over Your Communications Line . ”
Should an ISP be entitled to demand this ?
Karoo leaves its customers no choice , and simply forbids them to leave their network unsecured , or use a FON router , despite the fact that this will be practically impossible for them to enforce .
Not only that , people who have no idea about router security are now wide open to summary disconnection by this ISP .
UK lawyers Davenport Lyons are actively encouraging that service providers of various types enforce their own terms and conditions against copyright infringers , so if you ’re with Karoo and get a complaint , you can forget about 3 strikes .
Even if you did nothing illegal , it ’s one strike and you ’re out .
Some would argue that having an open wireless network is the right thing to do .
Earlier this year , security expert Bruce Schneier wrote an extensive essay on why it ’s a good thing .
Some of his key arguments were that it is basic kindness , and that the risk of running into abusers is extremely low .
Also , when someone abuses the open WiFi to do something illegal , it is easy to defend yourself .
Schneier ’s post led to a flood of responses , and most of them agreed with the security expert .
Of course , there are pro’s and con ’s to having an unsecured network , and whether it really is a wise choice can be debated .
But , disconnecting your users simply because they , knowingly or not , have an open wireless network is a bit too strict for our taste .
Nevertheless , Karoo thinks otherwise .
Karoo did n’t respond to our requests for comment .
An analysis of the political climate following the election of 2008 ; a plea for anarchists to maintain vibrant networks and confrontational organizing even as Obama takes office ; a discussion of what it takes for such networks and organizing to succeed ; and a brief review of actions around the election , with a glimpse of what is to come .
Featuring a revision of our earlier Obama poster , and a PDF [ 6.2 MB ] of a paper used to satirize corporate media the day after the election …
As much as radicals have focused on bringing people together in public spaces over the past ten years , not all public togetherness is necessarily radical .
On election night , when sports - riot - size crowds took to the streets of many cities to celebrate Obama ’s victory , the subtext was that representative democracy , long discredited under the Bush regime , had been rehabilitated as the populist spectacle it was always meant to be .
The chants of “ Yes We Can ! ” — appropriated , like most of Obama ’s shtick , from actual grassroots movements outside electoral politics — translated to “ Yes He Can ” : in endorsing the transfer of power from one politician to another , people may feel powerful , but it is not their power they celebrate .
It was exactly the kind of display that prompts young defeatists to declare that “ the masses ” do n’t want anarchy ; to be fair , with hundreds of millions of dollars for publicity , anyone could probably have achieved the same results — even anarchists .
Obama has ridden to power on the same social currents that radicals have relied on to propel their organizing and outreach over the past eight years : disgust with the excesses of empire , longing for more fairness and sociability in daily life , optimism about vague alternatives .
It is no coincidence that the liberal anti-war movement died out just as the presidential campaigns got underway ; the race effectively subsumed the energy of all not explicitly critical of representative democracy .
This cooptation of popular momentum is as essential to the disempowerment of the populace as the brutal repression associated with the right wing .
The powers that be are equally willing to tear gas us or hire us to go door to door registering voters — whatever it takes to keep us from building our own power outside and against their structures .
In that regard , Obama ’s election marks a new phase of their efforts to keep their system viable — calculated to defuse discontent , further marginalize radicals , and maintain the essential power imbalances of our society while giving the institutions that perpetuate them a makeover .
Top - down structures obscure the motivations and individuality of the participants , but they do n’t necessarily neutralize them .
Some of those who packed the streets on the night of November 4 must harbor desires too radical to be realized under capitalism , desires which might still bubble to the surface despite the veneer of social consensus .
In Minneapolis , not far from September ’s bitter street conflicts outside the Republican National Convention , a mixed crowd of East African immigrants and predominantly white anarchists occupied a major intersection for several hours , blocking traffic and defying police until the authorities resorted to pepper spray and finally called in massive backup .
Chants of “ Yes We Can ! ” and “ U - S - A ! ” mingled with “ Smash the State ! ” and the traditional “ Whose Streets ? ” as drummers pounded out rhythms , dancers filled the lanes , and multiracial lines of masked youth taunted and blocked police cruisers .
In one reading of this event , the anarchists were cynically endangering the less privileged immigrants by luring them into a dangerous situation ; presumably , had the anarchists gone home , the immigrants would have had the sense to stop provoking the police and get back to pulling themselves up by their bootstraps — a challenge that can only be easier now that there is to be a black President , never mind the recession .
In another reading of the situation , the anarchists and immigrants found tentative common cause in seizing public space , coming together on the basis of a shared desire to celebrate — even if they respectfully disagreed on the details of what was worth celebrating .
Together , they were able to obtain a few hours of the visibility and jubilation normally forbidden to their class ; and the inevitable confrontation with the police demonstrated to all that , Obama or no , we only get what we are prepared to defend .
The Obama years will doubtless offer us countless complicated opportunities such as this one .
But bad advice abounds in radical circles as this new era looms .
Some , afraid of being misunderstood , caution against confrontational organizing of any kind , forfeiting the initiative precisely when it is most important to maintain radical momentum .
Others , in attempting to keep a principled distance from all things reformist , risk isolating anarchist projects , denying them the interplay with other efforts and milieus that makes them effective and infectious .
How do we chart a middle course , staying connected to popular currents without subordinating our own priorities to those of the forces that exploit them ?
What Now ?
Unfortunately , there is a recent precedent for anarchists freezing up and dropping the ball , which too many have already forgotten .
After September 11 , 2001 , radical projects and momentum collapsed around the country as anarchists , fearful of appearing insensitive and of running afoul of the anti-terror reaction , cancelled plans and stepped back from organizing .
The resulting loss of impetus contributed to the decline of the anti-globalization movement in the US and enabled authoritarians to determine the character of the incipient anti-war movement ; it took years for anarchist organizing to recover from these setbacks .
The lesson is that , however inconvenient a particular historical juncture may be for anarchists , it ’s always easier to maintain organizing than to start over from scratch .
Yes , Obama is the first person of color to be elected President .
His victory does n’t mean representative democracy is suddenly inclusive and egalitarian any more than the successful careers of Bill Cosby and Michael Jordan indicate that capitalism is n’t structurally racist ; it also does n’t mean that the inequalities of the system are suddenly invisible to our neighbors .
We can affirm others ’ enthusiasm at the shattering of this particular glass ceiling without endorsing the authoritarian structure that remains or giving up on our opposition to it being intelligible to those around us .
Real relationships with people in adjacent communities are the best protection against the corporate media accounts portraying them as lockstep converts to liberal democracy ; those who insist most stridently that confrontational organizing is now self - defeating may do so because they lack connection with their neighbors .
Make no mistake about it — more people of color are in prison in the United States than ever before in history .
Obama will not grant them clemency or reassemble the communities torn apart by their kidnappings .
Global capitalism continues to plunder peoples and devastate ecosystems , disproportionately affecting people of color worldwide .
If anything is racist , it is failing to attack the roots of the system that perpetrates these injustices .
Some have expressed fears that any overt resistance to Obama ’s ascendancy will be misrepresented as racist , but these have already proved unfounded .
Although there was considerable discussion on this topic before the protests at last summer ’s Democratic National Convention , not only did corporate media coverage fail to cast any such aspersions , locals on the street also seemed clear on the motivations of the predominantly white black bloc .
Participants in the protests could certainly have done more to convey their opposition to white supremacy , but the precedent indicates that it is possible for anarchists to act against Obama without being misconstrued .
Coming out of the protracted mobilizations leading up to last summer ’s Democratic and Republican National Conventions , anarchists have actually built up some networks and momentum .
It would be all the more tragic , then , for hesitation to erode those modest gains .
Depending on what happens next , the clashes outside the Republican National Convention in St. Paul indicated either that anarchists have regained the initiative in the streets , or simply that they were the last rats to leave the sinking ship of the anti-war movement .
Either momentum will fizzle as ad hoc networks drift apart , or additional efforts will shift anarchists to the forefront of radical struggles now that the former liberal opposition occupies the highest seats of power .
A word is necessary on what it takes to maintain healthy networks , since anarchists in the United States have had so little success with this .
Networks only persist when they offer something concrete and desirable to the participants .
Were there an anarchist federation that could provide its members with free health care , this country would not lack for anarchists .
The networks that developed in the buildup to the convention protests flourished because they offered the opportunity to participate in something exciting and historic ; they are unlikely to endure unless people find other ways to use them to circulate useful resources .
Otherwise , as has happened countless times already , most people will drop out in search of more productive uses of their time , leaving only the most tiresome individuals to play at bureaucracy as an end in itself .
Some tentative attempts are unfolding to make use of the networks that linger in the wake of the conventions ; if they do n’t take off , anarchists will have to start all over again next time a nationwide mobilization is called for .
So what are anarchists to do , at the opening of the era heralded by Obama ’s victory ?
First , we should maintain explicitly anarchist organizing .
This does n’t mean refusing to work with non-anarchists , but establishing our own projects and organizing bodies , so we wo n’t be stuck reacting to others ’ initiatives or lose ourselves in authoritarian structures that absorb our efforts without bringing real liberation any closer .
The efforts of the RNC Welcoming Committee provide an excellent example of this , in stark contrast to the absence of any serious anarchist initiatives at the Republican National Convention of 2004 .
Now that the Democrats hold power in Washington , D.C. , it should be much easier to distinguish ourselves and our positions than it was when we were lumped in with the liberals under Bush .
And how can we organize popular resistance , when seems that everyone loves Obama ?
With the economy in shambles and global warming finally acknowledged as reality , the answers to this question should be obvious enough .
Capitalism has n’t gone anywhere — on the contrary , its negative effects are only more and more apparent to all .
Rather than entrenching ourselves on the losing side of the pro-or - anti-Obama debate , we should sidestep that trap to pose new questions .
Here is one example of how this could play out concretely .
The past two Presidential inaugurations have featured spirited liberal and anarchist protests questioning the legitimacy of the new ruler ; this time , rather than simply repeating that equation with significantly diminished prospects of success , it would be strategic for an anarchist mobilization to focus on economic issues and economic targets , plenty of which can be found in Washington , D.C.
As of this writing , a vague call to action for the inauguration has circulated , but it remains to be seen whether anything more concrete will materialize .
Above all , to repeat this once more , we cannot afford to withdraw into the shadows as we did after September 11 , 2001 ; a world sliding swiftly into catastrophe cannot afford this either .
But to urge anarchists to maintain confrontational organizing is not to endorse any and all action for its own sake ; on the contrary , it is essential that we pick our battles carefully .
The disaster of capitalism presents us with an endless number of fires to put out , and running around attempting to do so with no strategy can only exhaust us pointlessly .
As our numbers and resources are currently extremely limited , we should start with the objectives that will best enable us to extend our networks and capabilities .
Once we ’ve done so , we ’ll be better equipped to put an end to mountaintop removal , thwart the racist deportations carried out by ICE , and so on .
We leave it up to you , dear readers , to sort out what this looks like in practice — though here ’s a hint .
Appendix A : A Point of Departure
This year , with one exception , anarchist actions around the election were fairly isolated and predictable .
There were the usual scattered acts of vandalism , presumably limited to small in - groups , and principled refusals to participate in the electoral spectacle , which attract an even narrower demographic ; only one effort stood out as subversively combining public and clandestine elements .
The morning following election day , consumers around the country woke up to find that the newspapers in the dispensers on their streets , and in some cases even in their very driveways , had been provided with a spurious front page courtesy of local pranksters .
This occurred in at least twenty cities , including Washington , D.C. , New York City , Lawrence , Milwaukee , Duluth , New Orleans , and Chicago , not to mention several cities in Iowa , California , and North Carolina .
One paper estimated that 1000 copies of their publication alone had been affected .
Presumably , one or two groups came up with this idea , then solicited the participation of others around the country .
Because it involved comparatively low risk on the street level , it offered a perfect opportunity for newer groups to build up experience in an activity they would n’t necessarily have had the resources to pull off alone and to invite new people to participate .
This is exactly the sort of format that can enable a network to increase its numbers and capabilities .
On top of all this , the action gave visibility to dissent precisely when Obama ’s triumph was obscuring it .
This action demonstrated the proper way to make use of the networks that remain after the convention protests .
Had one group simply called for actions targeting corporate media , surely very little would have happened .
The point of a network is to save organizers the trouble of duplicating groundwork , and to increase the scope of what can be achieved with the same tactics so it is possible to escalate conflict without increasing individual risk .
Further efforts to utilize these networks need not take the same form , but they must follow the same basic principle ; otherwise , the groups that compose the networks will inevitably return to the isolation of focusing exclusively on local projects without outside support .

I ’m in love with statistics .
Knowing statistics has changed how I view the world and it ’s often hard for me to convey this to people because statistics has been tragically misrepresented to the public .
Most people think that statistics is a subset of math but I believe that , fundamentally , statistics is a philosophy class and I wager that if it were sold as that , it would be much more popular .
At it ’s core , statistics is an epistimology ( the philosophy of knowledge ) that happens to use math as it ’s language .
It ’s about probing the nature of certainty and doubt , understanding the power of knowing and the limits of knowledge .
Let me give a simple example :
Your friend has a coin which is either fairly weighted or weighted to land Heads 80 % of the time .
You observe a series of coin tosses and it comes down HTHHHTHTHHTTTHTHTHHHH .
What does this tell you about either hypothesis ?
What does this new knowledge now allow you to infer about the nature of the world around you ?
Notice that certainty is impossible , no matter what sequence of coin tosses you observe , it ’s possible for it to be generated by either hypothesis .
The knowledge you are gaining is inherently probabilistic , inherently statistical .
How does each additional coin toss influence your beliefs ?
How many coin tosses are required for you to have any useful knowledge ?
If you have less than that number , what is the nature of your belief ?
All of these questions are deeply philosophical but they cannot be answered without an analytical toolkit .
Understanding statistics rewired my brain , made my see everything in the world around me in a different light .
It was a mental augmentation that made me a quantum leap smarter .
But I ’m not going to lie , statistics also kicked my ass .
I rarely struggle to master anything but the first statistics class I took , I got a 68/100 and came out of it unimpressed .
I came into statistics like I did any other math class and I focused on learning statistics as a skill to be mastered .
And the work was challenging enough that I never thought to look for the bigger picture , to look for a mental framework to fit it all under .
As a result , I could grind out the calculations and know what the result was but the understanding was not there .
It was n’t until I took statistics again in Graduate School and had some background in what I was learning that I started to see the underlying roots of statistics .
I think the way statistics is taught now has had a profoundly detrimental impact on how it has been applied .
There are some that argue that the recent financial crisis is fundamentally rooted in financial quants who were only interested in applying statistical tools without being fully aware of the nature of what they were doing .
If statistics had been described to me as a philosophy class , I would have come in much more aware of the conceptual side of it rather than merely focusing on the tools and techniques .
I would have understood it as a way of thinking .
The problem is , you ca n’t at the same time divorce statistics from the math .
Without the mathematical rigor , statistics is an empty husk .
Philosophy majors take philosophy precisely to get away from math and Engineering / Science majors took their subjects to get away from the wishy washy abstract thinking of philosophy .
It ’s hard to find people who have an affinity to both and when you only have one semester to get through as much materiel as possible , covering the philosophical side is going to severely limit how deeply you can dive into the material .
Still , after speaking to a friend who revealed to me her choice of major hinged solely on not having to take a statistics course , I wonder if things had been different if she knew it was all about philosophy ?
Ultracapacitator Flashlight Charges in 90 Seconds , Does n't Use Batteries
November 10th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
I ’m always on the lookout for dependable flashlights , so the upcoming release of 5.11 Tactical ’s Light for Life has really piqued my interest .
Instead of batteries , the flashlight uses an ultracapacitator to hold its charge .
According to the company , the flashlight can perform 50,000 charge / discharge cycles with no degradation of quality — that ’s one charge a day for over 135 years .
And if that is n’t impressive enough , it can go from being dead to fully charged in 90 seconds .
The flashlight provides 90 minutes of light per charge .
The 16 oz .
Light for Life has no replaceable parts , and requires zero maintenance .
At $ 169.99 , it ’s somewhat of a bargain considering it may be the last flashlight you ever buy .
For detailed information on the inner workings of the Light for Life ’s ultracapitator , check out the flashlight ’s blog .

Sam Leffler releases HAL source
Sam Leffler , maintainer of the binary HAL that is also used in MadWifi releases , has released the source code for his HAL variant under ISC license .
It is available through a Subversion repository ( web interface ) , which is also be used actively for development and further improvements .
In his announcement , Sam states :
Coincident with the release of this code I have concluded my agreement with Atheros whereby I had access to information about their devices .
This means that in the future all fixes , updates for new chips , etc. will need to be a community effort .
Atheros states the Linux platform will be the reference public code base so folks wanting to add support for other platforms will have to scrape the information from there .
" Linux platform " refers to ath5k and ath9k .
Interested parties are advised to attend the ath5k - devel and ath9k - devel mailing lists .
These lists may be also used to ask general questions about the chipsets supported by the respective drivers .
For Linux developers this means further access to documentation to help enhance drivers like ath5k in particular for the AR5210 and AR5211 family of chipsets .
For the FreeBSD and NetBSD family this means a drop in open replacement for the binary HAL which was being used .
The Minnesota Senate Recount is in full swing , and with new numbers posted daily , it can , at times seem overwhelming .
But fear not , I 've created a snazzy new image that dynamically updates each night ( at 8 PM CT ) upon the release of new data by the Secretary of State .
The maps may initially seem cryptic , but its all explained below .
I 've also posted html and BBcode for each image so you can help spread the word , and keep others in the know .
The data from the SOS is provided at the precinct level , but our maps are only presentable at the county level .
To compensate , our algorithm loops through the entire result adding each precinct 's data to the associated county ; the result of this computation provides a county level extrapolation that allows for a graphical visualization of the most current recount result .

I 'll now attempt to explain the peculiarities of each map and the associated colorization process .
Franken vs Coleman ( 0 % , 1 , 3 )
The upper left most map of Minnesota depicts the percent margin of victory in each county using the unofficial results of the Minnesota Senate election .
All totals pertaining to unlisted candidates are included in our analysis .
The color purple represents counties decided by less than 3 % of the final margin , decrementing by 1 percent for each change in color .
The darkest purple represents a voting margin of 1 % or less , the middle purple between 1 % and 2 % and the lightest purple between 2 - 3 % .
The blue and red then represent counties that were decisively won by either Al Franken or Norm Coleman , respectively .
The red and blue counties follow a 3 % scale .
The lightest blue ( or red ) represents a 3 - 6 % margin , followed by 6 - 9 % as the color grows darker , then finally a 9 % + margin of victory for the darkest blue ( or red ) .
% Ballots Counted ( 0 % , 16.6 , 16.6 )
The upper right most map illustrates the ratio between the number of recounted votes and the certified vote totals for each county .
The counties in gray have yet to begin the recount process .
If the percent of recounted votes over certified votes is less than 50 % , the county is colored purple ; if this ratio is greater than 50 % the county is colored with respect to winning candidate , either blue or red .
The color gradations take place in 16.6 % divisions .
The tint , for each color represents the highest range .
For purple this range is 33.3 - 50 % segment while the darkest blue ( or red ) represents the 83.3 % - 100 % division .
The color grows lighter as the percentage decreases .
Ballots Challenged ( 0 % , 1 , 7 )
The bottom left map attempts to illustrate the discrepancy between challenged votes , in each county , by each candidate .
The purple counties are divided into single challenge divisions while the partisan colors are separated by seven .
The partisan coloring begins after a four challenge offset with blue representing a Franken challenge and red a Coleman challenge .
Gray depicts counties with no challenge discrepancy ; this may or may not include counties that have yet to begin recounting .
Recounted Vote Gain ( 0 % , 1 , 5 )
The last image provides the net vote gain , per county based on the difference between the current recount result and the initially certified count .
If less than 3 votes have been gained by either candidate in a given county that county will be colored purple in single vote divisions .
If a candidate has a net gain of more than 3 votes in any county it will be colored accordingly ; blue for Franken , and red for Coleman .
The partisan coloring is done in 5 vote increments .
Gray again represents counties that have yet to begin their recount process .

Pricey new duds are n't helping Palin in polls
Image 1 of / 8 Caption Close Pricey new duds are n't helping Palin in polls 1 / 8 Back to Gallery
Receiving more than $ 150,000 in clothing and accessories from the Republican National Committee last month does n't just run counter to Gov. Sarah Palin 's image as a " Wal - Mart Mom from Wasilla , " it also might have violated the spirit if not the letter of a campaign finance law co-authored by her running mate , Sen. John McCain .
The 2002 McCain - Feingold law prohibits funds that " are donated for the purpose of supporting the activities of a federal or state officeholder " from being used for personal expenses , including clothing , but it does n't preclude party committees from doing so .
Politico.com first reported the expenditure on clothing , hair styling , makeup and other " campaign accessories " made in September , and the McCain camp could n't tamp down the story by saying that it intended to donate the items to charity after the election .
" With all of the important issues facing the country right now , it 's remarkable that we 're spending time talking about pantsuits and blouses , " McCain spokeswoman Tracey Schmitt said .
" It was always the intent that the clothing go to a charitable purpose after the campaign . "
However , in May 1993 , McCain said , " The use of campaign funds for items which most Americans would consider to be strictly personal reasons , in my view , erodes public confidence and erodes it significantly . "
Down in polls
What 's eroding even more significantly - and quickly - could be the public 's confidence in Palin .
For the first time Wednesday , according to a new MSNBC / Wall Street Journal poll , more people have a negative response to Palin than a positive one .
The poll of 1,159 registered voters from Oct. 17 to 20 found that 47 percent viewed Palin negatively ; 38 percent saw her in a positive light .
The poll found that 55 percent felt she was n't qualified to be president .
In September , shortly after McCain asked her to join the GOP ticket , Palin enjoyed a 47 to 27 percent positive rating .
" Coming at a time that more Americans are being asked to do more with less , this does n't look good , " said Linda Basch , president of the nonpartisan National Council for Research on Women .
" The question about her clothing fits in with her two - dimensional portrayal in this campaign :
She 's either the attack dog or the hot babe , " Basch said .
" The American people ( in the MSNBC / WSJ poll ) are showing that they believe that she does n't have a command of domestic or foreign policy issues .
She has not spoken out about the issues that matter in this campaign to women .
" And now , people feel the hot babe is not going to be able to fix things , " she said .
Even California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger sounded unsure Wednesday that Palin is ready to fix things , even though he 's about to campaign for McCain in Ohio .
On Wednesday , CNN's Campbell Brown asked the governor if Palin was qualified to be president .
Schwarzenegger replied , " She will be . "
Prompted for more by Brown , he added : " By the time that she is sworn in , I think she will be ready . "
The new threads and accessories for Palin and her family included $ 49,425.74 spent at Saks Fifth Avenue stores in St. Louis and New York and $ 75,062.63 at Neiman Marcus - stores that do n't have outlets in the small towns of " real America " that the Republican vice presidential nominee has been referencing lately in stump speeches .
" She 's an enigma , " said Susan Carroll , a professor of political science at Rutgers University and co-editor of " Gender and Elections : Shaping the Future of American Politics . "
She added , " She 's a mix of all these different images . "
Palin told CBS ' Katie Couric last month that she considers herself a " feminist " but called herself " Caribou Barbie , " while Alec Baldwin told her " You are way hotter in person " last weekend on " Saturday Night Live . "
Buttons with her photo and the tag " Hottest Governor from the Coldest State " sold out at the Republican National Convention in September .
More than 1.2 million people have seen a video of Palin strutting in a one - piece bathing suit in a 1984 beauty contest - about 10 times as many as have viewed the McCain - Palin campaign 's " Joe the Plumber " commercial .
She is only the second woman in history to appear on a major party presidential ticket , but some analysts say she has blurred that distinction by spending less time talking about issues that male politicians rarely discuss - like increased day care or equal pay for women - than she has telling voters that Barack Obama has " palled around " with terrorists .
She links Obama 's tax policies to socialism , yet as Alaska 's governor she taxed oil companies and redistributed their wealth to residents of her state in the form of $ 1,200 annual checks .
She calls herself a reformer , yet an independent investigation into the Alaska troopergate scandal found that she " abused her power by violating " the state 's ethics law .
Confusing
" This is confusing to people , " Carroll said .
" They do n't know where to place her .
I do n't think this ( the clothing purchases ) will do much to her base of supporters , but it may to others . "
Perhaps Palin 's self - appointed " hockey mom " image was a bit overblown .
" She was never a hockey mom , she was always the prom queen sitting in the back of the convertible waving to the hockey moms , " said Simon Doonan , creative director at Barneys New York , the high - end clothing store .
As a fashion expert , Doonan did n't have a problem with Palin 's expenditures , as $ 150,000 does n't go as far as it used to - especially when you 're a national candidate making several personal appearances a day .
He estimated that outfitting Palin - shoes to accessories - in the style she has been sporting would run about $ 5,000 per outfit .
" In my mind , ( $ 150,000 ) is not nearly enough , " Doonan said .
" She should be out there feeding the economy - as long as she is buying American and shopping retail . "
A spokesman for the Obama campaign said it has paid for hair and makeup costs associated with interviews or events but has not paid for clothing worn by the candidates or their spouses .
The Democratic National Committee has not spent anything on clothing and accessories for the Obamas , the Bidens or their families .
Part of the clothing affair is a double standard that female politicians face .
Democrat John Edwards drew scorn during the primaries last year for receiving two $ 400 haircuts , but Sen .
Hillary Rodham Clinton 's wardrobe was dissected in ways almost equal to examinations of her health care policy .
" Men have it easy in that they have this uniform - a dark suit , white shirt and red tie - while women are expected to be different , " said Debbie Walsh , director of the Center for American Women and Politics .
Discussing the RNC clothing purchase for Palin is fair game as long as it is in context of potentially being " an ethics issue , " Walsh said .
" But if someone is talking about her clothing or sexualizing her in some way that you would n't a male candidate , then it becomes problematic . "
What 's even more disturbing to Walsh is how male commentators on the cable news networks continue to comment on " how hot she is . "
" It 's not like she 's dressing suggestively - she 's wearing suits all the time , " Walsh said .
" At this stage of the campaign , with all of the important things going on , I really wish we could get back to talking about the issues , and her stands on them . "
And in a story in Newsweek that was posted today :
NEWSWEEK has also learned that Palin ’s shopping spree at high - end department stores was more extensive than previously reported .
While publicly supporting Palin , McCain ’s top advisers privately fumed at what they regarded as her outrageous profligacy .
One senior aide said that Nicolle Wallace had told Palin to buy three suits for the convention and hire a stylist .
But instead , the vice presidential nominee began buying for herself and her family — clothes and accessories from top stores such as Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus .
According to two knowledgeable sources , a vast majority of the clothes were bought by a wealthy donor , who was shocked when he got the bill .
Palin also used low - level staffers to buy some of the clothes on their credit cards .
The McCain campaign found out last week when the aides sought reimbursement .
One aide estimated that she spent “ tens of thousands ” more than the reported $ 150,000 , and that $ 20,000 to $ 40,000 went to buy clothes for her husband .
Some articles of clothing have apparently been lost .
An angry aide characterized the shopping spree as “ Wasilla hillbillies looting Neiman Marcus from coast to coast , ” and said the truth will eventually come out when the Republican Party audits its books .
Alone , so far as I can see , amongst the British press , The Times insists on referring to Mumbai as Bombay in all its reports on the carnage .
In the larger scheme of the atrocities , it is , of course , of no great matter , but it does seem a little odd .
It is , apparently , because the paper ’s readers find the use of the word Bombay ' more familiar ' .
Which has a whiff of Empire about it somewhere .
Nor is there much consistency .
England 's cricketers , while they were still there , played a Mumbai XI , which had to be referred to as such - but then they played ' in Mumbai ' too .
Very confusing .
Maybe the Times thinks its sports fans are more up to date than its news consumers ( which would be a tad counter - intuitive ) , but either way , it ’s been a while now since the name was changed by the Indian parliament ( in 1997 , in fact ) .
Long enough for even the most traditional of the Thunderer ’s readers to get used to it , surely ?
And while I ’m here .
Anyone know of any good pubs in Kensington ?
a blog about how we might feel tomorrow
* Photo : Ramona Rosales * John Hodgman is an expert .
At everything .
( OK , maybe not sports . )
But where he really excels is in creating the illusion of expertise — and not letting pesky facts intrude on that authority .
From his first book , a compendium of faux trivia aptly titled The Areas of My Expertise , to his fiction - spewing shtick on The Daily Show to his role as the bloviating PC in those Mac ads , Hodgman handles the most obscure subjects with an aura of invincible confidence .
The fact that it 's fake ?
All the funnier .
Hodgman talks to Wired about his latest book , More Information Than You Require ( out in October ) , and his new area of bona fide expertise : being semi-famous .
Wired :
Is your character on The Daily Show the same person narrating your books ?
Or , for that matter , the PC in your Mac ads ?
Hodgman : I should clarify at this point : I 'm not that John Hodgman .
There 's a guy who goes on The Daily Show claiming to be me .
And there 's a guy who goes on the Mac ads claiming to be me .
Wired :
You should sue !
Hodgman :
No , I would say that the Resident Expert on The Daily Show is all me , or at least a heightened aspect of myself .
Aside from finding humor in the deadpan descriptions of things precisely as they are , I just veer off into the fantastic and the absurd .
Wired :
And that has made you slightly famous .
Hodgman :
Well , I always had this desire to celebrate and somehow be a part of things that I thought were really great .
When I wrote about Battlestar Galactica for The New York Times Magazine in 2005 , I was mainly geeking out about the fact that I was standing on the set , you know ?
So it was very unnerving and surreal to go from being the guy who wrote about Galactica to making a cameo appearance as a doctor in an upcoming episode .
Wired :
Yes , I meant to say something mean and jealous about that .
Hodgman :
Oh , I had long since come to peace with the reality that such a thing would never happen in my life , and I was very happy as a writer of fake trivia and stories about fake cameo appearances .
It is not typical , I think , for a then - 36 - year - old person with a kind of lazy eye , weak chin , and impending middle - age pudge to embark on a career in the visual medium of television .
So the new book really needed to shift a little bit in order to accommodate this new dimension that I have entered into .
Whereas the old book was written by John Hodgman , a former professional literary agent and professional writer , this book was written by John Hodgman , current famous minor television personality .
Even I must accept the bizarre reality that is my life now .
Why would that happen ?
Why ?
Wired : Because it 's funny ?
Hodgman : Comedy does offer an avenue to television and film careers for untelegenic people that great drama does not .
Wired : Did you always plan to write comedy ?
Hodgman : I was trying to write serious short stories .
But people would tell me they were hilarious .
I realized that I was ignoring the most important and easiest path to laziness of all , which is that jokes are the shortest stories there are .
Wired :
Even when you fill them with historical half - truths and obscure references ?
Hodgman : Part of the transaction between writer and reader is the pleasure of building a community and encouraging people to play along .
So there are in - jokes that I make because I 'm a geek .
And then there are in - jokes I 'm not sure anyone will get , that I leave as a kind of Easter egg .
Wired :
It 's more fun to write and more fun to read .
Hodgman : I do n't want to give anything away , but there is Moon writing in my new book .
If you read it the right way , you will find a map to a hidden door in a mountain , behind which is a room filled with wonders !
Also , there 's a disclaimer :
There is no hidden room .
The Extended Remix of Adam Rogers ' Q&A with John Hodgman
Wired :
You and I are almost exactly the same age , right in that generational zone that puts us right in the middle of Generation X .
We were important for a while , then people started to ignore us right away .
Hodgman : Yeah , but do n't you know that we 're getting more important every day ?
Wired :
Well , you 've been blogging about the presidential race .
And Matt Bai argued that , even though he 's a little bit older , Obama would be the first Gen X president .
Hodgman :
Well , yeah .
But I always found the term " Generation X " produced a lot of anxiety in me .
Wired : Really ?
Hodgman :
Well , because of the novel .
And as somebody who is an aspiring writer it was sort of nerve - wracking to have someone basically write the book about your generation , or what people would claim to be the book about your generation , before you had the chance to even think about what your generation might be .
And then you realize you do n't want to be writing about any generations anyway .
Wired :
That 's a young man 's game .
Hodgman :
That 's one of those kinds of books that you like the idea of writing it , but it 's really a very bad idea .
It 's a romance of the young fiction writer to write a generational novel along the lines of The Sun Also Rises , or whatever .
And generations usually are n't that interesting when they 're not tested by war or anything .
Wired :
Thank goodness nobody tested me by war , by the way .
Hodgman : I know .
And when they have all their testicles , and were not forced to grow up too young , you know .
I guess that was sort of the story .
But it was very anxiety - producing to be an aspiring writer who was also very lazy and did n't actually do a lot of writing .
And then all of a sudden Douglas Coupland came along and basically wrote the novel of his generation .
The next question is , well , then what 's left for me to do ?
And it took me about a decade and a half to figure out it was fake trivia .
Wired :
Well , let 's do some details .
Trace your trajectory from an office job through to the Mac commercials and The Daily Show and the books .
Hodgman : Having grown up in Brookline , Massachusetts , I then went to Yale University , where I pursued a degree in literature , which is essentially the same degree as the comparative literature major — which is to say very theory - based and very deconstructionist , Derrida and Foucault and A Hundred Years of Solitude over and over again , but with the distinction that in the literature major you only needed to know one foreign language , compared to the comparative literature major in which you needed to know two .
And if there 's one thing you should know about me , it 's that if I have the choice between learning two foreign languages or one foreign language I will learn one foreign language .
Wired :
The question dangles in the air : What did you pick ?
Hodgman : Spanish , primarily to read Latin American literature .
And then that quickly became a focus on Argentine literature .
And that quickly became a maniacal focus on Borges only .
Who himself had to learn Spanish in order to become literate .
Wired :
It 's a good point .
Hodgman :
He never read or wrote in Spanish when he was growing up , or at least if you are to believe his fable of his own life that he told .
Spanish was considered to be — that was a house language that you would speak , you know , among your family .
But the written languages were English or German .
Wired :
Oh , so he was — so Borges thought he was writing in the , in the — what do you call it ?
Hodgman : The vernacular .
Wired :
The vernacular , thank you .
Hodgman : Yeah , Spanish for him was the vernacular .
That was not a language that he — if you believe the fable — that he even knew was a written language .
And he did n't know there was literature in it .
Relatively early in his life he figured that out .
But you know , scholars of Borges who are better versed in Spanish than I will tell you that his Spanish , or his Castellano , as they say in Argentina , if I 'm going to be a real pompous jerk , is very stilted and constructed in a very sort of non-Romance language way , because he was very fond of English and other languages .
And he grew up reading the Encyclopedia Britannica .
Wired : Full of errors .
Hodgman :
That explains why he was so stupid about so many things .
Like that dude who could remember everything .
Ca n't happen .
Wired : Yeah , I never bought that .
Hodgman :
So , if you 're detecting an air of incredible privilege , small - P privilege , of just having an opportunity to enjoy a pure life of the mind plus alcohol for four and a half years — stretched out due to a six - month period of selling cheese in England — and not only enjoying , but not even thinking for a second that there was anything self - indulgent or wrong about spending your parents ' money without having any thought whatsoever to preparing a career of any kind , then your detection is correct .
That is exactly what that period of my life was .
And it became only traumatic when I left college and went to New York City to get into book publishing and realized that apparently there were a lot of people who had studied literature and English who came to New York to follow a romantic dream of being a writer and / or editor and / or book publisher of some kind .
Simple supply and demand , which I later learned about , dictated that those people did not get paid an awful lot .
I ended up working as a receptionist at a literary agency in a beautiful old brownstone , primarily because it was in a beautiful old brownstone and it matched my mental image of what a publishing house should be .
I found that to be a perfect intersection of my theoretical fondness for theoretical literature , and also my inherent laziness .
Which is to say I like writing a lot , but I do n't like writing a lot .
Wired :
That 's a real writer .
Hodgman : Sure .
But I did n't know that at the time .
I just felt conflicted .
But I enjoyed working with writers and bringing , you know , people who have the , I do n't know , the ability to actually string words into sentences that I found interesting and beautiful were very exciting to me .
Because it sort of felt like they were doing it so I did n't have to .
And I realized pretty early on that as an editor or , as I learned what an agent did , as an agent , I could help other writers and gain a lot of satisfaction out of that without having to actually do any writing of my own .
It just seemed to make sense to follow the agency path because , you know , you got a piece of the action .
And I had become immediately and very nervously aware of the need for capital .
Wired : New York will do that to you .
Hodgman : New York and a rather undisciplined and fairly stupid understanding of how credit cards work .
So , I became a literary agent 's assistant and then started representing authors who I really liked .
The other thing I figured out was that I was not alone in the world in the desire to write books .
Everyone wants to write a book .
Very few people are able to do it .
And I say that in full understanding that the books that I have written are not properly books .
They very rarely contain complete sentences .
I still have not written a novel or anything of that kind .
Those people who are able to do that are very far and few between and often insane .
Whereas most people who want to write books are not going to be able to do it .
But they often are interesting for other reasons , and I could use that to my advantage by essentially gaining access to interesting conversations with all sorts of people who wanted — who turned to me suddenly , a person in his mid-20s , as an authority on a world that they were interested in .
Accomplished businessmen and women , and people who had done all sorts of things and interesting things in their lives looked to me as an authority because they all wanted to write books .
And that was how I got my first taste of fraudulent expertise .
You know I used to go to writers ' conferences and that sort of thing , and meet people who had done fascinating things and whole careers , and now they wanted to write their detective novel about a guy who can speak to bears or whatever .
You 're sitting there hungover and telling them what you think you know about publishing , and they 're believing every word .
It was a terrible , terrible con , as so much of publishing is , to run on otherwise good - natured souls .
Anyway , I also managed to weasel my way into the lives of some really talented people who I simply wanted to be associated with .
Then I also sort of weaseled my way into the lives of say , luminaries like — you know sort of personal deities — like Dale DeGroff , who is the godfather of the cocktail renaissance of New York City .
Wired :
We 've had a couple of his recipes in Wired .
Hodgman :
Well , of course , you know , he 's the man .
And I could scam my way into an afternoon drinking with Dale DeGroff .
You could also justify a career in publishing , at that time it was the twilight of acceptable afternoon drinking in publishing .
I do n't know that that 's still the way it is .
And then of course you know in 1997 we got the Internet in the office , and that was how I found my way to a website of one Bruce Campbell .
And weaseled my way into his life as well .
Wired : Another deity .
Hodgman :
Oh he has been a personal deity of mine for a long time .
Since Nick McCarthy showed me Evil Dead at midnight at his house with a bunch of other guys , in high school .
And I am — and Jonathan Coulton , with whom I went to college , followed his career through the Brisco County , Jr. years .
And you know when you are a Bruce Campbell fan in the years before the internet , you were pretty much in the wilderness .
You felt pretty alone .
You did not know that there was anyone else there that saw things the way you did .
And as soon as the internet invaded our office in 1997 , I , like pretty much everyone else in the world , started discovering and rediscovering our generational memory .
You know , after we all got done — you can't even say " Google " — Alta Vista-ing ourselves , the next thing you plugged in were the weird , esoteric subjects and people that you half remembered or felt a personal passion for .
And suddenly everyone started discovering each other .
I discovered that there were lots of people that liked Bruce Campbell .
And within that particular niche we would all start talking together and a little community would grow and geekdom found its voice and its power in that way .
One thing I discovered as I was searching around for Bruce Campbell was Bruce Campbell .
Had his own little website where he would write amusing little stories about shooting the movie McHale 's Navy in Mexico .
Or anecdotes about , you know , taking a bike ride and seeing a fox after shooting an episode of a TV show called American Gothic .
And he could write pretty well .
And like many of those early celebrity sites on the web , they were actually started by the people who claimed to have started them .
I wrote him a little e-mail saying , " Have you ever thought about writing a book ? "
Within a day or two I had gotten an e-mail back saying , " I have .
I always wanted to write about what it 's like to be a B - movie actor .
Do you have any ideas ? "
And within another couple of days I was on the phone with him .
The magic became manifest in my shocked and thrilled ear as I heard his voice .
Wired :
That 's a lot of credibility , getting Bruce Campbell 's book out .
Hodgman : I was acutely aware of paying off this incredibly offensively stupid credit card debt that I had incurred — I mean it was the shame of my life .
And at that time , celebrity books were the business to be in , in book publishing .
As much as I love representing interesting cool novels about alternate universes and Howard Hughes pastiches , or pastiches about Howard Hughes living in Las Vegas and controlling a completely enclosed utopia of his own — that was another novel that I represented — I wanted to get in the money .
And my feeling was that — you know , this was my big coup .
Here was my celebrity book .
Whoopi Goldberg had a huge book .
Brett Butler had a huge book , Kelsey Grammer had a huge book .
This is going to be the big Bruce Campbell book .
I was going to be able to get some real money for it and help make my teenage man-crush superhero a star in book publishing .
And it 's interesting that even though there were lots of people on the Web who traded information about Bruce Campbell , for some reason 45 - year - old book publishers had not heard of him .
He was extremely patient .
It took us about a year to sell it to St. Martin 's Press .
I would try to explain to editors and publishers that Bruce Campbell does not just bring what Brett Butler brings to books , which is a sitcom .
Bruce Campbell brings an enormous , dedicated community of horror and sci- fi fans who know each other and meet each other in conventions and will line up for hours at a convention to meet Bruce Campbell and have him sign something that they had bought .
Maybe Bruce Campbell does n't have a million viewers like the wonderful Brett Butler sitcom Grace Under Fire did , which justified her enormous advance and terrible sales , right ?
He had probably 25,000 avid fans who are going to buy this book no question .
The one thing that was missing in Bruce Campbell 's life was something that he owned in the dealer 's room that those kids would go and buy and bring to him .
And in an industry in which a book that sells , you know , 15,000 - 20,000 copies in hardcover is considered to be a real success , I would think 25,000 guaranteed hardcover sales would be a modest advance .
But it just goes to show how blinkered people were by the idea of old - media celebrities being somehow more meaningful than somebody who cultivated an audience ( and was digital ) and got their devotion in return .
Wired : Campbell 's also a good example of somebody who comes out of the geek world .
Maybe in the late 1990s they did n't understand yet what a potent market that was .
Hodgman :
They certainly did not .
And to some degree it 's like , well , they kind of had a point .
It 's like , " Well this guy is a so - called celebrity that I 've never heard of .
And his last job was a TV show that lasted a single season . "
The idea of a cult hit being a powerful force in aftermarket sales of books and paraphernalia was completely unknown — even to me .
I could n't explain what it was .
All I knew was Bruce had fans and the need to sell something that he owned the copyright on .
But geekdom in general , I could n't make the argument beyond that to say , " But there are horror - movie fans who really like him . "
Because horror movie fans and sci- fi fans and comic book fans and all these potent geek purchasing communities that now have a lot of power and juice were held in utter contempt at the time .
There was another book that I was attempting to sell at one point about live action role - playing gamers .
It was by a guy named James McElroy who is also someone I had gone to college with — that 's what happens when you 're a literary agent .
You find the people you went to college with who are fool enough to let you be their agent .
And Jamie had written a book , a year in the life of a competitive cheerleading squad , which was the first book I sold .
It sold for pretty good money at the time and did okay , because competitive cheerleading was at that moment making a big splash on ESPN2 .
He wanted to follow up with a year in the life of a group of live action role - playing gamers in Maine .
The main character of the story was this guy who had purchased acres and acres and acres of wilderness that he was going to turn into a 24/ 7 fantasy world where the game would never end .
Wired : Yikes .
Hodgman : I mean , look , he was singing my tune .
This was a story that I wanted to read desperately , and he had written a really good proposal .
But it was around the same time , maybe ' 98 - '99 .
And it was still : no way , not in a million years would anyone touch somebody who wore fake tusks and called himself an orc , you know what I mean ?
As mainstream editors passed , I started turning to those editors who published science fiction and fantasy stuff , and they were even less receptive .
They were like , " We know these people , we go to these conventions , GenCons and DragonCons and everything else .
And we do n't like them .
I do n't want to have anything to do with them .
We think they 're a problem . "
Think about the initial reviews of Fellowship of the Ring .
There were real doubts about whether or not this book could be in any way interesting to a mass audience — completely ignoring the fact the book had sold millions upon millions of copies .
You know what I mean ?
It 's like , " There is no way Americans are going to go see a movie with hobbits in it . "
And there was lots of snarky reviews right after it came out , saying , " You know , for a movie with hobbits in it it 's sort of okay . "
But it was really look - down - your - nose kind of stuff .
That was the big eye opener for a lot of people who just casually discarded it and did n't care , and ignored the clear and mounting evidence that geeks as a culture were not only a vibrant , interesting , devoted bunch of incredibly smart people , but they were also purchasers .
Anyway , the Bruce Campbell book sold for an extremely small advance , which Bruce was generous enough and wise enough to take because he realized that if it did okay it just meant that he would get more in royalty .
And it ended up selling , I believe , 75,000 copies in hardcover .
Wired : Jesus .
Hodgman :
It was a huge success .
And one , to their credit , which St. Martin quickly realigned their thinking on and took advantage of it .
I do n't mean to say — I trust you understand that I 'm not suggesting that geekdom has value solely in its ability to buy crap .
Wired : Right .
Hodgman : Geekdom has value in a lot of ways .
And it 's particular value is in its ability to buy stuff that is not crap , and indeed its fairly high standards for popular culture that is not intensely stupid .
Arguably you did not need to make a movie of The Golden Compass .
You certainly did n't need to presume that people would be too stupid to figure out what the premise is simply by showing them the premise rather than giving them incredibly offensive and stupid opening narration .
Phil Pullman had proved that if you tell the story smartly and correctly , why , even children will understand the book and enjoy it in millions upon millions .
That 's what I really bristled at and still do bristle at .
Wired : Watching the new Batman movie , it was cool to of sit there and think , Ah , they 're finally learning to do it .
Like they 're finally learning to combine what used to be separate strings , to strain out the camp that infected even the good Superman movies , and turn them into these cool tales about interesting people doing cool stuff that managed to appeal to my Batman geekery as well as my William Friedkin geekery , you know ?
Hodgman : Yeah .
I mean , you know , there are good geeks and bad geeks .
There are geeks with taste and there are geeks without taste .
There are good comics and there are also comics .
I mean really awful comics .
Wired : Sure .
Hodgman :
So , I would say as a class of readers and thinkers and story enjoyers who absorb pop culture and are devoted to stories , the real difference is n't what kind of subject matter they like .
It 's the high quality of stories that they demand , and the intelligence , and how well that story challenges their intelligence , you know , as opposed to panders to it .
Wired :
It 's why a couple of years ago we recalibrated the kind of Hollywood stories we do .
For a long time we did stories about the sort of movies that we thought would appeal to our readers , but then tried to find the angle that let us do them in a more serious - minded way .
Anyway , we ended up doing a lot of stories about special effects .
It took a long time for a few of us to convince the bosses that , actually , special effects were the thing that a typical Wired reader cared about the least .
I mean you can make a TV where the walls are cardboard and the airlock moves every time somebody shuts it and it's still one of the most popular science fiction shows ever because the stories are great .
Hodgman :
You 're talking about Lost .
Wired : I was actually thinking Dr. Who , but you know …
Hodgman : Yeah , of course .
That was a bad joke .
OK .
But I think Lost is fascinating on a lot of levels , because to me it was at the epicenter of the Jock v. Nerd fight in popular culture that I think is really going on right now .
You know , there was clearly a lot of discomfort , it seems to me , among some people who were involved in making Lost in deciding whether or not it was just going to be a science - fiction show or not .
There was clearly a retooling between season two , which was incredibly geeky with all sorts of references to B. F. Skinner and esoteric pseudoscience from the ' 70s , and you know 3/ 4 inch video tapes .
Pure geek subjects .
And obviously the mystery and the mythology of what the island is and whether or not it 's the product of science or of you know something supernatural .
And then there was clearly a retooling to focus on the other element of the show , which had always been there as , " Are these three pretty people gong to fall in love with each other ? "
Wired : Right .
Hodgman :
The fight would go back and forth almost from episode to episode .
And détentes were clearly established , where it 's like well , if you give us this cheeseburger soap opera episode we 'll let you do this weird episode where the guy 's being brainwashed using techniques outlined in John Ronson 's book .
Wired :
That 's going deep .
Hodgman : Really esoteric , fun stuff .
And then we 'll do this love triangle for a while but we 'll let you build this alternate reality game just as long as it does n't get in the way of the soap opera we 're trying to keep on the air .
And I think there was a real discomfort in deciding , you know what , this is a science fiction show .
Because there was this lingering stink to the idea of a science fiction show that 's always going to be a B - material , unsuccessful , niche audience stuff .
Completely ignorant of the plain reality that people who like science fiction shows tend to be the most devoted audience members , do you know what I mean ?
Wired : Sure .
Hodgman :
And that the show was doing really , really well when it was talking about B. F. Skinner and all that sort of thing .
But even down to the kind of storytelling that was happening , there was like geek DNA versus nerd DNA .
I do n't know what was happening in the writers ' room , I do n't know if there were these fights on that level .
But I know that the end product would sort of veer between okay , is this going to be a science fiction show like The X - Files where there 's a long story arc that subdivides into a secondary story arc ?
And they all interact with each other , and it's all telling this larger story , and there has to be the hallmarks of every science fiction show , like there has to be continuity ?
You have to have — if someone says this in episode 2.15 , in episode 3.19 they can't say the opposite .
All of that sort of geeky stuff .
Or is going to be like a soap opera where indeed you may have supernatural elements or even sci - fi elements , but it 's more like , " You know what ?
We reboot every episode .
None of it matters , it gets in the way of us getting to the kiss scene .
Fuck it , we 're just going to ignore it .
Every episode is its own pocket universe , as it were , and we do n't care . "
And on that level Lost was fighting , too .
I really felt more invested than I should be in who was going to end up winning .
And I kind of feel like they both knocked each other out ultimately .
But I think it was a real bellwether in terms of where we were going in terms of mass media culture .
Whether or not what was typically considered to be a niche of culture — science fiction , supernatural stories , fantasy , whatever — was finally going to be recognized as mass culture .
And when I talk about geek culture being a niche culture , I 'm not just talking about the genre of science fiction , fantasy , comic books or whatever , I 'm also talking about a certain quality of storytelling and a certain intellectual requirement to the story that I think is what 's most off - putting to people who believe that mass culture just needs to be stupid by definition .
Ooh , I did not mean to go on such a rant .
I apologize .
Wired :
That 's all right .
It 's stuff I 've been thinking about a lot too , actually .
Hodgman : Anyway , around the time the Campbell book sold , I was getting involved in another sort of niche , which was the McSweeney 's world .
I sent in some submissions to the first issue of McSweeney 's that were rejected , until finally Dave accepted a joke letter that I had sent to my friend in Seattle , in which I sort of did a riff on this Lewis Lapham essay that had been circulating in which he gives advice to his nephew about entering magazine publishing .
And it was really pompous and ridiculous .
So , without being asked — my friend had sent me an e-mail , and I got maybe one e-mail a year at that point .
So , I sent him an e-mail back in which , I 'm sure to his confusion , I claimed to be his cousin who was a very important person in book publishing , a professional literary agent , who had all sorts of advice for how he would become a successful writer , most of which involved him buying from me a device that I called an Inner Voice , which was a small little man that you inserted into your brain who would speak interesting ideas to you .
And by the way would my friend allow me to sleep on his couch , because I had no place to go .
Wired : Right .
Hodgman :
That was the whole joke .
And Dave published that , and that would eventually become sort of the foundational voice for the column that I wrote on McSweeneys.net , as a former professional literary agent — once I had stopped being a literary agent — as the sort of deranged fraudulent authority on originally subjects pertaining to literature and publishing , and later on subjects pertaining to everything except sports .
Because even I could n't fake an authority on sports .
Wired : OK , so now you 're writing straight - ahead comedy .
Hodgman : I wrote a semi-serious short story for the Paris Review in ' 98 .
I was trying to write serious short stories .
I had no interest in writing a novel because I just did n't ever feel like I had an idea that was novel length .
And also I might have pointed out I was kind of lazy .
My attention span was pretty short , and I would write short pieces and did not find much of a market for it .
But when I would read my so - called serious short stories people would tell me they were hilarious .
Wired :
That sounds potentially insulting .
Hodgman :
Well , there were jokes in them .
It was more of a third or fourth layer .
They were n't the thing that was in focus .
Eventually I realized , as someone who was interested in writing short stories , that I was ignoring the most important and easiest path to laziness of all , which is that jokes are the shortest stories there are .
Wired :
Did you have a sense of the particular flavor of the humor that you were doing ?
Hodgman :
You know , I know now better than I knew then , in the first blush of writing funny stuff who I was consciously or unconsciously imitating .
I 've had this pleasure of being able to think about it and go , oh yeah , now I know who I stole that joke from or that pose from .
My friend Adam gave me a book of Peter Cook monologues , and I remembered how much I had liked the " One- legged Tarzan " sketch from Beyond the Fringe years before .
Like every other geek who grew up watching PBS and Dr. Who in Boston in the ' 70s , I liked Monty Python .
But I had completely forgotten that I had seen Terry Jones and Michael Palin 's 1970s book Dr. Fegg 's Encyclopaedia of All World Knowledge .
Wired : Uh-oh .
Hodgman :
Well , I mean , that 's what happens .
Things invade your brain and come out modified just enough to avoid a lawsuit .
Wired :
My mom sent up a stack of old Mad magazines from when I was a kid .
You know , she was cleaning out the house .
I started to go through them , and I had to stop .
I was terrified that I was going to find jokes that I was writing .
Hodgman :
There 's nothing less funny than trying to describe what makes humor funny .
But it was always productive for me to stop and look at a set of presumptions , whether they were presumptions specific to the publishing industry or just life the way a caveman or a space alien or in my case a deranged , self - inflated blowhard would look at things .
You know , to make sense of things simply by describing them exactly as they are , trying to erase cultural presuppositions out of your mind and just saying , oh this is what it is .
Wired : I understand that humor , like a frog , tends to die when you dissect it .
But the reason those things are funny is …
Hodgman : Usually I kill my frogs before I dissect them .
I kill them in a humane way .
Wired :
You 're not having the most fun with your dissections then .
Hodgman : I am not a monster .
Wired : I know there 's a line in here about somebody being pithy , for the biologists .
Hodgman :
Now you have gone to new places .
Wired : I went somewhere else , yes .
I 'm back .
Hodgman : Yeah .
Wired :
So , you have to know the antecedents to get the joke , right ?
You have to get the references to get the bit .
Hodgman :
To some degree you 're absolutely right .
You have examples of jokes that I 've written where the reference is so esoteric you could n't imagine anyone laughing at it .
And to me , I did n't realize the reference was that esoteric .
Say I went out there believing most people would know who the Cybermen were .
But when I talk about in my book Art Garfunkel 's album from the early ' 80s , 1981 , called Songs for Dead and Dying Rabbits , I realize I am presuming that people know that Art Garfunkel wrote the song " Bright Eyes " for the movie version of Watership Down , which is this totally absurd song about a dying rabbit , you know .
Wired :
That one went past me too .
Hodgman : Did it really ?
Wired :
It did .
Hodgman :
You never heard that Art Garfunkel song " Bright Eyes " ?
Wired :
Well , I saw Watership Down so I know I 've heard it , but — again , antecedents , right ?
Hodgman : Yeah , but here 's the thing :
In the same way that I feel that you could have made a movie — why you would bother ? — but you could have made a movie of The Golden Compass that was good , and part of the way to do that would be to not include an opening narration explaining the rules of the fantasy world that you were in , most people are willing to go along .
If you proceed with enough confidence and skill at revealing what needs to be revealed , most people will go along with the story .
I do n't know that the Art Garfunkel joke is really the best example of this , but the John Hodgman that writes these books always proceeds with absolute confidence that people understand exactly what he 's talking about even if he 's making a casual allusion to the soundtrack of Watership Down .
And I think that if I do my job correctly that confidence will , you know , will sort of buoy people along and realize , well , okay , you know he 's just deranged .
Wired :
You get the benefit of the doubt .
Hodgman : Exactly .
I was very touched recently when a writer named Mary Roach , who wrote the book Stiff , blogged a little nice thing about my first book and how much she enjoyed this piece about having a good snowball fight for children , including different styles of snowballs — snowballs that would have glass in them , snowballs made from last winter 's snow that you kept in the freezer , snowballs that were lit on fire with a flammable gel .
And it also had hints for making snow forts , including " make sure to include an icy compartment to store your vodka , " and also " watch out for wampas . "
Wired : Very nice .
Hodgman : Now , obviously , I know what a wampa is .
And immediately our brains flash back to the ultimate snow fort of all time , the Rebel base on the ice planet Hoth .
But Mary Roach , to her , she did n't know what a wampa was .
She did n't have any idea .
And to her that was the joke , that this deranged narrator was advising to be careful about something , presumably a kind of creature , that only he understands .
You 're correct that when I 'm left to my own devices I will trade an in - joke of various kinds , because they give me great pleasure .
I always enjoy telling an in - joke and letting people laugh along , because I find that they 're inclusive more than they are exclusive .
Wired :
You can build a community with an inside joke .
Hodgman :
Well , that 's exactly so .
Part of the transaction between writer and reader , between writer and audience , to me , is the pleasure of writing to build that community , to create that community , to encourage people to play along .
And so there are in - jokes that I make just because I 'm a geek and it 's funny to me to say , " Watch out for wampas . "
And then there are in - jokes that I will make that I know people will recognize .
And then there are in - jokes that I will make that are there for certain select readers .
And then there are in - jokes that I make when I 'm not sure if anyone will get it , and I 'll leave it as a kind of an Easter egg .
In my original book , I had to give a little entry for all of the 50 American states .
And West Virginia , I discovered , used to have a vibrant economy producing marbles for kids to play with .
So , you know I made very passing reference to that , which would mean nothing to someone who does n't know that about West Virginia .
Wired :
And if you do n't know , it 's still funny to think somebody makes marbles .
Hodgman : Yeah , that in itself is a joke .
It 's true : People make marbles .
Yet also it 's just sort of fascinating and beguiling and frightening to appreciate that everything that we interact with was grown or was made .
Somebody 's job has been to stamp out harmonica parts , you know .
That to me is very interesting .
So , yeah , I think it 's hilarious that people make marbles .
Those things that we take for granted , you know , the detritus of everyday life .
When you consider that there has been a human mind behind most of them .
I think that 's fascinating and tragic and funny and great .
They 're like Easter eggs , I suppose , in the way that you know you create something that you hope someone else will find .
It 's like a secret , little secret messages from my brain to yours , to see if there 's a connection there .
Sometimes I 'm surprised by what pings back in the darkness .
I love games and codes , and so much of my interest in Borges was the gamesmanship that went into those stories that he would write .
Those stories that pretended to be literary essays , and those metaphysical stories that pretended to be cheap pulp detective novels , and the codes that were written into them .
That was my pretentious bread and butter when I was doing literary theory .
What 's encoded in the language that 's telling a story that might be different than the story that the writer thinks he or she is telling .
Wired :
If you can encode secret stuff in the writing it becomes more fun to write and more fun to read .
Hodgman : Yeah , exactly .
I do n't want to give anything away , but if you read this new book in the right way there you will find a map to a hidden door in a mountain .
Wired : Goddammit .
Hodgman :
There is some moon writing in my works , let 's just say .
Wired :
There 's another reference .
Hodgman :
We 'll see if anyone can figure that .
I 'm sure they can .
So , what else ?
Wired :
Well , now I 'm wondering if I can take the galleys out on the right night of the year to see the writing .
Hodgman :
There 's a hidden room for you to find full of wonders .
Wired :
And he was never seen again .
Hodgman : Just please file your story before you go .
Wired :
Wow , you really were an editor .
Hodgman :
Also there 's a disclaimer :
There is no hidden room .
Wired : Let 's talk about performance .
Is your character the same person who is the ostensible voice speaking in the books or in the " Ask A Former Professional Literary Agent ? "
Hodgman :
Which guy ?
Is who that guy ?
Wired : The Daily Show correspondent .
Hodgman :
Oh , that dude with the glasses who goes around claiming to be me ?
Wired :
That 's the one .
Hodgman :
That guy is going to get sued .
Wired :
You know where he 's going to be .
Hodgman : Yeah , I should clarify at this point .
I 'm not that John Hodgman .
I 'm sorry if you thought that I was .
That 's a different guy .
Yeah , there 's a guy who goes on the Daily Show claiming to be me .
And there 's a guy that goes on the Mac ads claiming to be me .
Wired :
You should be able to find these folks .
Because they 're probably pulling in big Hollywood money .
Hodgman : I do n't do it for the money .
They do .
I do n't think about such things .
I would say that the Resident Expert on the Daily Show is all me .
I will sometimes be asked if I 'll be doing an interview in character or not , and I do n't even really feel like I 'm doing a character .
I am doing a heightened aspect of myself when I appear as John Hodgman as an expert .
Aside from finding humor in the deadpan descriptions of things precisely as they are — if we 're going to kill this frog even more — there 's also this sort of veering off into the fantastic and the absurd .
As I say in the introduction to the new book , reality — to paraphrase a great detective — reality is plausible , even probable , but it 's not always interesting .
And the obligation in my life , the obligation I feel is to make it interesting .
Or to reveal what is interesting in it through absurdity .
Wired :
You were somewhat surprised to find that there 's fame to be had from doing that .
Hodgman :
Well , that was problematic only in so far as that it makes my real life largely as implausible and ridiculous as the invented life I had sort of woven around John Hodgman , former professional literary agent .
You know , it is very difficult — and this is part of the real anxiety of approaching a new book — to make the sort of jokes that I would make in the first book .
For example , in the first book you know the idea of the former professional literary agent , the joke largely was when I said that I live a life of wealth and power and leisure , anyone who worked in publishing knew that was absolutely false .
That was a disjunction between reality that made the character , John Hodgman , me , delusional .
But the sort of joke where I list the various cameo appearances you made in movies , much like George Plimpton used to make cameo appearances in movies as a tweedy intellectual , has less integrity and is thus less funny if I am actually making cameo appearances in movies .
Wired :
Who 's the funny man now ?
Hodgman :
It really took the ground from beneath my feet .
It also helps that I got one of those celebrity antigravity devices .
Wired :
So jealous of those .
Hodgman : Yeah .
You can't have one .
Wired : Oh , I know .
Hodgman :
It is not typical , I think , for a then 36 - year - old person with a kind of a lazy eye and a weak chin and kind of a impending middle - aged pudge to embark on a career in the visual medium of television .
I would joke about making cameo appearances in movies , but I had come to peace with the reality , undeniable , that that would never happen in my life .
And indeed had achieved a very happy career , it would seem , as a writer of fake trivia .
So it was very unnerving and surreal to walk into a fancy hotel in Los Angeles and be recognized from television by name .
Or for that matter to be invited to do these cameos in movies , or to go from the guy who writes about Battlestar Galactica for the New York Times Magazine to the guy who does a cameo appearance as a doctor .
I do a lot of doctors .
On the set , acting , quote unquote .
Wired : I meant to say something mean and jealous about that by the way .
I forgot about that .
Hodgman : Yeah .
I spent a lot of that time feeling upside down .
And not just because I was in Vancouver , Canada , or Down Under as they call it .
Actually they call it Down Over , I believe .
The other side of the world .
Wired :
That 's just how they order eggs .
Hodgman :
But I mean to say that I was a literary agent and then when I stopped being a literary agent I became a magazine writer , and when I stopped being a magazine writer I became a book writer .
It was all largely — I mean being an agent and writing Bruce Campbell or being a magazine writer and pitching a story about Battlestar Galactica , it was all this desire to celebrate and somehow be a part of things that I thought were really great .
Wired : Sure .
Hodgman :
They were all excited that someone from the New York Times Magazine was there to write about them .
I was mainly there geeking about the fact that I was standing in the CIC , you know ?
It did not occur to me that my career would go through a black hole and come out the other side completely inside out , where I would be someone who knew the creators , and maybe I could come on and just press a button in the CIC , as a joke .
And not only that but that they would write a small part that involved me having to actually act for two days with professional actors who had done things like train and pay dues to be where they are .
That was not expected .
And even though I obviously agreed and said yes , the reality of that surreality did not hit me until I was actually there on stage and really on the other side , literally on the other side of the camera , and the other side of culture , the culture that I loved .
The impulse was still the same , I was still a weasely stalker trying to get in on something better than me .
Not many people have that opportunity
Wired : Yeah , yeah , but what 's the set like ?
Hodgman :
It 's very intricate .
They built hallways and rooms that connect and move from place to place .
And when you 're taking a break , you 're not sitting next to the craft service table somewhere .
You 're going to go sit somewhere else in the infirmary next to charts and records and post - it notes that have the corners cut off that no one will ever see .
Wired : No kidding ?
Hodgman : Yeah .
It 's awesome .
Wired :
That 's cool .
Hodgman :
To get up and to work with actors like Michael Trucco and Katee Sackhoff who are really good , you know , and to realize that you have reached levels of fraudulency and fake expertise that were a joke to you as a possibility not three years before — it was hard to deal with .
So far , I hear that my little part as a doctor has not been completely excised .
We 'll see .
But even if it does n't make it onto TV I know it happened , because I know that it was like stepping into another dimension , in which all businessman are cowboys , or the Nazis won , or I was actually on television .
All businessmen are cowboys — that was a plot from an episode of Sliders .
Wired : I was trying to figure out if it was a Westworld reference .
Hodgman :
It was n't even an episode of Sliders that I saw , because I do n't know that I ever saw an entire episode of Sliders , largely because I thought that it was an interesting idea and a clever , cheap way to do a science fiction show , but it was called Sliders , and that could not be forgiven .
But I saw the promo for it , and it was the promo where Jerry O'Connell and Salah go to a world where all business meetings are solved by shootouts .
It 's like this big corporate business and sort of a riff on Texas businessmen who wear cowboy hats with their big glass towers but they also carry guns and shoot each other .
That was what I gleaned from the promo .
Wired :
It 's a world just like our own , with one slight difference .
Hodgman : Exactly .
It 's a world just like our own — we live in a world that 's just like the real world with one slight difference .
I 'm on television .
Even I must accept the bizarre reality that that is my life now .
Why would that happen ?
Honestly , Adam , why ?
Wired :
Well , if the jokes hit , right ?
That 's what I 'm telling myself .
Hodgman : I do believe that comedy offers an avenue to television and film careers to normally ugly and untelegenic people that great drama does not .
Wired :
What do you read , what do you watch , what do you keep up with ?
What 's in the Tivo ?
Hodgman :
For the books , I spent a lot of time revisiting and visiting anew actual trivia books largely from the ' 70s , and then also going back to the '30s and the ' 20s .
Reference books , particularly old reference books , are their own kind of fiction , you know ?
I found a wonderful , old , self - published , practically Xeroxed pamphlet of superstitions of old New England at a roadside stand in Maine .
And every one of those superstitions and ways of defeating witches and ways of curing yourself of gout by rubbing a black cat on your neck is the sort of ephemera that gets tossed away .
Those are the sort of stories I love to read and love to find .
Obviously the Internet is an incredibly valuable tool to find dubious scholarship on all sorts of subjects .
When I learned that Wikipedia was all volunteers I I got excited because that meant that none of it was reliable .
In terms of general pop cultural absorption these days , I was Tivoing or DVRing Lost and Battlestar , the Daily Show obviously ' cause I have a professional obligation to enjoy myself .
I was watching Hell 's Kitchen because I really find astonishing the friction between Gordon Ramsey , the actual incredibly principled and talented no -nonsense chef who knows things , inhabiting the same body as Gordon Ramsey , the guy who will apparently do anything for money .
I am reading somewhat belatedly the Michael Chabon book , The Yiddish Policemen 's Union , which is just fantastic .
And then , you know , comic books .
I reread Watchmen recently , getting ready for the movie .
I have probably read that book ten times and I 'm still discovering new things in it .
Talk about secret messages and hidden codes .
The echoes and little subplots that are playing themselves out in the margins of the margins of that story , in the third layer back of the perspective panel to panel , I think there are few pure storytellers as gifted as Alan Moore .
In fact , it has become unpleasurable for me to read many comics because of how Watchmen and Frank Miller 's Dark Knight Returns are imitated without attribution over and over and over again .
You know , I love Miller .
I saw — I met and had drinks with him on Sept. 10 , 2001 .
I went home .
I had just reread Dark Knight Returns and was marveling again at the grim fury of the idea of that electromagnetic pulse hitting the world or hitting the Western Hemisphere , and Jim Gordon looking up and the plane flying into the building .
I was talking with Frank Miller about that , and then the next day was the next day .
That 's crazy .
But there you go .

A whale swims off the Valdes peninsula , Argentina .
After summering in the Arctic , whales return to the southern seas each winter to reproduce .
From July to November , whales mate and bear their young along the coasts of the Valdes Peninsula in Argentina .
Until the 1950s , this migratory marine mammal was extensively hunted for its meat and the oil extracted from its fat , which brought it to the edge of extinction .
Protective measures were adopted after international attention was focused on the problem in 1937 .
In 1982 a moratorium was declared on whale hunting for commercial purposes , and in 1994 the southern seas became a whale sanctuary .
After decades of protection , 7 of the 13 whale species , of which only a few thousand remain ( 10 to 60 times fewer than in the early 20th century ) , are still endangered .

Finally , Joe the Plumber gets to tell his side of the story on FNC's Mike Huckabee show .
DETROIT  General Motors is living on borrowed time , spending more than $ 2 billion in cash a month and lobbying for a government bailout to keep it out of bankruptcy .
And for about 100,000 of its white - collar retirees , time is about to run out on G.M. ’s gold - plated medical benefits .
To conserve its dwindling cash reserves , G.M. is eliminating lifetime health care coverage for its legions of retirees at the end of this year , leaving people like Ken Hewitt to fend for themselves in deciding how to cover their doctor ’s bills and prescription drug costs .
“ Everybody felt like they were set for life , ” said Mr. Hewitt , 81 , who retired from the former Chevrolet Engineering Center in 1982 and lives north of Detroit .
“ It ’s been difficult , but the information they ’ve given us has been beneficial .
Still , when you get to be our age , it ’s tough to make any big changes like that . ”
Game of the Year Edition see deal Fallout 3 : Game of The Year Edition - PC $ 19.99on Gamestop Bethesda did not deliver a standard Game of the Year Edition by simply adding a few bells and whistles to go along with a price drop .

Access to Information documents and campaign promises show that since 2003 alone , the Big Three , General Motors , Ford , and Chrysler , have received or been promised $ 782 - million from taxpayers .
This figure does not include hundreds of millions more committed previous to this .
The table can be found here .
“ Taxpayers cannot afford to continue to bail out mismanaged companies that expect perpetual handouts in good and bad times , ” stated CTF Acting Federal Director Adam Taylor .
“ The Big Three ’s demand for tax dollars occurs as regularly as these same companies shed shifts and jobs and it ’s time to put a stop to throwing good money after bad .
Thousands of layoffs have shown clearly that these subsidies are not working . ”
Automakers are now looking to Prime Minister Harper and Premier McGuinty for more public money to the tune of $ 1 - billion .
CTF data also reveals that firms receiving handouts in the form of “ repayable loans ” do n’t pay back the money or in some cases are n’t required to for 50 years .
“ A clear example of the Ontario government ’s misguided auto strategy is its decision to give millions of dollars to General Motors to build a gas - guzzling muscle car like the Camaro , at a time when most companies are moving to fuel efficient vehicles , ” stated CTF Ontario Director Kevin Gaudet .
“ Ontario taxpayers have provided more than half the money to the Big Three only to see jobs disappear as quickly as the handouts do .
Further , the so - called $ 175 - million “ loan ” to General Motors in November 2003 wo n’t even come due until Dec. 31 , 2055 .
Do you know of a bank that offers an interest - free loan without a single payment due for two generations ? ” asked Gaudet .
Taylor concluded : “ If governments continue to shore - up the ailing auto industry expect other industries — from textiles to aerospace — to come cap - in hand pleading the case for how “ special ” their industry is and how worthy it is for handouts .
This nonsense has to end .
The CTF will be mobilizing its supporters this week encouraging Canadians contact the government en masse and say NO to an auto bail - out .
The Harper and McGuinty governments need to stand - up for taxpayers and not failed American multi-national corporations . ”

Meteor over Edmonton Alberta Canada ( VIDEO )
Check out the meteor that streaked across the night sky over Edmonton , Alberta , Canada on November 20 , 2008 .
We 've got several videos that capture the phenomenon from different angles .
Scientists are hunting for the meteor that made a spectacular show before exploding into pieces and falling to earth .
They are calling it one of the biggest meteors to be seen in the country in the last decade .
Police in the province received hundreds of phone calls from people who witnessed the event .
Many heard a loud boom in the distance as the meteor struck the earth .
University of Calgary planetary scientist Alan Hildebrand plans to investigate an area near Macklin , Saskatchewan .
He said , " It would be something like a billion - watt light bulb . "
Check out the videos below .
Voters in three states did the right thing last week by defeating dangerous anti-abortion measures on their ballots .
In Colorado , an overwhelming vote of 73 percent to 27 percent rejected a wild initiative that would have amended the state ’s Constitution to bestow on fertilized eggs , prior to implantation in the womb , the same legal rights and protections that apply to people once they are born .
In addition to ending abortion rights , this doozy threatened to ban widely used forms of contraception , curtail medical research involving embryos , shutter fertility clinics , and criminalize necessary medical care .
In South Dakota , 55 percent of voters said no to a sweeping abortion ban that its backers had hoped to use as vehicle for challenging Roe v. Wade , the 1973 Supreme Court decision that recognized a woman ’s right to make her own childbearing decisions .
The defeated measure was a near - twin of the abortion ban handily rejected by voters just two years ago .
In California , meanwhile , voters turned back an attempt by abortion - rights opponents to mandate parental notification , the issue ’s third ballot defeat in the state in four years .
C Programming Notes
At its most basic level , programming a computer simply means telling it what to do , and this vapid - sounding definition is not even a joke .
There are no other truly fundamental aspects of computer programming ; everything else we talk about will simply be the details of a particular , usually artificial , mechanism for telling a computer what to do .
Sometimes these mechanisms are chosen because they have been found to be convenient for programmers ( people ) to use ; other times they have been chosen because they 're easy for the computer to understand .
The first hard thing about programming is to learn , become comfortable with , and accept these artificial mechanisms , whether they make ``sense '' to you or not .
In fact , you should n't worry if some ( or even many ) of the mechanisms used for programming a computer do n't make sense .
It does n't make sense that the cold water faucet has to be on the right side and the hot one has to be on the left ; that 's just the convention we 've settled on .
Similarly , many computer programming mechanisms are quite arbitrary , and were chosen not because of any theoretical motivation but simply because we needed an unambiguous way to say something to a computer .
In this introduction to programming , we 'll talk about several things : skills needed in programming , a simplified programming model , elements of real programming languages , computer representation of numbers , characters and strings , and compiler terminology .

Robert Higgs  scholarly specialty has been the study of how government grows exponentially in times of real or exaggerated crisis and rarely returns to its previous size , scope and power after the precipitating crisis is over .
This  Higgs Ratchet Effect detailed nicely in the economists 1987 book Crisis and Leviathan : Critical Episodes in the Growth of American Government ( 1987 ) proves that James Madison was right in 1794 to warn us about the old politicians  trick of turning every contingency into a resource for accumulating force in government .
The ratchet effect operated during World Wars I & II , the Cold War and economic crises like  The Great Depression ,  and the Independent Institute ( independent.org ) senior fellow suspects the war on terror and the current global financial meltdown will be no different .
We asked Higgs to provide us with an excerpt or two from his latest book , Neither Liberty Nor Safety : Fear , Ideology , and the Growth of Government ( Oakland , Calif. : The Independent Institute , 2007 ) .
 Bill Steigerwald
Our evolved psychological and physiological makeup predisposes us to fear actual and potential threats , even those that exist only in our imagination .
. . .
The people who have the effrontery to rule us , who dare call themselves our government , understand this basic fact of human nature .
They exploit it , and they cultivate it .
Whether they compose a warfare state or a welfare state , they depend on fear to secure popular submission , compliance with official dictates , and , on some occasions , affirmative cooperation with the states enterprises and adventures .
. . .
Without popular fear , no government would endure more than twenty - four hours .
The fear need not be of the government itself and indeed may be of the danger from which the government purports to protect the people .
Of course , some of the threats that induce subjects to submit to government in the hope of gaining its protection and thereby calming their fears may be real .
I am not arguing that people who look to government for their salvation act entirely under the sway of illusory threats , although I do insist that nowadays , if not always , many public fears arise in large part if not entirely from stimulation by the government itself .
If the peoples fears may be ( 1 ) of the government itself , ( 2 ) of real threats from which the people look to the government for protection , and ( 3 ) of spurious threats from which the people look to the government for protection , we must admit that the relative importance of each type of fear varies with time and place .
In every case , however , the government seeks to turn public fear to its own advantage .
Video : Realistic shadows in still photos that lengthen as the day goes on are possible in a new zero power display
Despite advances in image - capturing technology , photographs preserve an unchanging moment in time .
Now a new zero power display breathes new life into still images by letting an image change in appearance through the day as the direction of the Sun ’s light changes .
Using the system , shadows in a still life can be made to move and lengthen just like they do in the real world , or the Sun could be made to move across the sky of a landscape photo .
The technique could also be used to add an extra dimensionality to bill board displays , the system ’s lead developer Martin Fuchs at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics told New Scientist .
Fuchs ’ team at Max Planck collaborated with Ramesh Raskar at the MIT Media Lab , Cambridge , Massachusetts .

Photo sandwich
The researcher ’s prototype device , which can be attached to a window , comprises three layers : a lens array at the rear focuses light onto a transparency film on which a photograph is printed ; the light passes through and is projected onto a “ diffuser ” in front , where the image is revealed .
When the Sun rises in the east , the projected image shows objects casting a long shadow to the west .
As the Sun climbs towards midday , the shadow shrinks , before extending to the east in the evening .
This is possible because the picture on the transparency is actually a composite image , constructed from several hundred photographs capturing the same scene throughout the day .
All those images are combined into one , which is divided into thousands of hexagons a few millimetres across .
Each hexagon shows how the light varies in that small part of the picture across the several hundred source images .
The hexagon for an area brightly lit in half of the images but in shadow in the other half , is half light and half dark ( see image , top right ) .
Rather than illuminating the whole hexagon , the lens array focuses sunlight onto the same tiny point within each hexagon , thus projecting only one of the many source images onto the diffuser .
Super hologram
Because the effect is purely optical , the shadows move in real time and the device requires no power ( see video above ) .
“ If you print out a picture you only have a 2D representation , ” says Fuchs .
“ With our process you can maintain some of the variety of three - dimensions . ”
It should be possible to improve the 3D effect , says Fuchs .
Currently the device displays a different image depending on the direction of the light source , but his team is working on an alternate version that projects a different image depending on the viewer ’s position too , as a hologram does .
That could make portraits with eyes that follow the viewer around the room a reality .
Doing that requires additional layers of lenses between the transparency and the diffuser , Fuchs says .

Mr Obama 's team is scrutinising Mr Bush 's executive orders US President - elect Barack Obama will seek to reverse Bush administration policies when he enters office on 20 January , his transition chief has said .
John Podesta said executive orders by President George W Bush on issues such as stem cell research and oil drilling were at odds with Mr Obama 's views .
Plans to pass a raft of last - minute regulations are also being watched .
On Monday Mr Obama and Mr Bush will hold their first meeting since the Democrat 's election victory .
Mr Obama and his wife , Michelle , will be given a tour of their new home at the White House .
Afterwards the president - elect and Mr Bush are expected to hold what Mr Obama has described as " substantive talks " .
' Deliberate haste '
The meeting has been arranged with unusual haste - analysts say this is in part because the US is at war , and also the transition is taking place in the midst of an economic crisis .
Mr Obama has said that dealing with the economy is his top priority , and that he will move with " deliberate haste " to choose his cabinet .
You see the Bush administration even today moving aggressively to do things I think are not in the interest of the country
John Podesta Speaking on Fox News , Mr Podesta said Mr Obama 's team was working hard to " build up that core economic team " .
Speaking on Friday in his first news conference as president - elect , Mr Obama said he would seek a constructive approach to the meeting with Mr Bush .
" I 'm not going to anticipate problems .
I 'm going to go in there with a spirit of bipartisanship , " he said .
However , reports from Washington suggest Mr Obama 's transition team has been working hard to identify issues where executive decisions made by Mr Bush could be quickly repealed by Mr Obama .
The Washington Post reported that transition officials had compiled a list of some 200 executive orders to be considered for repeal .
Mr Podesta said executive orders on stem cell research or drilling in Utah could be easily repealed as no congressional action was needed .
In 2001 , Mr Bush issued an executive order limiting federal funding for medical research using human embryo stem cells .
The move was popular with moral conservatives but critics say it has hampered US medical research efforts .
BUSH DECISIONS UNDER FIRE Limited federal funding for medical research using human embryo stem cells
Aid groups receiving US aid barred from counselling women about abortion availability California barred from imposing minimum standards of vehicle fuel efficiency Utah land being opened up for oil and gas drilling Mr Podesta highlighted the Bush administration 's attempts to authorise oil and gas drilling in Utah as one order which could be easily repealed .
The Washington Post said other orders affecting environmental legislation and abortion issues were also under consideration .
" [ Obama is ] a transformational figure , and I think he 's going to transform the way government acts as we move forward , " Mr Podesta said .
Last - minute concerns Potential plans for a last - minute rush of executive decisions by the White House were also being watched carefully , Mr Podesta said .
" You see the Bush administration even today moving aggressively to do things I think are not in the interest of the country , " he added .
The current administration has proposed a number of regulation changes they hope can be approved before Mr Obama 's team moves into the White House .
Critics say many of the proposals would weaken environmental and consumer protection as well as reduce controls on drilling and mining companies .
Bush White House officials deny the plans are being rushed through , while critics suggest the proposals could be difficult for Mr Obama 's administration to undo , calling them an " assault on the public " .
The co-chair of Mr Obama 's transition team , Valerie Jarrett , said the new president was aiming to assemble a diverse , bipartisan cabinet .
" I 'm confident his administration will include people from all perspectives , " she said .
Mr Bush 's chief of staff , Josh Bolten , has pledged a smooth transition .
" If a crisis hits on January 21 , they 're the ones who are going to have to deal with it .
We need to make sure that they 're as well prepared as possible , " Mr Bolten said .

State Senator Tom McClintock , who is “ locked in a tight race for Congress ” with Democrat Charlie Brown , made his positions clear on two separate ballot measures yesterday , the L.A .
Times reports :
Said McClintock on Prop 8 :
“ Lincoln asked , ‘ If you call a tail a leg , how many legs has a dog ?
The answer is four .
Calling a tail a leg does n’t make it one .
And calling a homosexual partnership a marriage does n’t make it one . ”
And on Prop 2 , which prohibits confining hens , pigs and calves in small cages that prevent extension of their limbs , he said :
“ Sorry , but farm animals are food , not friends .
Plan on somewhat happier cows and much higher grocery bills if this one passes . ”

Multiple ROM Versions :
The Actual Anti-Piracy Measures :
A subroutine at address $ C0A11C is the first line of defense against pirates , being called upon startup .
It first checks to make sure that there 's only 8 kilobytes of SRAM , the part of memory used to hold saved games .
Cartridge copiers have more , so if it detects that , the game displays a screen that says , " It is a serious crime to copy video games . "
Both games also check which kind of PPU the SNES has - if it 's a PAL type ( used mainly by European game systems ) , they display the following screen :
Movement Script 1 calls a subroutine at $ C1FFD3 , which takes a checksum of the code at $ C0A11C - $ C0A150 .
If anything in that memory range has been altered , a non-zero value is stored to $ 7EB539 , and the script will then bring up a copyright infringement screen .
This screen differs between MOTHER 2 and EarthBound .
At $ C0281A there 's a check to see if $ 7EB539 is zero .
If it is n't , random enemies appear MUCH more often .
This was probably an attempt to make the game unenjoyable .
Here are screenshots of just how many enemies will show up :
At $ C08391 is another SRAM checker .
We 're not sure when it 's called , or what the game does if it detects more than 8 kilobytes .
It 's called from six different places though , so it probably happens at various events throughout the game , much like how the piracy checks on EarthBound Zero worked .
At $ C3FDC5 is another checksum routine that goes through $ C0A11C - $ C0A150 .
This one is called after Pokey turns off the Devil 's Machine .
If any data in that range has been changed , the checksum fails , the game deletes all your saved games ( seriously ) and then it crashes / freezes up .
Neat .
You can see it in action here :
This is so cool !
I wanna try it out !

CAUTION !
Most game companies these days put checks in their games to thwart -- or at least curb -- software pirates from illegally distributing and selling their work .
This includes the MOTHER 2 and EarthBound games .
Here is a brief look at the measures the programmers took to prevent piracy of these games and how we came to figure them out .
It 's common for game companies to release slightly different versions of games without telling anyone .
These different versions often fix rare bugs and glitches , and because of this , different versions of game ROMs are n't uncommon .
There appeared to be at least two different versions of the EarthBound ROM , but nobody really knewthey were different , until early 2007 .
It was discovered that one version actually had its anti-piracy measures crippled , meaning that version was looked at by pirates and hacked to keep the game from realizing it was pirated .
The other version appeared to be a clean dump of an EarthBound cart .
There may be other versions of clean EarthBound ROMs , but so far we do n't have any details on that possibility .
Forum user Goplat looked at the differences between the two ROMs , and found that the files differed by only a few bytes here and there .
These spots were where the anti-piracy code was .
So , by looking at the clean ROM , he could see what those snippets of code did :
If you want to try this stuff out yourself , use the following code in the cheat section of your favorite emulator :
Or if you have a Game Genie , the code is :
If you decide to try out these codes , make a backup of your .srm file !
That 's the file that has your save games !
CBC journalist Mellissa Fung speaks on the phone at the Kabul office of an official with the National Directorate of Security , Afghanistan 's intelligence agency , on Saturday .
( ( Afghan National Directorate of Security / Associated Press ) )
Prime Minister Stephen Harper has denied that prisoners were exchanged in order to secure the release of abducted CBC journalist Mellissa Fung , who was held captive for a month by a criminal gang in Afghanistan .
" There has been no release or exchange of political prisoners , " Harper told a news conference in Ottawa on Monday .
" This matter is being handled according to the laws of the government of Canada and the government of Afghanistan , and that 's all I 'll say in that regard . "
Harper also repeated earlier assertions that " continued reports " of a ransom payment to her captors were untrue .
Chief of defence staff Gen. Walter Natynczyk , speaking to the Empire Club in Toronto on Monday , was similarly cryptic .
" This is a testament to the good co-operation between the Afghan government authorities and the government of Canada , who have worked together as a team in this regard , " said Natynczyk .
He went on to say her release was " a very positive outcome , but I can't say much more about that . "
Harper and Natynczyk 's comments come after a Pakistani news agency reported that Fung was released in exchange for two prisoners connected to the gang responsible for kidnapping her in Afghanistan .
No deal in Fung case : Canadian ambassador
Earlier Monday , the Canadian government denied a separate report that two senior Taliban leaders facing charges of terrorism were freed to ensure Fung 's safety .
Canadian ambassador to Afghanistan Ron Hoffmann said Monday that the Canadian government did not cut a deal involving any transfer of Taliban prisoners .
The Canadian Press quoted Hoffmann as saying it was possible that the kidnappers made such a demand , however , since it would n't have been out of line for a high - profile Western hostage .
According to the Afghan Islamic Press — a news agency on the Pakistan / Afghanistan border — the criminal gang holding Fung had wanted the release of at least five people affiliated with it .
They were being held at a prison in Wardak province , about 50 kilometres southwest of Kabul , where Fung was confined by her captors .
" Apparently the gang got two prisoners , but not the five it was looking for , " said CBC reporter Bill Gillespie , who spoke with the news agency .
" Western journalists look to this agency because they have very good sources within the Afghan militias , the Taliban , and often the things they say are correct , " Gillespie added .
" The agency also says the Taliban were not involved .
This was strictly a criminal gang . "
However , the Pakistan Observer reported that the prisoners released in exchange for Fung were members of the Taliban resistance .
CBC News publisher John Cruickshank has said the broadcaster will not comment on any negotiations or demands that may have led to Fung 's release .
But Prime Minister Stephen Harper , Cruickshank and Afghan intelligence agents have all said that no monetary ransom was paid for Fung 's release .
Harper also said all Canadian and Afghanistan laws were followed to secure her release .
Fung was freed over the weekend during a raid by Afghan intelligence officers , the same day a call was received threatening to kill the kidnapped CBC journalist .
Underground chamber
Fung was captured and kept in an underground chamber southwest of Kabul for 28 days .
Weeks into her capture , the search for Fung had closed in on a house in a village on Wardak province .
Gillespie said the area is a hotbed of lawlessness populated by groups including the Taliban , a group like the Taliban , warlords and criminal gangs .
On Saturday morning , a Kandahar journalist known to CBC got a threatening call , which he recorded .
The caller said : " We have the girl .
Tell them we want the money today or we 'll kill her . "
The caller then alluded to people in custody of Afghan authorities , saying , " If they hurt them , we will kill her . "
That message was quickly relayed to officials in Kabul .
It is unclear what happened in the next hours , but by that evening , Fung had been freed by Afghan intelligence officers .
" Around 8:30 p.m. local , we successfully raided a house … and rescued Ms. Fung … in very good health condition , " said an Afghan official at a press conference .
Gillespie said Afghan authorities discouraged any Canadian plans to send in special forces to try to release Fung , saying they were making progress .
Sense of shame
Gillespie said that the governor of the province credited the elders of Wardak province for being instrumental in securing her release because they felt a deep sense of shame that the kidnappers had chosen a woman as their victim .
" They said that this was against Islam , it was a shame on the country and it was a shame on them , " Gillespie said .
Fung , 35 , had been taken by armed men who approached her in a refugee camp on the outskirts of Kabul on Oct. 12 .
Afghan officials said they have arrested three people , described as secondary suspects .
One of the key men involved may have fled Afghanistan .
Fung , who was raised in Vancouver , but recently stationed in Regina , said her captors stayed with her for the first three weeks but in the last week , she was left on her own with her hands and feet chained .
She said her captors never hurt her but that she was kept blindfolded .
I 'm not a big fan of reaching for conclusions and unjustified criticism when it comes to tech journalism , because I see it way too often .
But although I have no solid data to confirm it , I can't help the feeling that Steve Ballmer 's announcement of a new OS from Microsoft and its foray into cloud computing , temporarily dubbed " Windows Cloud , " seems rather strange .
At a Software plus Services partner event in London Ballmer said the following “ We need a new operating system designed for the cloud and we will introduce one in about four weeks , we ’ll even have a name to give you by then .
But let ’s just call it for the purposes of today ‘ Windows Cloud . ”
Essentially , it should be a bunch of services and products from Microsoft available in your browser in a simplified form .
“ We ’re not driving an agenda towards being service providers but we ’ve gotta build a service that is Windows in the cloud , ” Ballmer added .
First of all , this sounds like a big deal , and Ballmer is just casually saying they 'll have it out in a couple of weeks ?
Not Microsoft 's style .
For example , they announced their Live Mesh initiative ( which is , btw , in many ways related to the concept of cloud computing ) 5 months ago , and there 's still not a word about a public or even a closed beta , let alone a finished product .
( * correction : to clarify things further , a technical preview of Live Mesh is accessible to the general public .
It is very far from a finished product .
Furthermore , only users from a select few countries ( I 'm not in one of them ) can get in without a wait list .
More here . )
Microsoft is big and slow , they announce stuff like this months before it 's ready ; so my guesstimate is that Ballmer 's four weeks will turn into months really soon .
This is reiterated by the fact that they do n't even yet have a name for the product .
It 's due out in a month , but it has no name ?
Again , it 's simply not Microsoft 's style , especially when it comes to an ambitious product like this ; one that may very well prove if Microsoft is capable of competing with Google or not .
In a nutshell , it seems to me that Ballmer was simply reckless , talking about something that 's most probably set in the distant future as it were an almost finished product coming to our browsers in a week or three .
I expect it to go through long stages of alpha and beta testing before it 's actually useful to the end user .
Perhaps that 's what Ballmer meant when he said it 'll be out in a couple of weeks , but giving Google enough time to prepare countermeasures ( if needed ) is probably not the best course of action for Microsoft .
In any case , we should hear more about it at the end of October at the Professional Developers Conference in Los Angeles .
Ballmer pulled out another interesting observation at the event .
According to him , Google is directly competing with Windows and they are building a browser - based OS .
“ If you talk to Google they ’ll say it 's thin client computing but then they ’ll issue a new browser that ’s basically a big fat operating system designed to compete with Windows but running on top of it , ” he said .
Whoa , Steve , are you sure about this ?
Because , from what I 've heard , most developers think of the idea as preposterous .
Paul Broun Compares Barack Obama to Hitler
President - elect Obama made some comments that recently showed up on youtube about creating a civilian national security force that has drawn the ire of people who are wondering what the hell he is talking about .
This is more than a neighborhood watch program as he states it should be as equally funded as the military .
Paul Broun , a congressman from Georgia had this to say about Barack Obama ’s plan :
“ It may sound a bit crazy and off base , but the thing is , he ’s the one who proposed this national security force , ” Rep. Paul Broun said of Obama in an interview Monday with The Associated Press .
“ I ’m just trying to bring attention to the fact that we may — may not , I hope not — but we may have a problem with that type of philosophy of radical socialism or Marxism . ”
And he did n’t stop there :
“ That ’s exactly what Hitler did in Nazi Germany and it ’s exactly what the Soviet Union did , ” Broun said .
“ When he ’s proposing to have a national security force that ’s answering to him , that is as strong as the U.S. military , he ’s showing me signs of being Marxist . ”
He then says that he is not actually comparing Barack Obama to Hitler , but warns that we had better watch our backs :
“ We ca n’t be lulled into complacency , ” Broun said .
“ You have to remember that Adolf Hitler was elected in a democratic Germany .
I ’m not comparing him to Adolf Hitler .
What I ’m saying is there is the potential . ”
Yes you are comparing him to Hitler .
I have called the soon to be president a Marxist , socialist , totalitarian , un-American , anti-semite , and many , many other names .
But I would never compare him to Hitler .
Stalin maybe , but not Hitler .
How dare you campare a United States president to Hitler , you should be ashamed of yourself , uh wait a minute … …
Just when I thought that I might be willing to defend Obama on this I remembered this :
And I started to ask myself why should I condemn Broun and defend Obama when this is the type of defamation that President Bush was subjected to ?
How many of the people who believe that Bush =Hitler are now outraged by the congressman ’s remarks ?
I would guess that most of them are .
How many Bush haters who have called Bush the world ’s leading terrorist will now have the audacity ( of hope ) to complain about this ?
I will not defend Obama from this attack , but I also will not defend Broun either , however because of the treatment that Bush has recieved over the last eight years , neither will I condemn Broun .
If it was fair to compare Bush to Hitler than it must be okay to compare Obama to Hitler .
Fair is fair .
I keep hearing on the television that it is time to get behind Barack Obama , that it is time to unite , yet these pictures above show how the current president was treated .
There was no call for unity then , was there ?
I am having trouble with the notion that we are supposed to unite behind this new president when the same people that tell us to unite are the ones who tried to divide us over the years .
Why should I listen to the people who created such offensive pictures of the president now that their guy is in office ?
The left had no thought of unification when they were in the minority , they spent eight years trying to destroy President Bush and the Republicans but now that they are in the majority we Republicans are just supposed to acquiesce to their every whim ?
I am sorry but I am just having trouble trying to justify why I should get behind the same people who created such horrific images of President Bush .
I ca n’t bring myself to so it .
Quarter of Atlantic sharks and rays face extinction because of overfishing , say scientists
More than a quarter of shark and ray species found in the north east Atlantic are threatened with extinction , conservationists have warned .
An assessment of the region 's sharks , rays and chimaeras by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) found seven per cent of species were critically endangered , while another seven per cent were endangered .
Most at risk include the porbeagle shark , the common skate , deepwater sharks and spiny dogfish .
Most at risk :
The porbeagle shark is one of the species found in the north east Atlantic that is threatened with extinction
The IUCN said shark species , which are largely under pressure from overfishing , were much more threatened in the north east Atlantic than globally .
Some 26 per cent of species are threatened in the region , compared to 18 per cent globally , the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species assessment found .
And the figure could be even higher , as there was insufficient data to assess more than a quarter of the region 's sharks , rays and chimaeras .
Endangered :
The beautiful angel shark is also fighting for its survival
Claudine Gibson , lead author of the report for the IUCN 's shark specialist group , said :
' From angel sharks to devil rays , north east Atlantic populations of these vulnerable species are in serious trouble , more so than in many other parts of the world .
' Most sharks and rays are exceptionally vulnerable to overfishing because of their tendency to grow slowly , mature late and produce few young .
' Those at greatest risk in the north east Atlantic include heavily fished large sharks and rays , like porbeagle and common skate , as well as commercially valuable deepwater sharks and spiny dogfish . '
The scientists from the IUCN shark specialist group said over - exploitation - either fishing for the sharks deliberately or catching them accidentally while fishing for other species - was the biggest cause of decline in the north east Atlantic .
The conservation group , along with wildlife organisation Shark Alliance , called for European countries to take steps to protect the threatened species .
Currently the UK and Sweden are the only countries in the region to provide full national protection for certain shark and ray species , the IUCN said .
Dying out :
The common skate is another species in serious trouble
The European Union sets specific fishing limits for only four of the region 's 116 shark , ray and chimaera species .
While basking sharks and great white sharks are legally protected in the EU , fishing limits for spiny dogfish and porbeagles are regularly set in excess of scientific advice .
So too are broad EU limits across species of skates , rays and deepwater sharks , the conservationists said .
The upcoming setting of annual quotas , an EC action plan on sharks and meetings of international fisheries and wildlife bodies provide numerous opportunities to improve the situation , the IUCN and Shark Alliance said .
Sonja Fordham , policy director for the Shark Alliance , said : ' Country officials should heed the dire warnings of this report and act to protect threatened sharks and rays at national , regional and international levels .
' Such action is immediately possible and absolutely necessary to change the current course toward extinction of these remarkable ocean animals . '
Earlier this year the IUCN warned more than half the world 's wide - ranging ocean sharks were threatened with extinction - also the result of overfishing .
The Shark Alliance welcomed proposals published on Monday by the European Commission to stop fishing of six threatened north east Atlantic shark and ray species in 2009 .
The Commission proposed setting the total allowable catch for spiny dogfish and porbeagle sharks at zero , prohibiting fishermen from keeping angel sharks , common skates , undulate rays or white skates , and improving management of skate and ray fisheries .
Ms Fordham said : ' We are impressed with the Commission 's strong stance and unprecedented adherence to the scientific advice with respect to fishing limits for several of Europe 's most endangered sharks and rays .
' These proposals demonstrate the most solid step to date toward a new , more responsible era in the management of European shark fisheries . '

The transition from capitalism to socialism is the most difficult problem of socialist theory and practice .
To add to this the question of ecology might therefore be seen as unnecessarily complicating an already intractable issue .
I shall argue here , however , that the human relation to nature lies at the heart of the transition to socialism .
An ecological perspective is pivotal to our understanding of capitalism ’s limits , the failures of the early socialist experiments , and the overall struggle for egalitarian and sustainable human development .
My argument has three parts .
First , it is crucial to understand the intimate connection between classical Marxism and ecological analysis .
Far from being an anomaly for socialism , as we are often led to believe , ecology was an essential component of the socialist project from its inception — notwithstanding the numerous later shortcomings of Soviet - type societies in this respect .
Second , the global ecological crisis that now confronts us is deeply rooted in the “ world - alienating ” logic of capital accumulation , traceable to the historical origins of capitalism as a system .
Third , the transition from capitalism to socialism is a struggle for sustainable human development in which societies on the periphery of the capitalist world system have been leading the way .
Classical Marxism and ecology
Research carried out over the last two decades has demonstrated that there was a powerful ecological perspective in classical Marxism .
Just as a transformation of the human relation to the earth was , in Marx ’s view , an essential presupposition for the transition from feudalism to capitalism , so the rational regulation of the metabolic relation to nature was understood as an essential presupposition for the transition from capitalism to socialism .
[ 1 ]
Marx and Engels wrote extensively about ecological problems arising from capitalism and class society in general , and the need to transcend these under socialism .
This included discussions of the nineteenth - century soil crisis , which led Marx to develop his theory of metabolic rift between nature and society .
Basing his analysis on the work of the German chemist Justus von Liebig , he pointed to the fact that soil nutrients ( nitrogen , phosphorus and potassium ) were removed from the soil and shipped hundreds and thousands of miles to the cities where they ended up polluting the water and the air and contributing to the poor health of the workers .
This break in the necessary metabolic cycle between nature and society demanded for Marx nothing less than the “ restoration ” of ecological sustainability for the sake of “ successive generations ” . [ 2 ]
In line with this , Marx and Engels raised the main ecological problems of human society : the division of town and country , soil depletion , industrial pollution , urban maldevelopment , the decline in health and crippling of workers , bad nutrition , toxicity , enclosures , rural poverty and isolation , deforestation , human - generated floods , desertification , water shortages , regional climate change , the exhaustion of natural resources ( including coal ) , conservation of energy , entropy , the need to recycle the waste products of industry , the interconnection between species and their environments , historically conditioned problems of overpopulation , the causes of famine , and the issue of the rational employment of science and technology .
This ecological understanding arose from a deep materialist conception of nature that was an essential part of Marx ’s underlying vision .
“ Man ” , he wrote , “ lives from nature , i.e. nature is his body , and he must maintain a continuing dialogue with it if he is not to die .
To say that man ’s physical and mental life is linked to nature simply means that nature is linked to itself , for man is a part of nature ” .
[ 3 ]
Not only did Marx declare in direct opposition to capitalism that no individual owned the earth , he also argued that no nation or people owned the earth ; that it belonged to successive generations and should be cared for in accordance with the principle of good household management . [ 4 ]
Other early Marxists followed suit , although not always consistently , in incorporating ecological concerns into their analyses and embodying a general materialist and dialectical conception of nature .
William Morris , August Bebel , Karl Kautsky , Rosa Luxemburg and Nikolai Bukharin all drew on ecological insights from Marx .
The Ukrainian socialist Sergei Podolinsky ’s early attempt at developing an ecological economics was inspired to a considerable extent by the work of Marx and Engels .
Lenin stressed the importance of recycling soil nutrients and supported both conservation and pioneering experiments in community ecology ( the study of the interaction of populations within a specific natural environment ) .
This led to the development in the Soviet Union in the 1920s and early 1930s of probably the most advanced conception of ecological energetics or trophic dynamics ( the basis of modern ecosystem analysis ) in the world at the time .
The same revolutionary - scientific climate produced V. I. Vernadsky ’s theory of the biosphere , A. I. Oparin ’s theory of the origin of life and N. I. Vavilov ’s discovery of the world centres of germplasm ( the genetic sources of the world ’s crop plants ) .
In the West , and in Britain in particular , leading scientists influenced by Marxism in the 1930s , such as J. B. S. Haldane , J. D. Bernal , Hyman Levy , Lancelot Hogben and Joseph Needham , pioneered in exploring the dialectics of nature .
It is even possible to argue that ecological science had its genesis almost entirely in the work of thinkers on the left ( socialist , social democratic and anarchist ) . [ 5 ]
Obviously not all major figures or all developments in the socialist tradition can be seen as ecological .
Soviet Marxism succumbed to an extreme version of the productivism that characterised early twentieth - century modernity in general , leading to its own version of ecocide .
With the rise of the Stalinist system the pioneering ecological developments in the Soviet Union were largely crushed ( and some of the early ecologically oriented Marxists such as Bukharin and Vavilov were killed ) .
Simultaneously , a deep antipathy to natural science emerging out of an extreme negation of positivism led to the abandonment of attempts to theorise the dialectics of nature in Western Marxism , seriously weakening its link to ecology — though the question of the domination of nature was raised by the Frankfurt School as part of its critique of science .
If today socialism and ecology are once again understood as dialectically interconnected , it is due both to the evolution of the ecological contradictions of capitalism and the development of socialism ’s own self - critique .
Capitalism ’s world alienation
The key to understanding capitalism ’s relation to the environment is to examine its historical beginnings , i.e. , the transition from feudalism to capitalism .
This transition was enormously complex , occurring over centuries , and obviously cannot be fully addressed here .
I shall focus on just a few factors .
The bourgeoisie arose within the interstices of the feudal economy .
As its name suggests , the bourgeoisie had its point of origin as a class primarily in the urban centres and mercantile trade .
What was necessary , however , in order for bourgeois society to emerge fully as a system , was the revolutionary transformation of the feudal mode of production and its replacement by capitalist relations of production .
Since feudalism was predominantly an agrarian system , this meant of course transformation of agrarian relations , i.e. , the relation of workers to the land as a means of production .
Capitalism therefore required for its development a new relation to nature , one which severed the direct connection of labour to the means of production , i.e. , the earth , along with the dissolution of all customary rights in relation to the commons .
The locus classicus of the industrial revolution was Britain , where the removal of the workers from the land by means of expropriation took the form of the enclosure movement from the fifteenth to the eighteenth centuries .
Under colonialism and imperialism an even more brutal transformation occurred on the outskirts or the external areas of the capitalist world economy .
There all preexisting human productive relations to nature were torn asunder in what Marx called the “ extirpation , enslavement and entombment in mines of the indigenous population ” — the most violent expropriation in all of human history . [ 6 ]
The result was proletarianisation within the centre of the system as masses of workers were thrown out of work and moved to the city .
There they were met by the capital being amassed through organised robbery , giving rise to what Marx called “ modern industry ” .
Simultaneously , various forms of servitude and what we now call precarious work were imposed on the periphery , where social reproduction was always secondary to the most rapacious imperialist exploitation .
The surplus forcibly extracted from the periphery fed industrialisation at the centre of the world economy . [ 7 ]
What made this new system work was the incessant accumulation of capital in one cycle after another , with each new phase of accumulation taking the last as its starting point .
This meant ever more divided , more alienated human beings , together with a more globally destructive metabolism between humanity and nature .
As Joseph Needham observed , the “ conquest of Nature ” under capitalism turned into “ the conquest of man ” ; the “ technological instruments utilised in the dominance of Nature ” produced “ a qualitative transformation in the mechanisms of social domination ” . [ 8 ]
There is no doubt that this dialectic of domination and destruction is now spiraling out of control on a planetary scale .
Economically , overall inequality between the centre and periphery nations of the world system is increasing together with the intensification of class inequality within each capitalist state .
Ecologically , the world ’s climate and the life - support systems of the entire earth are being transformed by a process of runaway global warming . [ 9 ]
In addressing this planetary environmental problem it is useful to turn to Hannah Arendt ’s concept of “ world alienation ” , introduced fifty years ago in The Human Condition .
“ World alienation ” for Arendt began with the “ alienation from the earth ” at the time of Columbus , Galileo , and Luther .
Galileo trained his telescope on the heavens , thereby converting human beings into creatures of the cosmos , no longer simply earthly beings .
Science seised on cosmic principles in order to obtain the “ Archimedean point ” with which to move the world , but at the cost of immeasurable world alienation .
Human beings no longer apprehended the world immediately through the direct evidence of their five senses .
The original unity of the human relation to the world exemplified by the Greek polis was lost .
Arendt noted that Marx was acutely aware of this world alienation from his earliest writings , pointing out that the world was “ denatured ” as all natural objects — the wood of the wood - user and the wood - seller — were converted into private property and the universal commodity form .
Original or primitive accumulation , the alienation of human beings from the land , as Marx described it , became a crucial manifestation of world alienation .
However , Marx , in Arendt ’s view , chose to stress human self - alienation rooted in labour rather than world alienation .
In contrast , “ world alienation , and not [ primarily ] self - alienation as Marx thought ” , she concluded , “ has been the hallmark of the modern age ” .
“ The process of wealth accumulation , as we know it ” , Arendt went on to observe , depended on expanding world alienation .
It “ is possible only if the world and the very worldliness of man are sacrificed ” .
This process of the accumulation of wealth in the modern age “ enormously increased human power of destruction ” so “ that we are able to destroy all organic life on earth and shall probably be able one day to destroy even the earth itself ” .
Indeed , “ Under modern conditions ” , she explained , “ not destruction but conservation spells ruin because the very durability of conserved objects is the greatest impediment to the turnover process , whose constant gain in speed is the only constancy left wherever it has taken hold ” . [ 10 ]
Arendt had no final answers to the dire problem she raised .
Despite tying world alienation to a system of destruction rooted in wealth accumulation , she identified it with the development of science , technology , and modernity rather than capitalism as such .
World alienation in her view was the triumph of homo faber and animal labourans .
In this tragic conception , her readers were called upon to look back to the lost unity of the Greek polis , rather than , as in Marx , toward a new society based on the restoration at a higher level of the human metabolism with nature .
In the end world alienation for Arendt was a Greek tragedy raised to the level of the planet .
There is no doubt that the concrete manifestations of this world alienation are evident everywhere today .
The latest scientific data indicate that global emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels experienced a “ sharp acceleration ... in the early 2000s ” with the growth rate reaching levels “ greater than for the most fossil - fuel intensive of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emissions scenarios developed in the late 1990s ” .
Further , “ the mean global atmospheric CO2 concentration ” has been increasing “ at a progressively faster rate each decade ” .
The most rapid acceleration in emissions has been in a handful of emergent industrialising countries such as China , but “ no region ” in the world is currently “ decarbonising its energy supply ” .
All ecosystems on earth are in decline , water shortages are on the rise , and energy resources are becoming more than ever the subject of global monopolies enforced by war .
The “ man- made fingerprint of global warming ” has been detected “ on 10 different aspects of Earth ’s environment : surface temperatures , humidity , water vapor over the oceans , barometric pressure , total precipitation , wildfires , change in species of plants and animals , water run-off , temperatures in the upper atmosphere , and heat content in the world ’s oceans ” .
The cost now descending on the world if it does n’t radically change course is a regression of civilisation and life itself beyond comprehension : an economy and ecology of destruction that will finally reach its limits .

Socialism and sustainable human development
How are we to meet this challenge , arguably the greatest that human civilisation has ever faced ?
A genuine answer to the ecological question , transcending Arendt ’s tragic understanding of world alienation , requires a revolutionary conception of sustainable human development — one that addresses both human self - estrangement ( the alienation of labour ) and world alienation ( the alienation of nature ) .
It was Ernesto “ Che ” Guevara who most famously argued in his “ Man and Socialism in Cuba ” that the crucial issue in the building of socialism was not economic development but human development .
This needs to be extended by recognising , in line with Marx , that the real question is one of sustainable human development , explicitly addressing the human metabolism with nature through human labour . [ 12 ]
Too often the transition to socialism has been approached mechanistically as the mere expansion of the means of production , rather than in terms of the development of human social relations and needs .
In the system that emerged in the Soviet Union the indispensable tool of planning was misdirected to production for production ’s sake , losing sight of genuine human needs , and eventually gave rise to a new class structure .
The detailed division of labour , introduced by capitalism , was retained under this system and extended in the interest of higher productivity .
In this type of society , as Che critically observed , “ the period of the building of socialism ... is characterised by the extinction of the individual for the sake of the state ” . [ 13 ]
The revolutionary character of Latin American socialism today derives its strength from an acute recognition of the negative ( as well as some positive ) lessons of the Soviet experience , partly through an understanding of the problem raised by Che : the need to develop socialist humanity .
Further , the Bolivarian vision proclaimed by Hugo Chávez has its own deep roots of inspiration drawing on an older pre-Marxian socialism .
Thus it was Simon Bolívar ’s teacher Simón Rodríguez who wrote in 1847 : “ The division of labour in the production of goods only serves to brutalise the workforce .
If to produce cheap and excellent nail scissors , we have to reduce the workers to machines , we would do better to cut our finger nails with our teeth . ”
Indeed , what we most admire today with regard to Bolívar ’s own principles is his uncompromising insistence that equality is “ the law of laws ” . [ 14 ]
The same commitment to the egalitarian , universal development of humanity was fundamental to Marx .
The evolution of the society of associated producers was to be synonymous with the positive transcendence of human alienation .
The goal was a many - sided human development .
Just as “ all history is nothing but a continuous transformation of human nature ” , so “ the cultivation of the five senses is the work of all previous history ” .
Socialism thus appears as the “ complete emancipation of the senses ” , of human sensuous capacities and their wide - ranging development .
“ Communism , as fully developed naturalism ” , Marx wrote , “ equals humanism , and as fully developed humanism equals naturalism ” . [ 15 ]
The contrast between this revolutionary , humanistic - naturalistic vision and today ’s dominant mechanical - exploitative reality could not be starker .
We find ourselves in a period of imperialist development that is potentially the most dangerous in all of history . [ 16 ]
There are two ways in which life on the planet as we know it can be destroyed — either instantaneously through global nuclear holocaust , or in a matter of a few generations by climate change and other manifestations of environmental destruction .
Nuclear weapons continue to proliferate in an atmosphere of global insecurity promoted by the world ’s greatest power .
War is currently being waged in the Middle East over geopolitical control of the world ’s oil at the same time that carbon emissions from fossil fuels and other forms of industrial production are generating global warming .
Biofuels offered up today as a major alternative to pending world oil shortages are destined only to enlarge world hunger . [ 17 ]
Water resources are being monopolised by global corporations .
Human needs are everywhere being denied : either in the form of extreme deprivation for a majority of the population of the world , or , in the richer countries , in the form of the most intensive self - estrangement conceivable , extending beyond production to a managed consumption , enforcing life - long dependence on alienating wage labour .
More and more life is debased in a welter of artificial wants dissociated from genuine needs .
All of this is altering the ways in which we think about the transition from capitalism to socialism .
Socialism has always been understood as a society aimed at reversing the relations of exploitation of capitalism and removing the manifold social evils to which these relations have given rise .
This requires the abolition of private property in the means of production , a high degree of equality in all things , replacement of the blind forces of the market by planning by the associated producers in accordance with genuine social needs , and the elimination to whatever extent possible of invidious distinctions associated with the division of town and country , mental and manual labour , race divisions , gender divisions , etc .
Yet , the root problem of socialism goes much deeper .
The transition to socialism is possible only through a revolutionising practice that revolutionises human beings themselves . [ 18 ]
The only way to accomplish this is by altering our human metabolism with nature , along with our human - social relations , transcending both the alienation of nature and of humanity .
Marx , like Hegel , was fond of quoting Terence ’s famous statement “ Nothing human is alien to me ” .
Now it is clear that we must deepen and extend this to : Nothing of this earth is alien to me . [ 19 ]
Mainstream environmentalists seek to solve ecological problems almost exclusively through three mechanical strategies : ( 1 ) technological bullets , ( 2 ) extending the market to all aspects of nature , and ( 3 ) creating what are intended as mere islands of preservation in a world of almost universal exploitation and destruction of natural habitats .
In contrast , a minority of critical human ecologists have come to understand the need to change our fundamental social relations .
Some of the best , most concerned ecologists , searching for concrete models of change , have thus come to focus on those states ( or regions ) that are both ecological and socialistic ( in the sense of relying to a considerable extent on social planning rather than market forces ) in orientation .
Thus Cuba , Curitiba and Porto Alegre in Brazil , and Kerala in India , are singled out as the leading lights of ecological transformation by some of the most committed environmentalists , such as Bill McKibben , best known as the author of The End of Nature . [ 20 ]
More recently Venezuela has been using its surplus from oil to transform its society in the direction of sustainable human development , thereby laying the foundation for a greening of its production .
Although there are contradictions to what has been called Venezuelan “ petro socialism ” , the fact that an oil - generated surplus is being dedicated to genuine social transformation rather than feeding into the proverbial “ curse of oil ” makes Venezuela unique . [ 21 ]
Of course there are powerful environmental movements within the centre of the system as well to which we might look for hope .
But severed from strong socialist movements and a revolutionary situation they have been constrained much more by a perceived need to adapt to the dominant accumulation system , thereby drastically undermining the ecological struggle .
Hence , revolutionary strategies and movements with regard to ecology and society are world - historical forces at present largely in the periphery , in the weak links and breakaways from the capitalist system .
I can only point to a few essential aspects of this radical process of ecological change as manifested in areas of the global South .
In Cuba the goal of human development that Che advanced is taking on a new form through what is widely regarded as “ the greening of Cuba ” .
This is evident in the emergence of the most revolutionary experiment in agroecology on earth , and the related changes in health , science , and education .
As McKibben states , “ Cubans have created what may be the world ’s largest working model of a semisustainable agriculture , one that relies far less than the rest of the world does on oil , on chemicals , on shipping vast quantities of food back and forth ...
Cuba has thousands of organopónicos — urban gardens — more than two hundred in the Havana area alone . ”
Indeed , according to the World Wildlife Fund ’s Living Planet Report , “ Cuba alone ” in the entire world has achieved a high level of human development , with a human development index greater than 0.8 , while also having a per capita ecological footprint below the world ’s average . [ 22 ]
This ecological transformation is deeply rooted in the Cuban revolution rather than , as frequently said , simply a forced response in the Special Period following the fall of the Soviet Union .
Already in the 1970s Carlos Rafael Rodriguez , one of the founders of Cuban ecology , had introduced arguments for “ integral development , laying the groundwork ” — as ecologist Richard Levins points out — for “ harmonious development of the economy and social relations with nature ” .
This was followed by the gradual flowering of ecological thought in Cuba in the 1980s .
The Special Period , Levins explains , simply allowed the “ ecologists by conviction ” who had emerged through the internal development of Cuban science and society to recruit the “ ecologists by necessity ” , turning many of them too into ecologists by conviction . [ 23 ]
Venezuela under Chávez has not only advanced revolutionary new social relations with the growth of Bolivarian circles , community councils , and increased worker control of factories , but has introduced some crucial initiatives with regard to what István Mészáros has called a new “ socialist time accountancy ” in the production and exchange of goods .
In the new Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas ( ALBA ) , the emphasis is on communal exchange , the exchange of activities rather than exchange values . [ 24 ]
Instead of allowing the market to establish the priorities of the entire economy , planning is being introduced to redistribute resources and capacities to those most in need and to the majority of the populace .
The goal here is to address the most pressing individual and collective requirements of the society related in particular to physiological needs and hence raising directly the question of the human relation to nature .
This is the absolute precondition of the creation of a sustainable society .
In the countryside preliminary attempts have also been made to green Venezuelan agriculture . [ 25 ]
In Bolivia the rise of a socialist current ( though embattled at present ) embedded in the needs of indigenous peoples and the control of basic resources such as water and hydrocarbons offers hope of another kind of development .
The cities of Curitiba and Porto Alegre in Brazil point to the possibility of more radical forms of management of urban space and transportation .
Curitiba , in McKibbens ’s words , “ is as much an example for the sprawling , decaying cities of the first world as for the crowded , booming cities of the Third World ” .
Kerala in India has taught us that a poor state or region , if animated by genuine socialist planning , can go a long way toward unleashing human potentials in education , health care , and basic environmental conditions .
In Kerala , McKibben observes , “ the Left has embarked on a series of ‘ new democratic initiatives ’ that come as close as anything on the planet to actually incarnating ‘ sustainable development . ’ ” [ 26 ]
To be sure , these are mainly islands of hope at present .
They constitute fragile new experiments in social relations and in the human metabolism with nature .
They are still subject to the class and imperial war imposed from above by the larger system .
The planet as a whole remains firmly in the grip of capital and its world alienation .
Everywhere we see manifestations of a metabolic rift , now extended to the biospheric level .
It follows that there is little real prospect for the needed global ecological revolution unless these attempts to revolutionize social relations in the struggle for a just and sustainable society , now emerging in the periphery , are somehow mirrored in movements for ecological and social revolution in the advanced capitalist world .
It is only through fundamental change at the centre of the system , from which the pressure on the planet principally emanates , that there is any genuine possibility of avoiding ultimate ecological destruction .
For some this may seem to be an impossible goal .
Nevertheless , it is important to recognize that there is now an ecology as well as a political economy of revolutionary change .
The emergence in our time of sustainable human development in various revolutionary interstices within the global periphery could mark the beginning of a universal revolt against both world alienation and human self - estrangement .
Such a revolt if consistent could have only one objective : the creation of a society of associated producers rationally regulating their metabolic relation to nature , and doing so not only in accordance with their own needs but also those of future generations and life as a whole .
Today the transition to socialism and the transition to an ecological society are one .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin said Wednesday she does not regret her interview with Katie Couric of CBS and wishes she had been more available to the media during the campaign .
Gov. Sarah Palin says she will support President - elect Barack Obama and his new administration .
" I should have done it , yes .
And her questions were fair , " Palin told CNN 's Larry King Wednesday .
" Obviously being a bit annoyed with some of the questions , my annoyance shows through . "
Palin had some well - publicized fumbles during interviews with Couric in late September leading up to her vice presidential debate .
" Certainly I should have done the interview .
And to attribute I think that interview to any kind of negativity in the campaign or a downfall in the campaign , I think it 's ridiculous . "
Palin added she wished she talked more to the media .
" In retrospect , in hindsight , I wish I would had more opportunities or that we would have seized more opportunities to speak more , " Palin said .
In two interviews with CNN Wednesday , Palin reflected upon her unsuccessful bid for the White House and discussed President - elect Barack Obama 's incoming administration .
The Alaska governor said she would be honored to help out Obama and his new administration -- even though he did hang around with an " unrepentant domestic terrorist " -- if he asked her for assistance on issues she highlighted her campaign , such as energy or services for special - needs children .
" It would be my honor to assist and support our new president and the new administration , " said Palin , whom Sen.
John McCain chose as his running mate in August .
Watch CNN 's Wolf Blitzer interview Palin »
When asked about some of the tough rhetoric she hurled from the stump , she said she was " still concerned " about Obama 's ties to former Weather Underground member - turned - Chicago college professor William Ayers .
" If anybody still wants to talk about it , I will , " she said .

Palin was attending the annual Republican Governors Association convention in Miami , Florida .
She was also interviewed for CNN's " The Situation Room " -- the latest of several high - profile appearances for the ex-VP candidate .

There 's speculation that Palin , as well as other incumbent governors at the conference such as Charlie Crist of Florida , Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota , could all have designs on the Republican presidential nomination in the next race for the White House .
All three governors were on McCain 's list of possible running mates before he selected Palin .
As the 2012 buzz takes off , a new poll suggests that just less than half of all Americans have a favorable view of Palin .
Forty - nine percent of those questioned in a CNN / Opinion Research Corp. survey released Wednesday have a favorable opinion of Palin , with 43 percent viewing her unfavorably .

That is lower than a previous poll , suggesting that favorable opinions of Palin are dropping among Americans .
" In early September , just after the GOP convention , her favorable rating among registered voters was 57 percent , and only a quarter of all registered voters had an unfavorable view of her , " CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said .
" Palin is less popular than Vice President - elect Joe Biden , with a 64 percent favorable rating , or her boss on the GOP ticket during the just - completed campaign , John McCain , who is seen favorably by 61 percent of the public . "
The poll also suggests men have a slightly more positive view of Palin than women , with 51 percent of males viewing her favorably , 3 percentage points higher than female respondents .
Forty - one percent of males have an unfavorable opinion of Palin , compared with 45 percent of female survey respondents .

" With fairly high negatives and lower support among women , who should be a natural constituency for Palin , she 's not starting off from a position of strength , " Holland said .
" The question is no longer whether Palin was a drag on the McCain ticket but whether her unfavorables could be a drag on a future Palin ticket . "

Among Republicans , though , Palin 's rating remains high , with 86 percent of Republicans questioned in the poll holding a favorable opinion of her .
That number drops to 48 percent among independents and 27 percent among Democrats .
The CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted November 6 to 9 , with 1,246 adult Americans questioned by telephone .
The survey 's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points .

The finalists were chosen after a worldwide competition on the Internet in which more than 11,200 candidates posted their photographs on the Sloggi website .
These were then vetted by members of the public , with more than 31.8 million votes cast .
Internet " black boxes " will be used to collect every email and web visit in the UK under the Government 's plans for a giant " big brother " database , The Independent has learnt .
Home Office officials have told senior figures from the internet and telecommunications industries that the " black box " technology could automatically retain and store raw data from the web before transferring it to a giant central database controlled by the Government .
Plans to create a database holding information about every phone call , email and internet visit made in the UK have provoked a huge public outcry .
Richard Thomas , the Information Commissioner , described it as " step too far " and the Government 's own terrorism watchdog said that as a " raw idea " it was " awful " .

Nevertheless , ministers have said they are committed to consulting on the new Communications Data Bill early in the new year .
News that the Government is already preparing the ground by trying to allay the concerns of the internet industry is bound to raise suspicions about ministers ' true intentions .
Further details of the database emerged on Monday at a meeting of internet service providers ( ISPs ) in London where representatives from BT , AOL Europe , O2 and BSkyB were given a PowerPoint presentation of the issues and the technology surrounding the Government 's Interception Modernisation Programme ( IMP ) , the name given by the Home Office to the database proposal .
Whitehall experts working on the IMP unit told the meeting the security and intelligence agencies wanted to use the stored data to help fight serious crime and terrorism , and said the technology would allow them to create greater " capacity " to monitor all communication traffic on the internet .
The " black boxes " are an attractive option for the internet industry because they would be secure and not require any direct input from the ISPs .
During the meeting Whitehall officials also tried to reassure the industry by suggesting that many smaller ISPs would be unaffected by the " black boxes " as these would be installed upstream on the network and hinted that all costs would be met by the Government .
" It was clear the ' back box ' is the technology the Government will use to hold all the data .
But what is n't clear is what the Home Secretary , GCHQ and the security services intend to do with all this information in the future , " said a source close to the meeting .
He added : " They said they only wanted to return to a position they were in before the emergence of internet communication , when they were able to monitor all correspondence with a police suspect .
The difference here is they will be in a much better position to spy on many more people on the basis of their internet behaviour .
Also there 's a grey area between what is content and what is traffic .
Is what is said in a chat room content or just traffic ? "
Ministers say plans for the database have not been confirmed , and that it is not their intention to introduce monitoring or storage equipment that will check or hold the content of emails or phonecalls on the traffic .
A spokesman for the Home Office said that Monday 's meeting provided a " chance to engage with small communication service providers " ahead of the formal public consultation next year .
He added : " We need to work closely with the internet service providers and the communication service providers .
The meeting was to show the top - line challenges faced in the future .
We are public about the IMP , but we are still working out the detail .
There will a consultation on the Communications Data Bill early next year . "
A spokesman for the Internet Service Providers Association said the organisation was pleased the Home Office had addressed its members and was keen to continue dialogue while awaiting a formal consultation .
Database plans were first announced by the Prime Minister in February .
It is not clear where the records will be held but GCHQ may eventually be the project 's home .
R.I.P. , Morpheus :
File sharing client shuts down , world fails to notice
I ran into Mike Weiss the other day at Digital Hollywood , and asked him how things at Streamcast Networks were going .
Streamcast Networks has been the company behind the Morpheus file sharing client , and Weiss , Streamcast 's long - time CEO , has been an outspoken critic of the entertainment industry as well as lone fighter in an epic legal battle with the major record companies , which is why I was more than a little surprised when he told me that he shut down the company back in April .
Morpheus has been largely ignored by the P2P community in recent years because it was forced to install filters to prevent unauthorized file sharing after losing against the entertainment industry in front of the US Supreme Court .
However , Morpheus used to be at some point one of the if not the most popular file sharing client , so it 's only appropriate to do a quick recap of its oftentimes turbulent history : Morpheus started off as a Open Napster client back in 2000 , operating two dozen or so Open Napster servers under the name of the Musiccity network .
It switched to the Fasttrack network that was operated by Kazaa soon after , only to quickly become the most popular Fasttrack client , which also got the attention of the major record labels .
The labels filed a lawsuit against Morpheus , Kazaa and Grokster , which at that time all shared the same network , in October of 2001 .
Morpheus eventually had a fall - out with Kazaa in early 2002 when users of its client suddenly were unable to connect to the Fasttrack network .
The makers of Morpheus at the time stated that Kazaa tried to get rid of unwanted competition , but Kazaa maintained that Morpheus just did n't pay its licensing dues on time .
Morpheus switched to Gnutella soon after but lost a large amount of its users to Kazaa as result of the controversy .
Morpheus also implemented support for several other P2P networks , including Neonet , which was its own DHT network .
Streamcast obtained an important court victory against the entertainment industry in 2004 , but the case was appealed and went all the way to the Supreme Court , which sided with the major record labels in its now famous Grokster decision .
Grokster itself folded soon after , Kazaa eventually settled with the entertainment industry , but Morpheus fought on .
Morpheus suffered another loss in court about a year ago when a US District Court in Los Angeles put pressure on the company to install effective filters .
Part of the verdict was the appointment of a " Special Master " to " aid ( the ) decision of what constitutes the most ' effective ' filtering regiment " , as it was stated in the verdict .
Turns out , Special Masters do n't just have great job titles , they 're also really expensive .
Weiss told me that his company had to pay several hundred thousand dollars per month , and that these prohibitive costs eventually forced him to pull the plug in April .
Some folks have wondered why Morpheus even resisted that long .
Its product was barely usable due to the filters , its user base had shrunk to a minimum , and there was really no light at the end of the tunnel in terms of the legal fight .
Seth Finkelstein mused last year that Streamcast may just have been hanging in there to eventually reemerge as another P2P company .
Streamcast did apparently have some plans to position itself as a solutions provider for P2P - powered social media platforms .
I stumbled across a mock - up of a site called Faithsharingnetwork.com at some point that seemed to be an attempt to sell these service to niche markets , but now it looks like these attempts have died with Morpheus shutting down .
The Morpheus website finally closed down this week , leaving almost no trace of the once so popular P2P client .
Blogger Edmund Standing has some interesting background on connections between the British National Party and extreme right - wing ( in fact , wacko - wing ) Christian groups , with insight into why the BNP and other Eurofascists claim to be pro-Israel : Gott mit uns : British fascists and ‘ Christian ’ racism .
Following the recent leak of the BNP membership list , it may have come as a surprise to find that some members were listed as active Christians .
Among these , we find a ‘ “ Born Again ” Protestant Christian ’ , a ‘ Devout Christian lay preacher ’ , a ‘ Minister of Religion ’ , a ‘ Member of the Assemblies of God Pentecostal Church ’ , and a ‘ Practising Catholic ’ .
One member lists himself as a member of the ‘ British Israel World Federation ’ and another as ‘ Founder / organiser of Durham British - Israel Fellowship ’ .
The founder and organiser of Durham British - Israel Fellowship can be safely named as Colin Farquhar , for he is quite public about his support of the BNP and happy to advertise his home address as the contact point for the Fellowship .
In addition to believing that ‘ [t ] he theory of evolution is based on tales , not on fact ’ , Farquhar also holds some unusual views on the identity of the Biblical Israelites and is rabidly anti-Catholic .
In an article posted on a ‘ British Israelism ’ website , he states :
Let us also pray for , and warn Christians within the Protestant Church to shun the works of darkness and the institutions of Satan no matter what holy guise they appear to be shrouded in .
Let us warn them especially regarding the deceitfulness , error and darkness of the Antichrist Roman Catholic Church ; and those organisations such as the World Council of Churches and Churches Together that seek to bring about unity with this Satanic institution .
In order to unravel the bizarre beliefs of Farquhar and the other ( listed ) BNP member of the British Israel World Federation ( BIWF ) , let ’s first have a look at what the BIWF teaches .
Founded in 1919 , and currently Registered Charity No. 208079 , the BIWF is an organisation that promotes an esoteric interpretation of the Bible , in particular of ‘ prophetic ’ passages in the Old Testament , which was first popularised in the ‘ glory days ’ of the British Empire .
According to the theory of British Israelism , the British , and other European peoples , are in reality the so - called ‘ lost tribes ’ of Israel , the Northern Kingdom of Israel , who were expelled during the Assyrian Captivity .
It is claimed , meanwhile , that the Kingdom of Judah went on to make up modern day Jewry , although Jews are deemed by many to be ‘ ethnically mixed ’ and consequently no longer ‘ pure ’ Israelites .
This pseudo - historical belief system allows white nationalists to claim that the Bible is a book written by Europeans , about Europeans , and for Europeans , for according to this theory , Europeans are the Biblical Israelites .
British Israelism , then , is a ‘ Christian ’ religion that promotes Eurocentricism and opposes ‘ race mixing ’ as an affront to ‘ God ’s plan ’ .
Working from home can get pretty stressful while managing your toddler .
You can not concentrate on your work if your toddler is not taken care of properly .
You need to provide undivided attention to your kids as well as complete your work in the given deadline .
These tips will help you manage your work while you can be assured of your toddler ’s needs .
Waking up early
The best way is to make use of nap timing , especially early morning , when your kid is sleeping .
You wake up early to finish as much as work as you can so that when your kids wake up , you can have enough time for them without worrying much about your work .
You can plan your work timings during the early morning or late night time according to your household .
Many parents plan on waking up as early as 3 a .m. in the morning to finish most of their work so that the kids can only interrupt their sleep if they take rest during day time .
Use education programs
Another way is to keep your toddlers busy while you are working .
You can buy some educational programs that your kids can watch and keep them entertained .
Today , buying an iPad for the kids is a great idea as many applications on the device can help them learn while they play interactive games .
This can be a great way to help the learning for your kids , and a smart idea to get them focused on one thing to buy you time to work .
Swipe the role
When you and your husband or wife are both working from home , there can not be an easier way to do your work while you can take care of your kids .
You can swipe the rolls of giving time to your kids , and meanwhile , you can manage your work .
Go to a kids park
Work for home does not mean you need to be confined in your home .
You can instead go out to a kids park or an indoor playing area for toddlers .
You can keep your toddler insight while you can work simultaneously .
Make sure to choose a place which has the right security and safety measures to keep your kids under the right care .
This will help you concentrate on your work better , knowing that your kid is enjoying under the right environment .
Introduce books
You can also introduce interactive learning and coloring books to your kids .
Introducing books to your kids has two advantages .
One , they will get busy surrounded by the books so you can finish off your work .
Two , you will provide the right learning start for your kids .
Using the right books can help in establishing the learning foundation for your kids while they also develop an interest in reading and learning .
Manipulated Inflation Statistics An Undisclosed Act of Treason
For those of you who are unfamiliar with the work of John Williams of Shadow Government Statistics fame ; this missive should prove to be quite an eye opener .
For those who are familiar with Williams ' work – this is nothing more than logical extension [s ] and conclusions .
Walter J. " John " Williams was born in 1949 .
He received an A.B. in Economics , ***** laude , from Dartmouth College in 1971 , and was awarded a M.B.A. from Dartmouth 's Amos Tuck School of Business Administration in 1972 , where he was named an Edward Tuck Scholar .
During his career as a consulting economist , John has worked with individuals as well as Fortune 500 companies .
So , let 's just say the man knows of what he speaks .
The thrust of Williams ' work deals with identifying and documenting the intentional falsification of official , governmental , economic reporting – particularly as it relates to inflation :
What folks need to realize is that market rates of interest are historically set at ;
Inflation Rate + 250 [ or so ] basis points
What follows from this is , “ if you understate inflation , you end up with lower market rates of interest than you otherwise would have ” .
Why Officialdom Lies About Inflation
With a show of hands , have any of us ever met a politician who did not hold the fundamental belief that “ they ” know better how to spend our money than us – the folks who earn it ?
Not surprisingly , I did n't see many raised hands .
We all intuitively know that whenever large pools of money are earned or aggregated – ANYWHERE IN THE ECONOMY – government types tend to eye these accumulations of wealth as potential bonanzas .
This was evidenced recently over at the Wall Street Journal , where Alan Reynolds opined , where Obama will get $ 4.3 trillion dollars to fund all his new programs ?
As the Optimistic Patriot recently reported , they 're already floating a trial balloon that would net them $ 4.5 trillion :
House Democrats recently invited Teresa Ghilarducci , a professor at the New School of Social Research , to testify before a subcommittee on her idea to eliminate the preferential tax treatment of the popular retirement plans .
In place of 401 ( k ) plans , she would have workers transfer their dough into government - created “ guaranteed retirement accounts ” for every worker .
The government would deposit $ 600 ( inflation indexed ) every year into the GRAs .
Each worker would also have to save 5 percent of pay into the accounts , to which the government would pay a measly 3 percent return … .
Conversely , whenever government finances are “ stretched ” , they tend to look for ways to cut or decrease program spending without upsetting their constituents [ donors ] .
Because governments tend to not - live - within - their - means , and engage in expensive altruistic pursuits like wars , they run fiscal deficits .
Unchecked , accumulated fiscal deficits pile - up , year in and year out , to the point where interest expense becomes a TARGET – one of the largest line - items in governments ' expenses .
And as interest expense on the national debt is the fastest growing component of the federal budget , prominent mention of interest expenses in spending and taxation debates would portray a much clearer picture of the nation 's finances .
The Federal Budget
I mention all of this to show that a ] – governments have [ and always have had ] a propensity to spend on programs , and , b ] – if interest expense assigned to existing government debt were to , say , double – we can clearly see in the pie-chart above that deep cuts would necessarily have to be made to other budget items .
So , in conclusion , we know that methodology of measuring inflation has in fact been changed – for the benefit of governments ' finances - resulting in market rates of interest “ lower ” than they otherwise would be .
This was all done with the complicity of beholding Bureaucrats , The Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury .
Driven To Bankruptcy : The Promulgation of Unintended Outcomes
To be sure , the Big 3 U.S. auto companies have made mistakes – like flying corporate jets to meetings where they beg for money .
For a period of time [ like the 1980s ] they also did not seem so concerned with the quality of their product but they have made marked progress in recent years in this area .
But now let 's try to understand why some of these bad decisions were made .
How many of us have read news reports in recent years concerning auto companies bleak financial situations arising from their burgeoning pension [ health care ] costs ?
Some Background On Pensions :
Auto workers ' pension plans were , for the most part , devised and modeled by actuaries 50 – 60 years ago .
The framers of these plans were smart .
They well understood the math , or rather , the demographics of their work forces .
They knew and were able to model and plan how much capital would need to be set aside over the years to meet their future obligations .
Implicitly , in their models – these actuaries used “ assumptions ” on expected rates of future return ; namely , that fixed income investments would return a minimum of the real inflation rate + 250 [ or so basis points ] .
It should also be understood that pensions – broadly – fall into two broad categories :
Defined Benefit Plans -
In a defined benefit pension plan , an employer commits to paying its employee a specific benefit for life beginning at his or her retirement .
This type of pension plan was more common pre 1980s .
Defined Contribution Plan -
In a defined contribution pension plan , the amount of the contributions is set in advance .
The amount of the eventual retirement income is not set in advance .
A member 's retirement income will depend on several factors , including the total amount accumulated in his or her account :
 the member 's contributions , if any
 the employer 's contributions
 sums transferred to the member 's account , if any
 interest earned
Most pensions today [ since 1980 ] are Defined Contribution Plans .
Understanding how changes in inflation reporting have adversely impacted the auto company 's pension plans is KEY to understanding why the auto companies are in the financial straight - jackets they now find themselves in .
Auto companies labor contracts stipulate that pensions are of the Defined Benefit variety .
Additionally , labor contracts with the car companies have traditionally required the car companies to keep their pensions “ fully funded ” meaning that any shortfall in pension performance required the subject company to “ top up ” the fund out of operating revenue .
So , as health care costs escalated in the real world at the real world inflation rate – PENSION ASSETS [ or the fixed income portion thereof ] were only earning a FALSE rate based on corrupted or “ rigged ” interest rates .
To get your head around how debilitating this was :
In recent years General Motors has had pension assets under management of roughly 100 billion .
Their asset mix is roughly considered to be along traditional lines of 55 % - 65 % invested in equities and 35 % - 45 % invested in bonds [ fixed income ] .
Using the mid-point on the fixed income allocation , this means , by extension , that GM 's pension assets have roughly 40 billion invested in bonds [ fixed income ] or equivalents .
Now , if interest rates are 500 basis points lower than modeled expectations – this amounts to a 2 billion per year shortfall in pension asset return from that which was modeled !
This cancerous shortfall has been funded year - in - and - year - out by the auto companies and has CATEGORICALLY had a material impact on their financial demise .
These funds were not available to be reinvested back into operations to improve the product .
The situation the described above is a logical outcome which confirms and reinforces the work of John Williams .
This is an outcome that has afflicted virtually all legacy defined benefit pensions – from the steel industry to the airlines .
They 've all shared , more or less , the same fate arising from benefit costs being bourn in the real world versus income being derived by falsified fixed income benchmarks .
Everyone should be aware that , in the same way the rigging of interest rates - through falsification of inflation data – has wreaked unintended havoc on the car company 's balance sheets – it [ along with the rigging of the gold price ] has produced similar complications in the financial industry .
By mis-pricing the cost of capital – in the same way this creates asset bubbles – inefficient choices were made in terms of what size cars and trucks to build too !
After all , why would anyone have been concerned ?
Capital was cheap !!!
Market rigs have been directly responsible for asset bubbles arising from the misallocation of resources .
They have , in turn , also undermined confidence in the U.S. Dollar as the world 's reserve currency .
What we can say is that the discipline of honest money , and a freely trading market [ not rigged ] in gold , would have revealed the falsification of inflation data early on – which is exactly why it was simultaneously subverted .
Ben Bernanke and Hank Paulson know all of this and they 've both directly benefited from the perpetuation of these deceptions .
This has ALL been engineered .

Hi read this for a another view on how inflation should be claculated .
http://blogs.24.com/hubertmooolman
[ / caption ] This striking view of the Martian surface shows a stark contrast ( false colour ) between ice deposits and layered deposits ( composed mainly of ice , rock and regolith ) on the edge of the polar ice cap .
In the centre , there is a lone crater , approximately 200 meters in diameter , collecting a basinful of ice .
The ice is thought to have been there for about 10,000 years .
However , there are some oddities in this scene .
Why is the crater abnormally shaped ?
After all , craters are normally circular , not oyster shell - shaped .
Why is it an isolated crater ?
On viewing the entire region , only one crater appears to be present for several kilometres .
Does this mean the landscape is fairly young ?
If so , what geological processes are shaping the surface ?
The High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment ( HiRISE ) on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter ( MRO ) continues to return some of the most striking views from its Martian orbit .
The camera can resolve objects less than a meter in diameter , picking out everything from sand dunes , eroding mesas , rolling rocks , avalanches ( in action ) to tiny secondary craters .
These are some of the most detailed views we ’ve ever had of the Red Planet ’s surface .
HiRISE can even keep an eye on our robotic explorers , like spotting Phoenix shortly after it landed and the tread marks of the rover Opportunity .
Although this image of a rather odd - looking crater in the North Polar Region of Mars may seem a little mundane when compared with the list of HiRISE accolades , it is no less important .
It is the sole impact crater for miles , hugging the edge of the polar ice cap , carved into layered deposits of rock , soil and lumps of ice .
Using the crater count as a guide ( i.e. the lower the count , the younger the surface is ) HiRISE scientists believe the layered deposits may only be a few million years old .
This may sound like a long time , but for a planet thought to be geologically inactive , the resurfacing rate seems pretty rapid .
In this case , it is also believed the ice deposits in the crater are only 10,000 years old .
Geological activity destroys evidence of craters , although this region will have been hit by a similar number of meteorite impacts as crater - covered regions , rapid processes appear to be constantly reshaping the landscape .
It is thought that the ice flow rate would be quite low , but on observing the strange shape of the central crater , it seems it is being warped by the motion of the surrounding deposits .
The bright white ice deposits inside the crater are being protected from ablation as it is being shaded from the Sun by the crater walls .
This is a common feature in polar craters .
So much for Mars being a “ dead ” planet , then .
As seen with the dynamic avalanche processes and rolling boulders , Mars is far from being geologically inactive …

This is The Secret Museum of Mankind .
Scan : 2 ♣ Published in 1935 , the Secret Museum is a mystery book .
It has no author or credits , no copyright , no date , no page numbers , no index .
Published by " Manhattan House " and sold by " Metro Publications " , both of New York , its " Five Volumes in One " was pure hype : it had never been released in any other form .
Advertised as " World 's Greatest Collection of Strange & Secret Photographs " and marketed mainly to overheated adolescents ( see the 1942 Keen ad , left ) , it consists of nothing but photos and captions with no further exposition .
This was not a book published to educate ( despite appearing on some public library 's shelves ) , but to titillate ( literally ) — it 's emphasis was on the female form ( " Female Beauty Round the World " ) and fashion , and it featured as many National - Geographic - style native breasts as possible .
But anything lurid , weird , or just plain unusual is fair game .
This was a book to gawk at by flashlight under the bedcovers .
The Secret Museum is organized into five " albums " ( America , Africa , Asia , Europe and Oceania ) , but within those areas it 's a jumble with no order , laid out to fit as many photos as possible per page .
Strangely , there is n't a single photo from the United States — it skips from Mexico north to Canada as if nothing were in between .
The photos themselves range in quality from fair to atrocious , with almost all being bad or very bad .
Grainy , damaged , and either too - low or too - high contrast , they appear to have been copied from scratchy , abused tomes such as Hammerton 's Peoples of All Nations ( 1922 ) , Johnston and Guest 's The World of To - Day ( 1907 ) and others , without attribution .
The tone of the commentary is dated , and uniformly racist in the extreme , often hilariously so .
It reads like the patter of a carnival sideshow barker , from a time when the world was divided between " modern " Europeans and " savages " .
The photos were taken from the 1890s through the early 1930s , with period commentary to match .
This was the era of eugenics ( " the self - direction of human evolution " ) before it acquired a terminal taint thanks to Nazi Germany .
The assumption is that this was a get - rich - quick scheme : copy " 1,000 " ( actually 994 ) photos and captions verbatim from various sources with no credit , print them badly on cheap paper , sell thousands of copies for $ 1.98 , make a bundle , then take the money and run .
Yet , it was still for sale in 1942 , seven years after first being released .
Why was n't it shut down by the parties who were infringed ?
Were they involved ?
It 's a mystery .
Presented here is the Secret Museum in its entirety , all 564 pages scanned and transcribed — nothing is omitted or censored .
However , I 've cleaned up the images somewhat , paginated , added thumbnail galleries , an index , and a copy of a 1942 magazine ad .
Treat it as entertainment instead of education ( do n't take it seriously and do n't believe a word it says ! ) , adjust for the blatant racial bias of the time , and enjoy .
The Secret Museum 's photos and text are public domain .

On the recent ( behemoth ) thread that began at being gay at BYU and wandered off in every conceiveable direction from there , it was put forth that perhaps our tithing dollars have been or are being used in various ways to fund political campaigns –most notably in oppostion of the legalization of gay marriage .
Some small discussion ensued on that thread , but it was ( not surprisingly ) crushed by the great wheel of that unwieldy conversation , and because I think it ’s an important enough issue to warrent a thread of its own , I propose that we take up the matter more specifically here .
I ’ll just lay it out there .
The idea of my tithing money going to political purposes bothers me .
A lot .
I am ashamed to admit that it ’s a possibility that had n’t really occurred to me before .
Of course I ’ve been aware that the Church has thrown its cap into the political arena ( despite all the letters read over the pulpit each voting season claiming otherwise ) .
That fact is troublesome enough on its own–not only because I do n’t tend to agree much with the political stances the institution decides to take , but because I personally do n’t think a church ’s place is in politics at all .
But to think that the Church might be using my faithfully - given 10 % to support causes to which I would never knowingly donate makes me feel a bit …well …icky .
Because I do n’t have any knowledge on the subject , I put the following questions to all of you :
1 ) Is this true ?
( By which I suppose I mean is there any transparency on the subject of how tithing funds are allocated ? )
2 ) If so , how is it possible for a nonprofit organization to do such a thing without having its 501 ( c ) 3 status revoked ?
3 ) Also if so , is there anything we as individuals can do to ensure that our tithes go specifically and only toward things like the building of buildings and temples , ward budgets , etc–the sorts of things which I had always thought tithing funded ?
4 ) And finally , does the apparent lack of transparency on this subject bother any of you as much as it does me ?
What ’s to be done about it ?
And please please PLEASE do n’t let ’s turn this into another discussion of why gay marriage should or should not be legal .

The DIFC owns the emirate 's financial assets such as its stock exchange , Mr Bin Sulaiman said : " DIFC Week takes place at a critical juncture for the global economy .
Many see in the turmoil of global markets a crisis of epochal proportions .
Yet the financial shock waves rumbling around the world could be the first birth pangs of a new economic reality ...
Until recently capital typically moved from the developed world to developing economies .
This dynamic is now changing .
New financial centres [ like the GCC region ] complement , if not rival , the role played by established centres like London and New York . "
Python plugin for IDEA has reached an early access preview ( EAP ) stage .
It is alpha-quality software , lacking in many obvious spots , but already allowing to sample some features .
This release concentrates on means for writing code and navigating code .
Things known to work
A module of Python type can be added to a regular IDEA project .
Any reasonable CPython installation can be chosen as project 's Python SDK ; autodetection works reasonably on Windows , Linux , and Mac OS X .
When Jython code is used in a regular Java - based project , plugin 's features kick in .
For Python modules , project window lists your sources and Python 's standard libraries , including zips and eggs .
Source code is parsed on the fly and checked for syntax errors .
Imports from __future__ are respected for with_statement and nested_scopes .
are respected for and .
Ctrl + Click on an identifier leads to the latest definition of this identifier , or first probable out - of - context definition of it .
Note that such resolution is not always possible : consider something like foo [ i ] . bar .
. " Find usages " ( Alt + F7 ) works for identifiers , with same limitations as for Ctrl + Click .
Names defined in C - based modules are resolvable as long as the modules are importable .
Classes have usual " inheritors " navigation icons on the gutter .
Methods have usual " overrides " navigation icons on the gutter .
Structure View shows functions , classes , methods , and class variables , with arbitrary nesting .
Names that must definitely resolve but do n't are highlighted by an inspection .
Code completion ( Ctrl + Space ) on a blank space proposes visible identifiers , including imported , with module name as a hint .
Code completion in import statements suggests module names ; try typing import th and pressing Ctrl + Space .
and pressing Ctrl + Space .
Code completion proposes known items for qualified expressions , including inherited .
Try typing " foo " .cap and pressing Ctrl + Space .
and pressing Ctrl + Space .
Code completion and name resolution also work for attributes dynamically added to an object in immediate scope .
Try typing foo = object ( ) ; foo. bar = 1 ; foo.b and pressing Ctrl + Space .
and pressing Ctrl + Space .
Quick documentation ( Ctrl+Q ) for classes shows either doc comment or definition .
Function parameter popup appears on pressing Ctrl+P in argument list , parameters under cursor highlighted .
This includes fancier cases of starred and double - starred parameters and arguments , implicit " self " , etc .
Pseudo - source is auto - generated for built - in and C - based modules , allowing to navigate to identifiers defined therein .
Rename refactoring ( Shift + F6 ) works reasonably .
A DeMorgan law intention is available for boolean expressions .
( Internally it is implemented in Python . )
Function parameters are checked for consistency .
Method parameters are checked for presence of first parameter ( the " self " ) .
Where possible , argument lists of function calls are checked against parameter lists of corresponding functions , errors detected .
This is an inspection which you can turn off .
Any file from sources can be run , with output going to console , as usual .
Source control must work as for any other IDEA modules .
Things that work only partially
All code is parsed as Python 2.5 ; version - dependent features are yet to come .
Import statements do not support relative import correctly .
Support for standalone Jython is present but is very limited as of now ; Jython installations detection is very limited .
In Structure View , instance variables are not included .
The view is not always updated regularly ; switch it off and on to refresh .
Keyword completion proposes keywords , but sometimes unsuitable keywords are proposed .
Code navigation does not handle multiple definitions ( e.g. when in identifier is defined both in an " if " and in the " else " branches ) .
Code navigation does not honor class - private names ( e.g. __foo ) and the __all__ attribute of modules imported via " from foo import * " , so certain names look more visible than they are .
) and the attribute of modules imported via " " , so certain names look more visible than they are .
When an unknown name is found , the choice of possible ways to import it is limited to top - level modules .
Auto - indentation is often incorrect .
Type is inferred only for simplest expressions .
Several special functions from standard library ( like super ( ) or dict .
fromkeys ( ) ) do n't have correct signature .
or ) do n't have correct signature .
Syntax highlighting is very basic .
Name resolution and completion works somehow for Jython when referencing imported Java objects .
Things that are missing
Decorators are only parsed .
They are not included in quick documentation .
Their arguments are not correctly checked .
The standard @classmethod and @staticmethod decorators are not handled properly .
and decorators are not handled properly .
Properties are not detected as properties ; assignment to read - only properties is not detected .
Many significant inspections are not implemented yet ( unused values , unreachable code , unsafe string handling , definite assignment , endless loops , etc ) .
There are no significant refactorings yet .
There are no significant quickfixes and intentions yet .
There are no code templates yet .
There is no unit testing support yet .
There is no documentation generators support yet .
There is no support for packaging and deployment yet .
There is no debugger yet .
Please do n't hesitate to point us to deficiencies you notice and to suggest features .
No , I am saying 33 gigajoules is equivalent to 12 hp over 1hour .
Which it is .
I just converted the hp to watts , which is perfectly fine , then I plugged in the proper time which is in secconds , one hour = 3600 secconds .
12 hp is very roughly rounded , and the concluded answer was extremely comparable .
If I directly converted 12 hp over to electrical watts with no loss of energy I would still only get roughly 9kw which would be enough energy if stored to run my house which consumes 3 kwh for roughly 3 hours .
Its a bunch of math , but it is well reasoned .
I know it is difficult to understand converting between these to things .
Joules are a measure of energy ( energy is defined as the ability to do work )
Work is power * time and is measured as an SI unit of joules
Power is the rate at which work is performed or energy is converted
Time is , well you know what time is
By looking closely at these properties you can conclude that power over time is work or hp over one hour is joules
When I use the word over I do n't refer to a fraction or division problem I refer to something occurring over a period of time .

" All voters should join me in being furious , no matter the " results " reported on and after Tuesday . "
~~~Brad Friedman
As I reported 10/30/08 here at Bradblog , I early voted in North Fulton County , GA - the " Vanilla Side of Town . "
I talked about the machines to people around me while we waited 3 1/2 hours [ from 6:20 p .m. for me ] to cast our votes .
I was amazed to find they were fairly savvy on the topic and 100 % of them want to TRASH the MACHINES .
We will have to push it to the top of the agenda when the old guard gets booted out .
If they manage to steal it again ... well ... it will be the end of democracy and the final melt - down of what 's left of our country .

Everyone concerned about this issue ought to follow the example set by New Mexico voting activists who got the state to adopt paper ballots .
Yes , optical scanners used to read paper ballots can still pose threats , paper ballots are not fool proof , but I feel a heckuva lot better knowing I voted on a paper ballot and there is a paper trail .

As usual , a well - laid - out , crystal clear analysis by Brad .
As usual , the Dems do not want to use logic and reason and evidence to see what 's going on .
“ It ’s never helpful if the environment is filled with hyperbole about false claims .
Voters do n’t want to hear it , ” --- sez Bauer .
Sorry , no .
It is n't the voters who do n't want to hear it .
It 's people like Bauer .
OK ---
I think I get it now .
The Dems can't leave their abuser .
They are afraid they will be destroyed if they try to leave --- i.e. if they speak out against Grand Theft Election they fear they will be eliminated from the political spectrum in a very humiliating , painful way .
So , they deny the abuse is happening at all , because the stark reality would be too overwhelming to deal with , and dangerous if they were to go public with it .
Some Dems have been co-opted by the abusers , and spend their time attempting to ridicule and silence those who would fight and speak out against the abuse .
How do we fight the perpetrators and not blame the victim ?

So the obvious truth is out now .
We 're pretty much on our own as far as the machines are concerned .
Unless a complete meltdown occurs , and some " maverick " SOS and Attorney General call for an investigation ; a REAL investigation , there 's just " We The People " and our cameras and post-election statistical deviations from what we know to be fairly accurate poll numbers .
Of course , should " We The People " actually expose something so heinous and incriminating that even the " mainstream " media must acknowledge it , Mr. Bauer will be right there to take credit and hog the spotlight .
It 's a pretend fight with thousands of pretend lawyers - great ...

John Dean does n't get Voting Machine Election Fraud either .
In his most recent article he says : If Obama is rejected on November 4th for another authoritarian conservative like McCain , I must ask if Americans are sufficiently intelligent to competently govern themselves .
I can understand authoritarian conservatives voting for McCain , for they know no better .
It is well - understood that most everyone votes with his or her heart , not his or her head .
Polls show that 81 percent of Americans " feel " ( in their hearts and their heads ) that our country is going the wrong way .
How could anyone with such thoughts and feelings vote for more authoritarian conservatism , which has done so much to take the nation in the wrong direction ?
The truth is that Gore won , John Kerry won and Obama should win by a huge margin .
Election theft is to blame .
The controlled corporate media is largely responsible here for putting a black - out on the news ... book publishers refused to publish books on the subject ... major TV channels refused to talk about it ... & so on .
Since 9/11 , Congress has been living in a lock - down in DC ... all TVs tuned to FOX news [ whitehouse propaganda ] channel ONLY .
The brainwashing has certainly taken its toll .

I phoned into Thom Hartmann 's show in 2006 just prior to the mid-term elections and asked Bernie Sanders why does n't someone from Congress introduce a bill that makes it illegal for a private entity to own and operate voting machines or systems .
Bernie replied , the caller makes a good point , we need paper ballots .
That is not what I was looking for and I agree with Brad that it is inexcusable for this situation to exist as it does now .
Even if the Dems win big , we do n't know how big and whether it would give us the 60 Senators we need for a filibuster proof majority .
What 's wrong with the Dem leadership on this .
I just do n't understand .

Is the word about 866 - OUR - VOTE Reaching the Most Vulnerable Voters ?
http://urteveblog.wordpress.com
We believe that “ Election Protection ” is best equipped to prevent a calamity by linking legal experts with voters who are having trouble voting before and on election day .
However , after communicating with the publicity operations of “ Election Protection ” we sensed a missing link in their national campaign .
What we learned : * The “ Election Protection ” was rightly directed to those who are most vulnerable to being discouraged from going to the polls , or prevented from voting at the polling stations : they are the elderly , minorities and the under - informed …
* The campaign launched later than optimal .
* The campaign was not reaching local television and radio broadcast markets , and there was no indication that it would .
What we did : * Produced 8 video clips and audio clips with “ real ” people talking about what would they do if they had trouble voting on election day ( with both English and Spanish content ) .
We gave the videos the look and feel of content that local channels might produce themselves .
* In the last two days of October , we called every broadcast producer at the news desks of local TV and radio stations in the battleground states to ask if they had heard about the Election Protection or 866 - OUR - VOTE initiative .
What we found : * Almost no one knew about 866 - OUR - VOTE or Election Protection .
Only 1 in 10 producers had heard of Election Protection or 866 - OUR - VOTE .
* But 8 out of 10 producers either looked at our video or audio clips on the spot and / or confirmed that they were in need of content that differentiated themselves from what is coming over the nationally syndicated feeds .
They also reported that the content coming over nationally syndicated feeds was stale content by mid day .
Some of them pointed out that their audience was not predominantly those who read NYT , WSJ or tuned into NPR and that ad campaigns targeted to those individuals would miss their markets .
* When shown how easy it was to download broadcast quality clips , we got comments like : great , cool , interesting , we ’ll use this on election day , thanks , etc …
Our job is not quite done , but feel free to contact us if you would like to learn how you can help with this effort !

There is no suppression .
There is only people trying to ensure a fair election .
I think every Republican would welcome a fair and honest election cycle .
Somehow I do n't believe the Democrats really want that .
Identification is the first step to ensuring fair elections .
One man , one vote .
Without that , all other complaints are moot .
Even my kids soccer league verifies the ages and identities of the kids .
Until you recognize voter id requirements as a cornerstone of any election process , I will refuse to listen to any other complaints .
These complaints are just disengenous and being made by dishonest people with political agendas .

There is NO WAY the Dems do n't know e-vote machines are n't being hacked on a large scale .
What does that tell you about the Dems ?
Either they think they can hack them , too , which is bad for all voters ... OR ... they 're in on some charade to make us think there 's really two opposing parties ; IE : elections are just a dog and pony show to make us think there 's a real choice .
That 's all I can think of !

I happen to agree with the core strategy being used by the Dems right now , which is to overrun the problem with heavy new voter registrations , an awesome ground game to mobilize the vote , and a positive approach .
They are on the offense , not the defense .
The Hursti Hack would have been defeated by overrunning it with more voters .
Do the math .
Now , AFTER the election we 'll learn two things :
1 ) Whether anyone tries to get away with an exceptionally dangerous strategy , to tamper against a landslide and 2 ) Whether we can finally focus the public on the core issue , which is secrecy and removal of public right to know and public controls .
But that really is for after Tuesday .
Just my take .

Hackers ,
You guys really do n't have a clue what you are talking about .
It is so clear when you read these comments .
You have these ideas and principals that are so far fetched and unrealistic .
We live in a digital world like it or not .
You just can't change that .
Atm's , Banking , satelites , GPS , Cell Phones , Telephones , cable tv. etc etc .
Computers have made all these things possible but with voting its not exceptable ?
The way in which it is done can always be improved .
Some of these comments are almost pure studity with concerns on computer Hacking .
Sorry do n't take it personal , but you really do n't know what your talking about .
College 's do n't know what they are talking about .
They work inside a box .
Hacking is very traceable if you know what you are looking for .
Digital footprints .
A validation check of equipment and software prior to implimentation and a closed computer system is not vulnerable to attack .
Encryption or whatever or however in its many forms is n't an easy thing to overcome .
However one thing you do learn in life is anything is possible .
One thing I can tell you is Hacking is a time consuming process and does n't happen as often as most think .
As people we all seem to think the worst when something goes wrong .

Very interesting information .
Unfortunately I live in Kentucky , where it is illegal to videotape your vote .
During this year 's primary , I 'm fairly sure the optical scan machine I ostensibly " voted " on did not record my vote .
The counter did n't move .
Two questions : First , is there something about the Harsti hack that makes it an optimal client - side hack for one of these machines ?
I 'm just thinking about Ms. Harris ' remark that flooding a precinct with substantially more voters would defeat the Harsti Hack .
Could one not come up with a hack that is more robust in dealing with a greater number of variables ?
Second , it has been mentioned that recalibrating these machines after they 've been " voted " on is especially dangerous , that then is when they are most vulnerable to being hacked .
Why are they more vulnerable to being hacked at that point than they are to being hacked coming out of the factory at Diebold or Sequoia or wherever ?
Joe the Programmer / Plumber 's point touched on something that occurred to me a while ago : if you 're , say , the owner of one of these voting machines and also the head of George Bush 's reelection campaign , and you want to rig the election using your machines , would it not be more fail - safe to pre-load the machine that gets wheeled into the precinct of a Democratic voter , like myself , with a script that would simply toss or flip my ballot when it gets put through , rather than having a local poll worker / elections official load a script after the machine has correctly tabulated my Democratic vote ?

Joe the programmer : Hacking is not required .
These machines feature a manual entry screen .
It 's a menu item .
And as for the hacking , we taught a chimp to hack the Diebold system , so you overestimate the quality of the system .
As in " unprotected MS Access database that can be opened and edited without a password . "
Oh , and if you DO use a password ?
We tried one of the systems in Florida and discovered the password was " diebold "
For other comments yes , there are all kinds of hacks that can't be overrun with numbers , though preloading with negative and positive votes can be .
But when you have a very pronounced landslide going on , a point is reached where the tampering becomes implausible unless you can find some way to explain it that the public will buy .

Well in that case I would n't say a dismissal of voting systems is not what your after .
But better programming and security .
There are many ways to protect your systems just as you would any system .
Just because they are electronic does n't make them any less secure .
Actually creates more possible solutions for security .
NSA and NASA use computers for everything and have developed means to stop intrusion .
But first they learned from prior intrusions and worked on eleviating access points .
The staff is your first line of defense .
If they do n't know whats going on then ?
What can I say ?
If we are having these issues should n't we be going after secret groups that have been placing people in key positions of office .
Of course the means in which this happens is important also .
But the underlining problem still will exist and when there is a will there is a way , no matter the system put in place .
Kind of an endless cause .
I would like to see the end of political parties and vote on people to lead people not political groups .
I see it like this :
The most powerfull groups in the world .
1 ) . Catholic Church
2 ) . Republican Party
3 ) . Democratic Party Thank You

If this is not so ... then please state what the fatal flaw in e-voting is , and how you would plan to get around it .

Not to do a dogpile on Joe # 16 , but I have to add my obligatory notes on electronic hardware .
At the doping level , backdoor logic can be built into chips .
Even the USAF is worried about that in their PARTS SUPPLY .
It 's been done , the back - doors ' work .
but as far as electronic tabulation devices is will never be checked .
Not to forget , the public is not going to be allowed to probe an electronic vote tabulation device with a logic probe , logic analyzer , Oscope , Meter , etc. , in the middle of an election , and even still what 's read on such probes and devices might not be what the actual count is .
Furthermore , if there is a backdoor at the doping level , the only way your going to find it is , by pure chance , ( say someone 's transmitter signal enables hidden logic inside of a chip being monitored 24/7 ) when or with a destructive reverse engineering of each part .
Meaning , the device would be destroyed in the process .
Sadly ,
When I go vote , I wo n't see technicians monitoring the whole spectrum for anomalous signals at some unknown frequency , they wo n't be monitoring the power supply ( Hell we just had three brown outs yesterday and the day before out here in South Sacramento ) for changes in frequency or interruptions in power , they wo n't have logic analyzers connected , they wo n't have meters spread out .
Finally , lets not forget about the missing eeproms awhile back while being shipped via UPS .
Electronics do have a place in this world , but electronic tabulation devices is n't such a place unless your trying to steal elections .
Every election judge that say's , " we ca n't handle counting by hand on paper ballots " or , " we must have new machines " , or " this will never happen " , should not only be fired , but should never work , contract , or touch anything to do with elections ever again .
Can you tell I 've had a bad time ™ with election judges in the internet ?
And all you linux programmers ( down at openvotingconsortium.org ) , you might be smarter than me , you might mean well , and you might actually be able to make a box that actually counts , but you can not guarantee the hardware was n't tampered with , which is the whole point you miss in the first place .
Furthermore , you still can't provide a way for the public to provide oversight of an invisible electronic signal .
Perhaps you 've spent too much time programming and forgot your common sense physics ?
---
I 'll leave that as a rhetorical question , not to accuse anyone of anything .
I only wish there were more people that would spread this message about hardware , and electronic signals .
The death of these electronic vote tabulation machines could be final , without having to get the fascist media involved ( Which is a whole other problem in it 's own right . )

Really the only electronic vote tabulation devices would work is by giving up either the voter 's transparency , or by blind faith .
And that transparency was there for a reason .
Sure NASA might be able to let astronauts vote , but they either gave up transparency or they voted on blind faith .
Paper Ballots hand counted with public oversight do not have the same kind of problems that electronic signals have .
An electronic signal does n't care if there 's a lock on a sheet metal enclosure .
So while you might be able to pick that lock anywhere from 2 seconds to 20 minutes , the electronic signal can be in and out at 3e8 .
Where 3e8 = The Speed of light .

In comment # 11 , TomT says :
There is no suppression .
There is only people trying to ensure a fair election .
I think every Republican would welcome a fair and honest election cycle .
Somehow I do n't believe the Democrats really want that .
Identification is the first step to ensuring fair elections .
One man , one vote .
Without that , all other complaints are moot .
Even my kids soccer league verifies the ages and identities of the kids .
Until you recognize voter id requirements as a cornerstone of any election process , I will refuse to listen to any other complaints .
These complaints are just disengenous and being made by dishonest people with political agendas .
Well Tom , you seem to associate vote suppression with only the requiring of an ID to be shown on election day .
You must not have done much reading on this site , since most of the talk about vote suppression is concerned with far more serious methods , like intentional misallocation of voting machines and elections personnel , among many others .

Would somebody explain what " recalibration " refers to in the context of the touch - screen machines ?
I can't recall the last time that an ATM touch - screen was shut down for " recalibration " .
I 've never personally had the experience of the machine depositing a check when I was trying to withdraw money .
The mouse on my computer keeps going to the right spot on the screen .
The touchpad on my laptop acts the same way every day .
I 've written enough GUI apps and image processing code in C that I might be able to understand a technical answer , and by thi time , hearing one would be a relief .
Because the alternative that occurs to me is that people are just plain covering up for malfeasance .

I attended a panel at the LA Times Book Festival last May featuring John Powers , John Dean , Michael Gerson , and Nancy Snow .
During the question period I stepped up to the microphone and expressed the frustration I feel every time I hear talking heads in the media and so called liberals / progressives refer to the elections we have “ lost ” since 2000 instead of saying “ allegedly lost ” and pointing out the overwhelming evidence the elections were stolen .
I said the Republicans will create some false reason to doubt the outcome and steal the next election if the Democrats continue to refuse to educate the public and expose the Republican crimes .
Even though my remarks were supported by the applause in the room , John Dean did not take my allegations seriously at all …
He was quite dismissive as I recall ..
It ’s sad to say … but I think Obama may be allowed to win in exchange for maintaining the status quo .
The same dark forces will remain in the background pulling the strings and the religious right will be put back in their box .
No impeachment , no accountability , no new election laws , and no independent , science based 9/11 investigation .
BTW : I highly recommend seeing THE CHANGLING .
I found the parallels to current events chilling .
Corrupt authorities , abuse of power , truth tellers and victims labeled crazy and arrested , torture , manipulation of the media , black is white , white is black … .
It ’s all there .

Thanks for the responses , but it seems that none of us know for sure what it means to " recalibrate a touchscreen " .
War story .
I used to make various devices which I used to take tens of thousands of measurements off photographs .
They'd be interfaced to ( does this ever date me ! )
Apple //e computers through various cards I 'd buy from non-Apple companies .
Sometimes you 'd press a little switch .
Sometimes you 'd type a number on a keypad .
You 'd glance at the monitor and make sure that the input made sense .
Nothing got lost .
Every datum was written to floppy after the user pressed the switch .
I mean , for pity 's sake , I 'm not an engineer , and this stuff was n't rocket science .
It never froze .
It never broke down .
We never lost data , not after I learned my lesson about flushing buffers after every input thanks to a lightning strike .
If I could do this , then anybody with a pure heart can .
Failure is evidence of something worse than incompetence --- it is evidence of bad intent .

The best I could explain RECALIBRATION is that it 's similar to " Image Slicing " e.g. you pick your screen coordinates x , y and give them values .
If the values are not correct , then the image the user looks at is not centered for activation .
I too have written some GUI apps .
But I know nothing about electronic voting machines , or specifically DRE's .
While my programming may be weak , I do know electronics .
Bitching about Recalibration is simply an excuse to access the hardware / software of the machine .
Once that happens , to use a pun , " it 's game over . "

Or maybe it 's even worse than that .

I think that more and more people are saavy about the problems with voting machines .
Unfortunately , it seems that everybody who swings any weight in the Democratic Party is totally unsaavy , and worse , has drunk gallons of the Koolaide that says that it 's better for the Democratic Party to bury its head in the sand than it is to actually begin to address the real problems .
Already it seems obious that , should McCain somehow pull off a miracle victory tomorrow , the Dems will simply surrender .
As they 've shown again and again over the past decade , they have no stomach for a tough fight .
None at all .
Instead of dealing with anything , they fetishize false solutions , such as the supposed armies of lawyers .
Where the hell were these lawyers in Ohio in 2004 ?
Or early voting - that 's supposed to be the panacea .
Daily Kos refers to early votes as ' votes in the bank ' .
The sheer , seemingly willful ignorance , is simply astounding .
Did you know , Brad , that you are apparently considered an unacceptable source at Daily Kos , a " conspiracy theorist " , not good enough for the " reality based " Surrendercrats ?
I mention Daily Kos because to visit Daily Kos is to realize , in my opinion , that the Dems really are literally willfully ignorant .
At Dk , one of the key Dem online sites , discussion of Stolen Elections or election problems other than suppression is pretty much forbidden .
There is simply an active unwillingness to take these issues seriously , and also a determination to validate only those who dismiss them .
It 's an article of faith , for example , that exit polls do n't matter .
And that 's the really scary part .
The Democrats , be they establishment types like Obama , or supposed activists , like the Daily Kos folks , are absolutely , totally , determinedly willing and eager to have no , zero , nada , zip check on the validity of elections .
It does n't matter how big a lead Obama has in the polls going into the elections ( polls that themselves are controlled by a small number of companies ) ; the Dems will accept whatever the election day ' results ' are , angrily refusing to even consider any possibility that any elections are ever stolen .
So we can never know .
There are no checks and balances in elections .
Election cycle after election cycle , we just take it on faith .
There has to be a strong third party movement .
No matter how the election turns out Tuesday , the Dems simply cannot be trusted any more than the GOP can be trusted .
A third party that is willing to stand and fight for progressive principles ( such as real , verifiable elections ) is the only way to go .
To me , this is the final straw .
When neither ' major ' party is willing to address an issue as basic as election fairness and credibility , they no longer should be considered viable parties .

Recalibrating a machine is really quite a simple thing and has nothing to altering the precious source code .
Let 's say a touchscreen goes down , you need to bring in a new one to replace it .
That new one must match up to the ballots in that particular district / precinct and also must jive with the HATT at the end of the night .
Each polling place has it's own codes to match up ... you can not just " borrow " one .
You can use the the memory stick in the old one , toss the baby in and use some coding for the touchscreen to display the correct ballots .
Which actually is the best way , since that stick will still be holding all the previous votes on the other touchscreen .
Or some may already be set - up for that polling place , inwhich the Judge would offically shut down that touchscreen ( once you close the poll you cannot restart it ) and remove that memory stick , label it and use it also at the end of the night .
This type of procedure is not a function of any pollworker .
They are not privy to any under coding that the technicians use .
And through recalibrating , one NEVER actually opens any given machine .
It is not necessary .
This also works visa versa ... let 's say you go to open your polls and find the HATT is malfunctioning and will not work .
( Yes , they been known to be sent out without being reprogrammed from a training session )
You can take the memory stick from the touch screen , insert it into the USB port and then with some fancier coding recalibrate the HATT to match that district / precinct ballots and also accept the memory sticks and memory box and the end of the night .
So , from my point of view ( which is a darn good one ) , when you hear " recalibrating " it is only a procedure used for having the correct ballots to display and the correct coding for that polling place so all hell does n't break lose at the end of the night when you go to consolidate the votes .
Just my thoughts ... take it or leave it .

Except for allowing the possibility of the binary generated from the " precious source code " to be seamlessly overriden and then having the override tracelessly removing itself after the fact , you mean ?
So , using your explanation , why are machines becoming " uncalibrated " in the middle of a vote and having to be " recalibrated " again and again when it's the same machine using the same ballot definition software all day long ?
And how would your explanation change the fact that plugging into the ports of an active machine during an election opens a serious security vulnerability in that machine ... and in every other machine that machine is connected to either directly or indirectly ?
Just curious ...

Do the math .
Bev , would n't computer programmers have grown much more sophisticated since the Hursti Hack ?
Also , if you " re-calibrate " voting equipment in the middle of the election , could n't you introduce some serious vote - flipping code at that point ?
And with all the different points of entry for adjusting the vote there will be lots of opportunities , and few who will bother to look at discrepancies .
How 's it going in Pima , AZ ?
Has anyone gotten a look at those ballots yet ?
Now , AFTER the election we 'll learn two things :
1 ) Whether anyone tries to get away with an exceptionally dangerous strategy , to tamper against a landslide ...
I do n't think it 's that dangerous .
Already even the dems are saying stuff like , " If McCain wins the election , then all the pollsters will have egg on their face , " and " exit polls are suspect anyway --- you can't trust them . "
The public is being primed for another stolen election and it wo n't be that hard to convince people that , once again , the polls were wrong .
Also , I have little doubt that all the myriad tricks from 2004 and then some are being rolled out again in an updated version .
We already have a democratic election chair in Philadelphia poo-pooing the idea that long lines might affect the vote .
I think it 's great to register as many people as possible and get out the vote .
But the utter denial of election fraud insults my intelligence and makes me question why I 'm supporting them .
In fact I tell any Democrat who calls me that unless they stand up for the rights of voters I will have nothing to do with them .
I 'm angry , like Brad , and I think they are making a mistake to pretend it does n't exist .
I hope like hell their strategy works .
But Rove et. al. have their strategy in place , you can be sure .
Whether the numbers are enough to counter them , I do n't know .
I will hope and pray it is the case .
2 ) Whether we can finally focus the public on the core issue , which is secrecy and removal of public right to know and public controls .
But that really is for after Tuesday .
Yes , that is the core issue .
I see no reason to have kept it in the background before Tuesday .
But now , yeah .
Let 's hope that some candidates are in a position to do something after Tuesday and not grow complacent because , hopefully , they will have won .

Yeah right !
The Bush - enabling Dems have a strategy ?
When since 2000 have they demonstrated ANY strategy ?
You comment reminds me of what Dem kool - aid drinkers were saying before the 2006 " election " when Bush - accomplice Pelosi had said " impeachment is off the table . "
The Dem kool - aid drinkers said : Pelosi is not serious .
She 's just saying that to fool the Repugs and play the game .
She can't let the Repugs on to what she plans to do after the Dems take the majority in congress .
Today :
As we see , the Dem kool - aid drinkers were full of shit .
They were once again living in their wishful - thinking and Denial .
Pelosi was absolutely serious when she said repeatedly that " impeachment is off the table . "
She was n't trying to fool the Repugs or deceive the Repugs .
There was NO strategy .
Because she is a Repug charading as a Dem .
That example came to mind after reading your comment .
And now we have the ability to get rid of that Bush - enabling piece of work Pelosi but I do n't think that 's going to happen due to D party - line programming in most voters who can vote in district 8 .
But just in case , those who live in district 8 ( which is most of San Francisco ) , please vote for Cindy Sheehan to replace the Bush - enabling Traitor of the House Pelosi .

I hate to tell you this but it is as easy to change votes as it is to change numbers on a calculator .
Nobody sees it .
Nobody knows it 's being done .
These are non-verifiable voting machines .
Most often they flip FOR the Repugs .
We sure do n't hear the Repugs screaming about votes flipping over to the Dems now do we ?
And you notice that the Dems are silent on this , as usual ?
It does n't matter who votes , or how many people vote or how they vote .
The results will be what we are told they are by the corporate media and the results will most likely have no basis in reality whatsoever .
But we will never know , will we ?
And who helped bring the damnable machines to begin with ?
The Bush - accomplice Dems .
You wrote : " obama needs ur vote " No , Nader / Gonzalez NEEDS your vote .
Nader / Gonzalez needs your vote because Nader is for single payer health care , getting us out of all these wars / occupations ( Iraq , Afghanistan ) .
He wo n't give bailouts to Wall Street like the Dems / Repugs did .
He wo n't give us another Alito and Roberts like your Bush - enabling Dems did .
He will probably get rid of FISA and the USAPATRIOT Act and Guantanamo and torture , whereas your lord and savior Obama will get rid of NONE of this .

Yes , people , do go out and cast your vote this year because the landslide of unexpected votes in '06 is why we just barely got a Democratic majority in congress .
Yes it should have been a lot larger , but Karl 's " The Math " made an oops .
I 'm looking forward to a new kind of leadership in DC .
We 'll be Dancin ’ in the Street !!!

Kira , I never said that Nader had any chance to " win " ( or be selected by the voting machines rather ) because I know that most people do n't have the intelligence to vote for him .
You wrote : " Too bad Nader is n't running a campaign that inspires hope and action .
Obama is . "
I do n't base my vote for a candidate on something as flimsy as " hope . "
And I 've already seen Obama 's " action " by seeing his Bush - accomplice VOTING RECORD ( most recently FISA and Bush 's $ 850 BILLION Wall Street bailout give away to the rich ) .
I see you did n't mention anything about Obama 's Bush - enabling VOTING RECORD .
Interesting .
An intelligent person bases their vote on a candidate 's VOTING RECORD and / or the positions that a candidate takes .
Not wishful - thinking " hope . "
When you see runners on a track , do you urge the people in the back to slow down so that the so - called " front runner " can take the lead ?
That 's basically what you 're saying .
No , I 'm campaigning for Nader / Gonzalez until tomorrow .
And if Obama / Biden is so weak that they can't stand on their VOTING RECORD or be examined on their Bush - enabling VOTING RECORD , one cannot blame the Nader voters for it .
Also , Cindy Sheehan in the 8th district ( San Francisco ) to replace " impeachment is off the table " Bush - accomplice Pelosi .

Zapkitty ...
A memory stick cannot change the binary codes .
If your computer freezes up , which is the better solution ?
Restart or reboot ?
My personal choice it rebooting .
No machine is connected to another throughout the voting day .
Where did I suggest connecting into the ports of an ACTIVE machine ?
I did not , reread my post , thank you .

Kira ,
Board of Elections ?
No , I am not .
Though I have worked as an offical investigator on quite a few elections on behalf of the Board of Elections of Cook County .
I was subcontracted for research and analysis by Mike Gibbons , Kwaidan Consulting Services , for about 1 1/ 2 years prior to his untimely death , ex-subcontractor for Sequoia Voting Systems .
Part of that research had to do with investigative work into every offical tied into Sequoia .
IMO , electronic voting machines should be scrap metal .

" A memory stick cannot change the binary codes . "
FAIL .
The PEB ( personalized electronic ballot )
interface can be used to load viral software that not only overrides the binaries but can both spread to other machines and erase itself when its task is completed .

And for someone attempting to pass themselves off as a supposed " expert " you 're surprisingly ignorant of data that was first reported to the public in February of 2007 .

" If your computer freezes up , which is the better solution ?

FAIL .
Irrelevant non-answer attempting to masquerade as " expert knowledge " " No machine is connected to another throughout the voting day . "
FAIL .
You yourself spoke of sharing PEBs between machines ... and just like bio viruses any machine that has a PEB inserted is effectively hooked up to every machine that same PEB has been inserted into .
" Where did I suggest connecting into the ports of an ACTIVE machine ?
I did not , " FAIL .
If the machine was in use before the PEB insertion ... the supposed " recalibration " ... and is put back into use after the " recalibration " then the machine is in active service .
This was a very futile attempt at weasel - wording your way out of what was an unconscionable error for a pupported " expert " .
and in comment # 70 the hilarious tag " " I was subcontracted for research and analysis by Mike Gibbons , Kwaidan Consulting Services " LOL FAIL .
You mean the ghost " consulting firm " hired by Sequoia to whitewash their malfeasance ?

comment # 47 about being a political activist but not voting because he just heard about the rigged machines is preposterous , an obvious fake .
DailyKos is also preposterous .
I 'm sure like the church , there are a few good priests there , but it 's rotten at the top .
Kos worked for the CIA for 6 months .
Plants are everywhere .
To take back democracy we have to be aware of the large number of moles without getting paranoid or destroying our ability to work together .
Look up Operation Mockingbird , uncovered by congressional investigators in the ' 70's .
Do some research into CIA control of the media and more .
If you managed the Yankees , and could plant a fake onto the Red Sox , even plant their best player , who played great up until October every year , but then fell silent , WOULDN'T YOU DO IT ?
Fascism never died , it went underground and served up moles , rigged EVM's , double agents and plants and .... fascism , best hastened by rigged elections at all levels .
What Obama should do is dismantle the CIA .
Then the whole world might have a chance at democracy .

Follow - up to Zapkitty : I do respect your position on the subject , though do not reference me as a liar .
It 's rather a turn - off comment when my intentions are not meant to defend Sequoia in any way , shape or form .
Just the opposite , my dear .
" You mean the ghost " consulting firm " hired by Sequoia to whitewash their malfeasance ? "
I do n't need to backtrack the link , I have all the originals right here in my files .
Did n't anyone think it an odd move for Sequoia to " publically " hire , thus exposing , a man who had had been writing their programs across the country for years ?
NJ has a big trial coming up with Sequoia , interesting again they have dead scape - ghost in place .
And just for the record , MGs mother was Japanese .
As a child , she would tell him the stories of her country , passed down through the generations .
He named his company in honor of her .
Jungs theory of synchronicity is an interesting read .

Faye Warren - here are a couple of articles that refute your position regarding calibration : Report : ES&S Voting Machines Can Be Maliciously Calibrated to Favor Specific Candidates Touchscreen voting machines at the center of recent vote - flipping reports can be easily and maliciously recalibrated in the field to favor one candidate in a race , according to a report prepared by computer scientists for the state of Ohio . ...
" If one candidate has a check box in one place and a different candidate has it in a different place , you can set it up so that if you press on one candidate it gets recorded for another candidate , " said Matt Blaze , a computer scientist at the University of Pennsylvania who led one of three teams that co-wrote the report ( . pdf ) last year .
" But if you press on the other candidate , it gets recorded correctly for that candidate .
You can make it work perfectly normally in most of the screen , but have it behave the way you want in small parts of it . " ... Blaze said the calibration function on the ES&S machine is n't password - protected , making it easy for a poll worker --- or even a voter --- to access the calibration menu in the middle of an election using a PEB device ( Personalized Electronic Ballot ) , which election officials insert in a port on the face of the machine .
A PEB might be stolen or purchased online , or an intruder can simulate a PEB by using a Palm Pilot or other handheld device with an infrared port .
With no more than a minute 's access to a voting machine , someone could recalibrate the screen , and to observers the action would be indistinguishable from the normal behavior of a voter in front of a machine or of a poll worker starting up a machine in the morning , said Blaze , who discusses the issue on his blog .

Since Elections are such High Stakes events and gaming the machines or central tabulators can result in millions of stolen [ flipped ] votes opposed to the few that could be stolen via paper ballots - we are absolute morons if we accept this method for vote casting .

Kira ,
Thanks for your input .
My knowledge is only of Sequoias machines .
Which is password protected ... on several levels .
I agree , ES&S is the bottom of the barrel with Premier ( Diebold ) running close beside .
IMO , it 's easier to have the machines working properly , use a couple of sleezy poll workers and get votes entered that will come off looking legit .
I watched this happened in the hot run-off elections in Cook County last year .
So , here I am in Illinois , just outside of Cook County ... I have 4 legitmate registration cards for voting sent to my home .... I am the only resident .
Do we have a problem here ?
How many times should I vote today ?
Well , multiple that out , incredible .
It 's not just screwed up machines , this whole system needs to be overhauled .

I heartily agree with you , Faye .
This year I received 4 Voter Information Guides even though I 'm the only registered voter .
I guess that 's not exactly the same as registration cards , but still ... I was wondering the same thing .
Why did I get 4 sent on the same day ???
I 'm thinking this year the mess is being reported throughout the media - unlike the years before where there was a nearly complete blackout on voting machine issues - so we need to start carrying petitions around our neighborhoods to get rid of the machines .
It 's not just screwed up machines , this whole system needs to be overhauled .
- I totally agree .
