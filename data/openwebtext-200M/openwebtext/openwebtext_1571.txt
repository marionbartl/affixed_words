Park Avenue is no place to raise a family — of ducks , anyway .
A mother mallard , who built her nest on a traffic island in the middle of the busy thoroughfare , panicked and abandoned her 11 ducklings when well - meaning New Yorkers tried to help her web - footed little legion reach safety yesterday .
She flew frantically between East 68th and 69th streets , loudly squawking as her babies , unable to follow her , quacked in near unison below .
Then she disappeared .
The mother and her ducklings were first spotted heading north from the nest at 68th Street between the traffic islands just before 10 a.m .
“ The mother jumped into the tulips , but her babies could n’t make the jump , ” said Valeria Anzolin , 27 , who works at the Italian Cultural Institute across the street .
“ So I used my newspaper , and I picked up four of the babies and put them with their mother . ”

DUCK FAMILY RESCUED
Mama duck may have chosen the tony Upper East Side address thinking it would protect her eggs from predators , but she clearly did n’t anticipate the chaos that would ensue when the fluffy little yellow and brown cuties hatched .
“ Fortunately , this duck had connections , and was able to count on the good offices of the Parks Department , ” Commissioner Adrian Benepe said .
City Park Rangers Sheridan Roberts and Sgt. Sunny Corrao came up with a plan to lure back the mama duck after she flew off .
They put some of the babies in a basket in the hopes they would call their mother .
It took until 2 p.m. to regain the mother ’s trust .
The rangers then carried the basket of ducklings west on 68th Street .
The mallard matriarch followed them , as pedestrians , including one carrying a net , spurred her on and truck drivers held back traffic .
Thirteen minutes later , the mom was led over the Central Park wall and the ducklings were all released .
The rangers slowly guided the family through the park , and they all jumped into The Lake near The Boathouse .
“ I have done this every year for three years now , ” Corrao said .
“ Park Avenue is pretty , but it ’s not the best place to have baby ducks . ”

LSD and Ecstasy being used to combat cancer anxiety and post - traumatic stress disorder
[ caption ]
Hallucinogenic drugs including LSD and Ecstasy are being used by doctors in tests to treat conditions including cancer anxiety and post - traumatic stress disorder .
Scientists are once again striving to prove that psychedelic drugs can be of medical benefit more than four decades after authorities clamped down on their use for both recreational and research purposes .
There are a handful of studies currently taking place across the U.S. with drugs like LSD , MDMA ( Ecstasy ) and psilocybin , the main ingredient of ' magic mushrooms ' .
While the research is still preliminary , early results from a New York University study suggest that participants are less fearful of death and have less general anxiety .
They are also said to have greater acceptance of the dying process with no major side effect .
Rick Doblin , executive director of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies , said : ' There is now more psychedelic research taking place in the world than at any time in the last 40 years .
' We 're at the end of the beginning of the renaissance . '
He said that more than 1,200 people attended a conference in California last weekend on psychedelic science .
But doing the research is not easy , Mr Doblin and others say , with U.S. government funders still leery and drug companies not interested in the compounds they can't patent .
That pretty much leaves private donors .
' There 's still a lot of resistance to it , ' said David Nichols , a Purdue University professor of medicinal chemistry and president of the Heffter Institute , which is supporting the NYU study .
' The whole hippie thing in the 60s has kind of left a bad taste in the mouth of the public at large .
' When you tell people you 're treating people with psychedelics , the first thing that comes to mind is Day - Glo art and tie - dyed shirts . '
Psilocybin has been shown to invoke powerful spiritual experiences during the four to six hours it affects the brain .
A study published in 2008 , in fact , found that even 14 months after healthy volunteers had taken a single dose , most said they were still feeling and behaving better because of the experience .
They also said the drug had produced one of the five most spiritually significant experiences they 'd ever had .
Experts emphasise people should n't try psilocybin on their own because it can be harmful , sometimes causing bouts of anxiety and paranoia .
But the NYU study , led by Dr Stephen Ross , is testing whether that drug experience can help with the nine months of psychotherapy each participant also gets .
The therapy seeks to help patients live fuller , richer lives with the time they have left .
Each study participant gets two drug - dose experiences , but only one of those involves psilocybin ; the other is a placebo dose of niacin , which makes the face flush .
All three people in the study so far felt better , with less general anxiety and fear of death , and greater acceptance of the dying process , Dr Ross said .
No major side effects have appeared .
The project plans to enrol a total of 32 people .
Dr Ross ' work follows up on a small study at the University of California in Los Angeles .
Results have n't been published yet , but they too are encouraging , according to experts familiar with it .
Yet another study of psilocybin for cancer anxiety , at Johns Hopkins University , has treated 11 out of a planned 44 participants so far .
Chief investigator Roland Griffiths said he suspected the results would fall in line with the UCLA work .
In interviews , some psychiatrists who work with cancer patients reacted coolly to the prospects of using psilocybin .
' I 'm kind of curious about it , ' said Dr. Susan Block of the Dana - Farber Cancer Institute in Boston .
She said it 's an open question how helpful the drug experiences could be , and ' I do n't think it 's ever going to be a widely used treatment . '
Dr Ross , meanwhile , thinks patients might benefit from more than one dose of the drug during the psychotherapy .
The study permits only one dose , but all three participants asked for a second , he said .
If you 've been following the electoral politics of the marriage equality movement , the National Organization for Marriage would certainly ring a bell .
NOM , with the aid of substantial funding from Mormon and Catholic churches and organizations , was the organization primarily responsible for passing Proposition 8 in California and approving Question 1 in Maine , both of which eliminated the legal right for same - sex couples to marry in their respective states .
In each case , the campaign tactics used were despicable : both campaigns sought to convince the electorate that legalizing same - sex marriage would lead to second - graders being recruited into a lifestyle of sodomy and depravity .
Because of these higher - profile successes , NOM now has a reputation for being an organization focused primarily on pulling the long arc of history away from its inevitable pursuit of marital justice for the GLBT community .
But the truth behind NOM is far more sinister .
As evidence , let 's examine a project of NOM called The Ruth Institute .
The way the NOM homepage describes the Ruth Institute is innocuous enough :
Creating an intellectual and social climate favorable to marriage on college campuses .
The initial reaction to this idea might be somewhere in the neighborhood of " good luck . "
But delving a little deeper reveals a more interesting agenda .
First , let 's take a look at the basics .
As any marketer knows , the most public face that an organization has rests in two things : its name and its logo .
Now , one would think that an organization dedicated exclusively to promoting marriage between one man and one woman would feature in its logo some rendition of a happy , heterosexual married couple -- something along the lines of the Yes on Prop 8 campaign logo .
The Ruth Institute logo , by contrast , is n't that .
It is , rather , a graphic design comprised of women wearing old - fashioned dresses .
And if that were n't a clue to the organization 's real intent of turning back the clock a couple of centuries on the women 's liberation movement , the name ought to be .
In Scripture , the Book of Ruth is one of only two ( or three , depending on whom you ask ) biblical books named after a woman .
A quick and dirty plot synopsis : A Moabite woman named Ruth marries an Israelite man , but he dies , leaving her a widow .
Her Israelite mother - in - law entreats her to return home , but her loyalty to her husband 's family is so strong that she follows her mother - in - law back to Bethlehem , converts to the God of Israel and works the fields of a man named Boaz , who happens to be a relative of her deceased husband .
Because Boaz is a relative , he has the right ( and obligation ) to marry her to continue on her deceased relative 's family line ( this is important : keep this in mind ) .
Ruth reminds him of this obligation and goes to " visit " him , but Boaz must first confer with another male relative to decide who gets her .
The other male relative relinquishes his right , clearing the field for Boaz .
Their resulting children are the ancestors of King David .
In short , we have an organization seemingly named after a biblical woman who maintains loyalty to her husband 's family over her own , even after his death , and encourages one of his relatives to marry her specifically to carry on the family line .
And indeed , the organization 's publicly self - expressed vision seems to support this narrative of the ideal woman and the ideal marriage :
Returning to the virtues on this list is what the Ruth Institute claims will eliminate all of today 's social evils .
Hard to argue , right ?
After all , everyone knows that back when men's contributions to the family were respected and spousal " cooperation " determined how women balanced career and family obligations , we had no social ills in this country , everything was just peachy !
But this is n't what the Ruth Institute is all about .
To get at what Ruth - - and the National Organization for Marriage -- is really all about , you have to go to the information that 's not publicly available .
I recently received from an anonymous source a scanned document of an internal communication from the Ruth Institute : their strategic plan for the years 2010 - 2013 .
The entire thing ( uploaded to Scribd ) is worth reading in its entirety , but I want to call specific attention to the stated goals of the organization near the end of section II :
It aims to work hand - in - hand with other organizations in the marriage movement to : Decrease the divorce rate
Increase the marriage rate
Decrease the cohabitation rate < / li< li>Increase the number of children who grow up with both married parents
Reduce the lag time between the age of sexual initiation and the age of first marriage
Maintain at least a replacement - level birth rate , so that the devastation of a European - style " demographic winter " is avoided [ emphasis mine ]
First - -" sexual initiation ? " Seriously ?
It 's as if these people view sex as some sort of cult ritual .
But at last , we come down to what the main issue of what the Ruth Institute is all about .
Remember the earlier discussion about carrying on the family line ?
The real mission of the Ruth Institute is to erase the gains that women have made with regard to their social , economic and sexual liberation and ensure that they become baby factories like something out of Margaret Atwood 's Handmaid 's Tale .
And what is the concept of " demographic winter " ?
A right - wing notion with culturalist , if not racist , overtones regarding the end of first - world civilization because of declining birthrates .
There 's even a documentary about it , put out in part by the Ruth Institute 's christianist allies at the Family Research Council .
Righter - wing governments in Europe , such as that of Berlusconi's Italy , have offered economic incentives to the " right type of Italians " to conceive children -- and have notoriously taken them away when it was discovered that some of them were going to the wrong people - - namely , immigrant families .
But if you thought that the Ruth Institute would be content to let women have children on their own time -- say , using techniques like fertility treatments or artificial insemination - - you 're wrong .
Two of the top featured articles at the Ruth Institute 's website -- this one and this one -- openly decry these practices .
The only way women ought to have children , if you ask the Ruth Institute , is if a man is present to control the situation .
And there you have it .
The Ruth Insitute -- officially sanctioned by the National Organization of Marriage -- is an organization with an overtly sexist and racist organization .
And I 'll leave you with some final words from .
Dr. Jennifer Roback Morse , President of the Ruth Institute :
We hear that intelligent women should use their minds , by giving priority to career .
Taking care of children is for losers with nothing better to do .
We hear that independent women should not rely on men financially .
It is better to have a child alone , or to be childless , than to be financially interdependent with the child ’s father .
We hear there is no urgency to having children .
If you have n’t found a husband , if you have n’t made the time to become a mother naturally , you can always use artificial insemination with donor sperm , to become a mother at the time of your own choosing .
If we accept these ideas , we lose essential features of being a female human : an appreciation of woman ’s natural life - giving powers , of woman ’s desire for lasting relationships , and of woman ’s intrinsic delight in bringing forth new life .
Welcome to the future , handmaids .

Considered one of the foremost examples of this Old World style available in the American craft beer market , Stone Imperial Russian Stout is thick , rich and complex .
Nearly jet black with a fluffy hot chocolate - colored head , a goblet held to the sky could block out the sun .
This obsidian wonder is also adept at eclipsing palates , smothering taste buds with a sensory overload of flavors .
Dark chocolate and heavy roast come on strong up front and are granted graceful support by nuances of toast , anise , juniper berry , pepper , sassafras , molasses and more .
It ’s a symphony in a glass , where every member of the troupe is properly tuned to produce one outstanding symbiotic performance .
We ran into some trouble years ago with labeling Stone Imperial Russian Stout as what it was — an imperial Russian stout .
It started in late 2002 , when the TTB , in reviewing our label application , contended that the word Russian was misleading .
They thought it would confuse customers into thinking that the beer was brewed in Russia , despite all of the text being in English and the label clearly stating , " Brewed and bottled by the Stone Brewing Co. , San Marcos , San Diego County , CA . "
Find out more about the story of this beer 's name on the blog .
ABC managing director Mark Scott has gone on the attack over a column in The Australian by Mark Day , which raised the idea of the corporation being sold off .
It is the latest salvo in a war of words between Mr Scott and the News Limited organisation over the changing role of the ABC .
Mr Day used the recently announced BBC rollback to raise the argument that in the new media age the ABC should look to do the same .
" The news that the BBC is to scale back its operations and ease its competitive stance against its commercial rivals prompts the immediate question : should the ABC do the same ? " he wrote .
In a piece for ABC News Online 's The Drum , Mr Scott hit back at the column , defending the public broadcaster 's role in the Australian media landscape .
" About 90 per cent of the population believe the ABC is providing a valuable service , delivering on its charter to inform , educate and entertain , " he wrote .
" Australia has been richly served by a dual system of public broadcasting working alongside commercial media . "
Central to Mr Day 's column was the argument that the ABC 's role was to fill niches commercial outlets did not cover .
" It is time we had a full debate about the role of the ABC .
It was established in a vastly different media landscape as a taxpayer - funded entity designed to , in part , fill in the market niches not served by the commercial sector , " he wrote .
" Now , thanks to pay - TV and the digital revolution , those niches are hotly contested . "
But Mr Scott rejects this claim , maintaining the corporation has always played a central role in broadcasting in Australia .
" There is a concerted attempt to portray the ABC 's role in the media as solely that of a niche provider - participating only in sections of the market not served by the commercial sector , " he said .
" There 's nothing new in the ABC being in the competition for public attention - its role has never been to simply provide programs that commercial media have rejected . "
' Act of negligence '
He says any such arguments are motivated by organisations struggling with the demands of the 21st century media environment .
" Threatened by the pace of change , the inflexibility of their own business models and their reluctance to invest , the critics now demand that the ABC pull back , " he wrote .
" The audience does n't seem to feature in these arguments and the blatantly commercial agendas on display simply reinforce the need for a strong independent media voice . "
He also highlighted the performance of US media companies , which operate without state - run competitors , to rebut arguments the ABC should bow out to aid struggling organisations .
" Mr Day 's assertion that the ABC should be weakened or destroyed to prevent it causing ' havoc ' among commercial rivals , ignores the fact that the US is the media sector where ' legacy ' companies are most at threat - and the US does not have a major television public broadcaster like the ABC or the BBC . " he wrote .
" How reckless would it be for Australia to stop funding a credible independent news service to somehow prop up business models that may continue to struggle in any event ?
It would be an act of negligence and Australia 's news media and public discourse would be all the poorer for it . "
Mr Scott said it was important the ABC provide a voice that was not governed by commercial interests .
" We are not simply driven by decisions about whether we can make money out of our investment in news , Australian content and specialist programming .
In fact , making money does n't come into our thinking at all , " he said .
" We are about fulfilling our charter and delivering for audiences . "

Interchange of the Week
Monday , 2 October 2000 I -490 , I - 590 & NY 590 , Rochester :
The " Can of Worms " full - size image ( 337 KB ) is also available .
Orientation : I - 490 runs left to right .
I -590 enters at bottom left , changes to NY 590 at the double overpass ( center ) , and leaves at top right .
NY 96 ( East Avenue ) runs from bottom right to top left , passing over I -590 and under I -490 simultaneously .
University Avenue enters at extreme top left , ending at a split at East Avenue .
Winton Road is the diagonal north - south road at top left .
The brown line is the CSX railroad mainline .
Exit numbers :
This interchange marks Exit 21 on I -490 and Exit 5 on I -590 and NY 590 .
Half of I -490's Exit 20 is also within this interchange complex .
The interchange :
This interchange is familiarly called the " Can of Worms " , a name first applied to the original interchange at this location ( see bottom photo ) .
This was completely reconstructed between 1987 and 1991 , resulting in the configuration shown above .
The right - of - way limits of the old interchange are still visible in this picture , as is the embankment which once carried the ramp from I - 490 WB to NY 590 NB , just to the right of the present ramp .
The new version provides semi-directional flyovers for all freeway connections , only one of which is a left - exit ( from NY 590 SB ) .
The " offset " configuration stems from I -590 and NY 590 having originally been completely separate roadways , each ending at I -490 in a directional T - interchange .
Through traffic at that time had to enter I -490 , weave through its traffic , and exit again on the opposite side .
The weaving problems of the old interchange are not eliminated , but greatly reduced and relocated to lesser traffic locations .
A weaving section now exists on I -490 EB , between the ramp from NY 590 SB and Exit 22 ( Penfield Road ) .
Another exists on I - 490 WB , between the ramp from NY 590 SB and Exit 20 , which is the ramp to University Avenue .
Yet another exists on NY 590 NB , between the ramp from I - 490 WB and Exit 6 ( Blossom Road ) , partially visible at the top of the picture .
Notice that , to avoid another weave , and to allow enough distance for a gentle climb to the flyover , the ramps from NY 590 SB are not available from the Blossom Road onramp .
This is one of two connections that was sacrificed in the new design .
Local connections : Connections to and from local streets are also part of this complex .
The half - interchange with Winton Road at the far left is part of I - 490 Exit 20 , comprising the eastbound offramp and westbound onramp .
The westbound offramp is located within the Can of Worms itself , crossing over East Avenue and joining University Avenue up the middle as it splits to intersect East Avenue .
( This left entrance , either by design or happy accident , facilitates access to Winton Road and East Avenue from University . )
In the old design , this connection was by means of individual ramps from I -490 and NY 590 ; now , a single ramp serves both .
The corresponding eastbound onramp for Exit 20 comes off of East Avenue and joins the ramp coming from NY 590 SB , which then merges into I -490 .
Note that access from this entrance is not possible to NY 590 NB , but it was possible in the previous version , again by means of individual ramps .
This is probably the most serious flaw in the new design , as motorists wishing to make this connection must travel along surface streets to Blossom Road , or take I -490 east to Exit 22 and make a U - turn there .
( Connections of East Avenue and Winton Road with I - 590 , to and from the south , are also unavailable , but this has always been the case .
These connections are made at Exit 4 [ Highland Avenue ] , just off the bottom of the picture . )
Complexities :
There are a number of complexities that contribute to this interchange to make it unique .
First is the fact that it is traversed by a major railroad , which passes over some roadways and under others , in this as in the original configuration .
The required additional overpasses added to the visual tangle that originally inspired the interchange 's nickname .
What today is a small railroad spur just north of University Avenue was once a branch running south from the mainline ; it too had to pass through the old interchange , but was abandoned by the time of the reconstruction , simplifying the new design .
( Its old right - of - way can be traced here , along the left side of the large white building [ a tennis club ] and crossing I -490 at about the point where the ramp from I - 590 NB to I - 490 WB does today . )
Second , several side streets are in close proximity to the highway .
Gould Street , to the right of the tennis club , used to extend farther north to intersect East Avenue literally in the median of I -490 .
East Highland Drive , to the immediate right of I - 590 , had been a dead - end street at the concrete block supply yard .
It was extended to East Avenue ( see how tightly it curves between I - 590 and the tennis club ) as part of the reconstruction , and Gould Street was truncated to end at it .
A small cemetery ( the triangular green patch at left center ) , formerly tight against the soundwall , was given more breathing space with the rebuilding .
Still hard by the freeway are a cluster of businesses on the south side of East Avenue east of Winton Road , and a group of industries between University Avenue and the railroad .
A most impressive feature of this design was the ability to perform such a major overhaul with minimal disruption to these surrounding features ; in fact , the new interchange fits almost perfectly within the space of the old , while still meeting higher modern design standards .
However , the resultant confinement is very apparent on the ground : often , a truck on the ramp from I - 590 NB to I - 490 WB appears headed directly at eastbound traffic on East Avenue below .
The old interchange :
This photo is looking east over the original Can of Worms , shortly after its completion .
At that time ( mid -1960's ) , I -590 and NY 590 had not yet been designated ; both were instead part of old NY 47 until 1980 .
Notice that there were two separate directional T - interchanges with I -490 , and serious weave conditions existed for through traffic in either direction on both I -490 and NY 47 .
I - 490 had a spread median to accomodate the left - hand ramps , and the eastbound direction was elevated significantly above the westbound , passing over what the latter passed under .
Also note that University Avenue did not end at East Avenue , but continued closely parallel to it , intersecting both I -490 and NY 47 to and from the north via the split ramps discussed above .

It seems we 're always learning something new about slime molds , the bizarre roaming cell - colonies where countless biological principles can be found writ in miniature .
Here 's a point - by - point breakdown of why the slime mold deserves your respect .
Advertisement
Slime molds fascinate biologists because they 're essentially swarms of single - celled creatures that can coalesce to act as one larger organism .
Your basic slime mold is a one - celled unit , not very different from an amoeba .
However , when activated by a chemical signal , the individual cells can come together to form a supercell — a largish , sometimes meters - long mass that creeps across the ground in search of nutrients .
In their multicellular states , slime molds can look like mushrooms , puddles , and any number of other things .
When mobile , they 've been observed to move at more than a millimeter per second — not bad for a team of cells just looking to satisfy their hunger .

But slime molds are n't just interesting for the " wandering slicks of goop " factor ; they have much to teach us , too .
In January , we discovered that slime molds are at least as good at urban planning as the civil engineers who designed Tokyo 's subways .
Here are some more surprising things we 've learned from slime molds in recent years .

They reflect systems the world over .
Whatever the laws that let masses of slime - mold cells respond as one to changes in their environment , Ted Cox believes they apply to cells in countless other places , including our bodies .
" It 's a unifying theory of excitable systems , " Cox , a biologist at Princeton , told Wired recently .
Slime molds linked in a supercell can communicate with each other in the same way that our brain cells collude to release neurotransmitters , in the same way that nutrient levels are regulated in the womb , in the same way that communicable diseases jump from person to person .
If we figure out the exact mechanisms by which slime molds talk to each other , it could explain vast amounts about life at the higher levels .
They can control robots .
In 2006 , a team at the University of Southampton grew a slime mold on top of a circuit in the shape of a six - pointed star .
The circuit was then mapped to a small six - legged robot that sat a few feet away .
Once that was done , the movements of the slime mold were echoed in the movements of the robot .
Slime molds avoid light if they can , so when the slime mold was exposed to light and tried to move away , the robot scrambled around , mimicking the slime mold 's attempt to find a comfortable dark space .

They have brains , sort of .
In 2008 , scientists at Hokkaido University had slime mold cells crawl across a petri dish .
For ten minutes at the top of every hour , the scientists generated cold , dry conditions in the lab , causing the slime cells to slow down until the dish had warmed up again .
After three hours of this , the researchers stopped changing the lab temperature , but the slime molds continued to slow down on their own , right on schedule , in anticipation of the cold .
The scientists then kept conditions stable for a few hours , and the slime molds eventually adjusted , maintaining a steady pace .
But when the researchers dropped the temperature again , the slime molds remembered and resumed the ten - minutes - every - hour pattern .
The report concluded that the slime molds were demonstrating " a primitive version of brain function " — impressive for organisms without a brain .
They can't be stopped .
A 2007 gardening column at the Chicago Tribune notes that " there is no way to prevent slime molds ; the spores are all over the place , just waiting for the right conditions to become active . "
Pattern - learning , robot - controlling mobile slime units that can form at a moment 's notice ?
We do n't know about you , but this is the best news we 've heard all day .

The interrogations are a good story - telling mechanic but never really feel like a game .
It 's more engaging than a cutscene and roughing up a terrorist has its own simple appeal .
However , all the player is really doing here is walking over to objects in the room and pressing a single button .
There 's no challenge there .
Your presence is all that 's required to keep the scene going .
Unlike previous games , Fisher is n't as concerned with limiting casualties or avoiding detection .
There 's only maybe two sequences where you 're not allowed to be spotted by enemies .
Therefore you can be as sloppy and violent as you want , as long as you can survive the onslaught of guards .
Sam 's health regenerates but he can't take as many hits as his enemies , some of whom are wearing full body armor .
Furthermore , only a handful of guns can be upgraded with scopes ( you can zoom in only slightly with unscoped weapons ) so long - distance sniping is n't a viable option .
While it can look and feel at times like a third - person shooter , you 're not rewarded for playing it like one .
Instead , you 're better off killing enemies silently .
Manually headshots with silenced weapons work but the best way to clear a room is with the new Mark and Execute feature .
After performing a hand - to - hand kill , Fisher earns an execute , the ability to instantly kill multiple foes at once .
The max number you can kill varies from two to four , depending on what weapon you 're using .
You tag the enemies with the right shoulder button and an arrow icon appears above their head .
When they 're within range of an execute , that arrow becomes red .
Press Y and Fisher will cap the marked enemies with a series of headshots in slow motion .
It allows you to kill a group of foes without one of them raising the alarm .
While you can mark and execute enemies even after they 've seen you , planning your attack in advance works best .
You can mark enemies if you do n't have an execute , or if you only see them through use of gadgets .
Let 's say you 're outside of a room with four guys in it and you 're lacking an execute .
You can mark up the three that are further away with your snake cam , then run into the room and hand - to - hand kill the closest .
As his friends start to react , you unleash the execute you just earned .
The game displays ample visual cues to allow the player to understand the stealth system .
When you 're safely in the shadows , the game 's graphics go from color to black and white with occasional highlights ( enemies are in full color , for example ) .
The game employs a cover system and when you want to sneak to another piece of cover , the game will indicate exactly where you 'll slide to with an arrow based on where you 're aiming .
When you 're visible to an enemy , a white circle will appear on screen with an arrow indicating the direction of the person who spot you .
If you stay in sight , this arrow narrows ( quickly or slowly , depending on how visible you are ) until the circle turns red and you 're detected .
After being detected , a ghost image of Sam appears in the spot where you were found .
This indicates where enemies think you are and helps you formulate flanking strategies .
These little graphical touches probably help the learning process for newbies but even stealth game vets have to agree that these are helpful aids .
What 's weird about 's stealth , though , is that you can no longer hide dead bodies .
You can take an enemy hostage and drag him to a more secluded location but this workaround is unnecessary save for the two situations where you 're not allowed to be detected .
To compensate for the lack of corpse hiding , Ubisoft made guards ' reaction to dead bodies very muted .
They 'll something to the effect of , " Oh crap ! " and begin to sweep the area but they 're not as freaked out as you would 've expected .
Were I a faceless henchman who found my comrade dead in the middle of our base , I 'd probably raise some sort of alarm and try to round up as many of my friends as possible to find the intruder .
It takes a lot of prodding to get the guards that riled up , though .
While I would n't say they 're smart , the enemies at least show a bit of thought .
In an extended battle they start to lose their shit , kind of like their counterparts in .
They fire at your ghost image 's location , taunt you to come out , and sweep their flashlight - mounted guns around erratically to try and spot you .
While they 'll often move to intercept you , sometimes they 'll hang back and wait for you to attack .
It 's tough to get excited over the A.I. for a foe that 's standing still but it 's preferable to having enemies march into your traps single file like Lemmings .
There 's enough intelligence in these henchmen to keep you from using one trick over and over .
The gadgets you 'll use are pretty close to the selection from previousinstallments .
Sam 's no longer a Third Echelon agent but he manages to get his hands on most of his old favorites like EMP grenades and sticky cameras .
The primary difference is that , because no one 's telling you not to kill people , there 's no need for you to have non-lethal takedown items like tranquilizer darts .
While the developers toy with the idea of Sam being a more " low tech " spy - in the first mission , he uses a mirror he yanked from a car to look under doors - they never commit to that vision .
The sonar goggles , replacing the infrared / night vision goggles from previous games , are bound to be a controversial addition .
The goggle send out pulse of sounds that detect nearby structures and , more importantly , enemies .
While this sounds like an " I Win " button , it 's not as unbalanced as you 'd expect .
The information being sent through the goggles becomes distorted if you move quickly and you 're unable to see whether you 're in the shadows or not .
Furthermore , you 're not the only one with these goggles .
In a few spots you 'll fight enemies who also have them , resulting in very tense encounters where you 're forced to keep moving in order to avoid being hunted down .'s single - player campaign , about five to six hours , is n't as good as the gameplay mechanics would dictate .
Though the game 's premise would indicate a more personal or emotional storyline about Sam , the plot quickly turns toward boilerplate spy novel gibberish about mercenaries , weapons of mass destruction , government agencies , and the like .
The game takes very awkward turns to accomodate this story .
In order to introduce us to a new character , we 're forced to plod through a third - person shooter - style flashback level in Iraq that 's bereft of all stealth and the mark / execute system .
To listen in on the bad guy 's plot , there 's a level where you hack into a security camera and watch two characters having a conversation .
Seriously , that 's the level - you point a camera at them and watch them talk .
In order to explain the last pieces of the plot , Ubisoft decides to make the final scene of the game a face - to - face conversation between Fisher and the main villain .
It 's a pseudo - cutscene and a poor way to cap off the game .
Fortunately , is a lot more than just Fisher 's story .
The game has a full suite of two - player multiplayer modes .
The most prominent is a prequel co-op campaign that 's comparable in length to the single - player outing .
Archer and Kestrel , an American and Russian agent , team up to track down three warheads being sold on the black market .
This , and the other multiplayer modes can be played online or locally through system link or split - screen .
The Achievement - like challenges you complete in any mode ( such as " Kill three or more enemies with a frag grenade " ) earn you points for unlocking weapons and upgrades for use across all modes .
While the co-op story 's no more coherent than that of the single - player , the co-op campaign does n't allow itself to be driven off a cliff by plot demands .
It sticks to the coreexperience : sneaking around and killing lots of people in the process .
The same can be said of the Hunter and Last Stand game modes , which feature the maps from co-op as well as a couple new ones .
In Hunter , your objective is to kill all of the guards in a series of zones within the map .
If the guards raise the alarm , ten more of their comrades will flood into that zone .
Last Stand , meanwhile , has you and a friend defending an EMP device from waves of enemies .
Playing with another person adds another layer to the gameplay .
Stalking hapless guards is more fun with a partner , too .
You can pull off dual executes , in which you join together to shoot down marked targets .
Executing from two different vantage points means you no longer have to wait for guards to become closely grouped to kill them in one fell swoop .
The mission ends if your partner dies so you have to watch each other 's backs .
Even if one of you is about to die , though , there 's still cooperation at work .
If you get wounded , you can sit up and take potshots at enemies while waiting for your partner to revive you .
When an enemy gets you in a chokehold , you can elbow him to give you partner a clear shot at him .
Though youplay online , I 'd highly recommend local multiplayer .
While playing over Xbox Live I experienced many disconnects .
When this happens while playing the co-op campaign , you 'll lose all of your progress on the current mission .
You can also play Hunter and Last Stand maps by yourself but unfortunately no such option exists for the campaign .
Designing a bot that could effectively play this game alongside you must be a daunting and / or time - consuming task .
There 's another reason why I 'd suggest local multiplayer besides connection issues , though .
The fact is , playing with a friend is going to go a lot smoother than playing with some random guy through matchmaking .
Co-op stealth requires a bit more coordination and patience than you 'd need in , say , .
In the first segment of the second co-op campaign mission , you fail if you 're spotted by the guards .
Imagine doing that with a newbie , much less one without a headset .'s lack of team - based competitive multiplayer is what will likely frustrate fans the most .
The only competitive mode in the game is Face - Off , a 1v1 match where two players try to rack up higher scores by killing waves of enemies and each other .
It 's hard not to view this as a step backward from 's Spies vs. Mercenaries multiplayer , in which one team tried to infiltrate a base and retrieve encrypted files while the other team tried to stop them .'s inability to offer up something similiar , if not better , is a blow to the game 's replayability .
Neither long - timefans nor hardcore shooter devotees will be completely pleased with .
The former group will be frustrated by what 's been cut from previous games while the latter will realize that , thoughlooks a lot like a shooter , it 's a stealth - action game at its heart .
Still , if you belong to either group and enjoy co-op , this game has a lot to offer you .

The Web is a teeming commercial city .
It ’s haphazardly planned .
Its public spaces are mobbed , and signs of urban decay abound in broken links and abandoned projects .
Malware and spam have turned living conditions in many quarters unsafe and unsanitary .
Bullies and hucksters roam the streets .
An entrenched population of rowdy , polyglot rabble seems to dominate major sites .
People who find the Web distasteful — ugly , uncivilized — have nonetheless been forced to live there : it ’s the place to go for jobs , resources , services , social life , the future .
But now , with the purchase of an iPhone or an iPad , there ’s a way out , an orderly suburb that lets you sample the Web ’s opportunities without having to mix with the riffraff .
This suburb is defined by apps from the glittering App Store : neat , cute homes far from the Web city center , out in pristine Applecrest Estates .
In the migration of dissenters from the “ open ” Web to pricey and secluded apps , we ’re witnessing urban decentralization , suburbanization and the online equivalent of white flight .
The parallels between what happened to cities like Chicago , Detroit and New York in the 20th century and what ’s happening on the Internet since the introduction of the App Store are striking .
Like the great modern American cities , the Web was founded on equal parts opportunism and idealism .
Over the years , nerds , students , creeps , outlaws , rebels , moms , fans , church mice , good - time Charlies , middle managers , senior citizens , starlets , presidents and corporate predators all made their home on the Web .
In spite of a growing consensus about the dangers of Web vertigo and the importance of curation , there were surprisingly few “ walled gardens ” online — like the one Facebook purports to ( but does not really ) represent .
But a kind of virtual redlining is now under way .
The Webtropolis is being stratified .
Even if , like most people , you still surf the Web on a desktop or laptop , you will have noticed pay walls , invitation - only clubs , subscription programs , privacy settings and other ways of creating tiers of access .
All these things make spaces feel “ safe ” — not only from viruses , instability , unwanted light and sound , unrequested porn , sponsored links and pop-up ads , but also from crude design , wayward and unregistered commenters and the eccentric ­voices and images that make the Web constantly surprising , challenging and enlightening .
The UK stock market has for many years been a haven of interest for overseas companies and overseas investors due in the main to its " light touch regulations " and free market policy .
However , it is becoming more and more apparent that regulations will need to tighten in the short term and indeed we could see a reduction in the freedom afforded to investors , investment companies and businesses in the UK market .
So is the UK finally turning its back on a free market policy ?
There is no doubt that the Labour Party , under the guise of the proposed " Cadbury law " , is looking to reduce the number of overseas takeovers of UK companies .
There are growing concerns this will have a knock - on effect to other investment markets around the world with the likes of the US unlikely to allow UK companies to take over their own operations while US operations are blocked from taking over UK companies .
The past success of the UK investment arena is in the view of many people down to the fact that freedom has been given within a light touch regulatory framework which prior to the credit crunch seemed to work very well .
Whether we are now " throwing out the baby with the bathwater " is debatable but wholesale change in the UK investment arena could have massive consequences for the future .
Those bulky , bulletproof vests could become a thing of the past .
Their replacement : Your T - shirt , but with a special coating .
Bulletproofing can be done in one of two ways .
The first , old - school approach relies on hard plates of metal or ceramic , which deflect oncoming bullets .
A more elegant way , perhaps , is the use of a network of fibers – the approach taken by Kevlar – to “ catch ” the bullet , much like a hockey goalie catches a flying puck .
Kevlar has made its mark in body armor , as the technology is used in vests , helmets , and other gear for law enforcement , corrections officers and the military .
However , it ’s expensive , which limits its use to those who can drop hundreds of dollars for protection .
The new technology , which also relies on the catching method , addresses these issues by using an inexpensive material and a simple process – a feat that could bring body armor to the masses , according to Xiaodong Li of the University of South Carolina and study researcher .
Here ’s how it works :
By dipping pieces of cotton from a T - shirt into a solution of boron powder , the researchers created a network of nanowires made out of boron carbide – the third hardest material known to man at room temperature .
The new T - shirt body armor probably wo n’t compete with the Kevlar - type technologies , but it could be useful for situations in which less protection is sufficient .
" We should be able to fabricate much tougher body armors using this new technique , " Li said .
" It could even be used to produce lightweight , fuel - efficient cars and aircrafts . "
Li and his team detailed their findings in the April 6 issue of the journal Advanced Materials .
The blessings of war are few , but one hard - won result of the nation ’s conflicts is expertise in accounting for the dead .
The Revolutionary War , the War of 1812 and the Mexican War together claimed some 58,000 lives , on and off the battlefield .
But lax records and hasty on - site burials meant the number of unknown fatalities from those formative American wars remains a mystery .
Record - keeping improved with the Civil War , still the nation ’s deadliest conflict .
But because the conflict involved millions of men , shifting fronts and hurried burials , the percentage of soldiers who went to their graves without names is astounding .
One in four were never identified .
Determined to do better , the United States fielded specialty teams to recover and identify its fallen soldiers and sailors from the Spanish - American War , bringing thousands home from Cuba , Puerto Rico and the Philippines for burial .
As a result , the percentage of unknowns plummeted .
The number of total American deaths from World War I , the first conflict of truly global proportions , shocked the nation : 116,000 deaths in about 18 months of fighting .
In 1921 , the unidentified remains of one of those soldiers became the first body interred at Arlington National Cemetery ’s Tomb of the Unknown Soldier .
Nevertheless , because of advances in battlefield recovery , better records and the introduction of dog tags , the number of unknowns in our first great war dropped markedly , to about 2 percent , a rate that held through World War II and the Korean conflict .
Thanks to refinements in forensic dentistry and the use of X - rays and CAT scans , the number of unknowns has continued to dwindle with each subsequent war .
In 1998 , Arlington ’s unknown service member from the Vietnam War , who was buried in May 1984 , was disinterred and identified as First Lt. Michael J. Blassie , an airman shot down in 1972 .
With elaborate honors , he was returned to his hometown , St. Louis .
His tomb at Arlington remains empty , marking the first 20th century conflict for which there is no unknown warrior .
In the three major wars since — the Persian Gulf war and the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan — there has not been a single unknown soldier , and only one combatant has been listed as missing in action : Capt .
Michael Speicher , who was shot down over Iraq in 1991 .
His remains were recovered from the Iraqi desert in August 2009 and returned to his family .
The sad reality is that there will likely be new recruits for Arlington ’s ranks , now 300,000 strong .
Though all losses are painful , perhaps we can take some consolation in the knowledge that the names of those who will sacrifice so much are unlikely to go unknown .

Liverpool have confirmed the signing of highly - rated Charlton midfielder Jonjo Shelvey for an initial fee of £ 1.7 million .
Clubs also agree player partnership deal
Reluctant seller
Liverpool have confirmed the signing of highly - rated Charlton midfielder Jonjo Shelvey .
The Reds are believed to have beaten off a host of clubs to land the talented 18 - year - old with Shelvey making the switch to Anfield on 10th May .
Shelvey will become Liverpool 's first signing of the summer after agreeing personal terms and passing a medical .
Liverpool will pay an initial £ 1.7 million to Charlton with further potential payments depending on domestic and international appearances .
The two clubs also revealed they are in talks about forming a partnership about player development .
Liverpool 's Managing Director Christian Purslow told the club 's " Jonjo is an exciting young England international .
His signing is part of our long - term strategic recruitment plan and we all look forward to welcoming him to Melwood .
" Charlton chairman Richard Murray admitted the club were reluctant to lose Shelvey , but conceded the offer was too good to turn down .
" It is with the greatest reluctance that we have accepted an offer for Jonjo from Liverpool , " said Murray " No club likes to lose such a talented prospect , but the overall package is one we could n't refuse , and one which was very attarctive to Jonjo .
" Liverpool are going to develop him over the next few years to be a top player , and I can't think of a better place for him to go to . "
Net neutrality skeptics routinely point out that only a pair of ISPs , Comcast and Madison River , have been FCC targets for willfully interfering with specific Internet content — so what 's the problem ?
But a class - action lawsuit against cable company RCN argues that the company was in fact doing something similar , " delaying or blocking " P2P protocols .
As reported by Broadband Reports on Monday , the company has agreed to settle the suit without admitting any guilt , but one lawyer argues that the settlement is toothless , and he intends to do something about it .
Full throttle
The complaint against RCN was filed in 2008 by Sabrina Chin and later expanded into a class - action lawsuit .
According to the judge 's summary , RCN was charged with violating the Consumer Fraud and Abuse Act " by promising its customers ' fast and untapped ' broadband Internet service , when in fact [ it ] was engaging in a network management practice called ' throttling , ' which was designed to prevent or delay customers from using the Internet in certain ways , including for ' peer - to - peer ' file sharing . "
The two sides agreed to a settlement in mid-2009 , rather than take the case all the way to trial .
That settlement is due to be finalized on June 4 , 2010 at the US District Court in lower Manhattan , but the case has largely flown under the radar .
Yesterday , a " notice of pendency and settlement of class action " was issued that alerted RCN customers to the settlement , and one Ars reader was aghast at the terms .
Those terms provide nothing for users affected by RCN 's practices .
Instead , they require the cable company to change its network management practices .
These changes are in two parts : a " P2P cessation period " and a " non -P2P cessation period . "
In both cases , RCN agrees not to engage in certain kinds of network management for 18 months .
These cessation periods would be retroactive : the P2P cessation periods began on May 1 , 2009 , while the non -P2P cessation period began on April 1 , 2008 .
A moment 's math will tell you that , when the settlement is finally approved , one cessation period will already have ended and the other will be ending soon .
Once both cessation periods are over , RCN is allowed to implement whatever throttling regime it wants .
Given that a federal court has just removed the FCC 's authority to regulate network management , RCN appears to have carte blanche to single out BitTorrent and other P2P traffic for special throttling attention after November 1 , 2010 .
That 's the extent of the settlement .
For her trouble , Sabrina Chin will get $ 3,000 , but the class counsel are asking for " attorney 's fees of up to $ 520,000 and an award of expenses of up to $ 20,000 . "
This did n't sit well with Mark Lyon , a New York attorney , and he plans to get involved in the case by objecting to the current settlement .
I object
Lyon has been an RCN Customer since moving to New York City , and he tells Ars that he " noticed issues in the past " with VoIP and P2P applications .
Then , after receiving yesterday 's notice about the settlement , it became clear that " RCN has been engaged in efforts to shape or change the traffic on its network . "
This troubled Lyon already , but it became worse when he examined the settlement and found that the non -P2P " no throttling " period had already ended ; restrictions on throttling P2P traffic would be up in November .
" I 'm going to intervene with the court , " says Lyon , who has done so in the past .
He objected to the Sony BMG " rootkit " settlement after having his computer damaged by CD driver software included on the discs to prevent copying .
The driver could n't be removed , and it then interfered with the law school test - taking software on his computer at the time .
A lone objection to a settlement certainly wo n't force a rewrite of the entire agreement , but Lyon believes that he can get class counsel and corporate counsel at least to consider more options before finalizing the deal .
In his view , if RCN could operate without such throttling and blocking in place for the last year , there 's no reason it can't do so on a going - forward basis .
Lyon wants the settlement to include :
Compensation for the people harmed by RCN ’s activities .
Give back
the stolen speed by bumping users up one service tier for each month
they have been an RCN Internet customer .
the stolen speed by bumping users up one service tier for each month they have been an RCN Internet customer .
Permanent ban on P2P and non -P2P blocking .
Reasonable compensation for class counsel — $ 540,000 is excessive
for a settlement that offers affected class members absolutely
nothing .
Given the terms already agreed to by both parties , he 's unlikely to get his complete wish list , but he does intend to file a written objection with the court this week and to show up personally at the hearing in June to further his objection .
The class includes all RCN Internet subscribers from August 19 , 2003 to July 31 , 2009 .
Those who wish to opt out of the class action can do so by sending a letter to counsel 21 days before the June 4 hearing — so you 'll need to act fast if this describes you .
Complete legal details and copies of the settlement documents can be found on RCN 's website .
Update :
We checked in with Free Press , the DC advocacy group that was beating the drum so loudly against Comcast .
Research director Derek Turner tells us , " RCN appears to have been utilizing tactics that enabled the company to block or degrade its users ' Internet experience .
These suspicious ' network management ' techniques appear to be occurring throughout the industry .
RCN agreed to behave for an 18 month period — what happens after the 18 months is up and consumers are left unprotected ?
This company 's behavior provides further evidence that we need strong net neutrality rules and clear disclosure to protect consumers and to prevent these deceptive practices from becoming the norm among Internet providers . "
Five For Howling 's favorite Toronto " Journalist " David Shoats once again shows why he's the " best " in the business with this gem of a story in today 's globe and mail .
( Screen shot just in case they take it down )
In it he outlines Ice Edge 's dropping out of the bidding process for the Coyotes In order to buy an even more expensive team in the Manchester United of the English Premier League .
Not only that , but to quote the story he says :
Ice Edge will finance the soccer purchase , which should be in excess of $ 1 - billion , primarily through revenue bonds issued through the Stonehenge Municipality , just outside of London , England .
So basically he 's saying that they 're going to line up a BILLION dollars in financing while in other stories questioning the ability of the group to get the 160 million to get the Coyotes .
What 's hilarious is that this news came from nowhere .
Absolutely nowhere .
It 's not like he made it up .
He got it from a " source " and actually ran with it .
Why would you do that ?
This is quite possibly the laziest ass reporting I 've ever seen !
I mean I hate the guy and make no bones about that but really ?
Where is your journalism degree from ?
Cracker Jacks University ?
Just to note .
This entire thing is false !
One thing I love too is that local reporter Brahm Resnik , who appears to be auditioning for a job with the Globe , retweeted it immediately .
Then 10 minutes later it fell flat and he and Shoalts both deleted the tweets about it .
Hilarious .
Brahm seems a nice enough guy , but is pretty bias on this issue .
UPDATE : It looks like the guys from IEH in fact were the ones behind the announcement .
According to the Phoenix Business Journal :
The Globe and Mail went with the story and posted it on its Web site Thursday afternoon .
Jones acknowledged it was all an April Fool 's Day joke aimed at easing the mood around the Coyotes situation , which has been stirring passions in Canada .
Please let these guys get the team .
If they 're this good at F-ing with the media , actual ownership should be good times .
UPDATE 2 : Per @dshoalts on twitter ( David Shoalts ' Twitter account ) : " One large mea culpa : I am sorry for being so incredibly stupid in falling for the Ice Edge " story . "
No excuse for this . "
HAHAHAHAHAHA .
That is all .
The other article , which she wrote alone , looked at the allocation of power between the White House and agencies .
It defended presidents ’ tightening grip over agencies and proposed that courts should give special deference to agency actions if the White House directed them .
Image Elena Kagan , the Supreme Court nominee , met with Senator Frank R. Lautenberg on Thursday .
Credit ... Manuel Balce Ceneta / Associated Press
“ When read together , both these articles point toward strong central control of the federal bureaucracy , ” said Christopher S. Yoo , a University of Pennsylvania law professor .
“ The control goes to the agency head , and the agency heads are in turn accountable to the president . ”
Ms. Kagan ’s views place her within the center of a debate about the balance between making the bureaucracy more responsive to national elections and fears that excessive politicization could trump neutral expertise .
Among those who are critical of Ms. Kagan ’s approach is Peter L. Strauss , a Columbia University law professor .
He has argued that if Congress has delegated its lawmaking authority over some issue to an agency head , the president cannot legally order the agency to reach a certain result .
That approach , he said , would concentrate too much power in the White House .
“ It ’s important that people understand that the president is commander in chief of the military forces , but he ’s not commander in chief of domestic government , ” Mr. Strauss said .
“ What he is in relation to domestic government is an overseer .
He gets to counsel .
He gets to call up an agency head and say , ‘ I ’d really like you to do this . ’
I have no problem with that .
But it is n’t the agency head ’s legal obligation to obey him . ”
Ms. Kagan ’s writings suggest just the opposite .
She analogized an agency head to the captain of a naval vessel : even though military regulations put the captain in charge of a ship , it is understood that his superior officer can give him orders .
Similarly , she wrote , even if a statute delegates power to an agency head , it should be understood that the president can tell him what to do with that power .
Limbaugh says Iceland Volcanic Eruption God ’s punishment for Health Care Reform
Yesterday , hate radio host Rush Limbaugh talked about the volcanic eruption that ’s affecting air travel over much of Europe , saying it was “ God speaking ” in response to the passage of health care .
Here is Herr Blubberbaugh , courtesy of Think Progress :
You know , a couple of days after the health care bill had been signed into law Obama ran around all over the country saying , “ Hey , you know , I ’m looking around .
The earth had n’t opened up .
There ’s no Armageddon out there .
The birds are still chirping . ”
I think the earth has opened up .
God may have replied .
This volcano in Iceland has grounded more airplanes — airspace has more affected — than even after 9/11 because of this plume , because of this ash cloud over Northern and Western Europe .
At the Paris airport they ’re telling people to head to the train station to catch trains out of France , and when people get to the train station they ’re telling people , “ There are n’t any seats until at least April 22nd , ” basically a week from now .
It ’s got everybody in a shutdown .
Earth has opened up .
I do n’t know whether it ’s a rebirth or Armageddon .
Hopefully it ’s a rebirth , God speaking .
Last month , Rep. Steve King and Fox News host Glenn Beck were similarly invoking armageddon - style language , saying that a “ vote on the Sabbath ” was an “ affront to God . ”
If you have been using your iPad on a desk with the official iPad Keyboard Dock accessory , you might have felt the need of having a mouse to control iPad ’s screen .
This is because it is more convenient to use a pointing device for interacting with a device when it is placed in a standing position on a desk , just like how we do with our desktop monitors , notebooks / netbooks and so on .
So the other day , I gave BTstack Mouse app a go on my jailbroken iPad and was pretty impressed with the result .
Not only did it worked with Apple Magic Mouse , but also with almost all the other Bluetooth enabled mice I had .
For those of you who do n’t know , BTstack Mouse is a free utility which was first released earlier this year for jailbroken iPhones and iPod touch .
Here is a little video I did which shows a jailbroken iPad being controlled by Magic Mouse .
Follow the steps below to get it working on your iPad .
Step 1 : Make sure you have a jailbroken iPad .
Follow the complete instructions posted here for jailbreaking your iPad with Spirit if you have n’t already .
Step 2 : Install BTstack Mouse app from Cydia .
It is available under BigBoss repository .
Step 3 : Now start the app and let the app discover your Bluetooth - capable mouse .
Once it has been detected , simply connect the mouse and it should be working .
Tested with : Microsoft Bluetooth Mouse 5000 and Apple Magic Mouse .
Apple is set to bring official support for using Bluetooth keyboards in iPhone OS 4 for iPhone .
It now remains to be seen whether such a support for Bluetooth mice will also be brought , for both iPhone and iPad .

The findings suggest that analyzing the text found in streams of tweets could become a cheap , rapid means of gauging public opinion on at least some subjects , said Noah Smith , assistant professor of language technologies and machine learning in the School of Computer Science .
But tools for extracting public opinion from social media text are still crude and social media remain in their infancy , he cautioned , so the extent to which these methods could replace or supplement traditional polling is still unknown .
" With seven million or more messages being tweeted each day , this data stream potentially allows us to take the temperature of the population very quickly , " Smith said .
" The results are noisy , as are the results of polls .
Opinion pollsters have learned to compensate for these distortions , while we 're still trying to identify and understand the noise in our data .
Given that , I 'm excited that we get any signal at all from social media that correlates with the polls . "
The study findings will be presented May 25 at the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence 's International Conference on Weblogs and Social Media in Washington , D.C .
In the study , Smith and his colleagues collected a billion microblog messages -- averaging about 11 words each -- posted to Twitter during 2008 and 2009 .
They used simple text analysis techniques to identify messages that pertained to the economy or to politics and then found words within the text that indicated if the writer expressed positive or negative sentiments .
Results regarding consumer confidence were compared with the Index of Consumer Sentiment ( ICS ) from Reuters / University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers and the Gallup Organization 's Economic Confidence Index .
Political sentiments regarding President Obama were compared with Gallup 's daily tracking poll on presidential job approval and views regarding the 2008 U.S. presidential election were compared with a compilation of 46 different polls prepared by Pollster.com .
The ICS , Gallup and Pollster.com measurements were all obtained from telephone surveys using traditional polling techniques .

The Twitter - derived sentiment measurements were much more volatile day - to - day than the polling data , but when the researchers " smoothed " the results by averaging them over a period of days , the results often correlated closely with the polling data , said Brendan O'Connor , a graduate student in Carnegie Mellon 's Language Technologies Institute and first author of the study .
Consumer confidence , for instance , followed the same general slide through 2008 and the same rebound in February / March of 2009 as was seen in the poll data .
The researchers noted that the ICS and Gallup data had a correlation of 86 percent over the period ; the Twitter - derived sentiments had between 72 percent and 79 percent correlation with the Gallup data , depending on the number of days averaged to smooth the data .
Likewise , both the Twitter - derived sentiments and the traditional polls reflected declining approval of President Obama 's job performance during 2009 , with a 72 percent correlation between them .
But the researchers found that their sentiment analysis did not correlate as well with election polling during 2008 .
For instance , increased mentions of " Obama " tended to correlate with rises in Barack Obama 's polling numbers , but increased mentions of " McCain " also correlated with rises in Obama 's popularity .
Improved computational methods for understanding natural language , particularly the unusual lexicon of microblogs , will be necessary before Twitter feeds can be reliably mined to predict elections , the researchers concluded .
" The Web is so mainstream now that there 's no question that the Web is representative somehow of the population , " O'Connor said .
But pinning down
Web demographics is still difficult , he acknowledged , noting that Twitter traffic alone increased by a factor of 50 during the two - year span of the study .
Using computer programs to judge the sentiments of microblogs is fraught with potential error , but even with the crude tools used in this exploratory research , the accuracy is better than can be achieved by chance , O'Connor said .
" The massive amount of data was crucial in making this work , " he explained .
" We do n't need to get the sentiment of every individual right to understand sentiments in aggregate . "
Improved natural language processing tools , as well as query - driven analysis and use of demographic and time stamp data available on some social media sites , could increase the sophistication and reliability of microblog analysis .
In addition to Smith and O'Connor , authors of the study include Bryan R. Routledge , associate professor of finance , and Ramnath Balasubramanyan , a Ph.D. student in language technologies .

When I saw the photos of the Wilton Windmill crop circle ( the photo here is by Steve Alexander ) , reported on 22nd May , I was immediately struck by the possibility of a message encoded in 8 - bit binary .
After transcribing the binary digits , I translated each byte ( 8 bits ) into its corresponding ASCII character with this handy online converter , starting from the direction of the windmill , and working clockwise around the circle and out from the centre .
( If you ’re having trouble following this , see the animation linked at the bottom of the article ) .
The result was this :
e ^( hi ) pi) 1=0
It looked like some kind of equation , and when I looked it up , Google asked if I meant : e^( i ) pi) 1=0 , for which the top result was Euler ’s identity : eiπ+1=0 .
This has been called “ the most beautiful theorem in mathematics ” .
No surprise that it should turn up in a crop circle then !
One of the things that had caught my attention on initially seeing the pictures of the crop formation had been the way that it referenced both the turning wheel of the windmill and the twelve - part division of the zodiacal cycle , the cosmic wheel .
On looking a little deeper into the mathematics , it becomes clear that the formation also represents Euler ’s formula , of which Euler ’s Identity is a special case , in graphical form – as a circle , with radii represented at different angles .
On reflection , this is a very cleverly executed and elegant design , in which mathematical and symbolic meanings are fused into a single ‘ identity ’ .
Not being a mathematician , I was n’t sure about the odd notation of the formula as expressed in the crop circle , but I assumed that , for the circle - maker , it could be a way to get around the limitations of ASCII text , and was a near enough approximation for me to get the intended result .
One thing that bothered me was the inclusion of the anomalous ‘ h’ in the message / formula .
Certainly , with the absent ‘+’ , it made up the number of characters to the symbolic number twelve .
Perhaps significantly , the ‘ h’ , with the adjacent ‘ i ’ , reads ‘ hi’ – an embedded message from the circle - maker ?
It was only when a Facebook contact suggested that ‘h’ could be a reference to the Planck constant , taking us from the world of maths into the world of physics , that I realised a possible new layer of meaning within the embedded message .
Could the makers have left a ‘ Planck ’ in the design as a subtle joke on all the croppies who might pronounce this a ‘ genuine ’ crop circle as opposed to a circle made with a plank ?!
I wonder if anyone has looked down that arc that represents the binary digit in question – could there be a physical plank there ?
Less flippantly , I think that the more likely scenario is that the circle - makers made a genuine mistake .
The binary encoding for ‘ h’ – 01101000 is just one binary digit different to that for ‘(‘ – 00101000 .
The extra opening bracket would pair up with the otherwise unpaired closing bracket in the message to give us e^(( i ) pi)1=0 .
This animated explanation of the 2010 Wilton Windmill crop circle design that I put together should make everything clear !
Also , here ’s my original blog post .
Update : See my essay ‘ Closing the Circle ’ in the wonderful Daily Grail journal Darklore 5 for a more detailed treatment .
The essay is also available as a free sample pdf .
Meeting a friend in the corridor , Ludwig Wittgenstein ( 1889 - 1951 ) said : " Tell me , why do people always say that it was natural for men to assume that the sun went around the earth rather than the earth was rotating ? "
His friend said : " Well , obviously , because it just looks as if the sun is going around the earth . "
To which the philosopher replied : " Well , what would it look like if it had looked as if the earth were rotating ? "
You might find some good deals and bulk rates at Costco , but not find the minimum $ 50 per year membership quite worth it .
Buying a Costco Cash Card in any amount gives you a shot at the big - box savings .

The Costco Cash Card is simply Costco 's gift card , which can be bought for a minimum of $ 10 and used by the holder to shop at Costco , whether you 're a member or not .
So if you can get someone to snag you a card , or buy one yourself before your savings - minded shopping trip , you can shop at Costco until your card runs down , as Jim from Bargaineering.com writes in a guest post at The Consumerist .
Advertisement
The big caveat , though , is that once your Costco card runs out , only an actual Costco member can refill it or buy another card ( presumably checked against the credit card or driver 's license ) .
If you 've got a lot of willing friends who shop at Costco , you 're good to go .
Otherwise , figure out how much toilet paper , boxed cereal , and other goods you can afford and stash away , and load up your Cash Card .
Update : Commenters and former Costco employees , both here and at the Consumerist post , note that Costco management has started nixing this gift card loophole .
That said , the cards do seem to work at the discounted gas pumps , so you can use up any unfortunate leftover balances there .

Australian winemaker Thomas Angove , inventor of boxed wine , passed away yesterday at the age of 92 .
Nearly 45 years after his first prototype , boxed wine has become a popular drinking for those looking for decent wine at a reasonable price .
His son John Angove has taken over the business now , but was n't too sold on the boxed wine concept in the beginning , " that 's ridiculous , nobody is going to buy wine out of a cardboard box and a plastic bag . "
A sad day for winos everywhere , pour one out for Thomas Angove , folks .

We have reached part five of our Columbus Blue Jackets mini-series on Trading Partners .
In case you missed part four , we discussed the Calgary Flames .
Today we look at their Northern Alberta neighbors the Edmonton Oilers .
What a disastrous end to the season for the Oilers .
They were knocked out of the bubble in four games by the Chicago Blackhawks .
Even worse , they lost the series while playing all of their games on home ice .
It could n't have been drawn up any worse .
This meant another lost opportunity for Connor McDavid to attempt a deep playoff run .
As good as his season was , even his heroics were not enough to overcome the defensive deficiencies the team still has .
Until he , Leon Draisaitl and the rest of the team can find drastic improvement in that area , they seem stuck in quick sand .
Connor McDavid and the Oilers need to improve defensively .

Apr. 13 , 2010  -- Gov. Sarah Palin may be flexible on some of the perks she needs when speaking in public , but on the question of drinking straws , she shall not bend .
Six pages of the contract Palin 's handlers sent to Cal State Stanislaus were unearthed in a dumpster by students there this week , and one of the many requirements that must be met for the former vice presidential hopeful : two unopened bottles of still water and " bendable straws " must be waiting on a wooden lectern .
That was just one item among the pages of elaborate demands that must be met to land a contract for Palin to come speak at an event .
More costly were the requirement for her travel – the venue must supply her with business or first class commercial airfare , or with a private plane .
And not just any jet will do .
READ SARAH PALIN'S CONTRACT HERE
" The private aircraft MUST BE a Lear 60 or larger ( as defined by interior cabin space ) for West Coast Events ; or , a Hawker 800 or Larger ( as defined by interior cabin space for ) East Coast Events , and both are subject to the Speaker 's approval .
The Speaker Reserves the right to change the flight plans at any time , " the contract states .
None of this was supposed to be made public .
Palin 's contracts include a confidentiality clause , and the state university that had booked her to speak at a fundraising event has been fighting with state lawmakers over demands that the details be made public .
Palin's name does not appear in the six pages recovered , but the contract is from the Washington Speakers Bureau , which handles her speaking engagements , and refers to a female speaker who will be aboard flights originating in Anchorage , Alaska .
Palin 's planned speech at Cal State University Stanislaus is one of the dozens she has booked on a lucrative lecture circuit .
Speaking has become a major component of her post - governorship career – a multi-media whirl that has earned her at least an estimated $ 12 million since she left office in July , a figure that is based on publicly available records and reports .
The Cal State speech – which is believed to be costing the university 's foundation about $ 75,000 -- became grist for controversy when California state Sen .
Leland
Yee questioned the wisdom of the expense at a time when the state is in the grips of a budget crisis .
University officials have remained defiant .
University Vice President Susana Gajic - Bruyea sent an email March 29 to students defending the choice .
" The board wanted to bring a keynote speaker who would attract significant interest and , therefore , drive ticket sales , " she wrote .
" Sarah Palin is that type of speaker , whether or not people agree with her politics , and we expect this event to be a tremendous fund - raising success . "
Even so ,
Yee has argued that university officials have an obligation to cough up the details of the Palin agreement .
He unveiled the newly discovered documents at a press conference Tuesday morning , and hailed the find as a singular achievement for the public good .
" I never thought we would have to relive Watergate again .
This is our little Watergate , " Yee said .
" These students found these documents that the University said they did n't have , " he continued .
" I will not allow any retaliation against these two individuals . "
Yee showed off the documents – including parts of the university 's speaking contract with Palin – that were found in the dumpster outside the university 's administration building two days after university officials told Yee ( D - San Francisco ) that they did not have them .
According to Yee , students at Cal State Stanislaus learned on Friday , April 9 , that someone with the university had allegedly come in on a furlough day ( a day when state workers stay home to save money for cash - strapped California ) to destroy the documents .
Yee has turned the documents over to investigators with the California Attorney General 's office .
University officials have made no secret of their desire to keep the details of the contract with Palin under wraps .
They said Palin was invited to speak by the university 's foundation , its quasi - private non-profit fundraising arm , which they argued is not subject to public records requests .
Neither Washington Speakers Bureau nor a spokesperson for Sarah Palin responded to a request for comment about today 's press conference .

Posted by John , April 13th , 2010 - under Same - sex marriage .
Tags : Demonstrations
The defeat of the Greens - sponsored Marriage Equality Bill ( to repeal the ban on same - sex marriage ) in February saw Labor and the Liberals jointly reaffirm their opposition to civil rights and their support for homophobia .
Their actions in ensuring the continuance of state - based discrimination toward same - sex couples have made it crystal clear that change on this issue will not come from within the walls of parliament .
Rates of suicide and attempted suicide are six times higher for same - sex attracted young people than their heterosexual counterparts , and over 85 per cent of lesbian , gay , bi-sexual , transgender and intersex ( LGBTI ) people report having experienced physical violence and abuse in their lifetime .
Yet again and again , our elected leaders have refused to take note of either public opinion or a basic sense of decency .
They have shown themselves to be absolute bigots .
So it is vitally important that more and more people continue to take to the streets in protest against this gross discrimination – that means coming out again for the International Day Against Homophobia on Saturday May 15 .
The demonstrations that were held around the country in August and November last year and March this year have been vital in giving people the confidence to fight .
At the last rally , one young woman in Melbourne declared , “ I feel so powerful ! ”
Only through getting out in force and getting together as many people as possible can we begin to create and re-create this mood – this sense of power – in the face of the establishment , who want to create a sense of worthlessness and powerlessness in LGBTI people .
Those who support same - sex marriage rights – those who oppose homophobia – have a role to play in standing up to support those who are vilified by discriminatory laws .
In this election year it is only through taking to the streets that our message will be heard , that support can be consolidated , and that the issue will remain potent .
Labor is relying on the majority of the population to remain silent on this issue .
With people all around the world demonstrating on May 15 , it is a perfect opportunity to make some noise , to drown out their prejudice .
So if you have not yet taken to the streets to demand an end to homophobia , and to demand equal rights , now is the time to do so .
If you have already been out in support , now is the time to do it again .
In the lead - up to May 15 , tell everyone you know about the International Day Against Homophobia .
Make sure they know just how important this campaign is .

A gamer accused of cheating in a net café game of CounterStrike narrowly escaped death after irate players skewered his head on a knife .
The incident began in a net café in China ’s northern province of Jilin , when a group of youths apparently noticed a 17 - year - old boy they had been playing Counter Strike with had been cheating by using a “ wallhack ” to allow himself to see through walls .
An argument began and a fight broke out outside the café .
During the fight the cheater had a 30 cm knife thrust into his left temple , with the blade only being stopped by the other side of his skull .
His assailants fled the scene after inflicting this injury , and he was quickly taken to hospital in an ambulance , still remaining conscious .
Doctors decided to operate immediately .
Doctors explain the blade narrowly avoided major arteries , avoiding a devastating haemorrhage , and failed to impair his motor control despite passing through areas of the brain associated with such .
They were able to carefully extract the blade after opening his skull in an operation lasting some 10 hours , but noted that the knife was rusty – he has been placed under observation in case fragments of rust left inside his brain cause complications .
The net café in question was apparently popular with local youths as it did not require ID – government fear mongering about gaming culture has seen a variety of draconian restrictions placed on net cafés , so the café may be facing some unwelcome attention from the authorities .
" Under the Blows of the Counterrevolution " by Nestor Makhno
New publication
" Under the Blows of the Counterrevolution " is the second volume of Nestor Makhno 's memoirs which describes Makhno 's odyssey through revolutionary Russia in the spring of 1918 .
It is the first English translation of this book .
Under the Blows of the Counterrevolution
by Nestor Ivanovich Makhno
Nestor Makhno ( 1888 -1934 ) was a peasant anarcho - communist who organized an experiment in anarchist values in practice in southeast Ukraine during the Russian Revolution and Civil War .
This is the second volume of his memoirs , originally published in France in 1936 and published in English here for the first time .
" Under the Blows of the Counterrevolutio " n describes Makhno 's odyssey through revolutionary Russia in the spring of 1918 .
Driven from his Ukrainian village by a German invasion , he wandered through a nation torn by civil war , encountered various remarkable personalities , and survived hair - raising adventures .
This volume has interested historians mainly because of Makhno 's account of his interview with Lenin , but it also contains much valuable eye - witness information about a period of Soviet history which was later almost completely rewritten in officially sanctioned accounts .
The book ( 214 pp. ) includes the original preface and notes by Makno 's sometime colleague Vsevolod Volin together with photos , maps , glossary , explanatory notes , appendix , etc. English translation and editing by Malcolm Archibald ..

Orakzai had become a sanctuary for insurgents routed by the army ’s campaign in South Waziristan , notably Tehrik - i- Taliban , an umbrella organization of militant groups operating in the tribal regions .
Orakzai was also a stronghold of the Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud , who is generally believed to have been killed in a airstrike in January .
Army officials said over the weekend that militants fleeing other tribal regions also had taken refuge in the remote , thickly forested Tirah Valley in Khyber .
Pakistani officials say that more than 250 militants have been killed in recent offensives in the Orakzai and Khyber tribal regions , although the figures cannot be verified .
Journalists are barred from the areas .
While the Pakistani military is thought to have gained the upper hand in the tribal regions , militants have continued to target civil and military installations .
Security forces foiled an attempt by militants two weeks ago to retake control of a post in the Bezoti area of Orakzai .
Also Monday , at least six people were killed in clashes in the Abottabad district over the renaming of North - West Frontier Province .
The police fired tear gas to quell the unrest , which paralyzed the district in recent days .
Protesters claimed that the police opened fire on them , but officials said that the police had fired only rubber bullets .
Last week , a suicide bomber killed 42 people at a ceremony being held to celebrate the renaming .
Poppy and I went to the last minute press conference today at HHC and Tony also managed to duck out of work to join us , which was important as access to homebirth is not just a women ’s issue — it ’s a family issue .
The press conference went well .
Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer and Assemblyman Richard Gottfried spoke to the press , as did a representative from NYSALM , Elan McAllister of Choices in Childbirth , and expecting mom , Katalin Lovasz .
They described the meeting that had just taken place with HHC , and while nothing was immediately resolved and homebirth will largely become illegal in NYC as of midnight tonight (!!! ) , HHC is not totally closed to the idea of signing written practice agreements with NYC ’s homebirth midwives and the conversation remains open , for now .
The concern , however , is how long the negotiation process will take .
After all , HHC is a huge city bureaucracy not known for its speed or efficiency .
That and the fact that they have n’t agreed to anything yet — they ’ve simply agreed to continue their consideration .
The crowd was small , yet still impressive considering many of us had about an hour ’s notice to get there .
There was a decent media turnout considering homebirth is of interest to a very small population of people — WNYC , NY1 , the Daily News , and others had reporters there , and a couple of stories are already emerging ( see this post for the full media coverage so far ) .
We walked away from today ’s event , cautiously optimistic that this will be resolved in time , but still utterly depressed that as of tonight at midnight , a woman ’s legal right to birth at home with a qualified midwife in NYC has been pulled out from under her .
As one of the speakers today pointed out , many women are being left stranded in the final weeks of their pregnancies and forced to scramble to either find an OB willing to take them on at this stage of the game , or show up at an ER in labor and birth with total strangers .
And all the work and planning and thought that goes into a homebirth , not to mention the loving relationship built over several months with a midwife , goes right out the window .
And that ’s just wrong .
We could still use your help calling local representatives and putting pressure on the Governor to step in and right this wrong .

Update : Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer has posted a statement on his website .
Statement of Manhattan Borough President Scott M. Stringer Re : Impact of St. Vincent ’s Closure on Homebirth Midwives & Expectant Mothers
The collateral damage caused by the closure of St. Vincent ’s has unfortunately now extended to midwives and pregnant women .
In spite of our best efforts , the fact remains that at midnight tonight New York City women will lose the option of delivering their babies at home .
This does n’t have to be a permanent situation .
I brought together midwives with officials from the NYC Health and Hospitals Corporation ( HCC ) today to discuss ways in which midwives could be able to continue to practice with hospital resources behind them .
While we were unable to reach an agreement , I applaud HHC for undergoing deliberations , and I call on all hospitals and health care facilities around the city to do the same .
Let ’s not send the practice of homebirth underground .
The closure of St. Vincent ’s has led to some unavoidable hardships but there is no reason to add to that list the elimination of a woman ’s right to choose how to deliver her baby .
Update 2 : the NY Daily News posted a story this morning .

NEW YORK — Expressing regret that joyless , wrongheaded ESPN commentator and attack journalist Skip Bayless could not be dealt with otherwise , commissioners from every major professional sporting league , top officials of amateur athletic associations , and representatives of player unions reached an agreement Wednesday to end the practice of competitive sports in order to forever deprive Bayless of any subject matter .

" It 's a shame that it had to come to this , but there 's just no other way to stop Skip Bayless than to stop playing sports , " Major League Baseball commissioner Bud Selig said in his final statement before forever closing the books on the national pastime .
" Ending baseball is a tragedy , but if our sacrifice means Bayless stops spewing his petty , hateful vitriol , it will all be worth it . "
" Will we miss football ?
Of course we will , " said NFL Players Association president Kevin Mawae , who confirmed that professional football players would join all other pro athletes in turning in their uniforms and shredding their playbooks by May 1 .
" It 's all most of us know .
But for a long time now , there 's been a feeling that football was n't worth playing as long as Skip Bayless was able to take these ridiculously adversarial devil 's - advocate stances purely to rile up viewers and get attention .
It 's better this way . "

As part of the universal agreement to silence Bayless , Major League Baseball will discontinue all play Saturday night after Bayless has gone to bed ; the NBA and NHL will announce their cessation at an unspecified time this weekend to deny Bayless an opportunity to nastily criticize their playoff pictures ; and NASCAR will quietly close down once and for all Friday before Bayless can make some strident but idiotic statement about the sport as if he watched it all the time and were not simply reacting to something he had read that day .
By the end of this month , all high school gymnasiums will be permanently locked up , every swimming pool filled with concrete , and all soccer and baseball fields paved over to prevent anyone from ever trying to hold any vaguely athletic event about which Bayless could possibly make the smallest disparaging remark .

In addition , all related sanctioning bodies , sponsors , and athletic associations have agreed to help stanch the corrosive blather originating from within Bayless by canceling , at every level , all NCAA athletics ; Little League Baseball ; the Scripps National Spelling Bee ; Dancing With The Stars ; Scottish Highland games ; the Indy Racing League ; the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show ; the Boston , New York , and Chicago marathons ; and soccer 's World Cup .
" I love sports , " said 85 - year - old Brooklyn resident Myron Bell .
" I love all the New York teams , and there 's been nothing better in my life than sitting at home on a Sunday afternoon and watching the games on television .
But by God , this is the best news I 've heard in years . "

According to sources familiar with the agreement , Bayless is expected to fume and fulminate through the weekend about whatever sports remain .
After all athletic competition ceases to be , it is predicted he will rail , harangue , and whine like a spoiled child for several more days , complaing over the fact that sports has indeed ended .
However , most say that after roughly a week without an outlet for his disdain and hatred , Bayless will begin to choke on his own bile and be silenced for good , living the rest of his years silently curled around his bone - deep contempt for all that is pleasurable and good .
Officials said that to prevent Bayless from emerging once again to " make that prim little mirthless half - smile he puts on when he pretends to listen to other people talk , " all children must burn their baseball gloves , tennis rackets , basketballs , and any sports - related equipment by 2 p.m. next Sunday .

" Sport , of course , should be an exultation of the human spirit , a coming - together of all people , and a celebration of what humanity is capable of — in short , a symbol of what is best in each of us , " said International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge , who announced that the eternal Olympic flame in Lausanne , Switzerland , would be forever extinguished this weekend .
" Unfortunately , the poisonous words and deeds of Skip Bayless have ruined this , for all men , for all time . "
Bayless , 58 , began his infamous career as a locally hated sports journalist , writing for newspapers in Miami , Los Angeles , and Dallas .
After Bayless appeared on ESPN's Jim Rome Is Burning , where he instantly eclipsed Rome as America 's least - appealing sports commentator , the network offered Bayless the chance to be infuriating and wrong about sports on a daily basis as a despicable fixture on sports talk show Cold Pizza , which in turn led to loudmouth contrarian stints on First Take and 1st and 10 .
Soon , the smug , smirking Bayless had made ESPN 's daily programming all but unwatchable .

" Frankly , ESPN deserves a large share of the blame .
That 's why we are shutting the network down as of tomorrow , " ESPN president George Bodenheimer said .
" We can only hope our sacrifice will be enough .
Luckily , knowing Skip , I do n't believe he will be able to think of anything to say if he does n't have sports to denigrate , run down , or throw under the bus . "
" I know you are wondering why we employed him in the first place , " Bodenheimer added .
" And so are we .
But I think in a weird way we just felt bad for the guy . "

Bayless was not approached for comment .

Support for the Australian Greens has surged to a record high as voters turn away from the major parties .
The latest Newspoll shows the Greens have jumped six points in six weeks to score 16 per cent support .
They usually poll around 10 per cent of the primary vote and were at 12 per cent in the last poll .
The Greens ' gain was Labor and the Liberals ' loss .
They both lost two points , taking Labor down to 35 per cent of the primary vote and the Liberals to 41 .
Labor is hanging on to government with a razor - thin majority on the all - important two - party preferred vote .
The ALP leads the coalition 51 to 49 .
The federal election is expected later this year .
The political debate has been dominated in recent weeks by a pitched battle between Labor and the Liberals over the Government 's proposed tax hike on mining profits .
The poll appears to indicate that neither side is winning over the voters as the issue dominates the airwaves .
Thirty - six per cent of those polled said they were in favour of the resource super profits tax , with 41 per cent opposed .
The survey says 22 per cent of people think they will be better off under the tax , while 31 per cent think they will be worse off .
The Newspoll was published on The Australian newspaper 's website on Monday night .

The chief executive of a consumer goods company is in the news for making £ 90 m last year .
But while the firm produces a slew of household names , one really sticks unpleasantly in the memory - Cillit Bang .
Cillit Bang has been sold in the UK for six years Cleaning products often have quite traditional names .
Cif ( formerly Jif in the UK ) sounds safe and normal .
So does Flash .
But Cillit Bang , pronounced with a soft " c " , sounds like the alter ego of a bassist in a Turkish punk band or an ineligible Scrabble contribution .
Bart Becht , the boss of household goods company Reckitt Benckiser , which makes Cillit Bang and various other household goods , has been awarded a £ 90 m pay package .
But when Cillit Bang made its debut on British shores in 2004 the name alone was enough to baffle British consumers .
Now a range of four cleaning products , Cillit Bang 's adverts quickly gained cult status .
They featured a fictional man , Barry Scott , cleaning a penny .
The tone of the adverts appeared to be deliberately cheap .
He spoke in a slightly shouty manner and finished off his retro presentation of the product 's amazing cleaning powers by saying : " Bang and the dirt is gone . "
The product claimed to be deadly against limescale , rust , and something called " ground - in dirt " .
But soon Cillit Bang 's marketing attracted the wrong sort of attention .
As part of a digital marketing strategy , comments from Barry Scott would appear on random - and occasionally serious - blog postings .
Here was a place where Barry was not welcome .
Those in the blogosphere suggested that Cillit Bang 's marketers had got the wrong end of the stick and been rather annoying .
Cillit Bang is no weirder than anything else
Mark Choueke
Marketing Week " That did n't work out at all well , " says Mark Choueke , editor of Marketing Week .
And some people are still not fond of the name .
Whereas many Reckitt Benckiser products have explicable names - Vanish makes stains vanish , Finish gives your dishwasher load a sparkling Finish - Cillit Bang does not exactly trip off the tongue .
In January this year branding consultants G2 said Cillit Bang was the UK 's most disliked brand name .
It seemed particularly grating to women , with 25 % of those surveyed saying they disliked it .
But , argues Choueke , the name is not a great deal stranger than other Reckitt Benckiser brands like Calgon or Harpic , and ultimately its sales tell the real story .
" Cillit Bang is no weirder than anything else .
It probably helped the marketing .
It made a really boring sector into something special because of the name .
" It has n't stopped it being an incredible brand with incredible success .
Brands are more than just a name .
The idea at first was to get memorable . "
Frightening instructions
Go on the Cillit Bang website and you see its credentials as a tough cleaner emphasised , even in the frequently asked questions section .
One customer asks : " The instructions appear to be quite frightening and imply that this is a very harsh product .
Is it suitable for use as a household cleaner ? "
The brand got the kind of publicity that money cannot buy in August last year .
It was revealed it was being used on plutonium stains at the defunct Dounreay nuclear power plant in Caithness .
The clean - up project manager said : " One of the guys suggested Cillit Bang .
He remembered seeing it dissolve the grime on a 2 p coin in an advert on TV and thought it was worth looking at . "
But even that episode was n't all good news for Cillit Bang .
Great rival Mr Muscle had been used in another bit of the clean - up .
Add your comments on this story , using the form below .
I always found it strange that Jif would rename themselves to Cif .
Cif sounds just like Syph , the nickname of a sexually transmitted disease .
Not something you really want to smear round your bathtub .
Adam , London , UK Two things I 've noticed about Cillit Bang .
1 ) Barry Scott does n't shout anymore , and 2 ) on a recent advert , they bragged that the cleaner even cleaned ' Stainless Steal ' .
Steve , Tenby In New Zealand it 's called " Cillit Bam " - same tagline though .
Tracy , London , UK
In the USA , Cillit Bang is called " Easy - Off Bam ! " - still not a pleasant name , exactly , but rather nicer , and a little more descriptive ...
Curiously , the American adverts for it also featured a fictional British man called Barry Scott , but curiously , it was a DIFFERENT fictional British man to the ads in the UK !
I have no idea what was going through the marketing people 's heads !
Jon , London
My 4 - year - old insists I buy it as he likes saying it and loves the loudness of the ads .
If I do buy it , he cheers .
It 's expensive , but seriously , some things it shifts as nothing else can .
S Walmsley , Southport Cillit Bang is certainly a stupid name , but more to the point it 's no better than anything else .
It 's highly priced and best avoided
Reuben Matthews , Nottingham Cillit Bang gained cult status among students a few years back mainly due to a rave remix of the advert on Youtube .
Legendary .

Wenn man sich die Definitionen der 5 Sinnes - Fetische anschaut , wird sich wohl fast jeder als ein Fetischist im weitesten Sinne selbst entlarven können – und das ist auch gut so !
Auch wenn der Geruchs - Fetisch anscheinend nicht so populär ist wie die anderen , weitaus bekannteren Richtungen , so ist dieser vernachlässigte Fetisch doch einer der ausgeprägtesten .
Zudem ist er der am ersten entwickelte von allen .
Vor allen anderen Sinnen nutzt z.B. ein neugeborenes Kind den Geruchssinn , um die Milch gebende Brust – sowie die Mutter als solche – zu lokalisieren .
Der Geruchssinn ist auch der komplexeste chemische Sinn .
Gerüche wirken direkt auf unser Unterbewusstsein , einige werden sogar ausschließlich unbewusst wahrgenommen wie z.B. Pheromone .
Außerdem wirkt sich der Geruchssinn auch auf andere Sinne aus , z.B. den Geschmack – wer nicht riechen kann , schmeckt auch deutlich weniger , wovon wohl jeder ein Lied singen kann , der mal mit Schnupfennase zu einem – eigentlich – leckeren Essen eingeladen war .
Julian Assange is the founder of WikiLeaks.org , a Web site that " collect[s ] documents and imagery that governments and other institutions regard as confidential and publish [ es ] them . "
He is profiled by Raffi Khatchadourian in the June 7 , 2010 issue of The New Yorker .
Assange is an international trafficker , of sorts .
He and his colleagues collect documents and imagery that governments and other institutions regard as confidential and publish them on a Web site called WikiLeaks.org .
Since it went online , three and a half years ago , the site has published an extensive catalogue of secret material , ranging from the Standard Operating Procedures at Camp Delta , in Guantánamo Bay , and the " Climategate " e-mails from the University of East Anglia , in England , to the contents of Sarah Palin 's private Yahoo account .
The catalogue is especially remarkable because WikiLeaks is not quite an organization ; it is better described as a media insurgency .
It has no paid staff , no copiers , no desks , no office .
Assange does not even have a home .
He travels from country to country , staying with supporters , or friends of friends–as he once put it to me , " I 'm living in airports these days . "
He is the operation 's prime mover , and it is fair to say that WikiLeaks exists wherever he does .
At the same time , hundreds of volunteers from around the world help maintain the Web site 's complicated infrastructure ; many participate in small ways , and between three and five people dedicate themselves to it full time .
Key members are known only by initials–M , for instance–even deep within WikiLeaks , where communications are conducted by encrypted online chat services .
The secretiveness stems from the belief that a populist intelligence operation with virtually no resources , designed to publicize information that powerful institutions do not want public , will have serious adversaries .

Ipsos -MORI ’s final poll will be in the Evening Standard tomorrow , but apart from that all the other final polls are out .
CON LAB LDEM Con Lead Populus 37 28 27 +9 ComRes 37 28 28 +9 Opinium 35 27 26 +8 ICM 36 28 26 +8 You Gov 35 28 28 +7 Angus Reid 36 24 29 +7 Harris 35 29 27 +6 TNS BMRB 33 27 29 +4
There you go .
Yesterday I said I expected the final figures would be somewhere around where ICM , Populus and YouGov were ( at the time CON 34 - 36 , LAB 27 - 29 , LDEM 27 - 29 ) and not much has changed that , though the average level of Conservative support seemed to have ticked up a bit , with most polls now showing them at 35 - 37 .
All the pollsters are now very close indeed , the majority of the polls are within 1 point of CON 36 % , LAB 28 % , LDEM 27 % ( the exceptions are Angus Reid and TNS BMRB ) .
Looking at the details of the polls , Populus had a sample of 2,500 , conducted between yesterday afternoon and today .
An interesting part there was that of the 13 % of people who said they were voting tactically , half said they were voting Conservative , suggesting the Conservatives being the beneficaries of some tactical voting for once .
59 % of people told Populus they were certain to vote , compared to 57 % in their poll in 2005 .
The Harris poll was conducted between the 29th April and 4th May , so for a final eve- of - election poll there was some very old fieldwork .
No it was n’t !
Fieldwork was actually 4 - 5th May like everyone else .
Angus Reid provide some analysis of marginal seats in their poll .
In 150 Labour held Conservative targets Angus Reid found the Conservatives up 5 points on 2005 , Labour down 19 .
This equates to a somewhat implausible 12 point swing from Labour to the Conservatives in marginal seats , enough for a crushing landslide .
In the 63 Liberal Democrat held seats they found support at CON 33 % ( +4 ) , LAB 12 %( - 7 ) , LDEM 48 % ( +2 ) – a slight swing from the Lib Dems to the Conservatives .
YouGov interviewed 6483 , so a big old sample .
They also carried out a second poll of Labour held Conservative target seats with a majority between 6 % and 14 % ( the same seats You Gov polled a few months back for Channel 4 ) .
These showed a 7 % swing from Labour to the Conservatives , evidence that the Conservatives continue to do better in marginal seats and echoing the sort of swing the MORI and Crosby / Textor marginal polls have shown in the last week .
ComRes ’s final polls is already looking ahead to the aftermath of the election .
They found 51 % of people agreed with the statement that the party with the most seats should provide the PM , but 81 % agreed that the party that received the most votes should provide the PM .
Anyway , enough of the polling – how will it translate into seats ?
On a uniform swing a split of 36/28/27 would translate into a seat distribution of Conservatives 297 , Labour 245 and Lib Dems 76 .
There are a couple of departures from UNS that we can be pretty confident of though – firstly , Scotland will not follow this pattern .
The polling suggests Labour ’s support in Scotland is pretty solid and there is certainly no Conservative advance ( and the SNP surge we were seeing a year or two back has also gone . )
I also expect the Conservatives to outperform the national swing in Labour held marginals – the seven percent swing we ’ve seen in the YouGov , MORI and Crosby / Textor polls would take the Conservatives over 300 and close to a majority .
What is much more difficult to do is predict what will happen in Lib Dem marginals .
It seems likely the Conservative advance will be slightly offset by losing seats to the Liberal Democrats , but there have been a couple of straws in the wind like that ICM poll of Lib Dem marginals that suggest the Lib Dems are advancing more in Labour held marginals than Conservative ones .
We do n’t have the polling evidence to judge that – but whether the Lib Dems advance evenly , or do better against Labour , will be the difference between the Conservatives getting about 300 seats and getting up to 310 or more .
Anyway , I ca n’t delay it any longer : my guess is we are going to see the Conservatives between 300 - 310 , Labour between 220- 230 , the Liberal Democrats between 80 - 90 ( though I warn you , I may be a pollster , but my personal powers of election prediction are notoriously poor ! )
For other pollster predictions , TNS have made a seat prediction of CON 292 , LAB 204 , LDEM 114 ; Peter Kellner ’s personal prediction is CON 300- 310 , LAB 230- 240 , LDEM 75 - 85 ; Angus Reid have a prediction of CON 320- 340 , LAB 165- 185 , LDEM 105-120 .

The Game Evaluator
How much is that latest release really worth to you , how much to pay for that game you let slip by .
Here you 'll find reviews with no scores at the end but a price instead .
How much is a video game worth ?
Let me tell you .
Jonathan Daniel / Getty Images Xavier lost a heartbreaker , but Jordan Crawford passed the March Madness test .
Xavier lost a heartbreaker , but Jordan Crawford passed the March Madness test .
On Twitter last weekend , I mixed it up with my arch - nemesis Chad Ford on the following topic : " How much should March Madness affect our feelings about NBA prospects ? "
I always like riling Chad up because he 's a conflict - resolution professor .
Ticking him off is like getting Tim Tebow to swear .
Anyway , he tweeted that tournament performance affects evaluations by NBA teams , for better and worse , although he did n't think it was necessarily fair .
I responded that it was fair .
What better time to determine someone 's intestinal / testicular / mental fortitude than March Madness ?
It 's the ultimate " sink or swim " stage .
Chad disagreed with my disagreement and it was on .
Twitter fight !
Here 's my case in a nutshell : Let 's say I owned Marquis Jet and wanted to find new pilots to fly my 12 - seat airplanes .
Let 's say I narrowed it down to 30 candidates and had a chance to fly cross-country with them in inclement weather .
Let 's say 20 of them did fine , five were amazing and five completely melted down , to the degree that I had to grab the controls or we would have crashed .
Should this matter ?
( Hold on , I 'll give you an extra second to think about it . )
( And time . )
OF COURSE !
OF COURSE IT MATTERS !
I just looked into their souls .
I just tested them in the most intense way possible .
That does n't matter ?
Sink or swim .
That 's March Madness .
Should opinions on pro potential ( or , as reader Shaun Fagan cleverly calls it , " protential " ) be formed entirely on tournament performance ?
Of course not .
That 's ridiculous .
But in a perfect world , Madness accentuates opinions we 're already thinking and feeling .
What are those things ?
I narrowed them down to 10 questions .
I do n't need all of them answered , or even most of them but if I can get three or four protential answers , I am delighted .
Question No. 1 : Does Player X pass the Foxhole Test ?
In other words , would you want him as a teammate if you were playing a pickup game to 11 with the following stakes : Losers spend the weekend in a movie theater watching a 48 - hour marathon of " The Backup Plan " ?
Kansas State 's Jacob Pullen passed this test Saturday : gamer , warrior , tough as nails , totally unafraid , bounces off bigger guys , carried KSU all game ( eight 3s ) .
Scouts are dubious because , basically , he 's a 6 - foot - tall 2 - guard .
Or so they think .
Because I see him evolving into a goofy hybrid of Kyle Lowry and Aaron Brooks : a shoot - first point guard with 3 - point range who battles on every play .
You could do worse in the second round , that 's for sure .
At least we know he 's a fighter .

Presswire With Billy Gillispie still around , Big Blue fans would n't have been treated to John Wall this past season .
( Important note : I swear on my son's life that I first wrote the previous paragraph Wednesday afternoon , a day and a half before Pullen donned the hero 's cape in Thursday night 's epic double - overtime victory over Xavier .
See ?
The Foxhole Test never fails !!!!)
One other Foxhole guy I love : John Wall .
It 's his single best quality ; he detests losing and consistently ratchets up his game in big moments .
During the SEC title game , with Kentucky trailing by two and needing to rebound an intentional free throw - miss , I watched him as the free throw was in the air , thinking " I bet John Wall finds a way to get this rebound . "
And you know what ?
He did .
That 's what I want from my Foxhole Guys : Find a way to win .
Question No. 2 : If he 's an elite guy , can he have at least one " By the way , in case you did n't know , I AM AN ELITE GUY ! " game ?
Circumstances may intervene if Player X's teammates and / or coach are n't up to the challenge ( see : Kevin Durant 's 2007 Longhorns ) .
Still , it 's always nice to know a kick - ass statement game was lurking .
Heading into the tournament , I thought Wesley Johnson was the safest lottery bet of anyone not named " Wall " or " Turner . "
But if you 're an elite prospect on a loaded team , you need to leave a trail of asses at least once , right ?
So when he slapped 31 points and 14 rebounds on Gonzaga last Saturday , I felt relieved .
Best guy on the floor .
Owned it .
That made me feel better about Wesley Johnson , Future NBA Star And One - Man Corporation .
Again , we 're all about accentuating previously conceived feelings .
Question No. 3 : If Player X is a perimeter scorer or scoring point guard , can he get to any spot he wants ?
Put it this way :
If he can't make the executive decision a few times per game of " I 'm going to beat my guy , get into the paint and get a good shot " or " I 'm getting to the rim and either scoring or they 'll have to foul me , " then it 's not happening in the pros .
Did you watch Oklahoma State play Georgia Tech ?
Poor James Anderson 's stock fell through the floor .
At least for me .
He could n't get anywhere he wanted to go .
That means four words : " Welcome to the D - League . "
On the flip side , Xavier 's Jordan Crawford did n't just score 55 points in the first two rounds or make a variety of clutch plays .
He got to his spots .
Those were 55 relatively easy points .
Crawford had been pigeonholed as a " talented with a crummy attitude " second - round prospect , but those two games changed everything .
He certainly did n't hurt his cause Thursday night , pouring in 32 points and making a game - saving 3 in the first overtime .
I guarantee every Kansas State fan was petrified of him .
So why could n't he sneak into the top 20 of this year 's draft ?
How many NBA 2 - guards make 40 percent of their 3s AND get to their spots ?
Trust me , it 's not a long list .
Of course
Question No. 4 : If there are personality " concerns " about the player , can you see those concerns manifesting themselves during games ?
It 's the " Blink " test .
Trust your first instinct .
If you do n't like the look on someone 's face , the way they carry themselves and / or the way they interact with teammates and coaches , then trust that initial red flag .
I remember seeing Eddy Curry in person for the first time ( Bulls - Celtics in 2001 ) , watching him in warm-ups and checking out of the Eddy Curry Era right then and there .
Hated the look on his face .
Part entitled , part angry , part crazy , part " I hate warming up , I wish we were eating right now . "
I was done with Eddy in three seconds .
Nobody in NBA history had ever succeeded with that specific look on his face .
Another good example : Phoenix rookie Earl Clark ( a lottery pick for Phoenix ) .
Saw him in person last month and happened to be sitting courtside .
They brought him in with about six minutes to play in a blowout .
There are three types of garbage - time rookies : the ones who think " I can't believe I do n't play more ; as soon as I get in there , I 'm gonna kick ass and make Coach regret not playing me more " ( love these guys ) ; the ones who act like the entire garbage - time experience is beneath their talents ( hate these guys ) ; and the ones who seem like they 've been zoned out for the past two hours and totally forgot there was a chance they might be playing in this game ( have no use for these guys ) .
The last version was Earl Clark .
He seemed like a nice enough guy , but he carried himself like someone who had been randomly selected from the stands to shoot a half - court shot .
What ?
You 're bringing me out there ?
Right now ?
That was it for me and Earl Clark .
Back to Crawford .
By all accounts , it sounds like he had trouble suppressing his inner a -hole this season .
Maybe dunking on LeBron last summer ( and the subsequent Internet firestorm ) was detrimental to him .
But that 's a defensible character flaw .
And a fixable one .
These are young kids .
They are easily influenced .
They have no experience handling adversity or prosperity .
Heck , on my podcast this week , Ohio State 's Mark Titus discussed how much Evan Turner changed since his freshman year , when he played with a chip on his shoulder and clashed with teammates and coaches .
Now he does n't .
What happened ?
He got older .
He matured .
He learned how to deal with other people .
What 's the difference between being a fixable head case and an unfixable head case ?
It 's simple , actually .
You can't become un -lazy .
You can't go from being clueless to having a clue .
You can't go from crazy to sane .
You can't go from selfish to selfless .
You can't go from soft to tough .
You can't go from being a knucklehead to being savvy .
You can't go from ADD to totally zoned in .
You can't go from being a DEFCON 1 hothead to a soothing presence .
But you can absolutely mature from " being an a - hole " to " not being an a - hole . "
Crawford may have had issues earlier in the season , but all we saw in the tournament was heart and swagger .
That has to count for something .
Question No. 5 : Does Player X have a meal ticket ?
[+]
Enlarge Stew Milne / US
Presswire Omar Samhan has a low - post game that should work in the NBA .
Saint Mary 's Omar Samhan intrigues me for one reason :
If you feed him the ball within seven feet of the basket , he 's scoring unless Dwight Howard is defending him .
That 's his meal ticket .
I do n't care that he 's slow , that he can't jump , that he runs like someone removed his kneecaps .
Does n't matter .
If Aaron Gray can play for 8 - 10 years in the NBA ( and he will ) , so can Samhan .
He has to be one of the best 30 - 35 guys in this draft .
Has to .
You can count the number of effective low - post scorers in the NBA on two hands .
Still , we needed to see him do it on national TV with the Madness lights shining on him .
And he did .
That brings me to something I call the Gerald Green Corollary :
You can't make it in the NBA unless you can do at least one thing exceedingly well .
Green was an incredible athlete , but he was n't good at anything .
Throw in a Gump - like basketball IQ and he never had a chance .
Meanwhile , Ty Lawson was lightning - fast in college ; nobody could stay in front of him .
Guess what ?
He 's lightning - fast in the pros .
Eric Maynor had real command of the point guard position ; he owned it , for lack of a better word .
Nobody ran a team better last season .
Guess what ?
He 's a valuable backup for a 50 - win team .
J.J. Redick shot the living crap out of the basketball in college .
Guess what ?
He 's making 39 percent of his 3s on a contender .
My favorite example :
In college , Brandon Roy felt like a lottery pick to me just because of his tricky hesitation move .
Everyone fell for it .
He 'd dribble into the paint , stutter - step , do something imperceptibly weird with his dribble , wait for the defenders to lose their balance , then either pull up for an open jumper , attack the rim or draw a foul .
You know what that told me ?
He was going to score 20 points a game in the pros .
Minimum .
Still , I wanted to see it from him in the tournament .
He dropped 28 points in 32 minutes on Utah State .
Good sign .
In Round 2 , he brought Washington back from an 11 - point second - half deficit to beat Illinois .
Our big - stage questions were answered .
He became a can 't - miss for me .
Same for Ben Gordon two years earlier , an electric scorer who could n't be stopped when he got going .
In the regional finals , he destroyed Alabama : 36 points in 39 minutes , 11 - of - 19 shooting , four 3s , 10 - of - 11 from the line .
Done .
He had to be a top - five pick after that .
Always look for that meal ticket .
( A great example from last year 's draft that I blew at the time : Memphis ' Tyreke Evans could get to any spot he wanted .
This was obvious in college , and it 's painfully obvious now .
I got caught up in dueling issues with him -- " Is he a point guard or a shooting guard ? " and " Why was he the driver in the getaway car of a shooting ? " -- and missed the basic reality of the Tyreke Evans Era .
Namely , that none of the other crap mattered .
The dude gets to the rim whenever he wants .
I am still kicking myself . )
Question No. 6 : Should we overreact because Prospect X missed the tournament or was quickly eliminated ?
No !
I 'm convinced that this was why everyone ( including me ) blew Darren Collison 's situation last spring .
Since UCLA did n't do much in the tournament ( lost by 20 in the second round to Villanova ) and Collison did n't seem to get any better from his junior year to his senior year , he lost a little luster .
Looking back , he DID have a meal ticket :
His shooting percentages were outrageous .
Sophomore year : 48 % FG , 81 % FT , 45 % 3FG
Junior year : 48 % FG , 87 % FT , 53 % 3FG
Senior year : 51 % FG , 90 % FT , 39 % 3FG
Egads !
How did we overlook him ?
Like it was his fault that he went from playing with two 2008 top - five lottery picks ( Kevin Love and Russell Westbrook ) and another guy starting right now ( Luc Richard Mbah a Moute ) to a crew of nobodies .
Which reminds me
Question No. 7 : How much are Player X's teammates making / breaking his success in the tournament ?
Five years ago , Deron Williams jumped Chris Paul on some lists ( and ended up getting drafted ahead of him ) because Illinois made the title game and Wake Forest got bounced in Round 2 .
I never thought this was fair .
Paul was so superior to his teammates that I remember feeling bad for him ; they just were n't on the same plane .
( Can you name one player Paul played with that season ?
I bet you can 't . )
I thought Paul would thrive as a pro with better teammates and in this case , I was right .
( Note : I wrote " in this case " because I have been wrong many , many , MANY times .
See : Morrison , Adam .
Actually , do n't see it .
I 'm trying to unsee it . )

The tournament did n't give us a good read on Derrick Favors ' NBA future .
This month 's ultimate " better than his teammates " example : Georgia Tech 's Derrick Favors .
For all we know , he might be the next Kevin Garnett .
( Not saying he is ; just saying that there 's no way of knowing . )
His guards were gawd - awful and could n't get him the ball .
His coach seemed uninterested in running plays through him ( although to be fair , Paul Hewitt might just be in a coma ) .
And if that was n't enough , his only good teammate played the exact same position and had his own first - round ideas .
We learned nothing from his two March Madness games .
Favors may as well have played in the 2010 Kazakhstan Cup .
Question No. 8 : If Player X had a chance to assert himself in a giant tournament game and did n't , what were the reasons ?
Look , the degrees of either " coming through " or " not coming through " are so complex , and so variable - dependent , that it 's asking a lot for the moment to mean SOMETHING .
But you never know .
That 's why we watch .
So this one gets tricky .
For instance , Kansas ' Xavier Henry disappeared in the Northern Iowa loss when -- if you were thinking about him as a sleeper for the top 10 -- that would have been an ideal time for him to announce , " Hey guys , I got this , get on my back . "
He did n't .
Did it mean anything ?
In my opinion , not really .
Sherron Collins had such a stranglehold on the 2010 Jayhawks -- they deferred to him constantly , especially in big moments -- that it was like watching a cocksure 12th - grader playing with wide - eyed ninth - and 10th - graders .
Get out of my way , I got this .
If Henry disappeared in a similarly big game as Kansas ' best player next year , I would hold it against him .
Not this year .
A different example : Cole Aldrich in that same game .
He had been playing with Collins for the past three years .
He 's a lottery pick .
He should have been able to dominate Northern Iowa down low , Samhan - style .
But it was n't in him .
Not his style .
He finished with typically solid numbers ( 13 points , 10 rebounds , two blocks , 6 - for - 8 shooting ) and never once made you say , " This guy REFUSES to let Kansas die ! "
I did n't hold it against him .
In the words of Denny Green , Cole Aldrich was who we thought he was : a complementary center who challenges shots , rebounds and scores if he gets good position .
He 's Joel Przybilla 2.0 .
And you would n't want Joel Przybilla trying to save you from the biggest upset in 16 years right ?
Along those same lines : UNC 's Marvin Williams could n't start for the 2005 national champs , but some experts wrote it off as " That 's all right , those guys were loaded ! " and maintained that he was a top - three talent .
Really ?
HE COULDN'T START FOR HIS COLLEGE TEAM !
When we watched him play six straight games at the highest level , never -- not at any point -- did I feel like I was watching the No. 2 pick in the 2005 draft .
I thought I was watching a complementary player .
Like Aldrich , actually .
If alpha - dog tendencies do n't creep out during March Madness , they are n't creeping out at the next level .
Sorry .
Question No. 9 : If Player X self - destructed , crapped the bed , melted down or disappeared , what were the reasons ?
Behind Door No. 1 : Chris Webber 's timeout and Adam Morrison 's breakdown .
In retrospect , did n't those count as window - into - the - soul moments ?
C- Webb routinely shrunk from The Moment starting with the 1993 title game , which we initially wrote off as a fluke mistake .
Maybe not .
As for Morrison , there were worries about his emotional fragility in college ; if you remember , Gonzaga 's basketball staff protected him and limited his media exposure .
When the meltdown happened , we had fun with it over the next few days -- I even defended him in a magazine column -- but nobody ever took a step back and said , " Wait a second , that was kind of weird . "
Have you watched the clip lately ?
Not even jilted " Bachelor " contestants lose their s**t like that .
Should we really have been shocked that Morrison had trouble handling adversity in the pros ?
( We 'll be back on " Hindsight is 20 / 20 With Bill Simmons " right after this !
Uh -oh , I think I just gave ESPN an idea for another talking - head show .
Let 's move on .
Quickly . )
Behind Door No. 2 : Sherron Collins ' stink bomb in the Northern Iowa game .
Collins was n't the only reason Kansas lost -- I still blame Bill Self for allowing an underdog to control the tempo and not pressuring them with a superior crew of athletes -- but his " I live for the big moments ! " résumé was basically tossed in the garbage .
He kept chucking up bricks and refusing to defer to his teammates , making him the worst kind of bad : stubbornly bad .
That one game cemented my already forming ( and dissenting ) opinion on him .
If you 're trying to find a complementary player -- which is what Collins would be in the pros -- it can't be a limited guy with an inflated view of his own talents .
Remember in last night 's Xavier - Kansas State game when Pullen was n't feeling it in the second half and turned the scoring burden over to Denis Clemente for a few minutes ?
That 's what winners do .
They do n't keep chucking it up .
Behind Door No. 3 : J.J. Redick 's stinker against LSU ( 2006 , Sweet 16 ) .
Remember him missing 15 of 18 shots , bricking his way out of the top 10 and single - handedly knocking Duke out of the tournament ?
I know was n't pretty .
Dig a little deeper and you 'll find that LSU geared its whole game plan around stopping him .
Would that ever happen at the NBA level ?
Redick was always destined to be a complementary guy , a dead - eye shooter who spreads the floor and maybe even carries your second string if you run enough picks for him .
Unlike someone like Stephen Curry , you could never gear an NBA offense around him .
So ultimately , what was the big whoopee about that LSU game ?
We learned that J.J. Redick was n't Ray Allen or Reggie Miller ?
Did n't we already know that ?
Behind Door No. 4 : Wes Johnson's " disappearance " during the Butler upset .
If you studied the play - by - play sheet only , you 'd say to yourself , " Wow , Johnson went MIA !
No shots in the last six minutes ?
What a choke job ! "
Not exactly .
He was playing for a coach who made a career out of burying his No. 1 scoring option in big games ( note : Syracuse fans are nodding grimly right now ) , and with skittish guards who lost their minds down the stretch ( Andy Rautins and Scoop Jardine combined for eight shots and three turnovers in the final six minutes ) .
As I tweeted after the game , it was like Boeheim told his team at the five - minute mark , " Guys , I want you to go out there and take the most rushed , horrible shots you possibly can . "
Johnson could n't have done anything except clothesline Rautins and Jardine to get the ball .
Which , actually , might not have been a bad idea .
Question No. 10 : Is Player X thriving during a talent - heavy season or a talent - light season ?
Should we name this the Chris Wilcox Corollary or the Jared Jeffries Corollary ?
You decide .
I do n't care .
But let 's travel back to one of the lamest college seasons ever : 2002 , when high schoolers and one - and - done guys were flooding the NBA draft , and the talent dipped so dramatically that our 2002 All - Tournament Team was
( Hold on , you 're not gonna believe this )
Wilcox .
Juan Dixon .
Dane Fife .
Lonny Baxter .
And the one , the only , Kyle Hornsby .
( You blocked it out of your mind , did n't you ?
I knew it . )
Fast - forward to that June 's draft : Wilcox goes eighth ( just ahead of Amare Stoudemire and Caron Butler ) , Jeffries ( a starter on the Indiana team that played Maryland in the championship game ) goes 11th , and Dixon goes 17th ( six spots ahead of Tayshaun Prince ) .
None of them made it .
And not to film a second episode of " Hindsight is 20 / 20 With Bill Simmons , " but maybe it was n't a great idea to overrate those title - game guys in what was clearly a septic tank of a tournament ?
Four years later , Ty Thomas boosted his lottery stock after LSU 's Final Four run in 2006 you know , the same year Morrison and Redick were the best two college players and George Mason made the Final Four .
He ended up jumping Roy and getting picked fourth .
Even better , Portland swapped his rights for No. 2 pick LaMarcus Aldridge , that year 's version of Favors ( a textbook " his teammates suck , so we have no idea how good he is " guy ) .
At the time , I fell for this one hook , line and sinker .
That 's a great trade !
Ty Thomas came through during Madness !
What the hell did Aldridge do ?
Wrong .
Lesson learned .
They call it a " talent pool " for a reason .
And that year 's pool went about two feet deep .
Special Bonus Question : How reliably do March Madness heroics translate to NBA heroics ?
One thing we definitely know :
There is n't an algebra formula that applies across the board .
There will always be can 't - miss heroes who thrive in the pros ( Carmelo Anthony , Mike Bibby , Rip Hamilton , Dwyane Wade , Ben Gordon , Joakim Noah , Al Horford , Shane Battier ) , just like there will be heroes who never match that success ( Trajan Langdon , Ed O'Bannon , Mateen Cleaves , Miles Simon ) or find the right NBA team ( Christian Laettner ) .
In a best - case scenario , Madness heroics serve as a tipping point for the way you were already leaning .
You thought they would swim instead of sink but still , it 's nice to know for sure .
You know , like with Thursday night 's Kansas State / Xavier game .
I already believed in Crawford and Pullen .
I already thought their protential was severely undervalued .
I even left the ending of this column open for them .
Just in case .
So watching them trade haymakers in the signature game of a historically entertaining tournament -- a game so electric it made " Gus Johnson " the No. 1 trending topic on Twitter -- was too good for words .
They transcended the ending I had written for them in my head .
Forget about swimming those dudes were doing the breaststroke and the butterfly .
I saw everything I needed to see .
Jordan Crawford is an NBA player .
So is Jacob Pullen .
You will never convince me otherwise .
March Madness , baby .

There is an old zen koan that says that a baby goose was placed inside a glass bottle and raised inside it .
When it was fully grown it could no longer pass through the neck of the bottle .
How can we get the goose out of the bottle without breaking it ?
It is the concept of " satori , " " revelation " .
It is something that shakes you out of your old views and takes you to a new vision .
It happens when you see something apparently impossible suddenly coming true , like the goose in the bottle suddenly appearing outside , free .
Renewables have been growing as inside a bottle so far ; a bottle made of disbelief , red tape and not enough financing .
It is time for a little satori in renewable energy .
Renewables can hold on their own with new and more efficient technologies , in particular the CdTe thin film version which may have an EROEI of 40 .
With such EROEIs , we can start thinking of renewable energy as abundant and cheap .
( image on the right from rhizome.org )
A few years ago , at a meeting on energy , I met a lady who turned out to be the environment minister for one of the county governments in Italy .
Talking with her , I started feeling a sort of cognitive dissonance .
We were using the same words : solar , wind , and the like , but with different meanings .
At some point it dawned on me : she was fully convinced that renewables do n't really produce any energy ; that wind towers and photovoltaic plants are nice toys to make environmentalists happy but that their main purpose is to create business and transfer money from one place to another .
So , she saw that her duty as environment minister was to make sure that some of the money would find its way to the goverment of her region , in exchange for the permission they gave to build the plants .
I can't really fault this lady for the way she had understood the situation ; not after I have seen expensive " cash for clunkers " programs being implemented in Italy and elsewhere .
If a government is willing to pay cash for destroying perfectly good cars in the name of the environment , one would n't be surprised if wind turbines were to turn out to be little more than souped up lava lamps .
Machines that turn and turn , but produce nothing .
This is an attitude that I have often seen in politicians and the public alike : renewables are nice toys , but little more .
When it is time to get serious , you need something real .
You can't produce energy without burning something .
You need a smokestack , somewhere , that 's why you need coal , or oil , or gas .
That explains another story I was told : that of the national minister of industry who was shown an electric heater ( about 1 kW ) powered by a 300 kW photovoltaic plant and who refused to believe what he was seeing .
" Where is the trick ? " he kept asking .
No smokestack , no energy , apparently .
You can't power the world with little blue squares facing the sun or with propellers that turn in the wind , sometimes .
Even promoters of renewables seem to see renewable energy as at best a marginal source .
Most environmentalits seem to think that the right way to go is energy saving .
That 's the real , untapped energy source that we need to exploit .
This is a respectable opinion , but I think it does n't take into account the real potential of renewables .
And that potential is truly gigantic : think of the amount of sunlight that arrives on earth everyday - you probably have heard that it is almost 10,000 times larger than the primary energy we produce today ( see here ) .
So , what prevents us from using it ?
Once you start thinking about the possibilities , you may experience a little satori , an illumination where you see renewable energy suddenly breaking free out of the bottle .
Renewables can provide as much energy as we need and it does n't have to be expensive .
After all , sunlight and wind are free and there is plenty of both .
But even a Zen satori has to be based on some good physics when it is about energy .
And , when talking renewables , the good physics is mostly contained in the concept of EROEI - energy returned for energy invested .
It is the ratio of the energy that a plant can produce over its lifetime divided by the energy needed to build it , maintain it , and dismantle it when its useful life is over .
A good energy source must have an EROEI larger than one ; obviously .
But that is not enough ; it must have an energy much larger than one if it has to provide that surplus that we need to keep up what we call " civilization " .
Now , if you look at Charles Hall 's balloon graph with a list of EROEIs for various sources , you 'll probably think that there is not much hope for renewables .
In the graph , the EROEI of PV is given as under 10 and that of wind as under 20 .
The graph is dominated by the blue balloon of " Oil , domestic , 1930 " ) which is rated as having EROEI= 100 .
If our economy has been built on oil and if oil 's EROEI is so large ( or , at least it was at that time ) then we can't expect that renewables could substitute oil and fossil fuels .
Renewables , it seems , are a marginal source at best and surely can't give us back the good times of old .
But things move on .
Charlie Hall 's graph is already outdated in some points .
The EROEI of renewables is increasing , it is actually shooting up .
Realizing how fast that is happening was a little satori for me , not more than a few months ago .
It came when I found a 2007 paper by Raugei , Bargigli and Ulgiati that evaluated the LCA of various photovoltaic technologies ( See the references at the end ) .
Then , the same authors published another paper in 2009 and in a few years the change has been remarkable .
They do n't report the EROEIs directly , but these can be approximately calculated from the values of the EPBT ( energy payback time ) .
I discussed the results with one of the authors , Marco Raugei ( incidentally , a former student of mine ) , and we arrived to the conclusion that , in favorable conditions of illumination ( 1700 kWh / ( m2 * year ) and assuming a lifetime of 30 years , polycrystalline silicon has an EROEI of 15 , while CdTe thin film cells have an EROEI of 40 .
Now , tell me if this is not enough for a good satori .
An EROEI of 40 ?
And that with a " state of the art " system ?
Yes , with CdTe cells that you can buy on the market !
I can almost hear the objections - that I am too optimistic , that the EROEI depends on the initial assumptions , and how about intermittency , and do n't you know that we passed peak tellurium ?
And so on .
But let me discuss these objections in a note at the end of this post .
For the time being , let 's take this large value of the EROEI as a working hypothesis and let 's see how we got there and what are the perspectives .
First of all , this high EROEI is the result of a breakthrough in thin film cells .
There are many ways of making thin film cells ; the advantage is that the amount of material needed is very small and that reduces the cost .
The problem is that in some cases it is the manufacturing of the cells that is expensive ; requiring , for instance , vacuum processing .
In other cases , making the cell may be cheap , but it is the efficiency of light conversion that is low ; that 's the case of many kinds of organic cells .
The low efficiency of the cells increases the cost of the installation ( called " BOS " , " balance of system " ) because larger areas are needed .
So far , thin film cells have been either too expensive or too inefficient ( or both ) .
However , in the past few years , CdTe ( cadmium telluride ) cells have reached conversion efficiencies of the order of 11 % and that has led to a commercial boom all over the world .
A breakthrough , indeed , compounded by further advantages of the CdTe technology : that of being less sensitive than silicon cells to high temperatures , and that of being more efficient in capturing diffuse light .
First Solar , the company that makes CdTe cells , is now the second largest producer of solar cells in the world , with a yearly production corresponding to about 1.2 GW peak power .
Plans have been announced for reaching 1.8 GW by 2012 .
So , we are n't yet at the EROEI = 100 of oil in the 1930 , but the progress in this area has been remarkable .
And if PV based on CdTe can have an EROEI of 40 , what prevents us from getting much higher values , using the same or other thin film PV technologies ?
And not just photovoltaic cells are susceptible of breakthroughs .
Not long ago , I had another satori when I reviewed the situation with Airborne Wind Energy ( AWE ) and in particular the implementation called Kitegen .
Here , we are talking of prototypes still under costruction , but the simulations are extremely promising - the EROEI could well be over 100 .
At these EROEI levels , well , the goose is really out of the bottle ( and the bottle is not broken ) .
Of course we can't yet claim that the energy problem is solved .
We may have high EROEI renewable sources , but we still have to build up the infrastructure needed to build and deploy the plants ; we need to build up a " smart grid " system that can manage power production in such a way to overcome the intermittency problem ; we need also to restructure our economy in such a way that it can use electric power instead of fossil fuels for such things as transportation .
It can be done , but it is not at all obvious that it can be done before running out of the resources needed for doing it , that is of fossil fuels .
But it is not impossible .
It is a fighting chance , but it is there .
Note :
The calculation of the EROEI depends on where exactly you take the " boundaries " of the system and that we still do n't have rules on this point ( see this paper by Charles Hall ) .
But as long as we compare different technologies then we can compare the relative EROEIs and that has a meaning if the same methodologies have been applied ; which is the case here .
About PV in general , I know that we need to take into account the question of storage , but that is very often overstated and PV is not supposed to be the only technology used for energy production .
PV would be embedded in a mix of different sources over large areas that would compensate each other .
The concept of of " smart grid " would provide the necessary management of the energy produced and consumed .
Then , I know that the value of EROEI=40 it is obtained under rather optimistic assumptions : that the plant is located in a well irradiated area ( e.g. Southern Europe or North Africa ) and that it has a lifetime of 30 years .
Optimistic , perhaps , but realistic as well .
You CAN place these plants in Southern Europe , North Africa or Southern US and their lifetime can exceed thirty years if they are decently maintained .
So , we are not talking futuristic applications - it is reality .
Then , there are other objections that one can make to CdTe technology ; that it needs the rare element tellurium , that cadmium is toxic and what happens in case of fire ; etc .
All reasonable objections , but notice that these very problems imply that there is a tremendous stimulus to recover and recycle the materials used .
Finally , if one thin film technology can be made commercial , it is reasonable to think that there are more that can reach the same level .

The Pope will address three open air masses while in the UK
Roman Catholic churchgoers are being urged to help meet a shortfall of more than £ 3 m in funding for Pope Benedict 's visit to the UK .
The Church has asked them to put at least £ 1 m in Sunday 's collection - largely to pay for three big open air masses at which the Pope will preside .
Because this is a state visit by Pope Benedict XVI , the bulk of the cost is being borne by the UK government .
The Papal visit will cost £ 15 m , not including extra policing and security .
The Church 's share of the cost is £ 7 m , and with slightly less than half of it raised , congregations are being asked to contribute via the collection plate .
Most of the money will be spent on three open - air masses which the Church says could attract up to 400,000 people in total .
One of the masses will form the high point of the Pope 's visit - the beatification of Cardinal John Henry Newman at Coventry Airport on 19 September .
Secularist groups have criticised the use of taxpayers ' money to fund the visit of a religious leader .

But normal people live in Utah too
The notion quickly gained some traction among supporters who agreed with the Republican 's assessment that many seniors frittered away their final year of high school , but faced vehement opposition from other quarters ...
I do n't know if he 's related to the Buttars family of South Park but Utah state Senator Chris Buttars has made quite the name for himself over the years as one of his benighted state 's most racist , most homophobic and most delusional legislators .
He first came to prominence outside of his own lunatic asylum of a state by proposing a bill to teach " Divine Design " in the Utah public schools .
No , not a cross between John Waters and HBTV ; this was his idea of countering Darwin 's Theory of Evolution .
It is n't the only time he 's tried interfering in the school system .
When he introduced a bill to ban gay bars and gay dance clubs , he threw in a ban on gay - straight alliances in public schools to boot .
Even the Mormon Church was embarrassed enough by him to issue an official statement reminding their followers that " Senator Buttars does not speak for the church .
" Well , yesterday he was on his anti-education jihad again .
This time he 's trying to eliminate 12th grade .
Education , of course , has always been the biggest enemy of superstitions , religionist hucksters and conservatives like Buttars and the Utah Republican Party .
I do n't know if Bill Maher has ever heard of Buttars but he sure seemed to be talking about him the other night on his HBO special :

Movie actresses and entertainers such as Demi Moore , Madonna , Halle Berry , and Susan Sarandon have popularized the ' cougar ' culture of older women marrying younger men .
From a life expectancy standpoint of such a relationship , researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research ( DPIDR ) , in Rostock , Germany , studied two million Danish couples .
They found that women have the longest life expectancy when they marry a man of their exact same age ( plus or minus one or two years ) .
An older husband shortens her life expectancy , and a younger husband shortens her life expectancy even more .
The German study , lead by Swedish sociologist Sven Drefahl , who is also associated with the Department of Sociology at Stockholm University , stated that there is an approximate 20 % decrease in life expectancy when a woman marries a man 7 to 9 years younger than her , and almost the same percentage decrease in life expectancy when she marries a man 7 to 17 years older than her .
Is this bad news for women marrying older or younger men also poignant for men ?
The May 13 , 2010 Forbes article ' The Cougar Backlash , ' states , ' As if that is n't bad enough , the study also concludes that this early death syndrome affects only women who marry outside their immediate age range .
Not so for men who have years added to their lives when they marry younger women . '
Page two concludes .
The German article was published in May 2010 within the journal Demography , which is a publication of the non-profit professional organization of demographers called Population Association of America .
For additional information on the subject , please read the May 13 , 2010 Bloomberg / Business Week article ' Women Who Marry Younger Men May Die Earlier .' Dr. Dretahl is quoted in the article .
He states , " One of the few possible explanations is that couples with younger husbands violate social norms and thus suffer from social sanctions . "
Global warming could make the world a more violent place , because higher temperatures increase human aggression and create volatile situations , a new study says .
The report combined government data about average yearly temperatures with statistics on the number of violent crimes committed between 1950 and 2008 .
Based on those records , the authors estimate that if the average temperature in the U.S. increases by 8 degrees Fahrenheit ( 4.4 degrees Celsius ) , the country 's murder and assault rate will jump by about a hundred thousand cases a year .
A 2007 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projected that global surface temperatures could rise by 2 to 11.5 degrees Fahrenheit ( 1.1 to 6.4 degrees Celsius ) by 2100 if no mitigating steps are taken .
Brad Bushman , a psychologist at the University of Michigan who specializes in human aggression , agreed .
" Hot temperatures make people cranky and irritable , " said Bushman , who did not participate in the new research .
" Cranky , irritable people are prone to aggression . "
Warming 's Indirect Influences on Behavior
But literal warming is just one way temperature changes can influence human behavior , study co-author DeLisi noted .
For example , people tend to go outside more when the weather is warmer , which leads to more social interactions .
" In the summer , when people are out , you 're going to have more opportunities for people to engage in crimes , " DeLisi said .
In addition , changes in weather patterns triggered by global warming could lead to increased poverty , food insecurity , and malnutrition — all of which are risk factors for the development of aggression in violence - prone individuals , DeLisi added .
Global warming could also precipitate violence by increasing " eco migration , " or migration forced by some cataclysmic environmental event , he said .
( See " Climate Change Creating Millions of ' Eco Refugees , ' UN Warns . " )
" Displacement and migration of people across borders can potentially lead to a lot more human conflict , " DeLisi said .
For example , in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina , many people from New Orleans moved to Houston .
Shortly afterward , Houston saw a spike in the number of homicides , which officials mostly attribute to clashes between displaced New Orleans gangs and Houston gangs , DeLisi said .
If these types of skirmishes occur on a global scale , the result could be increased civil unrest — and even genocide and war , noted the study authors , who presented their work last week at the Sydney Symposium of Social Psychology in Australia .
Global Warming to Make Us Hot and Bothered ?
Previous studies back up the notion that global warming could heighten aggression , said Ehor Boyanowsky , a criminal psychologist at Simon Fraser University in Canada who was not involved in the new report .
" My own research has shown that elevated ambient temperatures lead to increased brain temperatures that result in cognitive dysfunction , emotional stress , and aggression , and to higher levels of violent crime , " Boyanowsky said .
Heat also has the strange effect of upping physiological conditions — increasing heart rate , for example — while simultaneously making people think they are less energetic , added the University of Michigan 's Bushman .
Muscle Building Adventures In An Insane Industry
Anyone who has been in the health and fitness industry for even a short amount of time , know that there is so much insanity when it comes to getting the facts right about …literally everthing .
And when it comes to the world of building muscle it ’s even crazier !
Experts disagree with each other , people bicker and complain on Internet forums , and facts and fiction blur together .
So called “ scientific tests ” or “ control studies ” all undermine each other .
No one really knows what is going on …
Supplement companies make crazy claims and spread lies to catch people in their marketing web and get them spending money on crap they do not need .
Bodybuilders advise non bodybuilders how to train like them .
Inexperienced guys hang out at the gym peddling the latest workout they read about in Muscle Fitness Magazine that is neither right for them or suited for their level of experience .
Guys pack themselves into gyms working out 6 days of the week and never get fully recovered and wonder why they do n’t grow … the list goes on and on !
Is there a way out of the clouds of confusion that are settling down around guys in gyms everywhere ?
Although we all have different goals for working out I think we can agree on the main ones : to put on muscle and look and feel damn good when the mirror reflects our image back to us ?
It may be hard to get the results you want with the overload of information and advice that is being dished out but all hope is not lost …
Somehow we all have to fight our way through the madness to find out the truth .
It usually happens by accident and other times it is planned .
Results are realized when we stick to proven workouts , diets and tips that have consistently worked throughout the years .
There is usually no hype or B.S. to get you pumped up about something that flat out does not work .
Just age old wisdom that utilizes real world results so that you can finally achieve the results you were after all along .
But even this is not enough though !
You have to put on your metaphorical blinders and ear muffs to keep blocking out all the illusions and deceptions that could seduce you off your newly chosen path that you are on .
Forget the marketing ploys of supplement companies .
Forget jumping between workouts every few weeks .
Forget listening to the thousands of voices at the gym , on the Internet , all around you and even your inner demons .
Forget everything that takes you away from the path of results !
Find the right training program for your body and experience level and stick to it .
Screw everything else !
Until you get your diet , workout , recovery , mindset and lifestyle habits optimized forget about things such as supplements as they wo n’t do a thing for you if do n’t get the main factors sorted out and optimized .
Workout hard , play the game of life at 100 % intensity and stop trying to be so damn perfect …aim to be outstanding instead .
Dream big and attach bridges to those dreams so you can walk across them and turn those dreams into reality .
Keep raging against the B.S. in the bodybuilding and muscle building world and stay true to yourself and commit to following the path that is right for you .
If there is no path to follow then learn from others and then blaze your own trail .
Stay focused and you will make the impossible happen …
All the best on your muscle building adventure !
I hope you enjoyed the post ,

Excellent ... Doug Short ( Dshort.com ) has updated his excellent mega - bears chart to take into account last week 's big drop in the stock market .
As you can see , from a timing perspective , it lines up fairly nicely with a major leg down in the Nikkei ( when our peak is overlaid with theirs ... he uses the peak of the .com bubble to show our one true peak ) .
So if we have a sharp rebound then our path does n't look anything like theirs .
On the other hand , if we keep falling , then there 's a scary historical precedent about what could lie ahead .
Alright
Im not going to try and take credit for this but its incredible and will make everyone here understand life better .
Here goes :
A boat docked in a tiny Mexican village .
An American tourist complimented the Mexican fisherman on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took him to catch them .
" Not very long , " answered the Mexican .
" But then , why did n't you stay out longer and catch more ? " asked the American .
The Mexican explained that his small catch was sufficient to meet his needs and those of his family .
The American asked , " But what do you do with the rest of your time ? "
" I sleep late , fish a little , play with my children , and take a siesta with my wife .
In the evenings , I go into the village to see my friends , have a few drinks , play the guitar , and sing a few songs .
I have a full life . "
The American interrupted , " I have an MBA from Harvard and I can help you !
You should start by fishing longer every day .
You can then sell the extra fish you catch .
With the extra revenue , you can buy a bigger boat . "
" And after that ? " asked the Mexican .
" With the extra money the larger boat will bring , you can buy a second one and a third one and so on until you have an entire fleet of trawlers .
Instead of selling your fish to a middle man , you can then negotiate directly with the processing plants and maybe even open your own plant .
You can then leave this little village and move to Mexico City , Los Angeles , or even New York City !
From there you can direct your huge new enterprise . "
" How long would that take ? " asked the Mexican .
" Twenty , perhaps twenty - five years , " replied the American .
" And after that ? "
" Afterwards ?
Well my friend , that 's when it gets really interesting , " answered the American , laughing .
" When your business gets really big , you can start buying and selling stocks and make millions ! "
" Millions ?
Really ?
And after that ? " asked the Mexican .
" After that you 'll be able to retire , live in a tiny village near the coast , sleep late , play with your children , catch a few fish , take a siesta with your wife and spend your evenings drinking and enjoying your friends . "
And the moral of this story is : .........
Know where you 're going in life ... you may already be there .

Last summer , Saudi Arabia put the final bolt in its largest oil expansion project ever , opening a new field capable of pumping 1.2 million barrels a day — more than the entire production of Texas .
The field , called Khurais , was part of an ambitious $ 60 billion program to increase the kingdom ’s production to meet growing energy needs .
It turns out the timing could not have been worse for Saudi Arabia .
Only two years ago , consumers were clamoring for more supplies , OPEC producers were straining to increase their output , and prices were rising to record levels .
But now , for the first time in more than a decade , the world has more oil than it needs .
As demand slumped because of the global recession , Saudi Arabia was forced to shut about a quarter of its production .
After raising its capacity to 12.5 million barrels a day , Saudi Arabia is now pumping about 8.5 million barrels a day , its lowest level since the early 1990s .
“ 2009 was painful for us as it was for everybody else , ” said Khalid A. al - Falih , the president and chief executive of Saudi Aramco , the kingdom ’s state - owned oil giant , and a company veteran who was promoted to the top post at the beginning of last year .
“ We experienced the same cash flow constraints that everybody did .
But we adjusted quickly and , certainly , everything that was strategic to us was not touched . ”
Sparrow hawk tries to kill the ordinary way but fails .
Than it sees the pool and - simply - drowns the magpie .
I did n't know they use this tactic .
A newly declassified document has added to long - standing questions about whether Henry Kissinger , while secretary of State , halted a U.S. plan to curb a secret program of international assassinations by South American dictators .
The document , a set of instructions cabled from Kissinger to his top Latin American deputy , ended efforts by U.S. diplomats to warn the governments of Chile , Uruguay and Argentina against involvement in the covert plan known as Operation Condor , according to Peter Kornbluh , an analyst with the National Security Archive , a private research organization that uncovered the document and made it public Saturday .
In the cable , dated Sept. 16 , 1976 , Kissinger rejected delivering a proposed warning to the government of Uruguay about Condor operations and ordered that “ no further action be taken on this matter ” by the State Department .
Five days after Kissinger ’s message , Chilean exile Orlando Letelier and an American colleague were killed in Washington ’s Embassy Row in a car bombing later tied to Chilean secret police working through the Condor network .
The killings are considered one of the most brazen attacks ever carried out in the capital .
“ The document confirms that it ’s Kissinger ’s complete responsibility for having rescinded a cease - and - desist order to Condor killers , ” said Kornbluh , author of a 2004 book on Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet .
In a statement , Kissinger said Kornbluh “ distorted ” the meaning of the cable and said it was intended only to disapprove a specific approach to the Uruguayan government , not to cancel the plan to issue warnings to other nations in the Condor network .
Former State Department officials who worked under Kissinger during that period now say that his cable did interrupt the U.S. effort to rein in Operation Condor , not just with Uruguay but with other countries in the region .
After being told of the existence of Condor by the CIA in mid-1976 , Kissinger initially ordered U.S. ambassadors in Chile , Argentina , Uruguay and other countries involved in the network to issue demarches , or formal diplomatic presentations , warning leaders that “ Condor activities would undermine relations with the United States . ”
“ The instructions were never rescinded , ” Kissinger said in his statement .
But it has been known for many years that U.S. ambassadors to Chile and Uruguay balked at delivering the demarches , stalling the effort to head off Condor .
The Uruguayan envoy feared for his own safety , previously disclosed documents have shown , and U.S. officials were devising a new way to deliver the U.S. warning to Montevideo .
Kissinger said his cable was intended only to delay the delivery of the demarche to Uruguay , because of “ very special circumstances . ”
He apparently was referring to the Uruguayan ambassador ’s fears .
However , shortly after Kissinger ’s order that “ no further action be taken , ” his top Latin America deputies moved to cancel U.S. warnings to other countries as well .
On Sept. 20 , then - Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Harry Shlaudeman told his deputy , William Luers , to inform U.S. ambassadors in countries involved in Condor not to convey Washington ’s concerns about the operation .
The Letelier bombing occurred the next day .
There is no evidence that Kissinger knew of the Letelier plot or the specifics of any other assassination plans .
But the delays in issuing the demarches meant Chile apparently received no high - level U.S. warning about Condor before the bombing .
Shlaudeman said in an interview that he had no memory of the cable from Kissinger or of his own subsequent message to Luers rescinding the orders to make demarches about Condor .
But he acknowledged that the timing and the similar wording of the two documents were strong evidence that he had acted on Kissinger ’s orders .
“ I must have sent it because I got the cable from Henry , ” he said .
“ I was carrying out my instructions . ”
Luers acknowledged that the demarches “ were not carried out in Chile , Uruguay and Argentina before Orlando Letelier ’s murder . ”
Letelier served as Chilean ambassador to the U.S. and foreign minister in the administration of Salvador Allende , a democratically elected socialist president who was deposed by Pinochet in a 1973 coup .
At the time of his death , Letelier worked at the Institute for Policy Studies , a Washington think tank , and was a leading anti-Pinochet activist in the U.S.
An institute colleague , Ronni Moffitt , also died in the bombing .
Scholars who have studied U.S. policy toward South America during this period say that Kissinger was reluctant to pressure right - wing authoritarian governments such as Pinochet ’s in the region ; he saw them as bulwarks against the leftist and communist movements in Latin America .
“ I think the document reinforces what we already know -- that Kissinger wanted to downplay Condor , ” said Jeremi Suri , a history professor at the University of Wisconsin and author of a 2007 book on Kissinger .
“ His primary concern was to maintain good and . . . productive relationships with Chile , Argentina and Uruguay .
Condor was seen as an irritant . ”
The hesitant U.S. response to Condor and to other human rights abuses by these regimes had lasting consequences , Suri argues .
“ It inadvertently gave a green light to these dictators , who believed the U.S. did n’t care if they went ahead with their terrorist operations , ” he said , and it hurt the reputation of the U.S. with the people of the region , who saw Washington as complicit in the years of repression .
Had the demarches been delivered as originally ordered , said J. Patrice McSherry , a professor of political science at Long Island University and author of a 2005 book on Operation Condor , the deaths of Letelier and Moffitt might have been prevented .
“ No one can say for sure .
But it ’s quite possible that it would have been a major deterrent . ”

Thanks , everybody , for making confessing everything on Facebook seem so normal .
Despite " connecting " us more securely with others online , social networking has made our real - life , non-online identities more insecure than ever .
The European Parliament has published the draft text of the controversial anti-counterfeiting trade agreement ( Acta ) which promises new sanctions against people who download copyright material .
The US , Europe and other countries have been negotiating the agreement in secret for the past two years .
Acta aims to stop trade in counterfeit goods , as well as piracy of intellectual property such as music , film , videos and software .
Sponsored largely by Hollywood and the music industry , the Obama administration once said the substance of the negotiations was a national secret .
The text aims to get principles of the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act written into international law .
It includes " special measures related to technological enforcement of intellectual property in the digital environment " .
These include " technical measures " such as bandwidth reduction , blocking and account termination of alleged infringing internet users .
However , the text clearly calls for internet service providers to police copyright infringers by filtering their traffic and removing infringing material .
Critics say this might affect material that is naturally available under " fair use " terms , as well as material whose owner is unknown .
Many of the procedures and penalties sought in Acta are the same as those sought by the music industry in the run-up to the Digital Economy Act , which was rammed through the UK parliament just before it rose for the election .
Digital lobby group La Quadrature du Net said publication of the text did not legitimise it .
" Transparency is no excuse for political laundering and the circumvention of democratic processes , " it said in a statement .
La Quadrature co-founder Jérémie Zimmermann said leaks ( first published on whistleblower website Wikileaks ) had shown that Acta could " dangerously hinder " freedom of expression , access to medicines and innovation throughout the world .
" This official release suggests that it is still the case .
We must firmly refuse that unelected officials devise policies that have an impact on such critical societal issues , " he said .
Open Rights Group campaigner Florian Leppla said the publication did not reveal the negotiating positions of individual countries .
" We wo n't know who is pushing for the most dangerous enforcement policies , " he said .
" What we need now is an open process that allows consumer and citizens groups to influence what is in the document . "
He said Open Rights Group would work with other consumer and civil rights groups such as Consumer Focus , the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) and La Quadrature du Net to analyse the text and plan further moves .
Acta aims to stop trade in counterfeit goods , as well as piracy of intellectual property such as music , film , videos and software .

The
has approved a preliminary
that would require schools to build in 30 minutes of daily moderate to vigorous physical activity into the school day , in addition to physical education classes .
The proposal also requires schools to get the junk food out of schools by establishing baseline nutritional standards for foods sold in vending machines and through fundraisers .
The increased emphasis on nutritional foods and physical activity requirements stem from concern about the growing childhood obesity epidemic in Pennsylvania and the associated health problems related to it .
State Health Secretary Everette James said he has reviewed other states ' nutritional and physical education requirements and said this proposal , if enacted , would put Pennsylvania 's among the strongest .
" The research is clear : young people need at least 60 minutes of physical activity every day , " said State Board of Education Chairman Joe Torsella .
" With children spending nearly one - third to one - half of their waking hours in school each day , we have an obligation to meet them halfway on a critical public health goal . "
The Pennsylvania School Boards Association voiced concern about trying to squeeze that activity into the already packed school day .
But some school officials indicated if increased physical activity is made a priority , schools find a way to make the time - before school , after school , during the lunch break , study halls and even as part of other classes .
Helmut Hoffer von Ankershoffen und Stephan Odörfer zeigen ein sichtlich betatschtes Vorseriengerät .
( Bild : heise online )
Noch ruckelt es ein bisschen .
In Details sind Soft - und Hardware des neuen WePad noch nicht perfekt abgestimmt .
Doch immerhin stört auf der zweiten Präsentation des iPad-Konkurrenten am Montag in Berlin keine Windows - Fehlermeldung das Bild .
Für die frisch gegründete WePad GmbH zeigen Helmut Hoffer von Ankershoffen und Stephan Odörfer ihr Baby noch einmal der Presse , um nach dem PR - Desaster der ersten Präsentation vor zwei Wochen dem Verdacht entgegenzutreten , das WePad sei nur heiße Luft .
Ist es nicht .
Zwar sind Software und Gerät noch nicht ganz serienreif , doch konnte der Hersteller mit drei einzeln gefertigten Vorseriengeräten einen guten Eindruck von seinem WePad vermitteln .
Ein paar wackelige Details an dem kompakten Tablet verraten noch den Vorserienstatus , doch sollen diese kleinen Schönheitsfehler bis zur Großserienproduktion ausgebügelt werden .
Auch an der Software wird noch gefeilt .
Doch dem genannten Ziel , im August große Stückzahlen ausliefern zu können , " steht nichts im Weg " , betont Ankershoffen .
Dafür steht auch ein bekannter Auftragsfertiger , dessen Namen die WePad - Macher nicht nennen .
Es gilt allerdings als offenes Geheimnis , dass das WePad von der Asus - Fertigungstochter Pegatron gebaut wird – so erklären sich auch gewisse Ähnlichkeiten mit dem technisch vergleichbaren ExoPC , der wohl aus der gleichen Schmiede stammt .
Das WePad , betont Ankershoffen , habe mit dem kanadischen Gerät nicht viel zu tun .
Auf dem ExoPC soll Windows 7 mit einer Touch - UI laufen , beim WePad ist das anders .
Die Software macht den Unterschied .
Das WePad mit Daumen - Scrolling in Aktion .
( Bild : heise online )
Das System setzt auf Linux : Auf den gezeigten Geräten schimmerte stellenweise – etwa beim Booten – eine nicht ganz unbekannte Distribution durch .
Die soll bis zur Serienfertigung noch ersetzt werden – welches Linux es schließlich sein wird , wollen die Macher noch nicht verraten .
Auf dem deutschen Tablet läuft aber " mehr als nur ein Linux mit einem Touch - Layer " , erklärt Odörfer .
Die Software sei eng mit dem Linux - System verwoben , sagt der Vorstand der Münchner 4tiitoo AG , die das " WePad OS " entwickelt .
Das WePad hat eine zentrale Oberfläche , auf der Anwendungen und Weblinks wie Widgets abgelegt werden .
Gelungen ist die " Daumen - Steuerung " über Navigationsflächen am Display - Rand :
Mit dem rechten Daumen scrollt man über die WePad - Oberfläche , ruft die Übersicht der laufenden Anwendungen ( " echtes Multitasking " , betont Ankershoffen ) oder die App - Verwaltung auf und holt die virtuelle Tastatur nach oben .
In den Anwendungen selbst lässt sich dann mit dem linken Daumen scrollen - natürlich auch mit den anderen Fingern auf dem kapazitiven Touch - Display .
Im Prinzip kann das WePad Multitouch und Gesten .
Kernanwendungen wie Browser oder Mediaplayer sind für Touch - Bedienung und das WePad angepasste Open - Source - Lösungen .
Bei anderen Anwendungen wird der Bedienkomfort davon abhängen , ob und wie sie für die Touch - Oberfläche angepasst werden .
Einfach die Maussteuerung mit Touch - Eingaben zu ersetzen wird da nicht ausreichen – hier hat Apple mit der konsequenten Touch - Implementierung klar die Marke gesetzt , an der sich auch das WePad messen lassen muss .
Das ruckelt alles noch ein bisschen , soll mit der finalen Software - Fassung aber ebenso glattgebügelt werden wie die wackelige Flash - Wiedergabe .
Dazu laufen auf dem WePad auch Adobe - Air - Anwendungen in einer Laufzeitumgebung .
An der Integration von Android wird noch gearbeitet .
In der gezeigten Entwicklungsversion laufen die Smartphone - Apps noch auf einer sichtbaren virtuellen Maschine .
Die soll noch verschwinden , die Android - Anwendungen dann " tiefer liegen " und näher am Betriebssystem laufen , wie Odörfer erklärt .
Der Benutzer soll von Laufzeitumgebungen und Systemebenen allerdings gar nichts mitbekommen .
Alle Anwendungen – ob Android , Adobe Air oder Linux – sollen über den " Meta - Store " des Herstellers zu beziehen sein .
Mit ein paar Tippern auf dem Display ist so eine App aus dem Store auf die gerasterte WePad - Oberfläche geholt , davon konnte man sich heute schon überzeugen .
Anders als Apple beim iPad lässt das WePad sich auch über SD - Karten oder USB - Sticks befüllen .
Auch mit gängiger USB - Peripherie kann das WePad was anfangen .
Tastatur , Maus oder Speichersticks sollen kein Problem sein , bei speziellerer USB - Hardware muss erst die Kompatibilität der Treiber gewährleistet werden .
Wer will , kann das WePad auch im " Experten - Modus " bedienen und hat dann vollen Zugriff auf das System , inklusive der Linux - Einstellungen .
Damit lassen sich dann auch Anwendungen installieren , die nicht aus dem Meta - Store stammen .
" Wir wollen kein geschlossenes System wie Apple " , sagt Ankershoffen .
Von der offiziellen " Jail - Break " - Möglichkeit versprechen sich die WePad - Macher auch Impulse aus der Entwickler - Community .
Für Experten , die im entsprechenden Modus an ihrem WePad basteln , leistet der Hersteller dann allerdings keinen Software - Support mehr .
Der Hardware - Support bleibt davon unberührt – den soll dem Vernehmen nach Medion übernehmen .
Das WePad kann ab Dienstag vorbestellt werden .
Wer zuerst bestellt , soll auch als erster ein Gerät bekommen , wenn die ersten Seriengeräte in kleineren Stückzahlen erhältlich sind , verspricht Ankershoffen .
Das WePad wird es als Modell mit WLAN für 449 Euro und als UMTS - Modell mit Standard - SIM - Schacht und HD - Grafikchip für 569 geben .
Zum Lieferumfang gehören WePad , Netzteil sowie Sleeve und Reinigungstuch .
Ein Dock mit Port - Replikator gibt es als Zubehör , einen Preis dafür nannte der Hersteller noch nicht .

How to Get Your Own Element Collection Home
From time to time , people ask me how to put together an element collection , or how much it would cost if they wanted me to make another table for them .
To the latter question my answer is that I 'm in the software business , not the furniture business , but hey , start writing zeros on the napkin and I 'll tell you when to stop .
To the former question , I have several answers .
One nice thing about collecting elements is that there is n't a company constantly manufacturing more of them for you to collect , like there is with Beany Babies and the like .
You can actually finish at some point , if you stop at elements with a halflife of at least a year .
Many people who collect elements concentrate on natural mineral samples containing them , and others concentrate on ultra-pure samples .
An example of the former is Jim Marshall from the University of North Texas , who actually takes his element collection on tour sponsored by the American Chemical Society .
He has a wonderful book and CD about it and he plans to publish a new one that will include the GPS coordinates of where each of the elements was originally discovered , so you can go visit there yourself .
An example of a pure - element collector is David Franco who has sent me many very nice and very pure elements for my collection .
Another option is to collect interesting things that have some element in them , even if it 's not especially pure or natural .
That 's the way I 've decided to go .
For example , I have spark plugs that contain yttrium not because they are a good representative sample of yttrium but rather because I think it 's bizarre and interesting that anyone would make a spark plug containing yttrium .
In fact , I have a whole sub-collection of spark plug elements .
Depending on your interests , here are some different ways of putting together an element collection :
2. Buy My Poster
I publish a photographic periodic table poster with pictures taken from my collection .
Sometimes pictures are frankly more interesting than real samples , which can be too small to see well in person .
And posters do n't have any health and safety issues :
You can put one up anywhere , even in places where radioactive elements would raise eyebrows .
Here 's what it looks like ( click to go to a page where you can see larger versions or order your own copy ) :
You can buy a copy right now !
3. Buy Elements from a Chemical Supplier
There are several full - line chemical supply houses that sell virtually every element in any number of different forms ( ingots , powders , sheets , rods , you name it ) .
They generally offer a range of purities from 95 % to 99.99999 + % , at a range of prices .
This is a pretty expensive way to get elements :
You 're paying a premium for guaranteed purity and careful packaging .
And they are generaly not interested in selling to individuals , preferring to deal with companies and research institutions .
Chemical companies of this nature used to be the only way to get some of the more exotic elements , but these days eBay is surprisingly comprehensive .
4. Scrounge around on eBay , at Walmart , Hardware stores , etc .
If you look through the list of sources and contributors of the elements in my collection , you 'll see that I got a large number of them from one of two sources : Walmart and eBay .
In fact , I have a special list of all the elements you can get at Walmart specifically .
If you want to follow this path , you can use my list of sources as a starting point :
Many of the eBay sellers are repeat sellers who probably have an element or two on offer right now .
I 've gotten so involved in element collecting that I now , in partnership with Max Whitby of the RGB Company , offer a line of museum - quality element samples on eBay .
Our samples are high - end : Not the cheapest but definitely the best .
Many are sealed in argon - purged glass ampoules , for example .
Another good seller is David Franco , who also has a non eBay web page : http://elements.daemon.net and an email address of .
You 'll want to use eBay 's search feature to find new sellers and new kinds of objects .
Some elements are easy to search for because no one uses their name unless they 're selling that element .
Other elements , like vanadium , are a pain because there are hundreds and hundreds of listings for things made of chrome - vanadium steel , for example .
You have to throw in terms like " pure " , or " chemical " to limit the search .
You could search just in the appropriate categories of lab supplies , scientific collectibles , etc .
But then you 'd miss the most interesting objects , like this antique Foo Lion incense burner made of antimony .
There are certain objects , like this one , for which there did not exist a mechanism by which one could possibly find one , before the invention of eBay .
Think about it :
Where on earth would you go if you wanted an antimony Foo Lion incense burner , if not eBay ?
The harder ones , scandium , promethium , most of the rare earths , are usually not available this way , except from a small number of sellers like David Franco ( see above ) .
In my case , I also got an incredible amount of support from people who thought my web site was fun and offered to trade or donate elements .
I think I tapped into a rich vein of people who had had an element or two around the house for a decade or three and were actually kind of relieved to find someone who would give it a good home .
If you can't find people like that , you may be forced to use method # 1 or # 2 to complete your collection .
As long as you keep the number of elements you buy from a chemical supplier to a minimum , the cost wo n't be too outrageous .
Or you could buy one of the complete sets after you give up on the rare ones .
This little guy is pretty remarkable : a fixed - wing aerial drone that lands by clinging vertically to a wall , and takes off from the same position .
I 'm not saying this is the future of spy planes — but it should be .
Advertisement
The Perching Project comes from the Biomimetics and Dexterous Manipulation Lab at Stanford University , and uses small spines to attach itself to rough surfaces .
The drone approaches the wall at speeds of up to 22 mph .
As it nears contact , it sharply cuts its speed down to 7 mph , tilting its body upwards so that landing legs can grab hold .
And if you think the effect is impressive now , get a load of its creator 's ultimate vision :
A flock of small , unmanned air vehicles flies quietly into a city , maneuvering among the buildings .
They communicate as they search for places to land , not on streets or flat rooftops but on the sides of buildings and under the eaves , where they can cling , bat or insect - like , in safety and obscurity ...
The fliers stay attached for hours or days , consuming little power and emitting no sound as they monitor the area .
When finished , they launch themselves with a jump and become airborne again , ready for their next mission .

The lesson : be kind to any biomimeticists you know .
And if you 've wronged one in the past , keep a close eye on your walls .

The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday announced a gradual but potentially far - reaching effort to reduce the amount of salt Americans consume in a bid to combat high blood pressure , heart disease , strokes and other health problems that have soared to near - epidemic proportions .
The FDA ’s efforts will begin by seeking voluntary cutbacks by the food industry .
But ultimately , the agency may resort to regulating acceptable levels of sodium in food and beverages .
“ Nothing is off the table , ” said FDA spokeswoman Meghan Scott .
“ Everyone ’s in agreement that something needs to be done … .
We just do n’t know what it ’s going to look like . ”
The FDA ’s decision was applauded by public health advocacy groups and scientists , who have long pointed up the link between high salt intake and a host of serious – and costly – medical problems .
But it was also criticized by some industry groups , and some conservative political leaders denounced it as another government assault on personal freedom .
The deliberate pace sketched by the FDA , and the absence of any immediate plans to issue regulations , were in contrast to a strongly worded report concurrently released Tuesday by the Institute of Medicine , the health arm of the National Academy of Sciences .
The institute declared that expeditious “ regulatory action is necessary ” because efforts to educate the public about the perils of excessive dietary salt and voluntary sodium - cutting efforts by industry have failed , although the institute called for such regulations to take effect gradually .
On a daily basis , Americans consume almost 50 % more than the roughly one teaspoon of salt recommended as a maximum by the federal government ’s 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans , according to the institute ’s report .
Sodium intake is “ simply too high to be safe , ” said Dr. Jane E. Henney , former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration and chairwoman of the institute committee that produced the report .
“ Clearly , salt is essential . …
We need it .
But the level we ’re taking in right now is far beyond the maximal levels we need . ”
The 14 - member panel ’s findings , more than a year in the making , come on the heels of a welter of studies tallying the health and economic costs of excessive salt intake .
Researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health predicted that , if dietary sodium consumption declined to the levels recommended in the 2005 federal guidelines , some 90,000 deaths could be averted yearly .
A Rand Corp. study published in September estimated that reducing American sodium intake to recommended levels could save $ 18 billion yearly in treatment for hypertension , stroke , renal disease and heart failure associated with excessive salt consumption .
“ There is now overwhelming evidence that we must treat sodium reduction as a critical public health priority , ” said Dr. Walter Willett , chairman of the Harvard School of Public Health ’s department of nutrition .
Willett , who was a key figure in the recent federal initiative to drive trans fats from the U.S. food supply , noted how quickly the U.S. food industry adapted to those new rules , and called for that industry ’s “ best creative minds to bring similar leadership ” to the bid to reduce sodium .
But the head of the salt lobby blasted efforts to curb salt consumption as unwarranted and overly broad .
“ It ’s not scientifically sound , ” said Lori Roman , president of the Salt Institute .
“ They ’re talking about some very drastic reductions .
They could be harming people . ”
Another key industry trade association , the Grocery Manufacturers Assn. , took a more measured approach .
It said in a statement that food makers already offer low - or no -sodium versions of many items .
“ We look forward to working with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to develop a national sodium reduction strategy that will help the consumer , ” the group said .
The FDA ’s decision to press food makers to reduce salt caps a 30 - year campaign by the Center for Science in the Public Interest .
The center sued the FDA in 2005 to try to force the agency to reclassify salt as a food additive subject to regulation .
Salt currently is categorized as a substance “ generally recognized as safe , ” hence not regulated in food products .
Center director Michael Jacobson urged the FDA to adopt mandatory limits on salt swiftly , and then phase them in slowly .
A gradual phase - in is considered crucial so that consumers do not notice a taste difference in foods with diminished amounts of salt .
While public health advocates like Jacobson hailed the clampdown , libertarian skeptics of government viewed it as another sign of a nanny state run amok .
“ It ’s another encroachment on people ’s personal freedom , ” said Gary Howard , spokesman for Campaign for Liberty , a libertarian advocacy group formed in the wake of Texas Rep.
Ron Paul ’s 2008 presidential campaign .
“ They ’ve already gotten into people ’s medical care , ” Howard said .
“ Where will they go next ?
Will they mandate exercise ? ”

WASHINGTON — A former Army microbiologist who worked for years with Bruce E. Ivins , whom the F.B.I. has blamed for the anthrax letter attacks that killed five people in 2001 , told a National Academy of Sciences panel on Thursday that he believed it was impossible that the deadly spores had been produced undetected in Dr. Ivins ’s laboratory , as the F.B.I. asserts .
Asked by reporters after his testimony whether he believed that there was any chance that Dr. Ivins , who committed suicide in 2008 , had carried out the attacks , the microbiologist , Henry S. Heine , replied , “ Absolutely not . ”
At the Army ’s biodefense laboratory in Maryland , where Dr. Ivins and Dr. Heine worked , he said , “ among the senior scientists , no one believes it . ”
Dr. Heine told the 16 - member panel , which is reviewing the F.B.I. ’s scientific work on the investigation , that producing the quantity of spores in the letters would have taken at least a year of intensive work using the equipment at the army lab .
Such an effort would not have escaped colleagues ’ notice , he added later , and lab technicians who worked closely with Dr. Ivins have told him they saw no such work .
Image A hazardous - materials team investigated a post office in West Trenton , N.J. , in October 2001 for clues in the anthrax attacks .
He told the panel that biological containment measures where Dr. Ivins worked were inadequate to prevent the spores from floating out of the laboratory into animal cages and offices .
“ You ’d have had dead animals or dead people , ” he said .
U.S. corporate media echoes spin that dead activists are to blame for the violence

The government of Israel , aided by many quarters of the international media , is attempting to spin today ’s deadly IDF assault on a humanitarian aid ship carrying supplies to Gaza as the fault of the murdered activists on board the vessel , ludicrously characterizing machine - gun carrying Israeli troops who killed over a dozen innocent people as the victims of the incident .
“ Defense Minister Ehud Barak said in a press conference on Monday that while he was sorry for lives lost , the organizers of the Gaza - bound protest flotilla were solely responsible for the outcome of the fatal IDF raid earlier in the day , ” reports the Jerusalem Post .
Elsewhere , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave his “ full backing ” to the Israeli military and Israeli Navy commander Vice - Admiral Eliezer Marom commended the “ bravery ” of the IDF commandoes who slaughtered innocent people who were attempting to take food and supplies to the Gaza Strip , which has been under Israeli blockade for the last three years , a situation humanitarian groups have labeled “ collective punishment , ” a throwback to how the Nazis brutalized entire cities of people in retaliation to attacks against them by resistance groups .
In addition , a video released by Israeli authorities is circulating on You Tube entitled , Demonstrators Use Violence Against Israeli Navy Soldiers Attempting to Board Ship , which ludicrously claims to show activists attacking troops unprovoked , without mentioning the fact that troops aggressively boarded the vessel outside of Israeli territory with the aid of army helicopters and heavily armed IDF soldiers before the activists did anything .
In reality , the video shows very little because it is shot from a perspective where the people on board look like ants and almost nothing can be deciphered from this .
Comments were disabled on the video to prevent people from making this criticism .
The video “ helpfully explain [s ] what you ’re supposed to see , ” writes one Israeli journalist .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ And , of course , the clip only contains the footage the IDF wanted to release ; we do n’t know what happened before or after this 60 seconds of video , ” reports Al Jazeera .
The tone of Israel ’s propaganda , that it was peace activists armed with nothing more than sticks and molotov cocktails who were responsible for the violence , and not heavily armed commando fighters backed up by helicopter gunships who in fact slaughtered at least 19 of the peace activists , is being cautiously parroted by some elements of the U.S. media .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
One only has to look at the nature of the death toll to understand who was responsible for this brutal attack .
At least 19 people , and this figure is rising by the hour , were killed during the attack , with dozens more injured .
Not one of those 19 victims is an IDF soldier , every single one is a Palestinian activist .
If the activists on board the ship had planned to attack the soldiers , you might at least expect them to have claimed one fatality – but this was n’t an attack by activists , it was a brutal assault by armed men with machine guns who violated international law and committed a despicable war crime before calling the monsters who carried it out brave heroes .
The Palestinian territories are controlled by Hamas , a group who legitimately won power in a democratic election .
The ships were not therefore “ seized ” by Hamas as is being implied , the Hamas government controlled the ships because they won the election and it is their job to provide food and aid to their people .
Crucially , the attack took place in international waters , not inside Israeli territory .
Israel had no right to board the ship under any legal definition .
As Mike Rivero at WhatReally Happened explains , “ Israel has no legal authority over the ships of other nations in international waters .
Israel may not issue orders to foreign flagged ships in international waters .
Ships are considered sovereign territory of the nations whose flags they fly .
Setting foot on one without the permission of the captain is technically an act of war .
“ The aid convoy did not “ attack ” the IDF .
The aid convoy , being in international waters , attempted to defend themselves from an act of piracy by a nation with no legal authority over those ships . ”
With Israel ’s attack being condemned globally by every nation on the planet besides the U.S. and Britain , and being savaged by every media outlet besides the ever - compliant U.S. establishment press , attempts to lay the blame on the very activists who were killed while lauding their murderers as heroes will only crystallize the fact that Israel , alongside Britain and America and the globalists who control all three countries , are nothing less than the new Nazis and represent the biggest threat by far to international security and the sanctity of the rule of law .

Canonical , the company behind the Ubuntu Linux distribution , announced today that its Ubuntu One cloud service will soon gain support for mobile contact synchronization .
The feature will be available to users who are paying for the higher tier of Ubuntu One service .
Canonical officially launched the Ubuntu One service last year alongside the release of Ubuntu 9.10 .
The service allows users to keep files and some application data synchronized between multiple computers .
The company is planning to roll out several significant new Ubuntu One features when Ubuntu 10.04 , codenamed Lucid Lynx , is released later this month .
The new Ubuntu
One music store , which is integrated into the Rhythmbox audio player , will use Ubuntu One to deploy purchased music to all of the user 's computers .
Much like the music store , the new mobile synchronization features are opening up for testing , but will officially launch alongside Ubuntu 10.04 .
Ubuntu
One mobile synchronization is powered by Funambol , a mobile push synchronization platform that is partly distributed under open source software licenses .
Ubuntu
One contact synchronization will work on the wide range of devices that are supported by Funambol 's client software .
You can download the synchronization program for your specific device by selecting it at the beta phone page on the Ubuntu One website .
Canonical is also releasing its own branded Funambol - based mobile client applications for certain platforms .
For example , the company is offering an Ubuntu One contact synchronization program for the iPhone , which is now available from the iTunes stores .
Plugins are available for several desktop applications too , such as Thunderbird .
The underlying Funambol technology supports push synchronization for calendars , notes , and other kinds of data , but Ubuntu One 's mobile sync only supports contacts at the present time .
It 's possible that its scope will be expanded as the service evolves .
Canonical developer Martin Albisetti described the new mobile sync feature in an announcement today on the Ubuntu One users mailing list .
" Getting contacts on CouchDB and replicating between desktops and the cloud was the first big step .
The second , and much bigger step , is to actually get those contacts from and to mobile phones .
To achieve this , we have partnered with a company called Funambol , who share our views on open source , and have an established a proven software stack that synchronizes thousands of mobile phones and other devices , " Albisetti wrote .
" Right now we 're at a stage where we feel confident opening up the service for wider testing .
We strongly recommend that [ testers ] have a backup of [ their ] contacts since we 've only tested with a hand - full of phone models at this point . "
Although the service is intended for paying Ubuntu One customers , nonsubscribers will get an opportunity to test it for free during a 30 - day trial period .
Albisetti says that the free trial will start following the release of Ubuntu 10.04 .
Right now , Canonical is seeking help from the user community to test the service .
He encourages users to provide feedback in the #ubuntuone IRC channel and on the Ubuntu One mailing list .
When we reviewed Ubuntu 9.10 last year , we noted that the lack of mobile synchronization was one of the most glaring deficiencies of the Ubuntu One service .
Many users already get contact synchronization for free through Google and other providers , but the feature could still potentially help make an Ubuntu One paid plan seem compelling to some regular end users .
Narayanan Krishnan Serves Over 1 Million Meals to India ’s Homeless
Narayanan Krishnan , a former gourmet chef , founded the nonprofit Akshaya Trust to serve meals to Madurai , India 's homeless population .
In 2002 , Narayanan Krishnan , a gifted young chef from Madurai , India , was working for an exclusive hotel group preparing haute cuisine for the ultra-rich .
But when he went home to visit his family , something he saw shocked him to his core .
“ I saw a very old man eating his own human waste for food , ” he told CNN .
Krishnan knew he could n’t go back to the gourmet restaurants he ’d been working in when his own countrymen were starving to death .
So he decided to stay in India and begin fixing meals for that man , and for the countless others who could not care for themselves .
The following year , he founded the nonprofit group Akshaya Trust .
The organization is named for the “ Akshaya bowl ” from Hindu mythology , a bottomless bowl that can feed the hungry forever — just as Krishnan hopes his group will do .
Each morning , Krishnan and his team rise at 4 AM , and seek out the homeless throughout a 123 - mile radius , armed with packets of hot vegetarian meals that Krishnan has prepared by hand .
He brings the meals to a crowd of about 400 regulars , and gives them free haircuts and beard trims when they need it .
In the years since starting the nonprofit , he ’s served over 1.2 million meals .
His recipients are nearly all mentally ill , and do not have the capacity to thank him .
Nonetheless , Krishnan receives great pleasure from the work he does .
“ I get this energy from the people , ” he said .
“ The food which I cook ... the enjoyment which they get is the energy .
I see the soul .
I want to save my people . ”

Yesterday , Drug Enforcement Administration agents raided a marijuana grow located in a warehouse at 1441 West 46th Avenue .
The site 's unusual for a cultivation operation for a couple of reasons .
It 's adjacent to the Denver Police Department District 1 station and about a block away from Remington Elementary School .
Beyond confirming the existence of a marijuana - related investigation involving that location , DEA spokesman Mike Turner declines to offer additional details , because the inquiry is ongoing .
But Jesse La Plante , a photographer ( visit his website here ) whose studio is next door , was on hand for the entire operation , and he provides plenty of inside details .
In February , the DEA stirred controversy when it raided Full Spectrum Laboratories in Denver -- an action apparently triggered by the lab applying for a license .
Within days , a lab in Colorado Springs was hit by the DEA , too , for pretty much the same reason .
As for the aforementioned grow operation , it moved into the 1441 West 46th avenue space a month or two ago , La Plante says .
" I toured the facility the day before this happened , because they were going to hire me to photograph some of their products for their website , " he says .
The website 's not up yet , in part because La Plante thinks the operation had n't been named yet .
But he saw nothing to suggest that it was intended to be an illicit or underground operation .
" The owner , whose name was Jesse , said their dispensary license was pending and that they'd be up and running , fully legit , in about a week or two ...
The owner said he already had eighty patients lined up and they had paperwork in to sell to three different dispensaries .
And they were also trying to get licensed to be their own dispensary as well .
They seemed like they knew what they were doing to me .
" I would say the warehouse was about 25 feet wide by 100 feet long , and they had two of them that were back to back and about the same size -- but I only went into one of them , which had about 200 plants inside .
It had a front room with plants in early stage of vegetation that were under a light 24 hours a day ; I guess that 's protocol .
And in another room , there were more mature plants that had already grown buds and were ready for picking .
They were under lights twelve hours a day to mimic the rotation of the earth .
They had another room where they packaged everything -- and there was also a room with a foosball table in it . "
La Plante did n't take his camera with him during the tour -- but he 'd eventually get shots of a few plants , albeit from a distance , and under circumstances he would n't have guessed .
" At around 11:30 yesterday morning , I walked out my door to go to lunch , and there was a SWAT team in full gear , with gas masks and machine guns , " he recalls .
" They yelled at me to go back inside , and I did .
But I could hear what they were doing , like when they kicked down the door .
" There were about three workers in there .
The owner was n't there when it happened .
I did n't see if they took them away , put them in cars or what .
But they spent probably the next two hours , maybe more , disassembling everything -- taking apart the lights , carrying all the plants out of planters , putting them in boxes , loading them up in their vehicles . "
At a certain point , La Plante was allowed back outside , but with limitations : " At the end of the unit , there 's this cargo door they were bringing everything out of in boxes , and they had that section blocked off . "
But he was able to go around the block and shoot photos through a fence as DEA personnel dismantled and packed .
And he also got into conversations with some of the police officers also on the scene .
" I heard them talking about how they felt kind of bad for taking down a semi- legitimate businessman , " La Plante recalls .
" They admitted that the guy was n't a drug dealer .
But they said if he tried it again , they 'd come at him harder , because repeat offenders are n't looked at in a good light .
They were pretty cavalier about it , cracking jokes about making bonfires and things like that . "
Those may not have been jokes ...
I believed that the collapse of the subprime mortgage market would ultimately lead to huge failures among the largest financial institutions .
But at the time almost no one else thought these trades would work out in my favor .

During 2007 , under constant pressure from my investors , I liquidated most of our credit default swaps at a substantial profit .
By early 2008 , I feared the effects of government intervention and exited all our remaining credit default positions  by auctioning them to the many Wall Street banks that were themselves by then desperate to buy protection against default .
This was well in advance of the government bailouts .
Because I had been operating in the face of strong opposition from both my investors and the Wall Street community , it took everything I had to see these trades through to completion .
Disheartened on many fronts , I shut down Scion Capital in 2008 .
Since then , I have often wondered why nobody in Washington showed any interest in hearing exactly how I arrived at my conclusions that the housing bubble would burst when it did and that it could cripple the big financial institutions .
A week ago I learned the answer when Al Hunt of Bloomberg Television , who had read Michael Lewis ’s book , “ The Big Short , ” which includes the story of my predictions , asked Mr. Greenspan directly .
The former Fed chairman responded that my insights had been a “ statistical illusion . ”
Perhaps , he suggested , I was just a supremely lucky flipper of coins .
Mr. Greenspan said that he sat through innumerable meetings at the Fed with crack economists , and not one of them warned of the problems that were to come .
By Mr. Greenspan ’s logic , anyone who might have foreseen the housing bubble would have been invited into the ivory tower , so if all those who were there did not hear it , then no one could have said it .
As a nation , we cannot afford to live with Mr. Greenspan ’s way of thinking .
The truth is , he should have seen what was coming and offered a sober , apolitical warning .
Everyone would have listened ; when he talked about the economy , the world hung on every single word .
Unfortunately , he did not give good advice .
In February 2004 , a few months before the Fed formally ended a remarkable streak of interest - rate cuts , Mr. Greenspan told Americans that they would be missing out if they failed to take advantage of cost - saving adjustable - rate mortgages .
And he suggested to the banks that “ American consumers might benefit if lenders provided greater mortgage product alternatives to the traditional fixed - rate mortgage . ”
Within a year lenders made interest - only adjustable - rate mortgages readily available to subprime borrowers .
And within 18 months lenders offered subprime borrowers so - called pay - option adjustable - rate mortgages , which allowed borrowers to make partial monthly payments and have the remainder added to the loan balance ( much like payments on a credit card ) .

Five former Blackwater security firm executives were charged Friday in North Carolina with illegally acquiring automatic weapons and filing false documents in a scheme to obtain government contracts .
The company , now known as Xe Services , continues to do work for the federal government and has bid on contracts for more .
But prosecutors issuing a federal indictment Friday in Raleigh , N.C. , said that the company officials attempted to gain a competitive bidding advantage by amassing high - powered weapons , which they used for training and , in one case , as gifts to the king of Jordan .
The 15 - count indictment accused Gary Jackson , the company ’s former president , and four others of conspiracy to violate firearms laws , making false statements and possession of unregistered firearms between 2003 and 2009 .

Company employees converted as many as 227 weapons into short - barrel rifles without registering them , as required by law , prosecutors said .
They also bought other restricted firearms by using the stationery of a local sheriff ’s department , the indictment charged .
The indictment is the latest in a mounting series of legal difficulties for the company , which prospered with the proliferation of government contracts for security and other paramilitary services since 2001 .
Blackwater has faced intense scrutiny for its security work in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The firm has “ sort of become the poster child for the industry and all the controversy that surrounds it , ” said Peter Singer , author of a 2003 book about the private security industry .
Blackwater is perhaps best known for a September 2007 shooting in Baghdad ’s Nisoor Square in which 17 civilians were killed .
In December a federal judge dismissed criminal charges against five former Blackwater guards in connection with the shootings , and the Justice Department has appealed the dismissal .

But the firm has continued to work for the government .
One Xe subsidiary , U.S. Training Services , held $ 354 million in contracts last year , according to government records , mostly for guard services .
At times , however , the company has confronted difficulty obtaining new business .
In March , the Government Accountability Office overturned U.S. Army plans to award a $ 1 - billion contract to the firm to train Afghan police officers , concluding that other companies were unfairly excluded from bidding on the job .
Friday ’s indictment alleged that the former Blackwater executives wanted to acquire fully automatic weapons and short - barrel rifles -- both of which are restricted under federal firearms laws -- to improve its chances of winning and keeping contracts with the U.S. and foreign governments .
“ The object of the conspiracy was to gain an advantage over competitors in the defense contracting field and thereby profit from obtaining and keeping government contracts , ” the indictment stated .

The indictment charges that Blackwater enlisted the Camden County , N.C. , sheriff ’s office , near its headquarters , in a scheme to acquire the weapons .
Prosecutors did not accuse the department of wrongdoing .
Prosecutors said the company used the weapons in carrying out government contracts to train security personnel .
The indictment refers to a March 2005 visit by King Abdullah II of Jordan to the company ’s 7,000 - acre complex in Moyock , N.C. , which includes classrooms , offices , shooting ranges , an armory and an airstrip .

The visit , which apparently was not previously reported , came days after Abdullah visited then - President George W. Bush at the White House .
Prosecutors did not specify the purpose of the king ’s trip .
Prosecutors said Jackson and the others presented the Jordanian monarch or his entourage with five firearms “ to gain favor ” with them .
After presenting the weapons as gifts , executives later realized they were unable to comply with federal laws requiring disclosure of where the weapons went , prosecutors said .
To cover up the lapse , prosecutors allege , the executives filed false federal firearms forms claiming they had purchased the weapons .

George E.B. Holding , the U.S. attorney for North Carolina ’s eastern district , stressed that the Jordanian officials were not suspected of any wrongdoing .
In 2008 , investigators raided the company ’s Moyock headquarters , seizing 22 weapons , including 17 AK - 47 assault rifles .
Charged along with Jackson in the 15 - count indictment were the company ’s former general counsel , Andrew Howell ; former executive vice president William Mathews ; former vice president of logistics and procurement Ana Bundy ; and former weapons specialist Ronald Slezak .
Attorneys for Jackson , Mathews and Howell told the Associated Press that their clients are innocent , and they criticized the government investigation .
A spokesman for Xe would say only that the company has cooperated with the investigation .

A woman who tried to stop a purse - snatcher Monday died from injuries sustained after falling off the thief 's truck , authorities said .
The victim , whose name was not released , died at Wilford Hall Medical Center , where she was taken with severe head injuries , police said .
The court was told he stabbed her nine times in the chest and three times in the arm with a kitchen knife , before ringing 999 and telling the operator : " I have stabbed my wife , please come quickly .
Will you please come and save her ? "
Aussies are safer in a strip club than a church , suggests new government data .
According to the latest figures compiled by the New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research , 1600 people were charged with committing a range of 27 offences in the state 's " places of worship ' ' in 2008 .
Astonishingly , the data showed only 282 people were charged with the same offences in adult entertainment premises .
" Most people would think of churches and synagogues as sanctuaries in society , '' News.com .au quoted bureau director Don Wedderburn , as saying .
Wedderburn added : " But maybe that 's naive , because the statistics show they are likely to rob , assault or steal from people there like anywhere else .
The figures are genuinely surprising . ''
The data showed 85 people were assaulted in places of worship , compared to 66 at an adult entertainment premises .
The report names churches , synagogues , monasteries , mosques , convents , cathedrals and chapels as places of worships .
Strip clubs , sex shops , brothels , massage parlours , homosexual clubs , gaming houses and gambling clubs fall under the category of adult entertainment premises .
Places of worship also took the lead in sexual offences ( 16 ) , theft from motor vehicles ( 33 ) , resisting arrest ( 7 ) and liquor offences ( 10 ) .
Harassment and threatening behaviour at places of worship ( 30 ) was over 50 percent more than at places of adult entertainment ( 13 ) .
THE NOTION that men have shorter fuses than women has acquired the status of a psychological shibboleth .
More than 30 years ago Stanford University psychologists Eleanor Maccoby and Carol Jacklin concluded in an influential book that sex differences were minimal in most psychological traits but considerable when it comes to aggression .
This opinion has endured ever since .
Were Maccoby and Jacklin right ?
Recent research bears out the broad brushstrokes of their claim but reveals that women can be equally , if less dangerously , belligerent .
Mad Men
In 1995 the late psychologist David Lykken of the University of Minnesota wrote that if we could magically place all boys and men between the ages of 12 and 28 in a cryogenic freeze , we would slash the rate of violent crime by two thirds .
The data bear out Lykken ’s thought experiment .
In the U.S. , the rate of violent crime for girls and women aged 10 and older is one in 56 ; the corresponding figure among their male counterparts is one in nine .
Men commit close to 90 percent of the murders in the U.S. and more murders than women in all the countries researchers have examined , according to a 1999 report by psychologist Anne Campbell of Durham University in England .
Indeed , investigators have consistently found that short of criminal activity , men exhibit more frequent and more extreme levels of physical aggression with one exception : in domestic disputes , as we will see , the tables are often turned .
In a 2004 mathematical synthesis of 196 studies ( known as a meta- analysis ) , psychologist John Archer of the University of Central Lancashire in England found that men are more physically aggressive ( by various measures ) than women across all ages , with the difference peaking between the ages of 20 and 30 .
This sex difference extended to all 10 countries Archer examined , which included the U.S. , Finland , Spain , India , Japan and New Zealand .
Interestingly , researchers have found men to be more physically aggressive in their mental lives as well .
Compared with women , men harbor more frequent and enduring homicidal fantasies , more often think about enacting revenge against their enemies , and report more physically aggressive dreams .
Evening the Score
Still , studies show that women are at least as prone to feeling anger as men and that they fight plenty .
Instead of expressing their angry emotions with their fists , women tend to use what in 1995 psychologist Nicki Crick , then at the University of Illinois , termed “ relational aggression , ” a less overt form characterized by social manipulation , especially of same - sex peers .
Popularized by such books as Odd Girl Out : The Hidden Culture of Aggression in Girls , by Rachel Simmons ( Harcourt , 2002 ) , relational aggression includes spreading rumors , gossiping , glaring , eye rolling , giving others the “ silent treatment , ” sending nasty notes or text messages behind rivals ’ backs , excluding others from social gatherings , poking fun at the appearance of competitors , and assorted other stealth attacks .
The so - called gentler sex may opt for such tactics because they are socialized to not show hostility openly and also because their relative lack of physical strength makes violence seem a less promising strategy .
Girls do not have an exclusive claim to relational aggression , however .
A 2008 meta-analysis by psychologist Noel Card of the University of Arizona and his colleagues suggests that it is equally common in girls and boys across both childhood and adolescence .
Other research suggests this absence of sex differences persists into adulthood .
More surprisingly , women are also just as likely as men to express hostility — in this case physically — in the context of a romantic relationship .
The popular stereotype of a domestic abuser is a man who habitually hurts his female partner .
Yet research by Archer and sociologist Murray Straus of the University of New Hampshire calls this scenario into question .
Surprisingly , their analyses demonstrate that men and women exhibit roughly equal rates of violence within relationships ; some studies hint that women ’s rates of physical aggression are slightly higher .
This apparent equality is not solely a result of women fighting back , because it holds even for altercations that women start .
Still , domestic abuse within intimate relationships poses a greater threat to women than to men .
Women suffer close to two thirds of the injuries , largely because men are stronger on average than women .
In addition , women and men differ in the severity of their actions ; women are more likely to scratch or slap their partners , and men more commonly punch or choke their partners .
Biology to Blame ?
Until recently , most psychologists thought differences in the degree to which men and women exhibit physical aggression stemmed largely from societal reinforcement of traditional gender roles .
Social factors undoubtedly account for a part of the differences .
But in a study published in 2007 psychologist Raymond Baillargeon of the University of Montreal and his colleagues reveal that as early as the age of 17 months , 5 percent of boys but only 1 percent of girls engage in frequent physical aggression , such as kicking and biting .
What is more , this gap does not widen between 17 and 29 months , as might be expected if environmental influences such as socialization by parents were to blame .
These findings suggest that biological factors — such as the effects of testosterone on brain function — contribute to sex differences in violent behavior .
Bolstering this hypothesis is the fact that males are the more belligerent sex in virtually all mammalian species that biologists have studied .
Even the one marked exception to this trend — the spotted ( “ laughing ” ) hyena — may prove the rule .
The female hyena , which is more physically aggressive than her male counterpart , has higher testosterone levels than the male does .

New studies by scientists at the University of Southern California have found that while stress may result in a universal physiological " fight or flight response " there are gender differences in psychological and behavioral responses .
The new findings suggest stress makes women more social and more aware of facial expressions , while it tends to make men less social .
The research led by psychologist Mara Mather , lends support to the theory proposed by Shelley Taylor , a neuroscientist from the University of California , Los Angeles , that women faced with stress “ tend and befriend ” by social networking and nurturing , probably as a way to protect their children , and that the fight or flight psychological and behavioral responses apply mainly to men .
In the experiments , Mather and her team split their male and female subjects into two groups .
One group was put under stress by being asked to hold one hand in ice water for three minutes , which caused an elevation in the level of the stress hormone cortisol that lasted for about an hour .
The other group held their hands in comfortably warm water , which does not elevate cortisol levels .
The subjects were then shown pictures of neutral or angry faces while they were lying inside a brain scanner .
The results showed striking gender differences in the brain scans .
The men with high cortisol levels showed less brain activity in the fusiform face area ( FFA ) , an area of the brain involved in processing images of faces , than unstressed men did , while the stressed women ’s brains were more active in that area than in unstressed women .
There were similar differences in the regions of the brain concerned with understanding other people ’s emotions and states of mind , and in feeling empathy towards others , with the stressed men showing reduced activity and a disconnection between the regions , and the stressed women showing an increased activity and greater connectivity .
Mather said women tend to seek out , befriend and bond with other people when they are under threat or stress , whereas men generally do not .
She said the women 's enhanced abilities to gauge facial expressions and respond to them could partly underlie their tend and befriend reaction to stressful situations .
The group ’s findings were presented at the 17th annual meeting of the Cognitive Neuroscience Society ( CNS ) held between 17 and 20 April 2010 in Montreal , Canada .

A 48 - year - old woman was raped twice as she walked home in Greater Manchester on Saturday night .
The victim was walking along Shanklin Walk in Darcy Lever , Bolton , at 2230 BST when a man approached her , police said .
He raped her in Shanklin Walk , before dragging her to nearby woodland where he raped her again .
Det Insp Stuart Wilkinson , of Bolton police , said the woman had been through an " horrific ordeal " .
' Isolated attack '
He added : " Due to the mental trauma she has been through she is unable to provide an exact time for the attack , but she tells us it happened some time overnight after 2230 BST .
" I want to reassure local people that incidents like this are thankfully rare and we believe this is an isolated attack .
" We have a team of detectives working on this and are determined to bring this man to swift justice . "
Det Insp Wilkinson appealed to anyone with any information to contact police .
Death row inmate Hank Skinner bought himself some time Monday when the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to take up a technical issue in his case , but legal experts say he 's unlikely to escape his ultimate punishment .
Skinner is asking the high court to address a procedural question on which courts across the country have split : whether he should be allowed to press a federal civil rights lawsuit seeking to have additional DNA evidence in his case tested instead of pursuing a writ of habeas corpus .
The answer to what might seem to be a simple procedural question could have far - reaching implications for others like Skinner who claim innocence after they 've been convicted .
A habeas corpus claim requires defendants to prove they were wrongly imprisoned .
Skinner 's argument is different :
He 's asserting a constitutional right to prove he 's innocent despite a jury 's decision otherwise in a trial conducted without legal error .
The Supreme Court for years has avoided ruling that such a right exists , and it wo n't take up that core question now .
A decision in Skinner 's favor , rather , would merely allow him to raise that question in lower courts under a civil rights claim .
“ What ’s being obscured is the bigger discussion about whether knowing the truth is a right that people really ought to have , ” said Jeff Blackburn , the general counsel for the Texas Innocence Project .
" DNA has opened sort of a scientific door for a complete re-examination of the criminal justice system . "
Skinner argues that DNA evidence that police gathered at the scene of the 1993 triple murder — a knife , a rape kit , a man ’s windbreaker and other biological material — could show he is innocent .
The material was never tested because other DNA evidence that was tested had helped implicate Skinner , and his original trial attorney did not want to take the chance that more testing would do the same .
An earlier appeal of Skinner 's based on claims his original lawyer was ineffective failed .
And Texas courts have denied Skinner 's requests under habeas corpus laws to test the evidence .
But in March — about an hour before he was set to walk into the death chamber — the Supreme Court issued a stay , and now it will decide whether to allow him to proceed under federal civil rights law .
Skinner ’s lawyers filed the civil rights lawsuit — alleging that his constitutional rights were violated by the state ’s unwillingness to allow him access to the untested DNA evidence — as his options under habeas corpus were running out .
The 5th Circuit Court rejected his case .
The court said Skinner ’s pursuit of DNA evidence is aimed at getting his sentence overturned and so it must be a habeas case , not a civil rights case .
Skinner ’s lawyers argue that he should be allowed to bring the case under civil rights laws because the DNA testing would n’t necessarily lead to a reversal of his conviction .
There ’s no guarantee that he would be granted testing by the lower federal courts .
Even if lower courts were to order testing — and the results showed he was innocent — that does n’t mean automatically Skinner would be taken off death row , his attorneys argue .
Gray County District Attorney Lynn Switzer , who is named in the lawsuit and is the most recent prosecutor to deal with Skinner 's case , released a statement Monday expressing frustration with the case , which has dragged on for more than 15 years .
In the statement , published online by KVII in Amarillo , Switzer said she remains in contact with the victims ' family and friends and that they oppose allowing additional DNA testing .
Skinner had a fair trial , she said , and the jury 's decision should be respected .
" If defendants are allowed to ' game the system , ' then we will never be able to rely on the finality of the judgments entered in their cases , " Switzer said .
Habeas corpus claims can lead to a defendant 's sentence being overturned after proving that he was wrongfully imprisoned .
Civil rights claims , on the other hand , usually allow a defendant to prove his constitutional rights were violated in some way during or after trial and do n't always seek to reverse his sentence .
Five circuit courts allow defendants to bring DNA testing requests under federal civil rights law , but two circuit courts — including the 5th Circuit Court of Appeal , which has jurisdiction over Texas and Skinner 's case — require such claims to be filed under habeas corpus laws .
“ The courts are very resistant to habeas claims , ” said Christopher Slobogin , a professor at Vanderbilt University Law School in Nashville .
“ To put it bluntly , they get tired of these claims . ”
The Supreme Court has ruled in the past that convicts seeking to have their sentences overturned must file habeas claims .
But those cases are some of the hardest to win , because they have a much higher standard of proof .
" Not likely to win "
Though getting the Court to take up Skinner ’s question was a win for him and his team of lawyers , legal experts said the victory — probably his last chance to get the DNA testing done before he is executed — might be fleeting .
“ In the end , Skinner ’s not likely to win here , ” said Joseph Hoffmann , a death penalty expert and law professor at Indiana University ’s Maurer School of Law .
Slobogin said he expected the high court to rule against Skinner and decide that his DNA request cannot be a civil rights issue .
“ The Supreme Court has said that when attacking the validity of a sentence , habeas is the appropriate venue , ” he said .
If the court agrees with Skinner that inmates can request DNA testing under civil rights laws , he said , there could be a rush by others to file similar requests .
“ I think it ’s fair to say there ’ll be an increase in DNA - type challenges to convictions if the court holds ” Skinner can seek testing under civil rights law , Slobogin said .
Even if the court agreed that Skinner can request DNA testing under federal civil rights law , Hoffmann said , it ’s unlikely the courts would rule that he has a constitutional right to prove he was actually innocent .
The Supreme Court has never ruled that the Constitution spells out such a right .
It ’s likely that Skinner ’s case or a similar one would make its way back to the Supreme Court and eventually force the court to face that question .
If the court were to answer it affirmatively , Hoffmann said , it could start a flood of litigation from inmates claiming innocence .
That , in turn , could raise a myriad of questions about how the justice system operates and really “ gum up the works , ” he said .
“ They really do n’t want to kind of bite the bullet and recognize this as a federal constitutional right . ”
Allowing DNA requests under federal civil rights law would also bring the Supreme Court closer to a larger question that Blackburn and Hoffmann said the elite jurists have carefully avoided : whether inmates have a constitutional right to prove they are actually innocent .
With the rise of DNA science , the question looms large in cases such as Skinner 's , in which testable evidence exists that the jury never heard .
Currently , federal innocence claims are primarily based on deprivation of an inmate 's constitutional right to due process — things like shoddy representation or biased juries .
There is no legal remedy for convicted criminals who claim the jury just got it wrong , even though their rights were properly protected at trial , Hoffmann said .
" Whether they ’re actually innocent or not is kind of a legal irrelevancy once the jury has spoken its version of the truth , ” Hoffmann said .
“ Basically , our legal system is constructed in such a way that that ’s the end of it . ”

What 's a World of Warcraft account worth ?
Posted by Sean @ 15:14 GMT
How you given any thought to the monetary value of your virtual commodities ?
How much is an online game account worth ?
For Hannu Ahola , it was 4,000 euros .
Marja , a contributer to F - Secure 's Safe and Savvy blog , read about Hannu 's case last November in the Helsinki Sanomat ( in Finnish ) .
Marja was curious about Hannu 's case , and recently , while visiting his area of Finland , she called , visited with him , and learned more of the details for herself .
The story starts about four years ago when Hannu purchased a World of Warcraft account from an acquaintance .
He then invested his time and effort into the game and developed a strong character .
Unfortunately for him , his success did not go unnoticed .
His acquaintance decided that he wanted the WoW account back , logged in , and hijacked Hannu 's character .
Now , what do you do when someone takes something from you in the virtual world ?
It 's quite difficult to make a criminal case from such an occurrence .
But Hannu was n't deterred , he wanted some kind of reckoning .
He sought the help of Turre Legal and with the help of researcher Vili Lehdonvirta the WoW account was valued at 4000 Euros in an out of court settlement .
The lab frequently sees WoW phishing sites and password trojans , but rarely does the account holder know the other person involved , so this is a very interesting case .
World of Warcraft now reportedly has 11.5 million subscribers .
At 4,000 Euros an account , that 's starting to equal some real money .
No wonder online games are such a popular target for online criminals .

Poorer nations are unlikely to make a low - carbon switch without a Western lead
Pledges made at December 's UN summit in Copenhagen are unlikely to keep global warming below 2C , a study concludes .
Writing in the journal Nature , analysts at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impacts Research in Germany say a rise of at least 3C by 2100 is likely .
The team also says many countries , including EU members and China , have pledged slower carbon curbs than they have been achieving anyway .
They say a new global deal is needed if deeper cuts are to materialise .
" There 's a big mismatch between the ambitious goal , which is 2 C ... and the emissions reductions , " said Potsdam 's Malte Meinshausen .
It is like racing towards the cliff and hoping you stop just before it
Dr Malte Meinshausen
" The pledged emissions reductions are in most cases very unambitious , " he told BBC News .
In their Nature article , the team uses stronger language , describing the pledges as " paltry " .
" The prospects for limiting global warming to 2C - or even to 1.5C , as more than 100 nations demand - are in dire peril , " they conclude .
Between now and 2020 , global emissions are likely to rise by 10 - 20 % , they calculate , and the chances of passing 3C by 2100 are greater than 50 % .
According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , this implies a range of serious impacts for the world , including significant falls in crop yields across most of the world
damage to most coral reefs
likely disruption to water supplies for hundreds of millions of people .
Chances of a 3C rise are higher than evens , the team calculates ( simplified from Potsdam Institute 's Nature paper )
More than 120 countries have now associated themselves with the Copenhagen Accord , the political document stitched together on the summit 's final day by a small group of countries led by the US and the BASIC bloc of Brazil , China , India and South Africa .
CLIMATE CHANGE GLOSSARY
Glossary in full
The accord " recognises " the 2C target as indicated by science .
It was also backed at last year 's G8 summit .
Many of those 120 - odd have said what they are prepared to do to constrain their greenhouse gas emissions - either pledging cuts by 2020 , in the case of industrialised countries , or promising to improve their " carbon intensity " in the case of developing nations .
Some of the pledges are little more than vague statements of intent .
But all developed countries , and the developing world 's major emitters , have all given firm figures or ranges of figures .
The EU , for example , pledges to cut emissions by 20 % from 1990 levels by 2020 ; China promises to improve carbon intensity by 40 - 45 % by 2020 compared against 2005 ; and Australia vows an emission cut of 5 - 25 % on 2000 levels by 2020 .
The Potsdam team concludes that many of the detailed pledges are nowhere near as ambitious as their proponents would claim .
They calculate that the EU's 20 % pledge implies an annual cut of 0.45 % between 2010 and 2020 , whereas it is already achieving annual reductions larger than that .
EUROPE'S 'AMBITIOUS ' CARBON CUTS
The Potsdam team calculates that the EU 's emissions have fallen on average by 0.6 % per year since 1980 During 2009 , emissions from the bloc 's power sector alone fell by 11 % owing to the recession Consequently , the current 20 % by 2020 pledge equates to 0.45 % per year - less than the historical average
China 's 40 % minimum pledge also amounts to nothing more than business as usual , they relate ; and among developed countries , only pledges by Norway and Japan fall into the 25 - 40 % by 2020 range that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) recommends as necessary to give a good chance of meeting the 2C target .
Hot air Whereas many countries , rich and poor , have indicated they are willing to be more ambitious if there is a binding global deal , the Potsdam team notes that in the absence of a global deal , only the least ambitious end of their range can be counted upon .
Writing in the BBC's Green Room this week , Bryony Worthington from the campaign group Sandbag argues that the EU can easily move to its alternative higher figure of 30 % - and that it must , if it wants to stimulate others to cut deeper .
EU can increase carbon ambition " Many countries are looking to Europe to show how it is possible to achieve growth without increasing emissions , " she said .
" Only when they see that this is possible will they be inclined to adopt absolute reduction targets of their own . "
An additional factor flagged up in the analysis is that many countries have accrued surplus emissions credits under the Kyoto Protocol .
Countries such as Russia and other former Eastern bloc nations comfortably exceeded their Kyoto targets owing to the collapse of Communist economies in the early 1990s .
Without a binding global agreement preventing the practice , these nations would be allowed to put these " banked " credits towards meeting any future targets - meaning they would have to reduce actual emissions less than they promised .
These " hot air " credits could also be traded between nations .
Stern words
This is not the first analysis of the Copenhagen Accord pledges , but it is one of the starkest .
Lord Stern 's team at the Grantham Research Institute for Climate Change and the Environment in London has also run the figures ; and although their conclusions on the numbers are similar , they do not see things in quite such a pessimistic light .
The Bolivian - hosted " Mother Earth " summit is lobbying for faster cuts " You cannot characterise an emissions path for a country or the world by focusing solely on the level in 2020 or any other particular date , " said the institute 's principal research fellow Alex Bowen .
" It is the whole path that matters , and if more action is taken now to reduce emissions , less action will be required later , and vice versa . "
The Potsdam team acknowledges that if emissions do rise as they project , it would still be possible to have a reasonable chance of meeting 2C if very strict carbon curbs were applied thereafter , bringing emissions down by 5 % per year or so .
" In an ideal world , if you pull off every possible emission reduction from the year 2021 onwards , you can still get to get to 2C if you 're lucky , " said Dr Meinshausen .
" But it is like racing towards the cliff and hoping you stop just before it . "
They argue that positive analyses may " lull decision - makers into a false sense of security " .
The UN climate process continues through this year , with many countries saying they still want to reach a binding global agreement by December .
But stark divisions remain between various blocs over emission cuts , finance , technology transfer and other issues ; and it is far from certain that all important countries want anything more binding than the current set of voluntary national commitments .

Technology may appear impotent in the face of the volcanic ash cloud disrupting global air travel .
So the Magazine has asked scientists for their most outlandish solutions .
And we want yours too .
At the bottom of online articles about Eyjafjallajokull , the hard - on - the - tongue Icelandic volcano that has created airline havoc around the world , the same comment left by many a disgruntled layman has become familiar .
" Why ca n't they just put a lid on it ? "
They can't , explains Prof Gillian Foulger of Durham University 's earth science department , because to do so would be to create a build - up of magma " with the explosive capability of an atomic bomb " .
But if the massed ranks of armchair pundits have been unable to offer a solution to the multi-million pound chaos , neither have the climatologists , volcanologists and aircraft technicians .
In a spirit of inquiry , we 've asked the experts to come up with suggestions for solving the crisis that are , at the very least , within the realms of scientific possibility , while not necessarily those of practicality , affordability or remote likelihood .
They 've come back with suggestions that are unlikely to be presented in learned journals any time soon - but go some way to outlining the balance of power between mankind and volcano .
BLOW A HOLE IN THE VOLCANO Rooted in Icelandic custom , though unlikely to be put into practice , is the science fiction brainchild of Dr Grant Allen from Manchester University 's Centre for Atmospheric Science .
Blowing a hole in Eyjafjallajokull could help beat the ash cloud .
In theory
He notes that , during previous eruptions , explosives have been used to create channels through which magma can flow harmlessly into the sea .
" The Icelanders are very adept at doing this sort of thing , " he says .
Of course , this volcano is different .
Getting at the magma and diverting it away from contact with the glacier which currently sits over the eruption site would involve blowing a hole in the side of the mountain itself .
" It would take something like a nuclear weapon to do it , " Dr Allen adds .
" I do n't think you would really have control of the situation . "
CREATE RAIN TO WASH AWAY ASH CLOUD Cloud seeding , in which particles are dropped or fired into clouds in an effort to change precipitation levels , is already a reality , much beloved by dictators who seek to control the weather on national holidays in their name .
Rain stops ... volcano ?
But employed on an as - yet unprecedented scale , it is - just - possible to imagine water vapour clouds being used to tackle volcanic ash , says Prof Foulger .
" You fill the atmosphere with dust which causes rain , " she says .
" You would just wash the ash out of the atmosphere . "
But , she acknowledges , the technology to do so on such as scale would be way beyond mankind 's capability at the moment .
" You 'd also have to do a cost analysis to see whether it would be really worth the expense , " she adds .
USE ELECTROSTATICS
On a similar - if barely more practical - theme , Prof David Pyle , earth scientist at Oxford University , suggests another way to sweep away the ash cloud .
It does n't take a bright spark to see why this might not be entirely practical
The key to his method is determining the electrical charge of the ash particles .
" If you knew whether they were negatively charged or positively charged , you could flush it with something that had an opposite polarity - bits of plastic or lumps of rock .
" What you 'd hope is that , as these large particles came through the cloud , they would attract the fine ash particles , clump together and sweep them to the ground . "
The drawback , he says , is that you would need to have aircraft continually feeding the ash cloud with the larger particles - no mean undertaking during an eruption expected to last months .
DRAIN THE MELTED WATER
One of the biggest problems with the Eyjafjallajokull eruption is that it is taking place beneath a glacier 650 ft ( 200 m ) thick , says Dr David Rothery , a volcanologist with the Open University .
The volcano has a glacier inconveniently sitting atop it The ice melts into the volcano magma plumbing system , and then turns into steam - expanding as it does so , which , Dr Rothery says , makes the volcano even more explosive .
" What you could do , in theory , is have some kind of drainage of the melted water under the ice . "
This could be done by boring through the ice , to take the steam away from magma .
But the practical obstacles mean it is hardly likely to be carried out any time soon .
" It would be very difficult , " Dr Rothery says .
" You 'd have to work out how long this would actually take and I would n't like to think about how much it would cost . "
GIVE AIRCRAFT ASH CAMERAS
The impracticality of these suggestions may imply that modern science is impotent in the face of nature .
But British climate expert Fred Prata , who is based at the Norwegian Institute for Air Research , is hoping to put into practice one idea which could , at the very least , ameliorate the effects of the eruption - for the flying public , at least .
At least one suggestion offers hope to frustrated travellers
He has patented an infrared camera for detecting volcanic ash which can be mounted on aircraft .
The device looks for volcanic silicates - the tiny pieces of volcanic glass and rocks so deadly for jet engines - which absorb infrared radiation , thus allowing air traffic controllers to reroute .
" This is n't science fiction , " Dr Prata says .
" If they were fitted with these cameras , the aircraft would be able to safely fly much closer to the ash clouds . "
Dr Prata is now in talks with airline manufacturers .
Perhaps , after all , it is this kind of ingenuity which is the most outlandish of all .

Gallup has a new poll showing that the ground is eroding under the feet of anthropogenic global - warming advocates .
Skepticism in the US has rapidly increased over the last four years , climbing from 30 % in 2006 to almost half of all respondents in their latest survey :
Gallup ’s annual update on Americans ’ attitudes toward the environment shows a public that over the last two years has become less worried about the threat of global warming , less convinced that its effects are already happening , and more likely to believe that scientists themselves are uncertain about its occurrence .
In response to one key question , 48 % of Americans now believe that the seriousness of global warming is generally exaggerated , up from 41 % in 2009 and 31 % in 1997 , when Gallup first asked the question .
Except for one year — the presidential election year of 2004 — skepticism had been a fairly marginal response in the US , hovering around the 30 % mark .
The scandals of the East Anglia CRU , the IPCC , and the climate - change industry in general appears to have seriously damaged the standing of AGW advocacy .
As the chart shows , though , skepticism had already begun spiking well before the credibility collapse started in November .
Now , the marginalized group is those who see AGW as an existential threat within their lifetimes .
That ’s now down to 32 % from a high of 40 % in 2008 , while skeptics on that point have increased to 67 % .
And there are even more reasons for skepticism now .
Pajamas Media reports on more exposed e-mail , this time involving NASA , that shows that the government agency was hiding its own skepticism about its own data :
Email messages obtained by the Competitive Enterprise Institute via a Freedom of Information
Act request reveal that the climate dataset of NASA ’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies ( GISS ) was considered — by the top climate scientists within NASA itself — to be inferior to the data maintained by the University of East Anglia Climate Research Unit ( CRU ) .
The NASA scientists also felt that NASA GISS data was inferior to the National Climate Data Center Global Historical Climate Network ( NCDC GHCN ) database .
These emails , obtained by Christopher Horner , also show that the NASA GISS dataset was not independent of CRU data .
Further , all of this information regarding the accuracy and independence of NASA GISS data was directly communicated to a reporter from USA Today in August 2007 .
The reporter never published it .
Why is this important ?
Defenders of the East Anglia CRU conclusions , as well as those of the IPCC , insist that their data has an analog in NASA / GISS .
They claim that even though East Anglia destroyed the raw data and that they have been exposed in manipulating results , the end result more or less matches what NASA / GISS has produced .
If NASA considered its data inferior to the CRU effort , that calls both into question .
The effort continues to crumble , and as it does , it produces another hockey stick — a sharp increase not in global temperatures , but in global common sense .
Top Supreme Court contender Elena Kagan , is an able administrator with a shamefully thin record of legal scholarship .
Paul Campos compares her to the hapless Bush nominee who got laughed out of town .
Plus , read our full coverage of Elena Kagan
As the rumblings become louder that President Obama is going to choose U.S. Solicitor General Elena Kagan as our next Supreme Court justice , somebody needs to ask a rather impolitic question :
How , precisely , is Kagan 's prospective nomination different from George W. Bush 's ill - fated attempt to put Harriet Miers on the nation 's highest court ?
On its face , the question seems absurd .
Five years ago , Miers was derided as a careerist mediocrity whose primary qualification to be on the Supreme Court was a slavish devotion to President Bush .
Kagan , by contrast is a purportedly " brilliant " legal scholar who was granted tenure at the University of Chicago and Harvard , before becoming dean of the latter 's law school .
Kagan 's work reminded me of Orwell 's observation that , if book reviewers were honest , 19 of 20 reviews would consist of the sentence , " this book inspires in me no thoughts whatever . "
• Read Our Full Coverage of Elena Kagan
Yesterday , I read everything Elena Kagan has ever published .
It did n't take long :
In the nearly 20 years since Kagan became a law professor , she 's published very little academic scholarship — three law review articles , along with a couple of shorter essays and two brief book reviews .
Somehow , Kagan got tenure at Chicago in 1995 on the basis of a single article in The Supreme Court Review — a scholarly journal edited by Chicago 's own faculty — and a short essay in the school 's law review .
She then worked in the Clinton administration for several years before joining Harvard as a visiting professor of law in 1999 .
While there she published two articles , but since receiving tenure from Harvard in 2001 ( and becoming dean of the law school in 2003 ) she has published nothing .
( While it 's true law school deans often do little scholarly writing during their terms , Kagan is remarkable both for how little she did in the dozen years prior to becoming Harvard 's dean , and for never having written anything intended for a more general audience , either before or after taking that position . )
Kagan 's handful of publications touch on topics like regulating offensive speech , analyzing legislative motivations for speech regulations , and evaluating the process of administrative law - making .
But on the vast majority of issues before the court , Kagan has no stated opinion .
Her scholarship provides no clues regarding how she would rule on such crucial contemporary issues as the scope of the president 's power in wartime , the legality of torture , or the ability of Congress to rein in campaign spending by corporations .
( Of course cynics have noted that today Supreme Court nominees are often better off not having an extensive " paper trail " regarding their views on controversial legal issues .
Who would have guessed it would be possible to retain this virtue while obtaining tenure at two of the nation 's top law schools ? )
At least in theory Kagan could compensate somewhat for the slenderness of her academic resume through the quality of her work .
But if Kagan is a brilliant legal scholar , the evidence must be lurking somewhere other than in her publications .
Kagan 's scholarly writings are lifeless , dull , and eminently forgettable .
They are , on the whole , cautious academic exercises in the sort of banal on - the - other - handing whose prime virtue is that it 's unlikely to offend anyone in a position of power .
Take , for example , Kagan 's article , " Presidential Administration , " which appeared in the Harvard Law Review in 2001 .
The piece is dedicated largely to reviewing the extant literature on the power of Congress and the president to control the actions of administrative agencies .
Kagan 's thesis consists of presenting a fairly standard view within administrative law scholarship — that relatively tight presidential oversight of administrative agencies can have beneficial regulatory effects — as if it were a novel argument .
She maintains , on the basis of thin evidence , that such oversight increased significantly under the Reagan and Clinton presidencies , and concludes with the tautological insight that presidential oversight can be a good thing if it does n't go too far .
Kagan 's work reminded me of Orwell 's observation that , if book reviewers were honest , 19 of 20 reviews would consist of the sentence , " this book inspires in me no thoughts whatever . "
The bottom line regarding Kagan 's scholarly career is that there 's no there there .
This is a problem not only because we have no evidence regarding what her views might be on almost any important legal question , but also because Kagan 's supposed academic achievements are being touted as the primary justification for putting someone who has never been a judge on the nation 's highest court .
Now the fact that Kagan is more or less an academic nonentity would be of merely academic interest if she possessed unrelated but compelling qualifications for ascending to the nation 's highest court .
But what else , exactly , has she done ?
Besides her law - school career , Kagan 's resume consists of four years in the Clinton White House , where she was associate White House counsel — a full rung down from Harriet Miers ' position in the Bush White House — and deputy director of the Domestic Policy Council , and six years as the dean of Harvard 's law school .
( Last year , Obama chose her as his solicitor general . )
Apparently her main accomplishment as dean at Harvard was raising a lot of money , which , given that it's the Harvard Law School , sounds roughly as impressive as managing to sell a lot of pot at a Grateful Dead concert .
( She 's also been given credit for improving the collegial atmosphere at the school , aka , getting a bunch of egomaniacs to engage in less backstabbing , which anyone familiar with law school faculties can attest is not a negligible accomplishment .
Whether it's a sufficient basis for putting somebody on the Supreme Court is another matter . )
It seems clear Kagan is a bright person and an able administrator .
But Harriet Miers was those things as well :
She had a long and successful career in the private practice of law , she was the first woman president of the Texas Bar Association , and she was the top lawyer in the White House for several years prior to her nomination to the Court .
Miers ' nomination was derailed by two complaints : that her primary qualification was that she was a " crony " of the president , and that nobody knew what views she had , if any , on the vast majority of questions facing the Supreme Court .
Both criticisms are just as relevant to Kagan 's potential selection .
Consider that Obama and Kagan joined the Chicago law faculty in the very same year , after both were Harvard Law students and members of the Harvard Law Review .
( The difference between a " crony " and a " colleague " is often something of a sociological mystery . )
Indeed , the most impressive thing about Kagan is that she seems to have a remarkable ability to ingratiate herself with influential people across the ideological spectrum .
The second criticism of the Miers nomination applies with even greater force to Kagan .
As a private lawyer , Miers , after all , had a fairly good excuse for having no public views on the great legal issues of our day .
For most of the past 20 years , Kagan 's job has been to both develop and publicize such views .
That she has nevertheless managed to almost completely avoid doing so is rather extraordinary .

There was no secret that the Obama administration and Democratic leaders in Pennsylvania wanted to avoid a divisive primary fight and rally around Specter .
But Sestak refused to stand down , and then caused a stir in February when he told veteran TV journalist Larry Kane that he had been offered a significant federal job to forgo a challenge .
Kane asked whether the post was Navy secretary , and Sestak declined to comment .
Views of the US around the world have improved sharply over the past year , a BBC World Service poll suggests .
For the first time since the annual poll began in 2005 , America 's influence in the world is now seen as more positive than negative .
The improved scores for the US coincided with Barack Obama becoming president , a BBC correspondent notes .
As in 2009 , Germany is viewed most favourably while Iran and Pakistan are seen as the most negative influences .
Nearly 30,000 people in 28 countries were interviewed for the poll , between November 2009 and February 2010 .
Fifteen of the countries have been surveyed every year since 2005 , allowing long - term trends to be discerned .
In these nations - or 14 of them , not including the US itself - positive views of the US fell to a low of 28 % on average in 2007 , from 38 % in 2005 , but recovered to 35 % in 2009 and 40 % in this year 's poll .
After a year , it appears the ' Obama effect ' is real
Steven Kull , director of Pipa Meanwhile , perceptions of China in the 14 other countries have been declining - falling from 49 % on average in 2005 , to 34 % in 2009 and 2010 .
" People around the world today view the United States more positively than at any time since the second Iraq war , " said Doug Miller , chairman of international polling firm GlobeScan , which carried out the poll with the Program on International Policy Attitudes ( Pipa ) at the University of Maryland .
" While still well below that of countries like Germany and the UK , the global standing of the US is clearly on the rise again . "
China ' in neutral ' Pipa director Steven Kull noted : " After a year , it appears the ' Obama effect ' is real .
" Its influence on people 's views worldwide , though , is to soften the negative aspects of the United States ' image , while positive aspects are not yet coming into strong focus . "
He added : " While China 's image is stuck in neutral , America has motored past it in the global soft - power competition . "
Of the full list of 28 countries surveyed this year , the US is viewed positively in 19 ( 20 including the US itself ) , while six lean negative and two are divided .
Compared with 2009 , positive views of the US jumped 21 % in Germany , 18 in Russia , 14 in Portugal and 13 in Chile - though Russia and Germany continued to have a negative view of the US overall .

BSA : Hardware Without Software Not Tax Deductible
26 . 5 . 2010 | Robert Krátký | Různé | 28182×
The Czech Ministry of Finance along with the BSA threaten to disallow deducting hardware from base tax if purchased without software .
This idea stems from their joint proclamation that for software to be used legally , it must be bought – thus completely ignoring the existence of free and open source software which can be obtained legally without any purchase whatsoever .
The Ministry and the BSA have issued a press release which basically labels all users of ' free software ' pirates .
Many public organizations and companies have expressed their dismay at such actions of the Ministry .
Press Release
The Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic ( MFCR ) has lent its name to a very strange activity – the so - called anti-pirate organization , BSA ( Business Software Alliance ) which associates many producers of software ( such as Apple , IBM , or Microsoft ) had penned a press released that has been published through official channels by the Ministry of Finance .
The press release is signed by the first deputy minister and the spokesperson of the BSA .
Note that the BSA is not even registered in the Czech Republic and as such has no legal presence in the country .
The press release is titled “ Software Piracy to Be Considered Tax Evasion Much More Often ” .
One can safely venture that the current outgoing ministry staff has decided to go for a very clumsy and incorrect interference with the continuing pre-election frays .
[ The Czech Republic holds national elections into both parliament chambers on the 28th and 29th of May . ]
The press release – which makes no attempt to conceal the fact it was written by a private entity – uses BSA 's favourite catch phrases and pseudo - arguments :
Revenues lost due to software piracy are calculated by simply adding the sum of prices of all illegally used software , neglecting the fact that many people of companies would not purchase said software , had they not the opportunity to use it illegally / for free .
Claims that the elimination of software piracy would lead to economic growth , innovations , and development .
Contains a BSA appeal to all governments “ to double their efforts to suppress the spreading of illegal software ” .
Lists , for example , the following as methods to combat piracy : “ steps taken by law enforcement authorities ” “ digital rights management ( DRM ) tools ”
Hardware Without Software Not Tax Deductible
The MFCR and BSA , in their efforts to push the notion that the only legal software is one that has been bought , fail to mention free and open source software .
Despite the fact that a number of operating systems and applications can be legally and for free downloaded from the Internet or obtained through other channels , the press release chooses to be silent about this .
There is no provision for proving that software downloaded from the Internet has been obtained legally ( when no receipt or other tax document exists ) .
Still , the main purpose of the press release is to communicate that hardware bought on its own , ie .
without software , will not be considered a tax deductible item by the tax collector , thus having no effect on the amount of base tax : “ The tax administration has been looking into the acceptability of hardware costs for a number of years now .
It should become non-deductible if without legally obtained software which would , of course , factor in the amount of base tax ” .
The press release goes on to threaten : “ Should there be a reasonable suspicion of the use of illegal software for business purposes , the tax office employees will deal with these offenses during regular controls ” .
This could result in the criminalisation of companies and entrepreneurs who legally use open source software .
At the least , it is an attempt to spread FUD ( Fear , Uncertainty , and Doubt ) and misinformation about the legality of software usage .
Common tactics for the BSA .
It is , however , alarming , that the Ministry of Finance , a government body of executive power , has been a part of this .
This article will be updated with further information as it becomes available , especially regarding the reactions of interested parties .

European commission 's spring forecasts put UK budget deficit this year at 12 % of GDP – the highest in the European Union and worse than Treasury estimates
Whoever wins the election must make sorting out the public finances the top priority , the European commission warned on the eve of the poll , as it predicted the British budget deficit would swell this year to become the biggest in the European Union , overtaking even Greece .
The commission 's spring economic forecasts put the UK deficit for this calendar year at 12 % of GDP , the highest of all 27 EU nations and worse than the Treasury 's own forecasts .
The country 's budget shortfall was the third largest in the EU last year but will overtake both Greece and Ireland this year , according to the forecasts .
Greece 's measures to tackle its public finances problems are projected to cut its deficit to 9.3 % of GDP .
Worries about Britain 's public finances – in their worst state since the end of the second world war – continue to unnerve financial markets and analysts are divided over whether a hung parliament will have the clout to rapidly reduce the deficit .
" The first thing for the new government to do is to agree on a convincing , ambitious programme of fiscal consolidation in order to start to reduce the very high deficit and stabilise the high debt level of the UK , " said European economic and monetary affairs commissioner Olli Rehn .
" That 's by far the first and foremost challenge of the new government .
I trust whatever the colour of the government , I hope it will take this measure . "
The deficit forecasts are an improvement on the commission 's last outlook for Britain but they still paint a gloomier picture than the government itself .
In financial year terms , the commission 's forecasts are for a worse deficit than predicted by Alistair Darling at his March budget .
In 2010 / 11 the commission puts the deficit at 11.5 % of GDP , compared with Darling 's forecast for an 11.1 % ratio of public sector net borrowing – the gap between tax and spending – to GDP .
The EU 's executive did double its forecast for British growth this year to 1.2 % from 0.6 % , in line with a March budget forecast for 1 - 1.5 % .
But in 2011 it warns growth will only pick up to 2.1 % , significantly below a Treasury forecast of 3-3.5 % .
It described " a slow start to a protracted recovery " , highlighting pressures on private consumption , a key growth driver , from employment worries and stagnant wages .
Darling pointed out that the commission expected the UK to grow more quickly than other major European countries next year – including Germany , France , Italy , and the Netherlands .
" The European commission 's report shows again that our judgment call to support the economy was right .
Yet again George Osborne 's flaky judgment is exposed .
The Tories can not be allowed to derail the recovery , " he said .
But opposition politicians seized upon the outlook as evidence that a new government was needed to get the economy back on track .
" The day before the election the European commission has issued a damning indictment of Gordon Brown 's economic record , " said shadow chancellor George Osborne , claiming only the Conservatives would start dealing with Britain 's debts on Friday .
" He has left this country with the largest budget deficit in Europe – larger even than Greece – and projections for future growth well below his own forecasts . "
Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Lord Oakeshott said the EU report laid bare government overconfidence .
" This shows the government has been far too optimistic , " he said .
" What matters now is a credible deficit reduction plan backed by the nation .
If the Conservatives scrape home with barely a third of the vote and indulge in butchery behind closed doors , that just wo n't work .
That 's why the Liberal Democrats call for a council of fiscal stability with all three economic spokesmen , whoever they are , and the governor of the Bank of England to agree a credible deficit reduction plan . "
Economists warn that if the next UK government drags its feet in reducing the deficit it could spark a downgrade from one or more of the ratings agencies that have been so swift to reassess Greece and Spain 's creditworthiness .
The commission 's forecasts fanned those fears .
" From such a large deficit , we suspect that it will be hard for a hung parliament to establish a credible path back to fiscal sustainability , " said Michael Saunders , an economist at Citigroup .
London - based economists at BNP Paribas , have warned that the City is grossly underestimating the chance of a downgrade from the UK 's current top - notch AAA status .
They warn that an undecided Britain is heading towards a coalition government that would create distractions from repairing the public finances - something that would raise the chance of a downgrade to almost 50 % , compared with a consensus estimate of 10 % risk .
That , they say , could cost the taxpayer at least £ 10 bn because of higher interest costs on government borrowing .

Apple iPad Review
How and where you 'll use the iPad are of the essence .

Looking for iPhone 5 or 4S info ?
Check out our guides to the iPhone 5 and iPhone 4S .
Also check out our full Apple iPhone 4 review , the Best iPhone 4 cases , and our iPhone 4 vs. HTC EVO 4G and iPhone 4 vs. Motorola Droid X comparisons .
Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone 4 today , which he claims offers over 100 new features , though he would focus on only a handful for the keynote .
The iPhone 4 looks like the iPhone prototype obtained under questionable circumstances by Gizmodo : stainless steel casing , all - glass front , and a design Jobs describes as the thinnest smartphone on the planet : almost 25 percent thinner than the iPhone 3GS ..
Unlike previous iPhones , the iPhone 4 will have volume controls on the side of the phone along with an accessible microSIM tray .
The iPhone 4 features a front - facing camera , and the back sports a microphone , 30 pin connector for docking , and a speaker , while the top sports a second microphone for noise cancellation , sleep / wake button , and a headset input .
Jobs went on to highlight the bands around the side of the iPhone 4 that caused much speculation in the wake of the leaked prototypes .
Jobs identified them as part of the phone ’s antenna system , saying the stainless steel band is also a primarily structural element of the device .
The antenna supports all the iPhone 4 ’s wireless capability , from 3G to Wi-Fi to Bluetooth to GPS along with cellular communications .
i Phone 4 : Retina Display
The iPhone 4 will also sport what Jobs described as a “ retina display ” with four times the pixel density of a typical LCD display at a whopping 326 pixels per inch — by far denser than anything else in the consumer electronics market .
The result is a 3.5 - inch display with a native resolution of 960 by 640 pixels that is actually a higher resolution than the typical human eye is capable of perceiving , when held at a distance of just 10 to 12 inches .
Jobs claims the iPhone 4 ’s display winds up looking like a high quality printed book ( albeit that emits light ! ) rather than a blocky pixellated grid .
The iPhone OS automatically handles rendering text and controls at the higher resolution for the iPhone 4 , so developers do n’t need to do anything to update their applications to look good on the new display … but , of course , if developers want to add higher - resolution graphics to their apps , they will look stunning on the iPhone 4 .
i Phone 4 : A4 Chip and Gyroscope
The iPhone 4 will also feature an Apple - designed A4 CPU , following along the lines of the processor powering the iPad .
Jobs said the A4 processor improved power management , so the iPhone 4 will manage 40 percent more talk time on 3G networks ( up to 7 hours ) , or up to 6 hours of 3G Web browsing or 10 hours of Wi-Fi browsing .
The device can also play up to 10 hours of video , 40 hours of music , and should have an standby time of up to 300 hours .
The iPhone 4 will also pack up to 32 GB of onboard flash storage , and will offer quad - band HSDPA / HSUPA for mobile broadband speeds up to 7.2 M bps downstream , 4.8 M bps upstream …assuming carrier networks support that technology .
The iPhone 4 will also support 802.11n Wi -Fi , assisted GPS , Bluetooth , and packs and accelerometer , compass , proximity sensor , and an ambient light sensor , .
The iPhone 4 also sports a gyroscope , which enables six - axis motion sensing … just like a game controller , and iPhone OS 4 will offer developer APIs to leverage the gyroscope : Jobs envisions the gyroscope enabling whole new types of mobile gaming .
i Phone 4 : Camera & iMovie
The iPhone 4 will feature a 5 megapixel camera with a backside - illuminated sensor , which Jobs says increases the amount of light captured by the sensor , resulting in better photographs , particularly in low - light situations .
The camera will also record HD video at 720 p resolution and 30 frames per second , and the LED flash can be used to light video as well .
Like the iPhone 3GS , the iPhone 4 will feature in - phone video editing and enable users to share video the the Internet ( think Facebook and YouTube ) .
However , Apple is pushing the video editing envelope with a new iMovie application for iPhone , that enables users to assemble and trim clips and record directly into an iMovie timeline .
Users can also add camera photos to their movies ( complete with the pan - and - scan Ken Burns effect ) , and iMovie for iPhone will enable users to add titles and transitions to their videos .
The iPhone 4 camera embeds geolocation information in video ; iMovie for iPhone can optional display display that information .
Users can also add music as a soundtrack to their video , and select from a number of pre-generated themes .
iMovie for iPhone will be available as a separate purchase from the App Store for $ 4.99 .
i Phone 4 : Bing
Among new features in iOS 4 will be an option to use Microsoft ’s Bing as a default search engine ; Google will still be the iPhone ’s default search , but Yahoo and Bing - powered searches will be available as options .
Note that Bing will be taking over the back end for Yahoo ’s search services later this year .
iBooks for iPhone
Apple also announced a version of iBooks will be available for iPhone , with feature parity to the iPad edition ( complete with previously - announced PDF and annotations support ) .
The applications will be able to synchronize across devices , so users will be able to start reading an iBook on an iPad , then pick up at the same spot on the iPhone .
Users will be able to download purchased books to all their supported devices at no extra charge .
No Longer iPhone OS 4 : iOS 4
Since it wo n’t do to have an iPad running something called “ iPhone OS , ” Apple has decided to rename its mobile device operating system to simply “ iOS 4 , ” encompassing all its mobile devices : the iPhone , the iPad , and the iPod touch .
iOS 4 will have the features Apple outlined back in April , including a form of multitasking support ( so applications like Pandora can stream music in the background while an iPhone user , say , surfs the Web in Safari ) , a unified Mail inbox that supports multiple services , home screen folders , a Game Center , and improved support for Microsoft Exchange and enterprise users .
However , developers will probably be more intrigued by a boatload of new APIs and significantly deepened features .
Developers at WWDC will be able to set hands on a release candidate today .
iAds
Jobs also took a moment to highlight Apple ’s new in -application advertising platform iAds : according to Jobs , Apple is developing iAds as a revenue channel for developers so they can earn money from applications in ways other than direct sales to users .
As outlined last April , Apple is aiming for high amounts of interactivity and engagement with iAds , building on HTML5 technologies rather than the still - industry - standard Adobe Flash .
Apple will host all the advertising and handle ad sales , so all applications developers have to do is specify where in the applications the ads should be placed , then collect 60 percent of the revenue from placements in their applications .
Apple has only been selling iAds for about two months — they should go live Jule 1 — and so far has many major brands on board , including Disney ( Jobs is Disney ’s biggest single shareholder , remember ) , Target , Best Buy , Geico , DirecTV , and other major brands .
Unlike traditional banner ads that eject users from applications out into Web browsers , iAds run without exiting a user ’s application , providing an interactive experience without causing people to leave apps , or lose work or messages : the goal is an engaging experience that users know is “ safe ” regardless of the app they ’re using .
Video Calling
Of course , that front - facing camera in the iPhone 4 exists for one and only one purpose : video calls .
Jobs demonstrated what Apple is dubbing FaceTime video calling with the iPhone 4 .
The feature will initially be Wi-Fi only and operate iPhone 4 devices — no word in whether FaceTime will support , say , desktops or notebooks equipped with cameras .
Users will be able to switch to the rear - mounted 5 megapixel camera on the iPhone 4 to let callers see what they ’re seeing , or stick with the front - facing camera for face - to - face chat .
Jobs says
Apple plans to work with mobile operators to make FaceTime available over 3G data services .
Apple says it plans to ship millions of FaceTime - capable devices this year — and if current iPhone sales are any indicator , they ’re right — so iPhone 4 users will have plenty of people to talk to .

PHILADELPHIA —
A police officer used a Taser gun to apprehend a fan who ran onto the field during a Phillies game Monday night , and the team and the police are investigating whether it was an appropriate use of force .
The fan , wearing a baseball cap , red T - shirt and khaki shorts , hopped a fence and scurried around the outfield , eluding two security officers in the bottom of the eighth inning against the St. Louis Cardinals .
One officer used a Taser and the fan went down in a heap .
Several Phillies placed gloves over their faces and appeared to be stifling laughter at the wild scene .
Phillies spokeswomen Bonnie Clark said the police department is investigating the matter and discussing with the team whether using the stun gun was appropriate .
Police spokesman Lt. Frank Vanore told The Philadelphia Inquirer police internal affairs will open an investigation to determine if the firing " was proper use of the equipment . "
Vanore was not made available to The Associated Press when a call was placed to the police department 's public affairs office late Monday night .
The teams said it 's the first time a Taser has been used by police to apprehend a spectator who ran onto the field .
The fan was 17 - year - old male and he will be charged with criminal trespass and related offenses , the team said .
The Phillies did not release his name because he is a juvenile .

A woman charged with murdering her three - week - old son allegedly dismembered the baby and ate his brain , police said .
The 33 - year - old woman , from Texas in the US , is recovering in hospital after allegedly stabbing herself in the torso and slicing her own throat during the attack .
San Antonio police chief William McManus said the alleged attack occurred on Sunday morning , a week after the child 's father moved out .
LATEST : Mother accused of eating baby 's brain had schizophreniaThe woman had used a knife and two swords to dismember the baby , then eaten the child 's brain and some other body parts .
She had also decapitated the infant , torn off his face and chewed off three of his toes before stabbing herself .
" It 's too heinous for me to describe it any further , '' Mr McManus said .
He said police officers called to the woman 's house at 5 am on Sunday allegedly found her sitting on the couch screaming : " I killed my baby !
I killed my baby !'' The boy 's body was found in a bedroom .
The woman allegedly told police the devil told her to kill her son .
She is believed to have been previously admitted to a psychiatric ward .

The air smells of salt and mangrove there , of tropical rot and fresh - cut grass .

The car will be used by Strathclyde Police 's Gangs Task Force
A £ 40,000 car which once belonged to criminals in Glasgow is now being used by the police in the fight against serious crime .
The black Q7 was seized by officers from Strathclyde police during an operation against a criminal gang in the north of the city .
The 4x4 car has now been emblazoned with the force 's livery and will be used by the Gangs Task Force .
This is the first time Strathclyde Police has used a confiscated vehicle .
Assistant Chief Constable John Neilson said : " I would say to the criminals that what you have this week ; your houses , your cars - you might not have next week .
" The hard working , law abiding citizens need to know that we are hurting those involved in serious and organised crime where it matters - their pockets .
" These criminals are fast realising that they are not above the law .
They may think that they are getting away with it , but we are determined to make a long - term impact in this area . "
LONDON —
The leaders of Britain ’s bold new experiment in coalition government flung off their differences and stood side by side on Wednesday , promising to act in concert to promote economic stability , reform the country ’s frayed political system and demonstrate that their unlikely arrangement is more than just a hasty marriage of necessity .
The Conservative prime minister , David Cameron , and his deputy , Nick Clegg , a Liberal Democrat , pledged that their jury - rigged government , with a cabinet made up of both parties , would tackle the bloated deficit by cutting £ 6 billion from the budget this year .
They said that the new arrangement , which they were forced into when the Conservatives failed to achieve a parliamentary majority and looked to the Liberal Democrats to provide them with support , represented an end to the old politics of self - interest and partisan short - sightedness .
And they said they would work together to tear up the old political system by establishing five - year fixed terms for Parliament — though they left an escape clause for disgruntled legislators , under which Parliament could be dissolved if 55 percent of its members voted in favor of doing so .
The moves were intended to demonstrate to a jittery , skeptical public that the new government would act swiftly and that two parties whose past relations had shifted along the spectrum from contempt to indifference could , in fact , function harmoniously and stably .

ALL PART OF THE PLAN ….
We talked earlier about the Obama administration ’s apparent intention to allow new oil and natural gas drilling along the Atlantic coastline , the eastern Gulf of Mexico , and the north coast of Alaska .
Given that this move could be used as a bargaining chip with Republicans during negotiations on energy policy , I questioned what the White House would get in exchange for the president ’s concession .
If the president has already effectively given Republicans what they wanted on energy , what will he get in return ?
A Hill staffer I know emails with an alternative look at the same dynamic , suggesting President Obama is playing a game we ’ve seen before .
I ’m republishing the staffer ’s email with permission .
Obama preempts the other side ’s most resonant arguments , which forces them to come up with more and more extreme claims in order to differentiate themselves .
In the end , he occupies the reasonable middle ground and his opponents are Palinized .
It does n’t always work — on the national security / gitmo / Miranda stuff , for example , it turns out the utter extreme positions the right is left with given the centrist ground Obama has staked out turns out to be fairly popular .
But even there , the Administration has had reasonable success pushing back on the Miranda nonsense and , because they effectively occupy the tough , pragmatic middle ground , they routinely get cover from non-crazy Republican national security voices , which has helped blunt the force of these issues .
( I understand that the term “ middle ground ” is very slippery and dangerous here , but I basically use it to mean policies that , before the great crazy of 2009 had broad consensus support from large portions of both parties and the Broder / Friedman / Brooks axis . )
At the same time , the policy is a tailored , measured version of what the Republicans have urged — so , yes , the headline is , ‘ Obama Allows New Offshore Drilling / Presses For Energy Independence , ’ but at the same time , California / Oregon / Washington where opposition is strongest is n’t included , and there are environmentally - friendly changes to Alaska leasing policy announced at the same time .
And again , as we ’ve seen before , Republicans are sort of forced to twist and parse , and even to oppose things they have long supported , just because the Administration has n’t gone far enough .
Finally , by announcing the drilling policy without seeking to extract concessions , the Administration makes clear that it is their policy and they are the centrist / flexible / pragmatic ones — making it harder for Republicans to argue that they accomplished this or that they forced Obama to do it . [… ]
[ O ] f course , if there was any reason to believe that Republicans would engage in normal negotiation / compromise , then I see why holding this back and trading it for support of a broader package would make sense .
But does anyone really think there are Republicans to negotiate with on this stuff ?
And if Republicans do come to the table , Obama still has plenty of room to give , including by simply agreeing to sign a law that makes proposals like this a matter of statute , not executive discretion .
That ’s an interesting take .
Something to keep in mind .
And by the way , right on cue , House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) denounced the administration ’s drilling plan , despite its similarity to GOP demands , with Boehner expressing his outrage that the president did n’t go further .
What a shock .
Voters still want Adu .
Despite the sizzling hot form of both Edson Buddle and Herculez Gomez , Goal.com voters still pine for the silky skills of former wonderkid Freddy Adu .
In a poll , 40 % Goal.com users indicated a desire for Adu to get one last look from U.S. national team boss Bob Bradley , compared to 37 % for Gomez and 23 % for Buddle .
Freddy
Adu has seen his career come off the boil drastically in recent years .
He burst onto the American landscape as a talented 13 - year - old and soon earned a move to D.C. United in Major League Soccer .
Without ever stamping his imprint on the league either there or with Real Salt Lake , Adu moved to Benfica .
After a successful run in cup competitions his first year there , Adu experienced two failed loans , first at Monaco then with Belenenses .
Now 20 , Adu plays on FC Aris with fellow U.S. international Eddie Johnson .
A lack of physical stature and poor work rate have all but shoved Adu out of the national team picture in the last year or two , with Bradley preferring more complete forwards than Adu 's playmaker build .
Given the car accident which left Charlie Davies ' World Cup in jeopardy , much speculation has circled Gomez and Buddle as possible options for the 23 - man roster .
Buddle has scored all of the Los Angeles Galaxy 's seven goals in the opening four MLS games , setting a league record .
Gomez finished the Mexican season with 10 goals to his name .
However , both players combined can claim only three U.S. national team caps .
A 30 - man roster will train under the eye of Bob Bradley at Princeton in May as players jostle for one last shot at a ticket to South Africa .

Welcome to the Polyamory Media Association
We maintained a database of qualified public speakers for lectures and workshops for colleges , churches , conventions , and any organization who was interested in education about polyamory in the form of lectures , panels , and workshops .
We helped researchers gather people for surveys and studies about alternative sexualities .
We worked with folks who practice polyamory , responsible non-monogamy , open marriages , open relationships , triads , quads , networks , tribes , swingers , and those who do n't choose any label but prefer a nontraditional relationship style .
But in 2013 , we decided that the poly community and the media were ready to work together on their own .
More and more poly folk were becoming media savvy and more and more media were becoming aware of polyamory and poly communities and so did not need to come here to find respondents .

( CNN ) -- A Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , police officer who told authorities he was shot while on patrol last month has admitted he shot himself intentionally , the city 's police commissioner said Tuesday .
Sgt. Robert Ralston , 46 , confessed to police early Tuesday morning that he made up the story , possibly to a get attention or a transfer , Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey said in a news conference .
Ralston reported that on April 5 he saw two African - American males arguing on a train track in West Philadelphia .
He told investigators that when he stopped the two men for questioning one of them pulled out a gun and shot him in the left shoulder .
His claim sparked a search for a phantom suspect .
Ramsey noted that there were many inconsistencies throughout the month - long investigation .
" The evidence never did match up .
We have forensic evidence at the scene that did not match with the story , " he said .
One example of inconsistent evidence was that the gunpowder residue found on Ralston 's shirt matched the ammunition used by the police department , he said .
The commissioner said that Ralston , who is white , told police his attackers were black because the district where the shooting took place is predominately black .
" It 's troubling in a lot of ways , " Ramsey said .
" It inflames racial tensions in our community , and that 's certainly something we do n't need . "
Ralston , a 21 - year veteran of the police force , will be made to pay the cost of the investigation that followed his report , and has been suspended with the intent to dismiss , Ramsey said .
He will not , however , face criminal charges because police granted him immunity to obtain his confession .
Today is Good Friday , when Christians commemorate the crucifixion of Jesus Christ .
Good Friday is part of Holy Week , a series of religious holidays and observations commemorating the last week of the earthly life of Jesus Christ and his resurrection on Easter Sunday .
Observances vary widely around the world , often incorporating elements of local pre-Christian traditions , and range from the elaborate and fanciful to simple and reverential .

Scientists Make Crude Oil from Pig Manure
April 16th , 2010 by Tina Casey
Pig manure is one step away from a transformation of metamorphic proportions .
The lowly waste product , notorious for its impact on the environment and on human olfactory nerves , is on the verge of becoming an important alternative to petroleum now that scientists at the University of Illinois have developed a process for converting raw pig manure to crude oil .
With further development , the process may even yield biodiesel .
[ social_buttons ]
If successful commercially , the process would help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants from pig farms and many other types of livestock operations .
In particular , it could help protect drinking water supplies in livestock farming areas .
Pig Manure and Oil Supplies
When it comes to providing an alternative source of oil , pig manure ai n’t no small potatoes .
According to an article by Steve Giegerich in the St. Louis Post - Dispatch , one pig generates up to 8 pounds of manure per day .
The research team estimates that a 10,000 - hog farm could produce about 5,000 barrels of crude oil per year .
The bottom line : instead of ending up with a manure waste disposal nightmare , hog farms could see an increase in income of up to $ 15 per hog .
Make Oil , Not Manure
The manure - to - oil process uses thermochemical conversion , in which heat and pressure act on organic compounds in a revved - up , tightly controlled imitation of the much longer process that occurs in nature .
In order to develop a commercially viable method , the research team ditched the catalyst required by the conventional process , and they figured out a way to keep pig hair and dander from fouling the equipment .
The team also skipped the conventional first step , which would be to dewater the manure .
Instead , their process uses raw manure containing 80 % water .
The use of raw manure requires more heat to activate the conversion , but the researchers note that could be captured and recycled with a heat exchanger .
The Future of Manure Oil
As Giegerich reports , for now the manure oil is being tested as a low grade binder for asphalt on a stretch of road near I - 44 in Illionis .
The team has also refined the product to an oil that could compete with diesel fuel .
If the process can be made cost - effective , it will be the latest in a series of fast - breaking developments in converting manure to an important alternative to fossil fuels in the U.S.
It ’s already happening with manure and methane gas conversion .
In particular , the dairy industry is already advancing quickly along the cow manure - to - methane road , partly in a water quality preservation effort .

What 's striking about the Rand Paul / Alex Jones interview is how much in agreement the two men seem , and it's more than that - it 's obvious they think they 're in the same movement .
Rand Paul has been widely cast as a libertarian but there 's considerable evidence tying him to another tendency - theocratic Christian nationalism , and specifically Christian Reconstructionism .
As my story Rand Paul Keynoted 2009 ‘ Biblical Law ’ Constitution Party Rally detailed , In April of 2009 Ran Paul was the featured speaker for a Minnesota Constitution Party rally .
The Constitution Party was originally founded , as The U.S. Taxpayers Party , by Howard Phillips , who called Christian Reconstructionism founder R.J. Rushdoony " my wise counselor . "
Rushdoony 's Chalcedon Foundation was the central institutional locus for the budding Christian Reconstructionist movement , and in 1989 , as Frederick Clarskon 's Eternal Hostility : The Struggle Between Theocracy and Decmocracy ( 1997 , Common Courage Press ) details ,
" In 1989 , [ Howard ]
Phillips authored a fundraising letter soliciting $ 1,000 donors for the Chalcedon Foundation in which he wrote " Each of us who has read The Institutes of Biblical Law ... has been uniquely privileged .
God has blessed us with the opportunity for exposure to the insights and teachings of a great theologian and servant ...
I have no doubt that he will be ever after regarded as one of the most significant figures in the history of Christian thought and advocacy . "
Rousas Rushdoony gave a speech at the 1992 inaugural event launching the new Taxpayers Party , later to become The Constitution Party .
Rushdoony advocated executing homosexuals by stoning , wanted to reimpose the institution of slavery , and maintained that the Sun rotated around the Earth .
He was a Holocaust denier , a racist , a creationist , and claimed that African - American slaves were lucky .
In 2008 Rand Paul 's father , U.S. Texas Congressman Ron Paul , endorsed the Constitution Party candidate for president and even , according to Religion Dispatches ' Sarah Posner , spoke at a 2009 Constitution Party fundraiser .
As my Rand Paul Keynoted 2009 ‘ Biblical Law ’ Constitution Party Rally story notes , in Rand Paul 's July 23 Alex Jones Show appearance Rand Paul told Jones that his political beliefs were close to identical to his father's .
I 'd guess there 's more to this story than I 've had time for , but meanwhile , here 's an audio excerpt from Rand Paul 's April 23 , 2009 Alex Jones appearance ,
And here 's a partial transcript ,
It is customary to divide online advertising into two categories : direct response and brand advertising .
I prefer instead to divide it according to the mindset of users : whether or not they are actively looking to purchase something ( i.e. they have purchasing intent ) . *
When users are actively looking to purchase something , they typically go to search engines or e-commerce sites .
Through advertising or direct sales , these sites harvest intent .
Google and Amazon are the biggest financial beneficiaries of intent harvesting .
When the user is not actively looking to buy something , the goal of an online ad is to generate intent .
The intent generation market is still fairly fragmented and will grow rapidly over the next few years as brand advertising increasingly moves online .
P&G – which alone spends almost $ 4B / year on brand advertising – needs to convince the next generation of consumers that Crest is better than Colgate .
This is why Google paid such a premium for Doubleclick , Yahoo for Right Media , and Microsoft for aQuantive ( MS ’s biggest acquisition ever ) .
In 2003 , Google introduced AdSense , a program to syndicate their intent harvesting text ads beyond Google ’s main property Google.com .
The playbook they followed was : use their popular website to build a critical mass of advertisers ; then use that critical mass to run an off - property network that offers the highest payouts to publishers .
AdSense became so dominant that competitors like Yahoo quit the syndicated ad business altogether .
Today , Google has such a powerful position that they do n’t disclose percentage revenue splits to publishers and extract the vast majority of the profits .
It is widely believed that Facebook will soon follow the AdSense playbook by introducing an off - property ad network .
They ’ll try to use their strong base of advertisers to dominate intent generating ads the way AdSense dominated intent harvesting ads .
But to win the intent generation ad battle , data is as important as a critical mass of advertisers .
For intent harvesting , users simply type what they are looking for into a search box .
For intent generating ads , you need to use data to make inferences about what might influence the user .
This is what the introduction of the Facebook Like button is all about .
Intent generating ads – which mostly means displays ads – have notoriously low click through rates ( well below 1 % ) .
Attempts to improve these numbers through demographics have basically failed .
Many startups are having success using social data to target ads today .
But the holy grail for targeting intent generating ads is taste data – which basically means what the user likes .
Knowing , for example , that a user liked Avatar is an incredibly useful datapoint for targeting an Avatar 2 ad .
Publishers who adopt Facebook ’s Like feature may get more traffic and perhaps a better user experience as a result .
But they should hope the intent generation ad market does n’t end up like the intent harvesting ad market – with one dominant player commanding the lion ’s share of the profits .
* Most text ads are about intent harvesting and most display ads are about intent generation , but they are not coreferential distinctions .
For example , with techniques like “ search retargeting ” ( you do a Google search for washing machines and the later on another site see a display ad for washing machines ) , sometimes intent harvesting is delivered through display ads .
DUBLIN , Ireland ―
It ’s not quite like Amsterdam yet , but against the odds Dublin is becoming a city of cyclists again .
A free bicycle scheme in this rainy metropolis of narrow roads , potholes and , it has to be said , bicycle thieves , has been a spectacular triumph .
Indeed Dublin City Council boasts that the program is “ the most successful in the world by any measure . ”
Despite predictions that the 450 specially - made bikes , available from 40 stations around the city , would quickly be stolen or tossed in the River Liffey by vandals , only two have been pilfered in the first six months of operation .
These were quickly recovered , and none have been vandalized , according to council spokesman Paul Finan .
It helps that the bicycle is ugly and that one needs a credit card to use it .
The machine is free for the first half an hour , but costs half a euro ( $ 0.67 ) for the first full hour , and 6.50 euros for four hours .
This ensures that riders do n’t leave them lying around , otherwise the final charge on their credit card would be substantial .
“ The scheme has exceeded all expectations , ” said Finan .
“ Since its launch in September '09 , we are heading for over 500,000 trips with a population of 1.2 million people in the Dublin region . ”
Dublin ’s success compares dramatically with a similar scheme launched in Paris in 2007 and run by the same company , JC Decaux .
In the first 18 months , half the original fleet of 15,000 in the French capital disappeared .
Many were dumped in the Seine , and a few ended up in eastern Europe and Africa .
The Dublin bicycle program is part of an effort by the council to reduce carbon emissions and make the Irish capital a green city .
A government bike - to - work tax incentive program introduced last year has also increased the number of bicycles on the road .
It allows employers to buy bikes for up to a maximum of 1,000 euros , and sell them to their workers tax - free , which reduces the price by about 40 percent .
Alas , the shiny new bikes bought under the bike - to - work scheme have created a bigger turnover for bicycle thieves .
According to the Irish Central Statistics
Office , the number of private bicycles reported stolen in Dublin in the first nine months of last year rose by nearly one - third , to 3,136 , compared to the same period the previous year .
The real figure is undoubtedly higher as many people do n’t bother reporting the theft of bicycles .
( Bicycle stealing is one of the oldest forms of theft in Dublin .
This correspondent recalls his Raleigh being lifted 40 years ago , and being told by a police sergeant , with an exaggerated wink , “ there ’s your bike over there , ” as he pointed to a thousand stolen machines in a storage shed .
I took the nearest good - looking one and cycled happily away . )
The police in Dublin have also taken to the bicycle again after a lapse of half a century .
For the last five years police patrols on mountain bikes have become a familiar sight in the Irish capital .
This , as any reader of the celebrated satirist Flann O’Brien will know , carries special risks .
In O'Brien 's popular book “ The Third Policeman , ” published in 1940 , a guardian of the law spends so much time on his bicycle that molecules are transferred from one to the other , and he adopts the habits of the machine , preferring to rest by propping an elbow against the wall .
To encourage cyclists , the council has also dropped the Dublin speed limit in the city center to 20 miles an hour .
At that rate the cyclist is just as likely as the motorist to get a speeding ticket .
Incidentally , the image of a rainy Dublin is not quite accurate .
The city gets 29 inches of rain a year .
This compares to 42 inches a year in Boston and 45 inches in New York .
According to the Irish meteorological office , Met Eireann , a commuter who spends 15 minutes cycling to work every day will get wet on only four days out of every 100 .
This assumes , of course , that the cyclist can pick just the right time between the showers .
A stunning new video of Iceland 's rumbling , smoking volcano Eyjafjallajokull shows rainbow - like shockwaves belching from the crater like snakes from a can of nuts .
Nothing to fear , though , it 's merely the aftereffects of Plinian events .
While rarely captured this well on film , they 're not uncommon , according to vulcanologist Jim Quick , associate vice president for research and dean of grad studies at Southern Methodist University .
Quick was coordinator of the volcano hazards program with the USGS , and says he 's seen shockwaves like this before himself -- in person .
" We were standing on the slopes of Anatahan in the Marianas Islands , " he explains , putting a series of monitoring stations around the remote Pacific island .
" There were a series of these explosions hurling giant boulders above the rim .
And before you could feel the shockwave , you 'd see it as a series of rainbow - like structures just like this . "
Quick explained that in a vulcanian eruption like that going on at Eyjafjallajokull -- the term describes a volcano exhibiting a series of explosive bursts -- you 'll see explosions called Plinian events , after the historian Pliny who described the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 AD .
These events are essentially explosive releases of gas .
" You have volcanic gases that are held by the magma as it rises toward the surface .
Eventually you get to the point where the gases separate from the magma , like popping the top from a soda bottle , " Quick explains .
The gases expand rapidly and separate from the magma , causing explosive bursts of tremendous magnitude equivalent to a significant dynamite explosion .
As the video shows , the explosion hurls incandescent blobs of lava hundreds of feet into the air -- and cause visible shockwaves .
These shockwaves reflect off the floor and the walls of the crater , shaking the entire surrounding area .
In the Marianas Islands , Quick says he could feel the shockwaves rumbling beneath his feet .
" We were half a mile from the actual crater rim , and you could feel it . "
Visible shockwaves are n't uncommon , occurring with any volcano having an explosive eruption , Quick explained .
On the smaller scale , Plinian events cause them and lead to ejecting blobs of lava .
But Quick notes that such rumbles can have much greater ramifications .
" On the larger scale , they cause Plinian eruptions like Mt. St Helen in 1981 , " he pointed out .

It ’s lucky that in springtime there are still days cool enough to enjoy baking .
One of my favorite springtime desserts is a ring of light pastry with an enticing , liberal layer of whipped , creamy filling showing all around .
Oddly enough , the classic creation was supposed to have been designed to recall a bicycle tire .
The French call this impressive crown - shaped cake gateau Paris - Brest , which was named for a bicycle race that took place between Paris and Brest , a port city at the western end of France .
To some this image might not seem fitting for an elegant dessert , but many Frenchmen and women are as addicted to their cycling races as they are to their desserts .
The glorious gateau , garnished with sliced almonds and powdered sugar , is a beautiful dessert , owing part of its appeal to the simplicity of its presentation .
It needs no intricate embellishment .
Technically , this popular cake is a cream puff in a different form .
Unlike eclairs , which are also made of cream puff dough , the ring - shaped pastry is fairly easy to form if you first trace a circle on a buttered baking sheet .
Before putting the dough ring in the oven , you sprinkle it with sliced almonds , which toast to light brown as the pastry bakes .
It ’s lovely to watch the cake puff and smell the almonds toasting as it bakes .
In old - fashioned French patisserie , the filling of the golden gateau Paris - Brest is made of an elaborate butter - enriched pastry cream flavored with praline , or ground caramel - coated almonds .
For springtime I opt for a lighter filling : I love my gateau bursting with bright - flavored , fresh berries and ruffles of Chantilly cream – French sweetened whipped cream flavored with real vanilla .
Chocolate fillings are wonderful too , like one of whipped ganache , made of chocolate melted in hot cream , then cooled and beaten to a mousse - like texture .
The dough itself is easy to make and is ready in a few minutes , with no need for a food processor , a rolling pin or a counter messy with flour .
You just cook the butter and water briefly in a saucepan , and beat in flour and eggs with a wooden spoon .
In fact , it ’s so easy , you might want to make a double batch and bake the extra dough in large spoonfuls as cream puffs .
Then freeze them for summer , when you might not feel like baking ; thawed and filled with ice cream and doused with chocolate sauce , they ’ll make phenomenal profiteroles !
For this new version of French gateau Paris - Brest , I use an easy - to - make , scrumptious filling of orange - scented whipped chocolate ganache .
The baked pastry cake can be kept , covered , up to one day at room temperature but tastes best on the day it is baked .
You can keep the filled cake , covered , up to eight hours in the refrigerator .
Cream puff dough ( see next recipe ) 1 egg , beaten with a pinch of salt ( for glaze ) 2 Tbsp. sliced almonds ( for sprinkling ) Powdered sugar ( for sprinkling ) Chocolate - Orange Whipped Ganache : 3 medium - sized navel oranges350 gr. fine quality semisweet chocolate , very finely chopped 11 ⁄2 cups heavy creamPosition rack in lower third of oven and preheat to 200º .

Remove from heat ; cool about 3 minutes .
Add 1 egg ; beat thoroughly into mixture .
Add second egg ; beat mixture until smooth .
Beat third egg in a small bowl .
Gradually beat 1 or 2 tablespoons of this egg into dough , adding enough so dough becomes very shiny and is soft enough so it just falls from the wooden spoon .
Add a pinch of salt to remaining egg ; beat until blended .
Reserve as glaze .
Refrigerate glaze until ready to use .
Makes enough dough for a 20 - cm. ring cake or 15 to 20 cream puffs .
Fresh from France : Dessert SensationsSefer Ha’ugot ( The Book of Cakes ) ,
Mr Hawking says it is ' perfectly rational ' to believe in aliens Aliens almost certainly exist but humans should avoid making contact , Professor Stephen Hawking has warned .
In a series for the Discovery Channel the renowned astrophysicist said it was " perfectly rational " to assume intelligent life exists elsewhere .
But he warned that aliens might simply raid Earth for resources , then move on .
" If aliens visit us , the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America , which did n't turn out well for the Native Americans , " he said .
Prof Hawking thinks that , rather than actively trying to communicate with extra-terrestrials , humans should do everything possible to avoid contact .
He explained : " We only have to look at ourselves to see how intelligent life might develop into something we would n't want to meet . "
The real challenge is to work out what aliens might actually be like
Stephen Hawking
In the past , probes have been sent into space with engravings of human beings on board and diagrams showing the location of our planet .
Radio beams have been fired into space in the hope of reaching alien civilisations .
Prof Hawking said : " To my mathematical brain , the numbers alone make thinking about aliens perfectly rational .
" The real challenge is to work out what aliens might actually be like . "
The programme envisages numerous alien species including two - legged herbivores and yellow , lizard - like predators .
But Prof Hawking conceded most life elsewhere in the universe is likely to consist of simple microbes .
HAVE YOUR SAY
I believe that it is inevitable that different forms of life exist within our universe Rogerjohn
In the recent BBC series Wonders of the Solar System , Professor Brian Cox , a physicist from the University of Manchester , also suggested life may exist elsewhere within our solar system .
He said organisms could be present under the ice sheet that envelops Europa , one of Jupiter 's moons .
Professor
Cox added : " Closer to home , the evidence that life could exist on Mars is growing .
" We will only know for sure when the next generation of spacecraft , fine - tuned to search for life , are launched to the moons of Jupiter and the arid plains of Mars in the coming decades . "

Water is a basic human right , the right to survive .
" Blue Gold " reports on various powers trying to take control of the public 's water for profit and control .
These powers fail to realize that people will not allow their water to be taken .
People fight , because they must .
In every corner of the globe , we are polluting , diverting , pumping , and wasting our limited supply of fresh water at an exponential level as population and technology grows , resulting in the desertification of the earth .
Corporate giants profit by forcing developing countries to privatize their shrinking water supply .
Wall Street investors target desalination and mass bulk water export schemes to turn a global catastrophe into a product .
Corrupt governments use water for economic and political gain , military control of water emerges , and a new geopolitical map and power structure forms , setting the stage for world water wars .
The good news is that people everywhere have fought and will continue fighting for their basic right to water , from Michigan court cases to violent Bolivian revolutions , from Mexican awareness Caravans ( right ) to Maine citizens dumping bottle water back into their river ( above left ) , or even third graders protesting in grade school - People fight , because they must .

Mr. Marshall said that Father Murphy visited him there , that they sat on the bed talking , and that the priest tried to put his hand down the boy ’s pants .
Mr. Marshall said he resisted , and as soon as Father Murphy left the cell , the teenager told a security officer , who called the superintendent of the center .
The superintendent interviewed him twice to make sure he did not change his story .
But Mr. Marshall said the superintendent told him that they had had previous complaints about Father Murphy , and that the priest ’s superiors had been told .
Another accusation , from a former altar boy at a church in Boulder Junction , surfaced in a letter written to a bishop , Raphael M. Fliss , in the Diocese of Superior , covering the Northwoods region .
The accuser , now a teacher , came forward in 2002 , at age 52 , stating that Father Murphy had sexually abused him at his lake cottage .
It is not clear whether Father Murphy was still working in Milwaukee when he met the second accuser , who is believed to have been from the Northwoods .
“ I want you to know that Father Murphy molested me many times at his cottage in Boulder Jct since I was a little , naïve , deaf boy , ” wrote the man , whose name had been redacted in the document received by The New York Times .
It is unclear whether he attended St. John ’s School for the Deaf in St. Francis , outside Milwaukee , where Father Murphy had worked .
In a letter , the man also asked for a settlement of $ 25,000 “ so I can forgive you and not be angry when I see the church , ” he stated .
A call to Bishop Fliss , now retired , was not returned this week .
The Diocese of Superior said it had had no comment to add about the Murphy case .
Years earlier , when Father Murphy was still at St. John ’s , he was said to gravitate to boys who were sexually inexperienced and lacking in social skills , according to Kathy Lyn Walter , a social worker and an expert on sexual disorders who was hired by the archdiocese to interview Father Murphy in 1993 .
She said he offered them what seemed like a beachfront reprieve from their lives in the dormitories , with canoe trips , picnics and barbecues .
The chief executive of BP told a British newspaper that the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is " relatively tiny " compared with the " very big ocean . "
Tony Hayward , in an interview with the Guardian newspaper at the company 's Houston crisis center , said :
" The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean .
The amount of volume of oil and dispersant we are putting into it is tiny in relation to the total water volume , " he said .
U.S. officials estimate that at least 5,000 barrels of oil per day are leaking from a pipeline more than 5,000 feet deep that was damaged more than three weeks ago by an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig , which later sunk .
Eleven workers died in the disaster .
Hayward told the Guardian that BP would " fix " the disaster , which could become the biggest ecological disaster in U.S. history .
" We will fix it .
I guarantee it , " he told the newspaper .
" The only question is we do not know when . "
Jeffrey Sweetin , the Drug Enforcement Administration ’s top agent in Colorado , said Monday there must be “ aggravating factors ” before he would raid businesses involved in the state ’s medical - marijuana industry .
Sweetin said medical - marijuana growers and dispensaries operating within the limits of state law are not ordinarily worth his agents ’ time .
Because of that , there have been instances when DEA agents have taken no action against marijuana - growing operations after an initial investigation , Sweetin said .
“ There ’s no question that these guys who are growing weed are violating federal law , ” Sweetin said during a meeting with The Denver Post ’s editorial board .
“ The real question is what are we going to do about it ? ”
Sweetin said agents would only pursue cases against medical - marijuana distributors if those businesses had links to criminal organizations , were run by people with lengthy criminal backgrounds , were feeding the marijuana black market , were operating “ far over the line ” of state law or had some other combination of shady dealings .
Sweetin ’s comments come a little over a week before a hearing in which Chris Bartkowicz , a Highlands Ranch man charged in federal court with marijuana cultivation , is expected to plead guilty .
DEA agents seized plants and growing equipment from Bartkowicz ’s home earlier this year .
The bust — along with comments Sweetin made that medical - marijuana businesses are at risk of federal prosecution — spread fear through Colorado ’s medical - marijuana industry .
Activists and politicians complained that Sweetin was in violation of a Department of Justice memo that advises federal prosecutors to back off patients and small - scale providers in medical - marijuana states .
Bartkowicz was targeted , Sweetin said , because he had more plants than specified in state law , because he had prior drug convictions and because he was growing near a school .
Sweetin said that while medical - marijuana activists think he went too far in busting Bartkowicz , he ’s also heard from residents and local law enforcement officials urging him to go further in targeting medical - marijuana operations .
He said he would prefer the DEA focus on international criminal groups and said he does n’t want to become the state ’s pot cop .
“ I ca n’t send people out every time there ’s a marijuana case , ” he said .

The Android devices we ’ve been anticipating from LG for a while now have finally launched in South Korea .
Both handsets , headed to Korean carriers SK Telecom and KT , are equipped with a 1ghz Qualcomm Snapdragon processor , 3.5 - inch AMOLED 800×480 display , and a 5 - megapixel camera .
We ’re inherently jealous of our Korean Phandroids that ’ll be able to scoop the LG LU2300 up .
Alongside that , the LG SU2300 will launch , as well .
The phones are identical in specs with difference coming from the SU2300 ’s slideout QWERTY keyboard as well as a built - in trackpad .
The phones will come stocked with Android 1.6 on LG ’s custom user interface , but should see an upgrade to 2.1 this summer .
Also announced was the Android 2.1 - running LG SU950 / KU9500 .
No specs on this particular phone , yet , but we expect to hear more once LG launches it in June .
Until then , we ’ll hold on to hope that we ’ll get some of LG ’s love in other parts of the world , too .

In a post last week about a federal judge in Wisconsin ruling that the congressionally - led National Day of Prayer was unconstitutional , I predicted that conservative Christians would shout that the decision was akin to banning prayer .
Guess what ?
The National Day of Prayer ’s web site had this to say about it :
The National Day of Prayer belongs to Americans .
It is a tradition that dates back to 1775 and it is not for a Judge to take away .
We the people called for the day of prayer and for 59 years we have practiced our freedom to gather and pray .
This is an attack upon our religious freedoms and it is a sad day in America when an atheist in Wisconsin can undermine this tradition for millions of others who simply wish to join their fellow citizens in praying for their country .
U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb wrote in her decision , the day “ serves no purpose but to encourage a religious exercise , making it difficult for a reasonable observer to see the statute as anything other than a religious endorsement . ”
The National Day of Prayer statement also says : “ The National Day of Prayer provides an opportunity for all Americans to pray voluntarily according to their own faith — it does not violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment . ”
Of course , this statement forgets that atheists and non-believers , like the members of the Freedom From Religion Foundation that filed the lawsuit , are citizens too and that the Establishment Clause also applies to them .
But the words “ according to their faith ” do n’t exactly ring true .
The Minnesota Independent has an interesting story that reveals much about the event ’s true purpose :
In recent years , only evangelicals were invited to speak at the event , which is part of Shirley Dobson ’s — and Focus on the Family ’s — plan for the nationwide events .
In fact , Sharon Auldrich , Minnesota coordinator for the National Day of Prayer , was hand - picked by Dobson .
Auldrich said that this year ’s event at the Capitol on May 6 will only be “ strengthened ” by the court decision .
“ This ruling will continue the process of refining and drawing out those who believe faith in God is vital and will encourage them to stand strong on Biblical principles , ” she said .
“ We are commanded to pray for our country and those in authority . ”
She added , “ God uses for good what the enemy has planned to use to destroy . ”
She said the court decision will be test for Christians , including President Obama .
“ What this does is draw a line in the sand , and those who say they believe in God and say they have biblical values will have to step forward and prove it , ” said Auldrich .
“ The request for President Obama to appeal [ the decision ] is going to be a very interesting test for him . ”
Look , nobody is being kept from praying .
As the saying goes , just as long as there are algebra tests , there will be prayer in school .
Nothing in the decision prevents a person , either by joining together with others or quietly in the privacy of one ’s bedroom , from praying to one ’s God .
Let ’s not forget what Christ had to say about this in Matthew 6:5 :
The US military say that a military strike may only delay Iran from getting a nuclear weapon .
By Kim Ghattas
BBC News , Washington
If Iran decides to go for nuclear weapons , the US may not be able to permanently stop this from happening unless it is willing to occupy the country .
This is the candid conclusion of one US general testifying in front of the Senate but one that seems to have gone mostly unnoticed amid a flurry of statements on Iran over the past few days in Washington .
Gen James Cartwright , one of America 's top uniformed officers , slowly edged towards that conclusion during a Senate testimony last week , underscoring the difficult choices facing the Obama administration as it weighs what do about Iran .
Gen Cartwright agreed a military strike would only delay Iran Since the US would probably be extremely apprehensive about even considering putting boots on the ground in Iran , the statement raises a key question - while the Obama administration publicly maintains that it will not allow Iran 's current leaders to acquire nuclear weapons , is it privately discussing how to live with a nuclear Iran ?
The military is averse to any action against Iran and Adm Mike Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said a military strike would be ' his last option " and has warned of the unintended consequences of such a strike .
One of those consequences could be a boost in the life expentancy of the Iranian leadership .
If Iran comes under attack from the outside , Iranians will likely rally around their leaders or be forced to do so .
This would put an end to any internal dissent and delay the prospect of internal pressure for change .
After all , a different Iranian leadership that cooperates more with the international community is another way of allaying concerns about Iranian nuclear ambitions .
But during the Senate testimony , which also featured the state department 's
No 3 official , William Burns , the senators questioning the panel also established that UN sanctions would probably not be tough enough to really have an impact on Tehran .
' Nuclear virginity ' Senator Jack Reed , a Democrat from Rhode Island , then asked Gen Cartwright whether the " military approach was a magic wand " .
Gen Cartwright , the vice - chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , acknowledged it was not , adding that military action alone was unlikely to be decisive .
Senator Reed prodded further , getting the general to agree that a military strike would only delay Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon if Tehran decided to go nuclear .
We keep pointing the gun , we have n't pulled a single trigger yet , and it's about time that we did
Senator John McCain
The senator then went further , asking whether the only way to absolutely end any potential Iranian nuclear weapon programme " was to physically occupy their country and disestablish their nuclear facilities ? "
The general answered : " Absent some other unknown calculus that would go on , that 's a fair conclusion . "
Graham Allison from the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at the Harvard Kennedy School said it was very difficult to stop a state determined to get the nuclear bomb if they decided they wanted it .
" Iran has lost its nuclear virginity , and it's a fact that can't be erased , " said Mr Allison .
A lot of the focus in recent days has been on a leaked memo sent by Defence Secretary Robert Gates , which apparently lays out what steps to take against Iran 's nuclear programme if it ignores international sanctions .
The memo was described by the New York Times as a wake up call for the administration , but Mr Gates said it was meant " to contribute to an orderly and timely decision process making " .
Either way , the Obama administration is considering the options it has if sanctions do not have the intended impact .
But critics say that is not enough .
' So far , no action ' " We have not done anything that would in any way be viewed effective .
I did n't need a secret memo from Mr Gates to ascertain that , " said Republican Senator John McCain on Fox News over the weekend .
URANIUM ENRICHED TO ... 3.5 % , Iran 's current level , is used in nuclear power stations 20 % is used in research reactors 90 % and above is used in nuclear weapons
Q&A : Iran and the nuclear issue Iran 's key nuclear sites Senator McCain was also on the Senate armed services committee questioning Gen Cartwright .
" The list goes on and on of the threats that we have made to the Iranians and so far no action " said Senator McCain .
" George Schultz , my favourite secretary of state in all the world , once said his marine drill instructor told him , never point a gun at somebody unless you 're ready to pull the trigger .
We keep pointing the gun .
We have n't pulled a single trigger yet , and it 's about time that we did . "
Senator McCain was probably also speaking figuratively about crippling sanctions .
" The ripple effects in the region of a military strike against Iran would be ugly , " said one senior US official speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue .
But he added that the longer it took to put sanctions in place , the more the risk of a military strike increased .
" The closer you get to the end of 2010 , the temptation to act gets greater , " said the official , who seemed to implicitly indicate it was Israel that would mostly be tempted to act .
' Embargo '
This would still only delay any Iranian plans to pursue nuclear weapons .
This is a regime that has survival at the top of its list
Graham Allison , Belfer Center Ideally , the Obama administration would like to convince Tehran that a nuclear weapon will not make it more powerful or more secure .
But without a change inside Iran , that argument is unlikely to have much weight because Iran does believe that its nuclear ambitions give it added clout in the region .
" If the international community was prepared to impose crippling sanctions , embargoing imports of gasoline and exports of oil , if it strangles Iran - Iran might recalculate , " said Mr Allison from the Belfer Center .
" This is a regime that has survival at the top of its list .
But imposing such sanctions without the support of Russia and China is impossible . "
So with the US neither able to impose crippling sanctions nor really eager to take the tough military action needed to permanently disable Iran 's nuclear facilities , Washington 's only options seem to be to either accept a nuclear Iran or find ways to continuously disrupt and slow down Iran 's nuclear ambitions .

Jeff Fobb freezes as he tries to sort through the noises rising from the swamp of the Everglades : the beating wings of an ibis , the scurrying of a lizard , the much louder splash of an alligator lowering itself into the water or , the sound he really wants to hear , the rustle of a large python in tall grass .
" It sounds sort of like the wind , but more steady , " says Fobb .
He combs through the grass with a long metal hook .
No snakes .
But the pythons are out there , somewhere , and Florida is looking to men like Fobb , a ponytailed former marine who heads the Miami - Dade fire department 's venom bureau , to hunt down and kill them .
Armed with a hunting knife , insect repellent , and mesh laundry bags into which he is hoping to bundle his prey , Fobb is on the frontline of a new push by Florida to try to contain a population explosion of alien intruders that is threatening the ecological balance of the Everglades and frightening the public in surrounding farm lands .
The state is in the midst of its first - ever open hunting season on pythons .
Authorities say the hunt , which runs until mid-April , could be a last chance to get rid of the snakes before they do irreparable harm to some of the endangered species in the Everglades .
Nobody knows how many pythons or other large constrictors are on the loose , or exactly how they got out into the wild .
Estimates run as high as 100,000 .
State wildlife officials are hoping a significant slice of the population froze to death in February 's extreme cold spell but they admit their evidence is spotty .
" The only safe thing to say is certainly at one time there were thousands , " said Scott Hardin , head of exotic species for Florida 's Wildlife and Conservation Commission .
Conservationists and wildlife officials believe the snakes are the offspring of unwanted pets that were dumped in the wild .
Hardin thinks they may originate from a breeding farm that was torn apart by Hurricane Andrew in 1992 , flinging snakes through the air .
What is clear however is that they are an increasing public menace .
Full - grown , a Burmese python is 200lbs of sinuous muscle and can overpower any animal in the Everglades .
According to a food pyramid of the python diet put together by Everglades National Park , pythons have eaten animals ranging from raccoons to blue herons to alligator .
They are multiplying : a mature female python lays up to 100 eggs a year .
Fobb 's Venom Bureau responded to 90 snake emergencies last year , mostly from pythons .
And they may be on the move .
A study by the US geological survey suggested the Burmese python could begin moving out of south Florida , potentially even to other US states .
The hunt is the latest attempt in a series of efforts by government agencies and environmental organisations over the last decade to try to limit their numbers .
In 2008 state authorities brought in a law requiring python owners to implant their snakes with a computerised chip .
This year the Obama administration proposed a ban on the import or transport within states of the Burmese python and eight other large constrictors .
Now state officials have decided to call in hunters to rout the intruders .
Aside from bragging rights , hunters could sell the skins of their prey , which go for about 10 dollars a foot .
Fobb though is more focused on getting to know the enemy .
He carries a notebook in which he enters the animal 's length , weight , sex , and stomach contents before what he calls the " unhappy denouement " : decapitation by pithing , the insertion of a thin wire in the snake 's spinal cord .
The carcasses are tossed back in the wild .
But getting rid of the creatures is proving more complicated than had been expected .
To date , none of the 60 hunters who signed on to a special course on python tracking have killed a single snake in the areas surrounding Everglades National Park approved for the hunt .
The national park itself is off - limits to python hunters .
Kenneth Krysko , a senior scientist at Florida 's Museum of Natural History , argues that is because the hunters are looking in the wrong place .
They need to go deeper into the Everglades – perhaps within the borders of the park itself – to get their prey .
" The commission is essentially just sending guinea pigs out into the wild just to see if there are pythons in those areas , " he said .
" They are found in very remote areas — eight to 12 miles away from the nearest road .
It 's pretty obvious that we will never be able to exterminate those individuals . "
Even Hardin admitted that the hunt was not going entirely to plan .
" It 's going to take a while for them to get the hang of where to look , " he said .
Fobb too has failed to find a single python on three forays in March , though he still gets daily calls at the venom bureau .
" It 's hard work .
It 's not something where you just come out and have a wholesale slaughter in a couple of weeks , " said Fobb .
" You just have to keep coming out and looking . "
Sometimes though , the snakes come looking for you .
After a six - mile trek through the Everglades recently , Fobb got a call from home .
He and his wife live on a few acres with horses , donkeys , dogs , and chickens and – as of that morning – a nearly nine foot python coiled up beside their house .
By the time he reached home , the snake was safely caged in a dog kennel .
" I just dragged him out by the tail .
He tried to bite me and pooped on me and everything , " said his wife , Sandy .
" Do n't you be letting that sucker loose in my house . "
Fobb sighed .
" I should have just stayed home . "

While reporting on the Tea Party rally in Boston today for FNC ’s America Live , Fox News reporter Molly Line tried to spin away the fact that Sen. Scott Brown decided to not to show up at the rally and associate with the Tea Party and Sarah Palin .
Line said , “ Tea Partiers gave him some credit actually for not coming here today . ”
Only at a rally led by Palin and Fox would Brown get credit for not showing up .
Here is the video courtesy of Media Matters :

On the topic of Brown , Molly Line said , “ Tea Partiers , you know gave him some credit for not coming here today .
You would think a lot of them would be offended , but there were folks here saying that because he is a newly minted , newly elected official , a Republican in Massachusetts , a predominantly Blue state , that he kind of has to stand his ground , stay away , and they mentioned on stage today as well , some of the activists saying , hey , at least he is in Washington doing his job .
The job that he was elected to do .
Although some people do contribute or credit the Tea Party with helping Scott Brown get elected .
He was n’t here today , but some of them said that he was here in spirit at least . ”
I would suggest that Scott Brown is doing a little bit more than distancing .
His only statement on the rally came from his spokesman Felix Browne who said that the senator , applauds the “ energy and enthusiasm ” that Palin and the Tea Party bring to the GOP .
Instead of offering some ringing statement of endorsement for the Tea Party , Brown put out a generic statement that could apply to any Republican organization .
I do n’t think Brown is distancing from the Tea Party .
He is throwing his arms up in the air and running in the other direction .
The Tea Party members have been hanging on to the myth that Scott Brown is in the Senate to undo Ted Kennedy ’s legacy , but except for opposing the health care reform bill , what has he done that undoes the Kennedy legacy ?
Brown voted for the jobs bill .
He was one of four Republican senators who broke the GOP filibuster on the most recent unemployment benefits extension .
Fox News and the Tea Party are kidding themselves if they think that this man is going to do anything that could jeopardize his senate seat .
Scott Brown appears to have used the Tea Party movement as an outside source of funds for the campaign , and now that he is in , he wants nothing to do with them .
However it is clear from the rhetoric on Fox that Brown is with them in spirit that the Tea Party is not going to let him walk away .
They are going to keep claiming ownership of him until he burns every single bridge behind him .
Fox News confirmed that the Tea Party is political poison , as soon as they offered up the excuse that it is best for Brown if he is not seen with us .
This statement was an admission that the Tea Party is nothing more than the far right fringe .
While it excuses Brown ’s absence , it also damns the whole movement .

Puleez - I thought ' great , she let him cum her mouth - nice !' -- that is , until I saw her put the cloth up to her mouth to discard of it .
Even if she absolutely could n't bring herself to swallow , she should have at least spit it back onto his cock and massaged it around or something .
A decent game for the neutral tonight , but fairly underwhelming from a tactical point of view .
Both sides played as expected , the result was no surprise , and all the goals came from defensive mistakes rather than attacking brilliance .
Benfica played with a variation of their usual shape , because of the injury to Javier Saviola .
Pablo Aimar moved forward into a more offensive role behind Oscar Cardoso , whilst Carlos Martins came into the centre of midfield .
This change meant that Ramires and Angel di Maria played slightly wider than usual , and the two swapped wings throughout the game , although di Maria was always more effective on his natural left - hand side .
Liverpool ’s shape was a familiar , solid 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 that looked to get men behind the ball and pinch goals either on the break , or from a set - play .
As so often with Rafael Benitez in European knockout ties , his plan worked very well .
Although Liverpool were under constant pressure early on , they managed to break at speed with Gerrard and Torres , and when the Liverpool captain won a free - kick on the left , they went ahead through Daniel Agger .
Benfica defended the free - kick really poorly – they set out zonally , but the problem was not the zonal marking as such , it was the way the system was deployed , with a single line of players .
When the free - kick is that central , and that close to the byline , there must be one player ahead of the line of defenders , preventing the cut - back .
There was n’t , and Agger took advantage .
After Ryan Babel was needlessly sent - off , Liverpool switched to a 4 - 4 - 1ish formation , with Kuyt playing infront of Johnson , and Gerrard drifting in from a left - sided position in a similar fashion to the role he plays with England , as the main support to Torres .
The way Liverpool set - up initially ( defensively , playing on the counter ) meant that the sending - off did n’t alter their overall strategy , and they weathered the storm quite well , with two deep banks of four in front of Reina , and Torres left to battle high up the pitch .
The only concern was Emiliano Insua , who had a shocking first half – and on a yellow card became exposed to the runs of Ramires and di Maria .
Benfica passed the ball around well and created more chances , but they missed Saviola hugely .
His role is to play ‘ around ’ Cardoso , looking for his knock - downs and making runs both towards the ball , and over the top .
Aimar is a fine player and not dissimilar from Saviola in physique , but he struggled to compensate for his fellow Argentinian ’s absence .
Saviola would have given a further option by testing the Liverpool centre - backs on the ground – they were constantly caught out in the air , but Cardoso missed numerous headed opportunities ( although his two penalties were superb ) .
Jamie Carragher , in particular , can be exposed against pace and skill but had a relatively easy ride despite Benfica ’s numerical advantage .
Benfica needed goals in this game , and it was this that convinced Jorge Jesus to introduce another striker at 1 - 1 , in the shape of Nuno Gomes .
He replaced the right - back Maxi Pereira ( who often fails to produce quality on the ball in the final third ) and played just off Cardoso .
Ramires switched to right - back to compensate – but he had less license to come forward than the left - back , Fabio Coentrao , since Gerrard was more of an attacking threat than Durk Kuyt .
Although Benfica went onto score another goal , the switch to two strikers was a poor move .
It took a player out of midfield , and suddenly Benfica had less possession and stopped creating chances .
The goal came from a ( slightly fortunate ) penalty , and they resorted to 35 - yard potshots from their centre - backs , rather than the crisp , patient passing game they ’d played when they were playing 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 .
Gomes hardly touched the ball , and Liverpool ’s two banks of four were far more comfortable with Gomes standing upfront waiting for service , rather than the now - subdued Ramires ’ runs .
Benfica played so well initially because they had three players ( Ramires , Aimar and di Maria ) running at two holding midfield players ( Mascherano and Lucas ) , with Martins and Javi Garcia free behind them .
The switch to two strikers meant Aimar was deeper , and Ramires was miles away from most of the action .
As with two other Europa League matches , the 2 - 1 scoreline makes it a fairly balanced tie , and Benitez will be confident his side can progress through to the semi-finals at Anfield .
Benfica needed a third goal to really tip the balance of the tie , and having played at home for an hour with one additional player , they really should have got it .

Tokyo , Japan ( CNN ) --
In the two days since CNN.com posted the story on hentai games ( specifically , the " RapeLay " video game ) , there have been thousands of comments , more than a million page views and many questions about how a culture can produce this genre of games and then quietly allow the industry to thrive .
It is terribly easy to condemn Japan as a sexist and repressed culture with a government that chooses to look the other way .
Part of that would be true , but the reason hentai continues to thrive in a country as progressive as Japan is a complex cultural issue .
Kyle Cleveland , an associate professor of sociology at Temple University in Japan , teaches a course called " Youth and Deviant Subcultures in Japan . "
Yes , there is enough material to fill an entire university level syllabus .
Cleveland explains that the outrage from critics is borne through the prism of their own cultures , a Western sensibility with an entirely different cultural norm than what exists in Japan .
" Japan is a patriarchal society .
It has been historically and remains to this day , " said Cleveland .
" It 's no surprise that this is expressed in mass media and pornography .
The moral entrepreneurs that are scrutinizing Japan have both a feminist history and cultural tradition that is simply not in play in Japan . "
' Rapelay ' video game goes viral amid outrage
According to the 2009 World Economic Forum Global Gender Gap report , Japan ranked 101 out of 134 countries , called abysmally low by women 's groups considering it is the world 's second largest economy .
That lack of participation of women in positions of power sets the cultural stage for why hentai games thrive openly in the country .
" What you have in Japan is policymakers and politicians who are in some ways blind to these issues because you have a relatively male - dominated , elderly political class that was raised under a different set of gender norms and have never acknowledged the feminist critiques that have become integrated in American and Western consciousness .
There are whole sets of non-issues that are not raised for political debate in Japan , so they do n't filter into the consciousness of most Japanese people , " said Cleveland .
But they are becoming issues in our borderless digital world .
Japan 's Gender Equality Bureau of the Cabinet Office told CNN that the government was aware the international community is outraged by the games .
The national government is considering making possession of child pornography illegal -- currently it is not .
But this possible change to the law is due to outside pressure , not internal protest .
Cleveland says Japan has some of the most heinous examples of child pornography in the world .
" It 's a country that has been held to task by the U.N. for human trafficking and exploitation of women . "
" Japan has ways of expressing sexuality that are practically indecipherable to a Western sensibility but that are so normalized in Japan that the Japanese do n't often understand or acknowledge the critiques that are made against them , " Cleveland says .
Cleveland believes the international debate will pressure Japan to amend its laws , making it harder for hentai games to be sold and distributed .
He believes Japan will not comply for moral reasons but because " it 's politically expedient . "
But he cautions those who are appalled to take a look within their own culture .
" What provokes people about Japan is the cultural distance which inclines people to see Japan as exceptionally lurid or perverse simply because it expresses sexuality in ways outside of Western norms .
Japan is in some ways not that different than other cultures , including the United States , which has its own gender problems that are quite apparent . "

The new Tory election poster surprised many yesterday with its unabashedly rightwing , Thatcherite message targeting unemployed people – perhaps heralding a shift in tactics by David Cameron ahead of tomorrow 's televised debate .
As commenter NeoPunk noted , the poster " completely clashes with Cameron 's ' friendly open compassionate conservatism ' persona , like that scene in Mary Poppins where she suddenly gets all arsey with the kids . "
As everyone knows , all the Tories ' campaign posters so far have been extensively spoofed on the internet , and the party may have attempted to avoid that fate through the design of this new one : rather than printing the text on an easily edited oblong of colour , the poster 's message has been superimposed on to a crowd of faces , even running slightly into the image of Cameron .
But the Bloggerheads website has some bad news for the Tories :
After a well - documented series of hilarious own - goals , the Conservatives appear to have gone to a lot of trouble to make their latest poster " unshoppable " ... so I knocked this ' blank ' up in a spare two minutes I had .
Have fun .

Getting a little more surreal , this one by jaime_campbell ( above ) suggests Cameron 's " plan B " involves aping Star Wars villain Darth Vader , while this one from qwghlm should need no explanation .
So the poster is not unspoofable – in technical terms .
But it has to be said that that original message – " Let 's cut benefits for those who refuse work " – is so baldly and comically reactionary that it read like self - parody already .

In contrast , profits at the Fat Duck fell , partly as a result of one of the most exclusive dining experiences in the world becoming just that little bit more exclusive .
Accounts filed by SL6 , Blumenthal 's holding company , show that the Michelin three - star restaurant in Bray , Berkshire , made a profit of £ 525,818 in 2009 , compared with £ 732,278 the previous year .
The nearby Hinds Head , in which SL6 owns a 75 % stake , turned in £ 136,196 , up from £ 51,088 the previous year .
With starters like pea and ham soup costing £ 6.35 , a Balmoral venison cheeseburger setting diners back £ 11.95 , and puddings at as little as £ 6.50 , the Hinds Head offers a more affordable alternative to the Fat Duck , where the renowned 13 - course taster menu is £ 150 .
Some may conclude that anyone wanting to turn a profit in the restaurant trade should eschew copying the Fat Duck 's celebrated menu , which boasts staples such as nitro poached green tea and lime mousse and snail porridge , and focus on more traditional fare .
But the figures were affected by unique factors .
Last year the Fat Duck was forced to close for two weeks after an outbreak of food poisoning led to the cancellation of some 800 bookings .
If a £ 200,000 payout to cover the restaurant 's closure is factored in , the Fat Duck 's performance is almost unchanged .
The restaurant , which two years ago had 44 chefs for 42 customers , has also slightly reduced its number of tables , a decision that has made it even more difficult to obtain a booking – and had an impact on its bottom line .
" The decreased profit for 2008 - 2009 at the Fat Duck is representative of many different factors ; the increased investment in staff and training , the increasing prices of the produce and ingredients we use , " a spokesman said .
" Significantly , we also reduced the number of tables at the restaurant and now seat fewer guests .
This has enabled us to focus on the precision of the food and give more attention to the service and the evolution of the overall dining experience .
There are also the costs of the creative research and development work . "
The spokesman added : " Regarding the Hinds Head , both turnover and profitability increased in 2008 - 09 , but this is related to the continuing development of the offering at this property . "
At a time of recession experts consider the performance impressive .
Many three - star Michelin restaurants struggle to make money even in good times .
The Fat Duck 's rival for the best restaurant in the world crown – El Bulli in Spain – has made no profit from its food since 2000 , and its chef , Ferran Adrià , has announced he plans to close it in 2012 .
" You need to put it into context , say compare it with good tickets for Manchester United versus Chelsea , or top - flight theatre tickets , and see it for what it is , something almost theatrical , a once - in - a - year treat , " said Elizabeth Carter , editor of the Good Food Guide .
" With fine dining there are huge expectations .
It really is a performance and someone like Heston gets it absolutely right . "
Blumenthal is about to open a restaurant at the Mandarin Oriental hotel in London , and is currently appearing on TV in his fairytale - themed cooking series .
In an interview in 2008 he declared : " The Fat Duck enables me to do other things – publishing , TV , consulting – and by allowing those to expand I can allow the Fat Duck to shrink . "

Adult Diapers , Defense supplies , and small kitchen appliances – product portfolio as diverse and uninspiring as these , topped up with no -frills , relentless execution , long term contracts and transparent and shareholder friendly policies , and stellar dividend history – this is National Presto Industries Inc. for you .
The company has continued to show revenue growth and profitability through the recent economic downturn and the stock is still undervalued with forward PE less than 10 .
The company carries no debt , has a Price to Book ratio close to 2 and sports a pristine balance sheet .
It is also a company with over 100 years of history , and one which apparently Benjamin Graham himself was a shareholder once .
Interested readers should take a look at the company financials , its quarterly and annual reports .
You might be struck with how straightforward the reports are and the distinct lack of sub-texts , asterisks , and CYAs .
While the prose is not so important to me , it does paint a picture of a company that is run for the benefit of the shareholders and is not trying to hide or obfuscate or otherwise paint picture that is rosier than the reality .
The company also shies away from traditional PR , does not feel compelled to manage their business on a quarterly cycle and therefore being a 100 year old company has much less following on the street than one would expect .
But what really interests me is its positioning .
Let ’s take a brief look at its product segments .
Small kitchen appliances : Consumers are surely not going to be eating any less in the future .
But what has started to happen , thanks to the recession , is a trend towards more home cooking and less eating out .
This means that small kitchen appliances will continue to sell in high demand .
In fact , National Presto has been enjoying significant sales gains in this segment ( about 20 % YOY in the most recent quarter ) .
National Presto ’s positioning at Walmart stores , will no doubt continue to be an asset .
Absorption Products :
One only has to look at the US demographics to understand that the demand for adult diapers is not going to slow anytime soon .
The wave of baby boom retirees and the increasing life expectancy will continue to demand more of these products .
Defense products : National Presto makes ammunition and other products for the US government under a long term contract that was recently renewed .
Given the state of current geo-politics and the fragile nature of many economies and political entities around the world , it is quite understandable if the US defence spending continues to remain high or even increase .
In short , not only is the company well run and the stock undervalued , it is also positioned to compete in prosper in the segments that have the ability to do well in the future regardless of the other economic factors .
As the stock market continues to be volatile , any drop in the NPK stock price should be seen as an opportunity to buy .
NPK is one of our top small cap stock picks .

An Irish team of scientists based at University College Cork has found that probiotic yogurt could revolutionize the battle against cancer .
Researchers at the Cork Cancer Research Centre ( CCRC ) have found that harmless bacteria from probiotic yogurt ( bifidobacteria ) naturally travels through the body and can grow inside tumors .
The discovery could one day rule out the need for administering chemotherapy drugs via painful IV injections when .
It could also reduce the toxic effect many current cancer therapies have on healthy cells .
Principal investigator Dr Mark Tangney said the " bacteria can leak out from the gut into the blood and grow inside tumors throughout the body where they can produce whatever we want " .
" We can now genetically engineer these bacteria so that they will pump out anti-cancer agents specifically inside tumors , " he said .
Tangney said the findings were very exciting because the main goal of cancer treatment is to focus therapy on tumors without harming healthy cells .
" When a patient ’s cancer has spread , then ideally , a treatment should be administered throughout a patient ’s body ( eg intravenous administration ) to allow treatment of any tumors present , including secondary tumors at early stages of development .
" However , current chemotherapy drugs administered in this fashion are toxic to many healthy cell types , often resulting in severe side effects for the patient .
This is why we are so excited about this research , " he said .
Tangney said future treatment " could be as simple as handing someone a yogurt suspension containing millions of bacterium . "
I got to witness a little bit of history Sunday night in Washington , sitting in the gallery of the House of Representatives as the vote was tallied for final confirmation of the health - care reconciliation package .
It was a pleasure seeing the beaming faces of Democrats ( and there was no small bit of schadenfreude in seeing Republicans ' scowls ) , especially people like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , who looked fresh and energized despite probably having had no sleep for 72 hours or more , and my own representative , Jim McDermott , who has fought consistently for health - care reform for several decades now .
Of course , I only sort of witnessed the final vote .
You see , security was rotating groups of about 18 people in and out of the seats every 15 minutes , because demand was so high ; and my group 's time ran out just as the count reached 200 .
I returned quickly to the item - return room ( you had to leave behind your cell phones ) , where a big screen ran the tallies on C - SPAN ; when the vote hit 216 , a loud cheer erupted among the 30 or so of us gathered to watch .
Not all of us cheered , of course .
A sizable portion of the crowd forming those long lines , in fact , comprised Tea Partiers who had spent the day outside the Capitol protesting , " Kill the Bill ! "
And they scowled and booed while the rest of us cheered .
I had , in fact , spent a portion of my day among these Tea Party protesters , wandering among them with a video camera in the hours before that afternoon 's massive March For America .
( And it has to be mentioned that this crowd , of several hundred at best , was utterly dwarfed by the crowd of immigration - reform activists behind them , estimated to be 200,000 strong , a contrast that must -- or should -- have struck some of them as a wee bit ominous for their Beckian claim that " We Surround Them " . )
As you can see , some of the leaders of the chants were not above some ugliness in the process .
A woman reporter from the local ABC affiliate was mercilessly harassed by one of the bullhorn holders , as you can see .
And there was no shortage of kooky signs , including :
I DID NOT SERVE SO THAT DICTATORS COULD RULE Obama Take Your Flight Now And Don't Ever Come Back We 'll Manage !
A brief exchange of insults occurred when a middle - aged man in a blue soccer shirt made clear he adamantly supported health care , and a man in Michigan Militia T - shirt said , " F - - k you , " to which the older man responded in kind .
Someone in the crowd ( the guy holding the " Take Your Flight Now " sign , in fact ) called out , " Commie ! "
( And yes , the incessant chant of " Kill the Bill ! " did start to remind one , after awhile , of the crowd of zombies chanting " Im - ho - tep ! " in The Mummy . )
Media Matters spent all day among them and produced some even more disturbing clips .
Dave Weigel at the Windy also found some prime violent wingnuttery :
As a Democratic victory looked more and more likely , Tea Partiers got more ornery about the liberals who ’d showed up to cheer for reform and take commemorative photos of what , to them , looked like the end of a year of agenda - slowing right - wing activism .
“ Look at that idiot ! ” said Linda Cocsy , a New Yorker who ’d spent the weekend in Washington for the protests , pointing at one of the young Democrats who ’d infiltrated the protest , holding up a pro-reform sign provided by a pro-choice Catholic group .
“ This one , here with the stupid grin on his face !
He looks likes he ’s brainless .
You look at these people and , they really look like jerks .
You look at the other people , with the Do n’t Tread on Me [ flags ] , and they look like real people ! ”
Cocsy stared off at another protester , waving a sign he ’d picked up from a pro-immigration reform protest that had broken up around the time that Stupak announced his flip .
“ I just wanna kill them ! ” said Cocsy .
Meanwhile , the NY Daily News reports that one right - wing blogger called for Obama to be shot :
Solomon " Solly " Forell tweeted : " ASSASSINATION !
America , we survived the assassinations of Lincoln and Kennedy .
We 'll surely get over a bullet 2 Barack Obama 's head . "
The crazy talk is n't just coming from the rank and file .
Some of the Tea Partiers ' favorite congressmen are saying similarly nutty things , such as Rep. Steve King 's call for secession ( via Amanda Terkel ) as a response to HCR , following up on his earlier call for an armed revolution .
So it was very interesting listening and observing their responses that evening as we all crowded together into a line to watch the House vote -- Tea Partiers and reform supporters together , required to remain quiet and civil with each other , upon pain of being immediately removed by security .
For the longest time , it seemed , there were about a hundred of us lined up along the long corridors leading to the House gallery , where we had to run a gauntlet of security checks .
I was right behind as group of middle - aged Tea Partiers who were dead set against reform and talked among themselves with the usual talking points : " It 's just too much government control , " " We 're talking about one - sixth of the economy " , etc. etc. , all straight out of Fox News .
But directly behind me was a boisterous young man from Tulsa who was an ardent supporter of health - care reform , and he made his feelings known as well , talking loudly about the vote count as it trickled in on the preliminary vote to advance the measure -- which , had it failed , would have ended the counting for the night .
When it passed , he and others in the line cheered loudly .
One of the Tea Partiers ahead of me said to his fellows : " I ca n't believe all these people want health care . "
Because I was being quiet and civil , I refrained from saying : " Yeah , who ' da thunk ? "
About the same time , a group of people who had been watching in the gallery and whose time had expired began filing past us , some of them beaming .
The young Oklahoman began high - fiving them and cheering .
But one middle - aged woman refused :
" It 's the night America died ! " she said .
Finally , we made our way through the last security gate and took our seats , just as the votes came in on Republicans ' last - gasp delaying attempt came in , and then we watched as the counting began on final confirmation .
Just as the vote count in favor reached 200 , the security men came and escorted us out , leading to our final hurrah at the item - return station .
I caught the last Metro back to the condo where I was staying ( thanks again , Darcy ! ) and sat alone near the door .
There were only about six of us in the entire car , but right behind me was as glum - faced middle - aged couple .
Their expressions alone made clear they had been among the Tea Partiers , as did their conversation on the way back .
" I have to wonder , when we wake up in the morning , whether this will still be a free country or not , " said the husband .
" I know , " said his wife .
" It 's so sad . "
Again , self - restraint ( and fatigue ) were all that kept me from standing up and saying to them :
" Good God , people , get a grip !
Do you still have freedom of speech ?
Freedom of association ?
The right to vote ?
To choose your religion ?
To live where you want , choose your own occupation , decide what kind of family you want to have ?
Because those are real freedoms .
You have n't lost any of that !
It 's still the freest country on earth , you loons !
If you think that paying taxes means a loss of freedom , you 're wrong -- it just means you 're living up to your end of the social contract .
Are you part of that , or not ? "
Well , those were the words in my head , anyway .
And I realized then that , for all these people who have been watching Glenn Beck and Fox News and listening to Limbaugh and Palin and Hannity lo these many moons , that really is their stark reality now : Sunday night was " the night America died . "
And that 's really a dangerous prospect .
Because it means the American Right has come completely unhinged .
And unhinged people begin not just saying unhinged things , but doing them .
There 's a reason John Amato and I have just finished up work on our new book , Over the Cliff : How Obama 's Election Drove the American Right Insane ( which you can pre-order at Amazon , though it wo n't be out till June 1 , and no , that 's not our final cover , and the foreword is by Digby , not Rick Perlstein ) .
It 's becoming more timely by the day .
The sites offer different - but complementary - services
The Government 's police inspectorate has backed down after protests from social media activists over its choice of name for a new website .
Her Majesty 's Inspectorate of Constabulary ( HMIC ) had unveiled plans for a project called MyPolice.org.uk .
But the name was already being used by a project started in 2009 , intended to allow crime victims and others to report feedback to police forces .
HMIC said it had chosen to stop using the name to avoid confusion .
" To ensure the public gets the benefits of both services with no chance of confusion , we will change the name of the ' my police ' pages on our website , " HMIC said in a statement .
" We are currently consulting on the best option , and will announce the results in the next week . "
The HMIC website was intended to be used by members of the public to find out information about how their local force is performing .
HMIC said it had " nothing to gain by overwhelming MyPolice.org " .
The entrepreneurs behind the independent site had accused HMIC of trampling over their work .
During the dispute , co-founder Lauren Currie told BBC
News that it had caused " a huge problem " .
In a statement , she said they were " grateful " for the change of heart .
" We think the product HMIC launched , which until today shared our name as My Police , is a genuinely good idea .
" We believe ... that it is important to enable the public to rate and score their local force but our product is different . "
You know the importance of toothpaste for bringing out the best in your pearly whites but did you know that toothpaste is useful for a wide variety of other purposes ?
It ’s true .
Toothpaste can do much more than leave your smile bright and your breath minty fresh .
Take a look at these nine uses for toothpaste that will have you seeing your favorite brand in a whole new light .
For this to work it must be an old fashioned paste toothpaste product rather than one of the “ new fangled ” gel toothpastes .
Wash the area in cold water to numb and draw out the pain .
Remove the stinger in the event of a bee sting .
Then , dab toothpaste on the affected area .
Leave the toothpaste there – do not rinse it off .
The longer it remains the better .
Believe it or not , it ’s true !
Toothpaste ( the original paste variety ) is a miracle worker when it comes to getting rid of bothersome crayon marks left behind by little fingers .
The best part is that it wo n’t remove the paint so it ’s safe to use on walls and other wood furniture that has been painted in a different color scheme than the offending crayon .
If you ’re cleaning on budget and need to remove crayon fast most dollar stores have tubes for one dollar or less .
This means you can even use this for an excellent and frugal crayon removal tip .
Toothpaste should be safe for your paint and is in most cases .
However , it is wise to do a small test area in an inconspicuous location on your wall before applying the toothpaste to a larger area in an effort to remove unsolicited works of art from your wall .
Let it sit for 24 hours and check back for potential problems with paint then remove the larger work of art .
Compact Discs ( CDs ) and Digital Video Discs ( DVDs ) can provide many hours of entertainment to people of all ages .
Unfortunately they have proven to be somewhat fragile when not properly cared for .
This has left more than one CD or DVD thrown into a trash container long before its usefulness is gone .
You can save many of these discs by rinsing with water and then rubbing toothpaste ( the paste variety and not a gel ) over the surface of the CD or DVD where scratches occur .
Then rinse with warm water making sure that all toothpaste residue has been removed from the surface .
There should be some toothpaste in the cracks to create a smooth surface .
Dry well .
Test the results .
This process may need to be repeated if there are many scratches .
Acne can be a real downer for your social life .
Many times you can feel the pimple coming on long before it makes its appearance .
Once it makes its grand entrance though toothpaste ( the old - fashioned paste variety ) can zap that zit double quick .
Dab a little toothpaste on the pimple at night before going to bed and you should be well rid of the pimple by morning .
Just remember that whitening toothpastes contain hydrogen peroxide that can irritate or damage the skin .
This is also not suggested for people with extremely sensitive skin because it may irritate .
Ever had an unpleasant aroma cling to your hands ?
If you ’ve ever chopped onions or garlic you know all too well how some fragrances seem to follow you for hours no matter how many times you wash your hands .
Even certain cleaning products can linger on your hands for an unpleasant experience .
Next time this happens to you try using a small dab of toothpaste on your hands in addition to the soap you would ordinarily use .
When you think about it , it makes sense .
Toothpaste works to remove the aroma from strong smelling foods from your mouth .
It can do the same for your hands .
Foggy bathroom mirrors becoming a bummer ?
Prevent the annoying fog by rubbing toothpaste on the mirror and then wiping it off .
Do this before your next shower and see how quickly you can go from the shower to the mirror and onto round two of your morning routine .
Saving just a few minutes by not waiting for the mirror to clear can make your morning more productive .
This also works well to keep swimming goggles from fogging up .
Wipe toothpaste along the inside and wipe off before swimming .
Looking for ways to get rid of scuff marks from sneakers ?
Before you begin , wipe the shoe with a damp cloth .
Remove any debris or dirt .
Use a plain toothpaste and rub it onto the white area of the shoe .
Rinse any remaining toothpaste .
This will remove the black marks and scuffs on the shoe and have them nice and white again .
Stubborn stains or scuffs may require additional toothpaste or multiple applications to remove completely .
For this project you ’ll want to use a toothpaste with whitening ingredients .
Those ingredients are typically peroxide based or baking soda .
Avoid gel toothpaste .
Dampen a sponge and place a small amount of toothpaste in the center .
Use the sponge and toothpaste to clean the shower doors in a circular motion .
Allow plenty of time for the active ingredients to work on the soap scum then rinse .
When all is said and done you ’ll have clearer , cleaner , and soap scum free shower doors .
This only works for small holes that are less than ¼ ” .
The trick is in finding a toothpaste the same shade as your wall or a willingness to touch up the paint once the toothpaste sets .
Squeeze the toothpaste into the hole and use a putty knife to remove excess toothpaste that did n’t quite make it into the mark .
This is a quick and inexpensive fix that is great for rentals or college apartments to cover up nail holes left over from posters , calendars , and photographs that graced the walls .
The war in Afghanistan , which George W. Bush started and Barack Obama pledged to win , is over – and we lost .
No one realizes this , quite yet , but give them time – because the fruits of our defeat are already a veritable cornucopia .
And the reason can be summed up rather neatly in two words : Hamid Karzai .
The fashion - plate heralded as the savior of Afghanistan by the Bush administration is turning into the Americans ’ harshest critic : from quite credibly claiming that the US was trying to manipulate the recent Afghan election in order to give its sock - puppets the advantage , to declaring that he ’s about ready to join the Taliban , President Karzai is making waves – and coming in for a barrage of disdain from the Washington cognoscenti , who cavil he ’s an " unreliable partner . "
Translated into ordinary language , this means he is n’t kowtowing to Washington ’s whims , and is instead seeking to pursue his own aims – shocking , is n’t it ?
What ’s the reason for Washington ’s very public discontent with our erstwhile " partner " ?
Well , in any relationship , you know , it ’s always the little things that lead to divorce : like announcing you ’re about to walk out , and not only that , but threatening to hook up with your ex’s worst enemy .
However , that ’s just talk : banter , really , of the sort couples engage in all the time when one is trying to gain the upper hand .
It ’s the kind of thing that could be tolerated , even enjoyed – at least if you ’re a character in a play by Edward Albee .
Yet there ’s always a line you do n’t cross in public , certain subjects you do n’t talk about to outsiders , unless you want to wind up in divorce court .
In Who ’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf , it was the secret of George and Martha ’s imaginary son – in Who ’s Afraid of the Taliban ?
it ’s the secret of Karzai ’s imaginary " government " – which , in reality , can hardly be said to exist outside of Kabul ’s urban core .
As Martha put it to George : " You ’re nothing ! "
Billions of taxpayer dollars are going to aid the Afghan government – an entity that , for all intents and purposes , does n’t really exist .
What exists are names on an organizational chart , a few offices in US - NATO –held areas , a seat in the United Nations , and that ’s just about it .
This gossamer network of paid shills and American - educated sock - puppets is superimposed over the real power structure of clan leaders and warlords , a thin thread that could break at any moment .
No one knows this better than Karzai , and so he has taken a new tack to ensure his political – and physical – survival .
No amount of " spin " can interpret the following report , taken from the Times of London , except as open subversion of the US - NATO war effort :
" The president of Afghanistan , Hamid Karzai , has cast doubt over NATO ’s planned summer offensive against the Taliban in the southern province of Kandahar , as more than 10,000 American troops pour in for the fight .
" Karzai threatened to delay or even cancel the operation — one of the biggest of the nine - year war — after being confronted in Kandahar by elders who said it would bring strife , not security , to his home province .
" Visiting last week to rally support for the offensive , the president was instead overwhelmed by a barrage of complaints about corruption and misrule .
As he was heckled at a shura of 1,500 tribal leaders and elders , he appeared to offer them a veto over military action .
" Are you happy or unhappy for the operation to be carried out ? " he asked .
" The elders shouted back : ‘ We are not happy . ’
" Then until the time you say you are happy , the operation will not happen , " Karzai replied .
" General Stanley McChrystal , the NATO commander , who was sitting behind him , looked distinctly apprehensive . "
As well he might .
Karzai is either going to change his tune , or else find himself the victim of an " accident " : a military coup is not out of the question .
If I were the CIA station chief , I ’d release those photos of Karzai toking on a hashish pipe .
And if I were Karzai , I ’d send my resume to Gucci , and get out of town fast .
Because " the chicest man on the planet " would n’t do well at Bagram .
Like all weaklings , whenever Karzai tries to assert himself he only underscores his impotence : he has no chance of stopping the Kandahar offensive , and everyone – including the attendees at the shura – knows it .
What this does , however , is make mincemeat of the announced American strategy , which is to " clear , hold , and build . "
Because at this point it ’s fair to ask what , exactly , are we building – the largely imaginary national " government " headed by Karzai , who can only hope to gain popular support by denouncing Washington ?
Instead of building a stable or even credible Afghan government , the spanking new counterinsurgency doctrine propounded by Gen. David Petraeus , and those Deep Thinkers over at the Center for a New American Security , is creating the conditions for America ’s inevitable defeat .
As long as the Obama - ites have Karzai on their hands , the experiment that was supposed to prove the validity of the Petraeus doctrine winds up creating a Frankenstein monster , at best , feeding the very forces fighting the American presence .
Which is why you do n’t have to be Nostradamus to predict Karzai ’s exit from the presidential palace , sooner rather than later .
Oh , they say they can work around Karzai , and deal with local clan leaders .
Yet these very same clan leaders , at least the ones in Kandahar , are less than enthusiastic about the American occupation .
The great problem we have yet to overcome in Afghanistan is that the majority of the population clearly sympathizes with what American journalists lazily call " the Taliban , " and which is really a series of local insurgencies which have largely supplanted the old Taliban leadership of Mullah Omar as the chief military resistance to the occupation .
Both the fighting core of the Taliban and certainly Al - Qaeda have long since fled to Pakistan and points beyond : what we are fighting in Afghanistan is a fresh crop of militants bred in the horror of nearly ten years of constant warfare .
A wars is like any and all [ . pdf ] government programs : its advocates and beneficiaries ( very often the same people ) seek to prolong it long after its original rationale has been rendered irrelevant and / or conveniently forgotten , and the Afghan example is a veritable textbook case .
As announced by President Obama , our war aims in Afghanistan are to disrupt and destroy al - Qaeda cells resident in that country , a goal that has long since been accomplished .
Al Qaeda can hardly be said to exist in Afghanistan these days , and the same goes for the Taliban remnants .
The more sophisticated war proponents acknowledge this .
The real problem , they aver , is Pakistan , where they strongly imply bin Laden is hiding out .
( Hillary Clinton apparently believes this . )
The government of Pakistan denies this , and , in spite of Hillary ’s hectoring hysterics , it ’s been the Pakistanis who have taken out and actually captured a good number of the top al - Qaeda leaders , who are today in custody – far more than we have .
If bin Laden and / or his top cohorts were in Pakistan , and the ISI knew it , who can doubt they ’d turn them over – just to get the US to stop the not - so - secret " secret war " the Pentagon ’s been waging on Pakistani soil ?
Our announced war aims are like George and Martha ’s imaginary son : it ’s all part of a private narrative , a story we tell ourselves that somehow reassures us and makes us feel better – even noble – as we enslave , torture , and ravage a country in the name of " progress " and civilization .
So if these are n’t our real aims , if the whole thing ’s a fairy tale , then what ’s the real reason we ’re wreaking mayhem in that part of the world ?
The answer , I fear , is not to be found in any theory of politics , economics , or international affairs , but in one neglected field of human psychology : the psychology of political power , and those who wield it .
When Zero Hedge first wrote about the adverse role of prop trading in capital markets , long before it was a mainstream issue , which in turn incited the response of one Lucas van Praag , in which they assured us and our readers that there were never any issues with Goldman 's prop trading desk and that all concerns about prop trading are misplaced .
A few months later one of the luminaries of modern finance picked up the Zero Hedge banner and proposed a rule that would end banking prop trading for ever , in essence overriding Mr. van Praag explanation .
Yet for the past three months most had left the Volcker Rule for dead , after the banking lobby had once again bought a two year full recourse lease on Obama and his cronies .
Until the last two weeks , when first on May 6 we saw what happens how an entire market , gripped in computerized gambling and speculating can break in the span of a few minutes , without doubt facilitated by the banks ' prop operations , and also when we saw that the big 4 banks had monopolized prop trading to such an extent ( and disingenuously masking it as flow trading : yeah , right , flow trading with a VaR of $ 150 million ... better luck finding greater idiots next time ) that none had a losing day , in essence making Madoff 's ponzi scheme , with its worse " win " track record a joke in comparison with the ponzi that the market has become .
Which is why we read with great satisfaction in the FT that the banking lobby 's power is slipping at a critical time : this week the Volcker Rule will be voted on by the Senate , and it may very well pass , despite the " cornered rat " response by the banks .
As the FT notes , " the political mood is such that a straight vote on derivatives would be close and the Volcker Rule would be likely to pass . "
Should the Volcker Rule pass , this will be the beginning of the end for the current casino capitalism system that has gripped Wall Street .
And do n't be surprised to see a 10 % drop in the market as a last ditch self defense mechanism by the primary dealers .
More from the FT , which also discusses the Blanche Lincoln 's derivative reform proposal :
The derivatives change , which faces a groundswell of opposition from regulators as well as Mr Volcker , head of a White House economics advisory board , is slated to come up first .
Two bank lobbyists said a powerful combination of Mr Volcker , Mr Obama and the anti-bank fervour in the country meant they had almost given up hope of modifying the Volcker Rule , which would prohibit banks from trading for their own account and investing in hedge funds and private equity firms .
The controversial derivatives provision , likely to be considered on the Senate floor before the Volcker Rule , is a different matter .
Here , the industry has the backing of Mr Volcker and Sheila Bair , who chairs the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation .
Neither provision has been subject to congressional hearings and both are widely opposed by Republicans and some moderate Democrats .
But the political mood is such that a straight vote on derivatives would be close and the Volcker Rule would be likely to pass .
The administration is involved in a complex dance with Blanche Lincoln , the Democratic senator from Arkansas , who authored the derivatives provision and is refusing to modify it .
Many believe her primary election challenge next week , where she is battling a rival on her left , is the reason why the White House and Treasury will not come out and oppose it .
And who else if not the biggest republican apologist for Wall Street Bob Corker comes out in support of banking status quo :
“ I do think we ’ll deal with [ it ] , ” said Bob Corker , the Republican senator from Tennessee , who blamed the Obama administration for allowing Democrats to offer the provision .
“ They are aware it is a problem , ” he said .
“ But they want Republicans to fix it . ”
The banks ' usual bullshit response is that same as it ever was when they want to get something from the idiot politicians : do it our way or the system will blow up .
Well , not this time .
The banks ’ argument in both cases is similar – the attempt to lessen risk will perversely increase it by preventing deposit - taking banks from mitigating their risk and by driving activities into the less - regulated shadow banking sector of pure investment banks , hedge funds and private equity firms .
And they are hitting where it allegedly hurts most : the household net worth :
Some of the more astute lobbyists have realised that arguments about competitiveness and risk just do not cut it in the current febrile atmosphere .
The only way to modify the provisions is to show that they have negative “ real world ” effects .
So , an industry paper by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association finds that “ if banks cannot use swaps to hedge the risks associated with home mortgage lending , the cost of a $ 200,000 home mortgage will increase by at least $ 6,000 to $ 10,000 and probably more ” .
Surprisingly a paper authored by Zero Hedge but riddled with far too many expletives and f- bombs to ever see the light of day , concludes that the impact on mortgages will be negligible , but that banker bonuses will be cut by 50 % or more , which is the primary and only reason why SIFMA has been bribed to goalseek whatever results the banking kleptocracy wants published so that Goldman partners can end up owning every apartment in 15 CPW and build a moat around it .
This way when D - day comes , the morts will have to first deal with ill - tempered mutated seabass as they go asking politely for explanations why the economy , and the stock market , just like the Madoff ponzy , no longer exist .
" We 're going to stop people for it .

Please send me e-mail if you believe there 's a major flaw in my rankings ( or an error in any of the biographies ) .
Obviously the relative ranks of , say Fibonacci and Ramanujan , will never satisfy everyone since the reasons for their " greatness " are different .
I 'm sure I 've overlooked great mathematicians who obviously belong on this list .
Please e-mail and tell me !
Following are the top mathematicians in chronological ( birth - year ) order .
( By the way , the ranking assigned to a mathematician will appear if you place the cursor atop the name at the top of his mini-bio . ) :
Earliest mathematicians Little is known of the earliest mathematics , but the famous Ishango Bone from Early Stone - Age Africa has tally marks suggesting arithmetic .
The markings include six prime numbers ( 5 , 7 , 11 , 13 , 17 , 19 ) in order , though this is probably coincidence .
The advanced artifacts of Egypt's Old Kingdom and the Indus - Harrapa civilization imply strong mathematical skill , but the first written evidence of advanced arithmetic dates from Sumeria , where 4500 - year old clay tablets show multiplication and division problems ; the first abacus may be about this old .
By 3600 years ago , Mesopotamian tablets show tables of squares , cubes , reciprocals , and even logarithms and trig functions , using a primitive place - value system ( in base 60 , not 10 ) .
Babylonians were familiar with the Pythagorean Theorem , solutions to quadratic equations , even cubic equations ( though they did n't have a general solution for these ) , and eventually even developed methods to estimate terms for compound interest .
The Greeks borrowed from Babylonian mathematics , which was the most advanced of any before the Greeks ; but there is no ancient Babylonian mathematician whose name is known .
Also at least 3600 years ago , the Egyptian scribe Ahmes produced a famous manuscript ( now called the Rhind Papyrus ) , itself a copy of a late Middle Kingdom text .
It showed simple algebra methods and included a table giving optimal expressions using Egyptian fractions .
( Today , Egyptian fractions lead to challenging number theory problems with no practical applications , but they may have had practical value for the Egyptians .
To divide 17 grain bushels among 21 workers , the equation 17/21 = 1/2 + 1/6 + 1/7 has practical value , especially when compared with the " greedy " decomposition 17/21 = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/17 + 1/1428 . )
The Pyramids demonstrate that Egyptians were adept at geometry , though little written evidence survives .
Babylon was much more advanced than Egypt at arithmetic and algebra ; this was probably due , at least in part , to their place - value system .
But although their base - 60 system survives ( e.g. in the division of hours and degrees into minutes and seconds ) the Babylonian notation , which used the equivalent of IIIIII XXXXXIIIIIII XXXXIII to denote 417+43/60 , was unwieldy compared to the " ten digits of the Hindus . "
( In 2016 historians were surprised to decode ancient Babylonian texts and find very sophisticated astronomical calculations of Jupiter 's orbit . )
The Egyptians used the approximation π ≈ ( 4/3 ) 4 ( derived from the idea that a circle of diameter 9 has about the same area as a square of side 8 ) .
Although the ancient Hindu mathematician Apastambha had achieved a good approximation for √2 , and the ancient Babylonians an ever better √2 , neither of these ancient cultures achieved a π approximation as good as Egypt's , or better than π ≈ 25/ 8 , until the Alexandrian era .
The sudden blossoming of math in the Iron Ages of India and Greece owes much to the ancient mathematics of Egypt and Babylonia .
Early Vedic mathematicians
The greatest mathematics before the Golden Age of Greece was in India 's early Vedic ( Hindu ) civilization .
The Vedics understood relationships between geometry and arithmetic , developed astronomy , astrology , calendars , and used mathematical forms in some religious rituals .
The earliest mathematician to whom definite teachings can be ascribed was Lagadha , who apparently lived about 1300 BC and used geometry and elementary trigonometry for his astronomy .
Baudhayana lived about 800 BC and also wrote on algebra and geometry ; Yajnavalkya lived about the same time and is credited with the then - best approximation to π.
Apastambha did work summarized below ; other early Vedic mathematicians solved quadratic and simultaneous equations .
Other early cultures also developed some mathematics .
The ancient Mayans apparently had a place - value system with zero before the Hindus did ; Aztec architecture implies practical geometry skills .
Ancient China certainly developed mathematics , in fact the first known proof of the Pythagorean Theorem is found in a Chinese book ( Zhoubi Suanjing ) which might have been written about 1000 BC .
Thales of Miletus ( ca 624 - 546 BC )
Greek domain
Thales was the Chief of the " Seven Sages " of ancient Greece , and has been called the " Father of Science , " the " Founder of Abstract Geometry , " and the " First Philosopher . "
Thales is believed to have studied mathematics under Egyptians , who in turn were aware of much older mathematics from Mesopotamia .
Thales may have invented the notion of compass - and - straightedge construction .
Several fundamental theorems about triangles are attributed to Thales , including the law of similar triangles ( which Thales used famously to calculate the height of the Great Pyramid ) and " Thales ' Theorem " itself : the fact that any angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle .
( The other " theorems " were probably more like well - known axioms , but Thales proved Thales '
Theorem using two of his other theorems ; it is said that Thales then sacrificed an ox to celebrate what might have been the first mathematical proof in Greece . )
Thales noted that , given a line segment of length x , a segment of length x/k can be constructed by first constructing a segment of length kx .
Thales was also an astronomer ; he invented the 365 - day calendar , introduced the use of Ursa Minor for finding North , invented the gnomonic map projection ( the first of many methods known today to map ( part of ) the surface of a sphere to a plane , and is the first person believed to have correctly predicted a solar eclipse .
His theories of physics would seem quaint today , but he seems to have been the first to describe magnetism and static electricity .
Aristotle said , " To Thales the primary question was not what do we know , but how do we know it . "
Thales was also a politician , ethicist , and military strategist .
It is said he once leased all available olive presses after predicting a good olive season ; he did this not for the wealth itself , but as a demonstration of the use of intelligence in business .
Thales ' writings have not survived and are known only second - hand .
Since his famous theorems of geometry were probably already known in ancient Babylon , his importance derives from imparting the notions of mathematical proof and the scientific method to ancient Greeks .
While more ancient mathematicians were concerned with practical calculations , modern mathematics began with the Greek emphasis on proofs and philosophy .
Pythagoras and Parmenides of Elea also played key roles in that development which began with Thales .
These ideas led to the schools of Plato , Aristotle and Euclid , and an intellectual blossoming unequaled until Europe 's Renaissance .
Thales is ranked # 38 on the Pantheon List of Most Popular and Productive Persons .
Thales ' student and successor was Anaximander , who is often called the " First Scientist " instead of Thales : his theories were more firmly based on experimentation and logic , while Thales still relied on some animistic interpretations .
Anaximander is famous for astronomy , cartography and sundials , and also enunciated a theory of evolution , that land species somehow developed from primordial fish !
Anaximander 's most famous student , in turn , was Pythagoras .
Apastambha ( ca 630-560 BC )
India
The Dharmasutra composed by Apastambha contains mensuration techniques , novel geometric construction techniques , a method of elementary algebra , and what may be an early proof of the Pythagorean Theorem .
Apastambha's work uses the excellent ( continued fraction ) approximation √ 2 ≈ 577/408 , a result probably derived with a geometric argument .
Apastambha built on the work of earlier Vedic scholars , especially Baudhayana , as well as Harappan and ( probably ) Mesopotamian mathematicians .
His notation and proofs were primitive , and there is little certainty about his life .
However similar comments apply to Thales of Miletus , so it seems fair to mention Apastambha ( who was perhaps the most creative Vedic mathematician before Panini ) along with Thales as one of the earliest mathematicians whose name is known .
Pythagoras of Samos ( ca 578-505 BC )
Greek domain
Pythagoras , who is sometimes called the " First Philosopher , " studied under Anaximander , Egyptians , Babylonians , and the mystic Pherekydes ( from whom Pythagoras acquired a belief in reincarnation ) ; he became the most influential of early Greek mathematicians .
He is credited with being first to use axioms and deductive proofs , so his influence on Plato and Euclid may be enormous ; he is generally credited with much of Books I and II of Euclid 's Elements .
He and his students ( the " Pythagoreans " ) were ascetic mystics for whom mathematics was partly a spiritual tool .
( Some occultists treat Pythagoras as a wizard and founding mystic philosopher . )
Pythagoras was very interested in astronomy and seems to have been the first man to realize that the Earth was a globe similar to the other planets .
He and his followers began to study the question of planetary motions , which would not be resolved for more than two millennia .
The words philosophy and mathematics are said to have been coined by Pythagoras .
He is supposed to have invented the Pythagorean Cup , a clever wine goblet which punishes a drinker who greedily fills his cup to the top by then using siphon pressure to drain the cup .
Pythagoras ranks # 10 on the Pantheon Popularity / Productivity List , but despite this historical importance I may have ranked him too high : many results of the Pythagoreans were due to his students ; none of their writings survive ; and what is known is reported second - hand , and possibly exaggerated , by Plato and others .
Some ideas attributed to him were probably first enunciated by successors like Parmenides of Elea ( ca 515-440 BC ) .
Archaeologists now believe that he was not first to invent the diatonic scale :
Here is a diatonic - scale song from Ugarit which predates Pythagoras by eight centuries .
Pythagoras ' students included Hippasus of Metapontum , the famous anatomist and physician Alcmaeon ( who was first to claim that thinking occurred in the brain rather than heart ) , Milo of Croton , and Milo 's daughter Theano ( who may have been Pythagoras 's wife ) .
The term Pythagorean was also adopted by many disciples who lived later ; these disciples include Philolaus of Croton , the natural philosopher Empedocles , and several other famous Greeks .
Pythagoras ' successor was apparently Theano herself : the Pythagoreans were one of the few ancient schools to practice gender equality .
Pythagoras discovered that harmonious intervals in music are based on simple rational numbers .
This led to a fascination with integers and mystic numerology ; he is sometimes called the " Father of Numbers " and once said " Number rules the universe . "
( About the mathematical basis of music , Leibniz later wrote , " Music is the pleasure the human soul experiences from counting without being aware that it is counting . "
Other mathematicians who investigated the arithmetic of music included Huygens , Euler and Simon Stevin . )
Given any numbers a and b the Pythagoreans were aware of the three distinct means : ( a+b ) /2 ( arithmetic mean ) , √( ab ) ( geometric mean ) , and 2 ab / ( a+b ) ( harmonic mean ) .
The Pythagorean Theorem was known long before Pythagoras , but he was often credited ( before discovery of an ancient Chinese text ) with the first proof .
He may have discovered the simple parametric form of primitive Pythagorean triplets ( xx - yy , 2xy , xx+yy ) , although the first explicit mention of this may be in Euclid 's Elements .
Other discoveries of the Pythagorean school include the construction of the regular pentagon , concepts of perfect and amicable numbers , polygonal numbers , golden ratio ( attributed to Theano ) , three of the five regular solids ( attributed to Pythagoras himself ) , and irrational numbers ( attributed to Hippasus ) .
It is said that the discovery of irrational numbers upset the Pythagoreans so much they tossed Hippasus into the ocean !
( Another version has Hippasus banished for revealing the secret for constructing the sphere which circumscribes a dodecahedron . )
In addition to Parmenides , the famous successors of Thales and Pythagoras include Zeno of Elea ( see below ) , Hippocrates of Chios ( see below ) , Plato of Athens ( ca 428-348 BC ) , Theaetetus ( see below ) , and Archytas ( see below ) .
These early Greeks ushered in a Golden Age of Mathematics and Philosophy unequaled in Europe until the Renaissance .
The emphasis was on pure , rather than practical , mathematics .
Plato ( who ranks # 40 on Michael Hart 's famous list of the Most Influential Persons in History ) decreed that his scholars should do geometric construction solely with compass and straight - edge rather than with " carpenter 's tools " like rulers and protractors .
Panini ( of Shalatula ) ( ca 520-460 BC ) Gandhara ( India )
Panini's great accomplishment was his study of the Sanskrit language , especially in his text Ashtadhyayi .
Although this work might be considered the very first study of linguistics or grammar , it used a non-obvious elegance that would not be equaled in the West until the 20th century .
Linguistics may seem an unlikely qualification for a " great mathematician , " but language theory is a field of mathematics .
The works of eminent 20th - century linguists and computer scientists like Chomsky , Backus , Post and Church are seen to resemble Panini 's work 25 centuries earlier .
Panini 's systematic study of Sanskrit may have inspired the development of Indian science and algebra .
Panini has been called " the Indian Euclid " since the rigor of his grammar is comparable to Euclid 's geometry .
Although his great texts have been preserved , little else is known about Panini .
Some scholars would place his dates a century later than shown here ; he may or may not have been the same person as the famous poet Panini .
In any case , he was the very last Vedic Sanskrit scholar by definition : his text formed the transition to the Classic Sanskrit period .
Panini has been called " one of the most innovative people in the whole development of knowledge ; " his grammar " one of the greatest monuments of human intelligence . "
Zeno of Elea ( ca 495-435 BC )
Greek domain
Zeno , a student of Parmenides , had great fame in ancient Greece .
This fame , which continues to the present - day , is largely due to his paradoxes of infinitesimals , e.g. his argument that Achilles can never catch the tortoise ( whenever Achilles arrives at the tortoise 's last position , the tortoise has moved on ) .
Although some regard these paradoxes as simple fallacies , they have been contemplated for many centuries .
It is due to these paradoxes that the use of infinitesimals , which provides the basis for mathematical analysis , has been regarded as a non -rigorous heuristic and is finally viewed as sound only after the work of the great 19th - century rigorists , Dedekind and Weierstrass .
Zeno's Arrow Paradox ( at any single instant an arrow is at a fixed position , so where does its motion come from ? ) has lent its name to the Quantum Zeno Effect , a paradox of quantum physics .
Eubulides of Miletus was another ancient Greek famous for paradoxes , e.g . " This statement is a lie " -- the sort of inconsistency later used in proofs by Gödel and Turing .
Hippocrates of Chios ( ca 470-410 BC )
Greek domain
Hippocrates ( no known relation to Hippocrates of Cos , the famous physician ) wrote his own Elements more than a century before Euclid .
Only fragments survive but it apparently used axiomatic - based proofs similar to Euclid 's and contains many of the same theorems .
Hippocrates is said to have invented the reductio ad absurdem proof method .
Hippocrates is most famous for his work on the three ancient geometric quandaries : his work on cube - doubling ( the Delian Problem ) laid the groundwork for successful efforts by Archytas and others ; and some claim Hippocrates was first to trisect the general angle .
His circle quadrature was of course ultimately unsuccessful but he did prove ingenious theorems about " lunes " ( crescent - shaped circle fragments ) .
For example , the area of any right triangle is equal to the sum of the areas of the two lunes formed when semi-circles are drawn on each of the three edges of the triangle .
Hippocrates also did work in algebra and rudimentary analysis .
( Doubling the cube and angle trisection are often called " impossible , " but they are impossible only when restricted to collapsing compass and unmarkable straightedge .
There are ingenious solutions available with other tools .
Construction of the regular heptagon is another such task , with solutions published by four of the men on this List : Thabit , Alhazen , Vieta , Conway . )
Archytas of Tarentum ( ca 420-350 BC )
Greek domain
Archytas was an important statesman as well as philosopher .
He studied under Philolaus of Croton , was a friend of Plato , and tutored Eudoxus .
In addition to discoveries always attributed to him , he may be the source of several of Euclid 's theorems , and some works attributed to Eudoxus and perhaps Pythagoras .
Recently it has been shown that the magnificent Mechanical Problems attributed to ( pseudo - ) Aristotle were probably actually written by Archytas , making him one of the greatest mathematicians of antiquity .
Archytas introduced " motion " to geometry , rotating curves to produce solids .
If his writings had survived he 'd surely be considered one of the most brilliant and innovative geometers of antiquity .
He appears on Cardano 's List of 12 Greatest Geniuses .
( Euclid , Aristotle , Archimedes , Apollonius , Ptolemy , and the physician Galen of Pergamum are the other Greeks on that List . )
Archytas ' most famous mathematical achievement was " doubling the cube " ( constructing a line segment larger than another by the factor cube - root of two ) .
Although others solved the problem with other techniques , Archytas ' solution for cube doubling was astounding because it was n't achieved in the plane , but involved the intersection of three - dimensional bodies .
This construction ( which introduced the Archytas Curve ) has been called " a tour de force of the spatial imagination . "
He invented the term harmonic mean and worked with geometric means as well ( proving that consecutive integers never have rational geometric mean ) .
He was a true polymath : he advanced the theory of music far beyond Pythagoras ; studied sound , optics and cosmology ; invented the pulley ( and a rattle to occupy infants ) ; wrote about the lever ; developed the curriculum called quadrivium ; is credited with inventing the screw ; and is supposed to have built a steam - powered wooden bird which flew for 200 meters .
Archytas is sometimes called the " Father of Mathematical Mechanics . "
Some scholars think Pythagoras and Thales are partly mythical .
If we take that view , Archytas ( and Hippocrates ) should be promoted in this list .
Theaetetus of Athens ( 417-369 BC )
Greece
Theaetetus is presumed to be the true author of Books X and XIII of Euclid 's Elements , as well as some work attributed to Eudoxus .
He was considered one of the brightest of Greek mathematicians , and is the central character in two of Plato 's Dialogs .
It was Theaetetus who discovered the final two of the five " Platonic solids " and proved that there were no more .
He may have been first to note that the square root of any integer , if not itself an integer , must be irrational .
( The case √2 is attributed to a student of Pythagoras . )
Eudoxus of Cnidus ( 408-355 BC )
Greek domain
Eudoxus journeyed widely for his education , despite that he was not wealthy , studying mathematics with Archytas in Tarentum , medicine with Philiston in Sicily , philosophy with Plato in Athens , continuing his mathematics study in Egypt , touring the Eastern Mediterranean with his own students and finally returned to Cnidus where he established himself as astronomer , physician , and ethicist .
What is known of him is second - hand , through the writings of Euclid and others , but he was one of the most creative mathematicians of the ancient world .
Many of the theorems in Euclid 's Elements were first proved by Eudoxus .
While Pythagoras had been horrified by the discovery of irrational numbers , Eudoxus is famous for incorporating them into arithmetic .
He also developed the earliest techniques of the infinitesimal calculus ; Archimedes credits Eudoxus with inventing a principle eventually called the Axiom of Archimedes : it avoids Zeno 's paradoxes by , in effect , forbidding infinities and infinitesimals .
Eudoxus ' work with irrational numbers , infinitesimals and limits eventually inspired masters like Dedekind .
Eudoxus also introduced an Axiom of Continuity ; he was a pioneer in solid geometry ; and he developed his own solution to the Delian cube - doubling problem .
Eudoxus was the first great mathematical astronomer ; he developed the complicated ancient theory of planetary orbits ; and may have invented the astrolabe .
He may have invented the 365.25 - day calendar based on leap years , though it remained for Julius Caesar to popularize it .
( It is sometimes said that he knew that the Earth rotates around the Sun , but that appears to be false ; it is instead Aristarchus of Samos , as cited by Archimedes , who is often called the first " heliocentrist . " )
One of Eudoxus ' students was Menaechmus , who was first to describe the conic sections and used them to devise a non-Platonic solution to the cube - doubling problem ( and perhaps the circle - squaring problem as well ) .
Four of Eudoxus ' most famous discoveries were the volume of a cone , extension of arithmetic to the irrationals , summing formula for geometric series , and viewing π as the limit of polygonal perimeters .
None of these seems difficult today , but it does seem remarkable that they were all first achieved by the same man .
Eudoxus has been quoted as saying " Willingly would I burn to death like Phaeton , were this the price for reaching the sun and learning its shape , its size and its substance . "
Aristotle of Stagira ( 384-322 BC )
Macedonia
Aristotle was the most prominent scientist of the ancient world , and perhaps the most influential philosopher and logician ever ; he ranks # 13 on Michael Hart 's list of the Most Influential Persons in History .
His science was a standard curriculum for almost 2000 years .
Although the physical sciences could n't advance until the discoveries by great men like Newton and Lavoisier , Aristotle 's work in the biological sciences was superb , and served as paradigm until modern times .
Aristotle was personal tutor to the young Alexander the Great .
Aristotle 's disciple and successor Theophrastus was also a great scientist , as was Theophrastus ' successor Strato of Lampsacus .
Although Aristotle was probably the greatest biologist of the ancient world , his work in physics and mathematics may not seem enough to qualify for this list .
But his teachings covered a very wide gamut and dominated the development of ancient science .
His writings on definitions , axioms and proofs may have influenced Euclid ; and he was one of the first mathematicians to write on the subject of infinity .
His writings include geometric theorems , some with proofs different from Euclid 's or missing from Euclid altogether ; one of these ( which is seen only in Aristotle 's work prior to Apollonius ) is that a circle is the locus of points whose distances from two given points are in constant ratio .
A charge sometimes made against Aristotle is that his wrong ideas held back the development of science .
But this charge is unfair ; Aristotle himself stressed the importance of observation and experimentation , and to be ready to reject old hypotheses and prepare new ones .
Of course many of his ideas turned out to be wrong , but many were correct : e.g. the explanation that sound comes from the vibration of air .
And even if , as is widely agreed , Aristotle 's geometric theorems were not his own work , his status as the most influential logician and philosopher in all of history makes him a strong candidate for the List .
The Nature of Time and Space
Although he was a disciple of Plato , Aristotle had very different ideas from his tutor on many topics .
While Plato felt that time and space were absolute entities that would exist even in a void without objects or events , Aristotle believed that time and space were defined by objects and events , that eventless time or perfect vacuums were absurdities .
Aristotle 's common - sense view was the default until Newton stipulated notions of absolute mathematical time and space to make his equations of motion sensical .
This latter view seems like common - sense today , but it is said that this modern view started with the Newtonian revolution .
While Newton took Plato 's side in the debate about the nature of time and space , his rival Leibniz took Aristotle 's side .
These opposing views were finally subsumed by wholly new notions of time and space introduced by one of the greatest of all geniuses : Albert Einstein .
Strato of Lampsacus ( ca 335-269 BC )
Greece
Although not a mathematician , the natural philosopher Strato is worth mention .
He made many improvements to Aristotle 's natural philosophy , including improved understandings of time , space , acceleration and continuity ; and may have been the true author of the Mechanics text originally attributed to Aristotle .
He also wrote about moral philosophy .
He equated God with natural law , so was perhaps the first atheist .
His thinking has been compared to that of Baruch Spinoza .
Euclid of Alexandria ( ca 322-275 BC )
Greece / Egypt
Euclid of Alexandria ( not to be confused with Socrates ' student , Euclid of Megara , who lived a century earlier ) , directed the school of mathematics at the great university of Alexandria .
Little else is known for certain about his life , but several very important mathematical achievements are credited to him .
He was the first to prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers ; he produced an incomplete proof of the Unique Factorization Theorem ( Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic ) ; and he devised Euclid 's algorithm for computing gcd .
He introduced the Mersenne primes and observed that ( M2+M ) / 2 is always perfect ( in the sense of Pythagoras ) if M is Mersenne .
( The converse , that any even perfect number has such a corresponding Mersenne prime , was tackled by Alhazen and proven by Euler . )
His books contain many famous theorems , though much of the Elements was due to predecessors like Pythagoras ( most of Books I and II ) , Hippocrates ( Book III ) , Theodorus , Eudoxus ( Book V ) , Archytas ( perhaps Book VIII ) and Theaetetus .
Book I starts with an elegant proof that rigid - compass constructions can be implemented with a collapsing compass .
( Given A , B , C , find CF = AB by first constructing equilateral triangle ACD ; then use the compass to find E on AD with AE = AB ; and finally find F on DC with DF = DE . )
Book III Proposition 35 proves that when chords of a circle intersect , the products of their segments are equal .
Although notions of trigonometry were not in use , Euclid 's theorems include some closely related to the Laws of Sines and Cosines .
Among several books attributed to Euclid are The Division of the Scale ( a mathematical discussion of music ) , The Optics , The Cartoptrics ( a treatise on the theory of mirrors ) , a book on spherical geometry , a book on logic fallacies , and his comprehensive math textbook The Elements .
Several of his masterpieces have been lost , including works on conic sections and other advanced geometric topics .
Apparently Desargues ' Homology
Theorem ( a pair of triangles is coaxial if and only if it is copolar ) was proved in one of these lost works ; this is the fundamental theorem which initiated the study of projective geometry .
Euclid ranks # 14 on Michael Hart 's famous list of the Most Influential Persons in History .
The Elements introduced the notions of axiom and theorem ; was used as a textbook for 2000 years ; and in fact is still the basis for high school geometry , making Euclid the leading mathematics teacher of all time .
Some think his best inspiration was recognizing that the Parallel Postulate must be an axiom rather than a theorem .
There are many famous quotations about Euclid and his books .
Abraham Lincoln abandoned his law studies when he did n't know what " demonstrate " meant and " went home to my father 's house [ to read Euclid ] , and stayed there till I could give any proposition in the six books of Euclid at sight .
I then found out what demonstrate means , and went back to my law studies . "
Archimedes of Syracuse ( 287-212 BC )
Greek domain
Archimedes is universally acknowledged to be the greatest of ancient mathematicians .
He studied at Euclid 's school ( probably after Euclid 's death ) , but his work far surpassed , and even leapfrogged , the works of Euclid .
( For example , some of Euclid 's more difficult theorems are easy analytic consequences of Archimedes ' Lemma of Centroids . )
His achievements are particularly impressive given the lack of good mathematical notation in his day .
His proofs are noted not only for brilliance but for unequaled clarity , with a modern biographer ( Heath ) describing Archimedes ' treatises as " without exception monuments of mathematical exposition ... so impressive in their perfection as to create a feeling akin to awe in the mind of the reader . "
Archimedes made advances in number theory , algebra , and analysis , but is most renowned for his many theorems of plane and solid geometry .
He might have been first to prove Heron 's formula for the area of a triangle .
His excellent approximation to √3 indicates that he 'd partially anticipated the method of continued fractions .
He developed a recursive method of representing large integers , and was first to note the law of exponents , 10 a·10 b = 10a+b .
Working with exponents , he developed simple notation and names for numbers larger than 10 ^ ( 10 ^16 ) ; this will seem more startling when you recall that it was another 18 centuries before Europeans would invent the word " million . "
Archimedes found a method to trisect an arbitrary angle ( using a markable straightedge — the construction is impossible using strictly Platonic rules ) .
One of his most remarkable and famous geometric results was determining the area of a parabolic section , for which he offered two independent proofs , one using his Principle of the Lever , the other using a geometric series .
Some of Archimedes ' work survives only because Thabit ibn Qurra translated the otherwise - lost Book of Lemmas ; it contains the angle - trisection method and several ingenious theorems about inscribed circles .
( Thabit shows how to construct a regular heptagon ; it may not be clear whether this came from Archimedes , or was fashioned by Thabit by studying Archimedes ' angle - trisection method . )
Other discoveries known only second - hand include the Archimedean semiregular solids reported by Pappus , and the Broken - Chord Theorem reported by Alberuni .
Archimedes and Newton might be the two best geometers ever , but although each produced ingenious geometric proofs , often they used non-rigorous calculus to discover results , and then devised rigorous geometric proofs for publication .
Archimedes used integral calculus to determine the centers of mass of hemisphere and cylindrical wedge , and the volume of two cylinders ' intersection .
He also worked with various spirals , paraboloids of revolution , etc. Although Archimedes did n't develop differentiation ( integration 's inverse ) , Michel Chasles credits him ( along with Kepler , Cavalieri , and Fermat , who all lived more than 18 centuries later ) as one of the four who developed calculus before Newton and Leibniz .
( Although familiar with the utility of infinitesimals , he accepted the " Theorem of Eudoxus " which bans them to avoid Zeno 's paradoxes .
Modern mathematicians refer to that " Theorem " as the Axiom of Archimedes . )
Archimedes was an astronomer ( details of his discoveries are lost , but it is likely he knew the Earth rotated around the Sun ) .
He was one of the greatest mechanists ever , discovering Archimedes ' Principle of Hydrostatics .
( A body partially or completely immersed in a fluid effectively loses weight equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces .
Archimedes is famous for testing the purity of his King 's gold crown , but he did n't write up his solution ; it was finally Galileo who pointed out that a test based on measuring water displacement , as had been assumed to be Archimedes ' " Eureka ! " method , would be extremely imprecise .
Instead Archimedes must have applied the less trivial corollaries of his Principle of Hydrostatics by comparing a balance scale 's reading in and out of water . )
Archimedes developed the mathematical foundations underlying the advantage of basic machines : lever , screw and compound pulley .
Although Archytas perhaps invented the screw , and Stone - Age man ( and even other animals ) used levers , it is said that the compound pulley was invented by Archimedes himself .
For these achievements he is widely considered to be one of the three or four greatest theoretical physicists ever .
Archimedes was a prolific inventor : in addition to inventing the compound pulley , he invented the hydraulic screw - pump ( called Archimedes ' screw ) ; a miniature planetarium ; and several war machines -- catapult , parabolic mirrors to burn enemy ships , a steam cannon , and ' the Claw of Archimedes . '
( Some scholars attribute the Antikythera mechanism to Archimedes -- Is it the Archimedean planetarium mentioned by Cicero ?
However this is unlikely : the detailed motion of the Moon produced by the mechanism was probably unknown until Hipparchus . )
His books include Floating Bodies , Spirals , The Sand Reckoner , Measurement of the Circle , Sphere and Cylinder , Plane Equilibriums , Conoids and Spheroids , Quadrature of Parabola , The Book of Lemmas ( translated and attributed by Thabit ibn Qurra ) , various now - lost works ( on Mirrors , Balances and Levers , Semi-regular Polyhedra , etc. ) cited by Pappus or others , and ( discovered only recently , and often called his most important work ) The Method .
He developed the Stomachion puzzle ( and solved a difficult enumeration problem involving it ) ; other famous gems include The Cattle - Problem .
The Book of Lemmas contains various geometric gems ( " the Salinon , " " the Shoemaker 's Knife " , etc. ) and is credited to Archimedes by Thabit ibn Qurra but the attribution is disputed .
Archimedes discovered formulae for the volume and surface area of a sphere , and may even have been first to notice and prove the simple relationship between a circle 's circumference and area .
For these reasons , π is often called Archimedes ' constant .
His approximation
223/71 < π < 22/7 was the best of his day .
( Apollonius soon surpassed it , but by using Archimedes ' method . )
Archimedes ' Equiarea Map
Theorem asserts that a sphere and its enclosing cylinder have equal surface area ( as do the figures ' truncations ) .
Archimedes also proved that the volume of that sphere is two - thirds the volume of the cylinder .
He requested that a representation of such a sphere and cylinder be inscribed on his tomb .
That Archimedes shared the attitude of later mathematicians like Hardy and Brouwer is suggested by Plutarch 's comment that Archimedes regarded applied mathematics " as ignoble and sordid ... and did not deign to [ write about his mechanical inventions ; instead ] he placed his whole ambition in those speculations the beauty and subtlety of which are untainted by any admixture of the common needs of life . "
Some of Archimedes ' greatest writings ( including The Method and Floating Bodies ) are preserved only on a palimpsest rediscovered in 1906 and mostly deciphered only after 1998 .
Ideas unique to that work are an anticipation of Riemann integration , calculating the volume of a cylindrical wedge ( previously first attributed to Kepler ) .
Along with Oresme and Galileo , Archimedes was among the few to comment on the " equinumerosity paradox " ( the fact that there are as many perfect squares as integers ) .
Although Euler and Newton may have been the most important mathematicians , and Gauss , Weierstrass and Riemann the greatest theorem provers , it is widely accepted that Archimedes was the greatest genius who ever lived .
Yet , Hart omits him altogether from his list of Most Influential Persons : Archimedes was simply too far ahead of his time to have great historical significance .
( He does rank # 11 on the Pantheon List .
Some think the Scientific Revolution would have begun sooner had The Method been discovered four or five centuries earlier .
You can read a 1912 translation of parts of The Method on - line . )
Eratosthenes of Cyrene ( 276-194 BC )
Greek domain
Eratosthenes was one of the greatest polymaths ; he is called the Father of Geography , was Chief Librarian at Alexandria , was a poet , music theorist , mechanical engineer ( anticipating laws of elasticity , etc. ) , astronomer ( he is credited as first to measure the circumference of the Earth ) , and an outstanding mathematician .
He is famous for his prime number Sieve , but more impressive was his work on the cube - doubling problem which he related to the design of siege weapons ( catapults ) where a cube - root calculation is needed .
Eratosthenes had the nickname Beta ; he was a master of several fields , but was only second - best of his time .
His better was also his good friend : Archimedes of Syracuse dedicated The Method to Eratosthenes .
Apollonius of Perga ( 262-190 BC )
Greek domain
Apollonius Pergaeus , called " The Great Geometer , " is sometimes considered the second greatest of ancient Greek mathematicians .
( Euclid , Eudoxus and Archytas are other candidates for this honor . )
His writings on conic sections have been studied until modern times ; he developed methods for normals and curvature .
( He is often credited with inventing the names for parabola , hyperbola and ellipse ; but these shapes were previously described by Menaechmus , and their names may also predate Apollonius . )
Although astronomers eventually concluded it was not physically correct , Apollonius developed the " epicycle and deferent " model of planetary orbits , and proved important theorems in this area .
He deliberately emphasized the beauty of pure , rather than applied , mathematics , saying his theorems were " worthy of acceptance for the sake of the demonstrations themselves . "
The following generalization of the Pythagorean Theorem , where M is the midpoint of BC , is called Apollonius '
Theorem : AB 2 + AC 2 = 2 ( AM 2 + BM 2 ) .
Many of his works have survived only in a fragmentary form , and the proofs were completely lost .
Most famous was the Problem of Apollonius , which is to find a circle tangent to three objects , with the objects being points , lines , or circles , in any combination .
Constructing the eight circles each tangent to three other circles is especially challenging , but just finding the two circles containing two given points and tangent to a given line is a serious challenge .
Vieta was renowned for discovering methods for all ten cases of this Problem .
Other great mathematicians who have enjoyed reconstructing Apollonius ' lost theorems include Fermat , Pascal , Newton , Euler , Poncelet and Gauss .
In evaluating the genius of the ancient Greeks , it is well to remember that their achievements were made without the convenience of modern notation .
It is clear from his writing that Apollonius almost developed the analytic geometry of Descartes , but failed due to the lack of such elementary concepts as negative numbers .
Leibniz wrote " He who understands Archimedes and Apollonius will admire less the achievements of the foremost men of later times . "
Chang Tshang ( ca 200 - 142 BC )
China
Chinese mathematicians excelled for thousands of years , and were first to discover various algebraic and geometric principles .
There is some evidence that Chinese writings influenced India and the Islamic Empire , and thus , indirectly , Europe .
Although there were great Chinese mathematicians a thousand years before the Han Dynasty ( as evidenced by the ancient Zhoubi Suanjing ) , and innovations continued for centuries after Han , the textbook Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art has special importance .
Nine Chapters ( known in Chinese as Jiu Zhang Suan Shu or Chiu Chang Suan Shu ) was apparently written during the early Han Dynasty ( about 165 BC ) by Chang Tshang ( also spelled Zhang Cang ) .
Many of the mathematical concepts of the early Greeks were discovered independently in early China .
Chang 's book gives methods of arithmetic ( including cube roots ) and algebra , uses the decimal system ( though zero was represented as just a space , rather than a discrete symbol ) , proves the Pythagorean Theorem , and includes a clever geometric proof that the perimeter of a right triangle times the radius of its inscribing circle equals the area of its circumscribing rectangle .
( Some of this may have been added after the time of Chang ; some additions attributed to Liu Hui are mentioned in his mini-bio ; other famous contributors are Jing Fang and Zhang Heng . )
Nine Chapters was probably based on earlier books , lost during the great book burning of 212 BC , and Chang himself may have been a lord who commissioned others to prepare the book .
Moreover , important revisions and commentaries were added after Chang , notably by Liu Hui ( ca 220-280 ) .
Although Liu Hui mentions
Chang 's skill , it is n't clear Chang had the mathematical genius to qualify for this list , but he would still be a strong candidate due to his book 's immense historical importance :
It was the dominant Chinese mathematical text for centuries , and had great influence throughout the Far East .
After Chang , Chinese mathematics continued to flourish , discovering trigonometry , matrix methods , the Binomial Theorem , etc .
Some of the teachings made their way to India , and from there to the Islamic world and Europe .
There is some evidence that the Hindus borrowed the decimal system itself from books like Nine Chapters .
No one person can be credited with the invention of the decimal system , but key roles were played by early Chinese ( Chang Tshang and Liu Hui ) , Brahmagupta ( and earlier Hindus including Aryabhata ) , and Leonardo Fibonacci .
( After Fibonacci , Europe still did not embrace the decimal system until the works of Vieta , Stevin , and Napier . )
Hipparchus of Nicaea and Rhodes ( ca 190 - 127 BC )
Greek domain
Ptolemy may be the most famous astronomer before Copernicus , but he borrowed heavily from Hipparchus , who should thus be considered ( along with Galileo and Edwin Hubble ) to be one of the three greatest astronomers ever .
Careful study of the errors in the catalogs of Ptolemy and Hipparchus reveal both that Ptolemy borrowed his data from Hipparchus , and that Hipparchus used principles of spherical trig to simplify his work .
Classical Hindu astronomers , including the 6th - century genius Aryabhata , borrow much from Ptolemy and Hipparchus .
Most of Hipparchus ' work has been lost , and little is known of his life .
Even his dates have been deduced from the lunar eclipses he discusses .
( Some of his delicate measurements required lunar eclipses . )
Hipparchus is called the " Father of Trigonometry " ; he developed spherical trigonometry , produced trig tables , and more .
He produced at least fourteen texts of physics and mathematics nearly all of which have been lost , but which seem to have had great teachings , including much of Newton 's Laws of Motion .
In one obscure surviving work he demonstrates familiarity with the combinatorial enumeration method now called Schröder 's Numbers .
He invented the circle - conformal stereographic and orthographic map projections which carry his name .
As an astronomer , Hipparchus is credited with the discovery of equinox precession , length of the year , thorough star catalogs , and invention of the armillary sphere and perhaps the astrolabe .
He had great historical influence in Europe , India and Persia , at least if credited also with Ptolemy 's influence .
( Hipparchus himself was influenced by Babylonian astronomers . )
Hipparchus ' work implies a better approximation to π than that of Apollonius , perhaps it was π ≈ 377/120 as Ptolemy used .
The Antikythera mechanism is an astronomical clock considered amazing for its time .
It may have been built about the time of Hipparchus ' death , but lost after a few decades ( remaining at the bottom of the sea for 2000 years ) .
The mechanism implemented the complex orbits which Hipparchus had developed to explain irregular planetary motions ; it 's not unlikely the great genius helped design this intricate analog computer , which may have been built in Rhodes where Hipparchus spent his final decades .
( Recent studies suggest that the mechanism might have been designed soon after Archimedes ' time , but that genius was probably not the designer : the Mechanism does n't match descriptions of the planetariums that Archimedes built . )
( Let 's mention another Greek astronomer contemporaneous to Hipparchus , Seleucus of Seleucia ( ca 190 - 145 BC ) , who is noted for supporting heliocentrism .
explaining tides , and proposing that the universe is infinite . )
Titus Lucretius Carus ( ca 99-55 BC )
Rome
Lucretius was a highly - praised poet rather than a mathematician , but may deserve mention in the history of the development of science .
His poem " On the Nature of Things " showed advanced knowledge of the natural world .
He postulated that equal weights fall at equal speeds in a vacuum , long before Galileo made the same observation .
Albert Einstein is famous for proving the existence of atoms from Brownian Motion , but Lucretius had used the same argument almost 2000 years earlier .
Lucretius also had advanced ideas in philosophy , psychology and cosmology .
He had a notion of evolution ( though not species origin ) based on survival of the fittest , and denied that humans were intrinsically superior to other animals .
The " three - age " system ( dividing human prehistory and history into Stone , Bronze and Iron Ages ) is due to Lucretius .
( Like all ancient natural philosophers , Lucretius had misconceptions : it appears he did n't accept that the Earth is spherical . )
Heron of Alexandria ( ca 10 - 75 ) Egypt
Heron ( or Hero ) was apparently a teacher at the great university of Alexandria , but there is much uncertainty about his life and work .
He wrote on mechanics ( analysing the five basic machines of mechanical advantage ) , astronomy ( determining longitudes ) , hydrostatics , architecture , surveying , optics ( he introduced the ' shortest - distance ' explanation for mirror reflection ) , arithmetic ( finding square roots and cube roots ) , and geometry ( finding the areas and volumes of various shapes ) .
He was an inventor ; he was first to describe a syringe , a windmill , a pump for extinguishing fires , and some very primitive counters and computers .
He is especially famous for his invention of the aeolipile which rotated using steam from an attached cauldron , and is considered the first steam engine .
( Vitruvius may have described such a machine before Heron . )
He is noted for designing various toys ( probably developed as teaching aids for his lectures ) ; these included a puppet theater driven by strings and weights , a robot trumpet , trick wine glasses , a windmill - driven organ , and coin - operated vending machine .
His most famous discovery in mathematics was Heron 's Formula for the area A of a triangle with sides a , b, c :
A2 = s( s - a ) ( s- b ) ( s- c ) where s = ( a+b+c ) / 2
But there is some controversy about the actual authorship of Heron 's books ; and much of Heron 's best physics and mathematics ( possibly including Heron 's Formula ) appear to repeat discoveries by Archimedes .
Thus , despite his fame , we do not include Heron on our List .
Menelaus of Alexandria ( ca 70 - 135 ) Egypt , Rome
Menelaus wrote several books on geometry and trigonometry , mostly lost except for his works on solid geometry .
His work was cited by Ptolemy , Pappus , and Thabit ; especially the Theorem of Menelaus itself which is a fundamental and difficult theorem very useful in projective geometry .
He also contributed much to spherical trigonometry .
Disdaining indirect proofs ( anticipating later - day constructivists )
Menelaus found new , more fruitful proofs for several of Euclid 's results .
Tiberius ( ? )
Claudius Ptolemaeus of Alexandria ( ca 90 - 168 ) Egypt ( in Greco - Roman domain )
Ptolemy ` the Wise , ' Librarian of Alexandria , was one of the most famous of ancient Greek scientists , ranking # 80 on the Pantheon List of Most Popular and Productive Persons .
His textbooks were among the most important of the ancient world , perhaps because they supplanted most that had come before .
He provided new insights into optics and music ; he was the best geographer of his day .
Among his mathematical results , most famous may be Ptolemy 's Theorem ( AC·BD = AB·CD + BC·AD if and only if ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral ) .
This theorem has many useful corollaries ; it was frequently applied in Copernicus ' work .
Ptolemy wrote on trigonometry , optics , geography , and map projections ; but is most famous for his astronomy , where he perfected the geocentric model of planetary motions .
For this work , Cardano included Ptolemy on his List of 12 Greatest Geniuses , but removed him from the list after learning of Copernicus ' discovery .
Interestingly , Ptolemy wrote that the fixed point in a model of planetary motion was arbitrary , but rejected the Earth spinning on its axis since he thought this would lead to powerful winds .
Ptolemy discussed and tabulated the ' equation of time , ' documenting the irregular apparent motion of the Sun .
( It took fifteen centuries before this irregularity was correctly attributed to Earth 's elliptical orbit . )
Geocentrism vs. Heliocentrism
The mystery of celestial motions directed scientific inquiry for thousands of years .
Except for some Pythagoreans like Philolaus of Croton , thinkers generally assumed that the Earth was the center of the universe , but this made it very difficult to explain the orbits of the other planets .
This problem had been considered by Eudoxus , Apollonius , and Hipparchus , who developed a very complicated geocentric model involving concentric spheres and epicycles .
Ptolemy perfected ( or , rather , complicated ) this model even further , introducing ' equants ' to further fine - tune the orbital speeds ; this model was the standard for 14 centuries .
While some Greeks , notably Aristarchus and Seleucus , proposed heliocentric models , these were usually rejected due to the lack of parallax among stars , and the lack of the ferocious winds that might be expected if the Earth were in motion .
( However some historians believe that many ancient Greek scholars , perhaps including Plato , accepted the possibility of Earth 's motion , and that geocentrism became dogma only after Ptolemy 's work . )
Aristarchus guessed that the stars were at an almost unimaginable distance , explaining the lack of parallax .
Aristarchus would be almost unknown except that Archimedes mentions , and assumes , Aristarchus ' heliocentrism in The Sand Reckoner .
I suspect that Archimedes accepted heliocentrism , but thought saying so openly would distract from his work .
Several thinkers proposed a hybrid system with Mercury and Venus rotating the Sun but the outer planets and the Sun itself rotating Earth ; these thinkers may have included ancient Egyptians , the Greek Heraclides of Pontus , some of the Islamic scientists , a member of Madhava 's Kerala school , and Tycho Brahe -- the astronomer who linked Copernicus to Kepler .
A related question is : Does the Earth spin daily on its axis ?
All heliocentrists , beginning with Heraclides of Pontus , seem to have accepted that , as well as some who were more doubtful about the Earth 's annual orbit .
Another related question is :
Is the universe finite , or is it infinite ?
Democritus , Seleucus , Nicholas of Cusa and Giordano Bruno were four who proposed an infinite universe prior to Galileo .
Hipparchus was another ancient Greek who considered heliocentrism but , because he never guessed that orbits were ellipses rather than cascaded circles , was unable to come up with a heliocentric model that fit his data .
Aryabhata , Alhazen , Alberuni , Omar Khayyám , ( perhaps some other Islamic mathematicians like al - Tusi ) , Regiomontanus , and Leonardo da Vinci are other great pre-Copernican mathematicians who may have accepted the possibility of heliocentrism .
Another reason to doubt that the Earth moves , is that we do n't feel that motion , or see its effect on falling bodies .
This difficulty , which almost disappears once Newton 's First Law of Motion is accepted , was addressed before Newton by Jean Buridan , Nicole Oresme , Giordano Bruno , Pierre Gassendi ( 1592-1655 ) and , of course , Galileo Galilei .
The great skill demonstrated by Ptolemy and his predecessors in developing their complex geocentric cosmology may have set back science since in fact the Earth rotates around the Sun .
The geocentric models could n't explain the observed changes in the brightness of Mars or Venus , but it was the phases of Venus , discovered by Galileo after the invention of the telescope , that finally led to general acceptance of heliocentrism .
( Ptolemy 's model predicted phases , but timed quite differently from Galileo 's observations . )
Since the planets move without friction , their motions offer a pure view of the Laws of Motion ; this is one reason that the heliocentric breakthroughs of Copernicus , Kepler and Newton triggered the advances in mathematical physics which led to the Scientific Revolution .
Heliocentrism offered an even more key understanding that lead to massive change in scientific thought .
For Ptolemy and other geocentrists , the " fixed " stars were just lights on a sphere rotating around the earth , but after the Copernican Revolution the fixed stars were understood to be immensely far away ; this made it possible to imagine that they were themselves suns , perhaps with planets of their own .
( Nicole Oresme and Nicholas of Cusa were pre-Copernican thinkers who wrote on both the geocentric question and the possibility of other worlds . )
The Copernican perspective led Giordano Bruno and Galileo to posit a single common set of physical laws which ruled both on Earth and in the Heavens .
( It was this , rather than just the happenstance of planetary orbits , that eventually most outraged the Roman Church ....
But we 're getting way ahead of our story : Copernicus , Bruno , Galileo and Kepler lived 14 centuries after Ptolemy . )
Liu Hui ( ca 220-280 ) China
Liu Hui made major improvements to Chang 's influential textbook Nine Chapters , making him among the most important of Chinese mathematicians ever .
( He seems to have been a much better mathematician than Chang , but just as Newton might have gotten nowhere without Kepler , Vieta , Huygens , Fermat , Wallis , Cavalieri , etc. , so Liu Hui might have achieved little had Chang not preserved the ancient Chinese learnings . )
Among Liu's achievements are an emphasis on generalizations and proofs , incorporation of negative numbers into arithmetic , an early recognition of the notions of infinitesimals and limits , the Gaussian elimination method of solving simultaneous linear equations , calculations of solid volumes ( including the use of Cavalieri 's Principle ) , anticipation of Horner 's Method , and a new method to calculate square roots .
Like Archimedes , Liu discovered the formula for a circle 's area ; however he failed to calculate a sphere 's volume , writing " Let us leave this problem to whoever can tell the truth . "
Although it was almost child 's - play for any of them , Archimedes , Apollonius , and Hipparchus had all improved precision of π's estimate .
It seems fitting that Liu Hui did join that select company of record setters :
He developed a recurrence formula for regular polygons allowing arbitrarily - close approximations for π .
He also devised an interpolation formula to simplify that calculation ; this yielded the " good - enough " value 3.1416 , which is still taught today in primary schools .
( Liu 's successors in China included Zu Chongzhi , who did determine sphere 's volume , and whose approximation for π held the accuracy record for nine centuries . )
Diophantus of Alexandria ( ca 250 ) Greece , Egypt
Diophantus was one of the most influential mathematicians of antiquity ; he wrote several books on arithmetic and algebra , and explored number theory further than anyone earlier .
He advanced a rudimentary arithmetic and algebraic notation , allowed rational - number solutions to his problems rather than just integers , and was aware of results like the Brahmagupta - Fibonacci Identity ; for these reasons he is often called the " Father of Algebra . "
His work , however , may seem quite limited to a modern eye : his methods were not generalized , he knew nothing of negative numbers , and , though he often dealt with quadratic equations , never seems to have commented on their second solution .
His notation , clumsy as it was , was used for many centuries .
( The shorthand x3 for " x cubed " was not invented until Descartes . )
Very little is known about Diophantus ( he might even have come from Babylonia , whose algebraic ideas he borrowed ) .
Many of his works have been lost , including proofs for lemmas cited in the surviving work , some of which are so difficult it would almost stagger the imagination to believe Diophantus really had proofs .
Among these are Fermat 's conjecture ( Lagrange 's theorem ) that every integer is the sum of four squares , and the following : " Given any positive rationals a , b with a>b , there exist positive rationals c , d such that a 3 - b3 = c3+d3 . "
( This latter " lemma " was investigated by Vieta and Fermat and finally solved , with some difficulty , in the 19th century .
It seems unlikely that Diophantus actually had proofs for such " lemmas . " )
Pappus of Alexandria ( ca 300 ) Egypt , Greece
Pappus , along with Diophantus , may have been one of the two greatest Western mathematicians during the 13 centuries that separated Hipparchus and Fibonacci .
He wrote about arithmetic methods , plane and solid geometry , the axiomatic method , celestial motions and mechanics .
In addition to his own original research , his texts are noteworthy for preserving works of earlier mathematicians that would otherwise have been lost .
Pappus ' best and most original result , and the one which gave him most pride , may be the Pappus Centroid theorems ( fundamental , difficult and powerful theorems of solid geometry later rediscovered by Paul Guldin ) .
His other ingenious geometric theorems include Desargues ' Homology Theorem ( which Pappus attributes to Euclid ) , an early form of Pascal 's Hexagram Theorem , called Pappus ' Hexagon Theorem and related to a fundamental theorem :
Two projective pencils can always be brought into a perspective position .
For these theorems , Pappus is sometimes called the " Father of Projective Geometry . "
Pappus also demonstrated how to perform angle trisection and cube doubling if one can use mechanical curves like a conchoid or hyperbola .
He stated ( but did n't prove ) the Isoperimetric Theorem , also writing " Bees know this fact which is useful to them , that the hexagon ... will hold more honey for the same material than [ a square or triangle ] . "
( That a honeycomb partition minimizes material for an equal - area partitioning was finally proved in 1999 by Thomas Hales , who also proved the related Kepler Conjecture . )
Pappus stated , but did not fully solve , the Problem of Pappus which , given an arbitrary collection of lines in the plane , asks for the locus of points whose distances to the lines have a certain relationship .
This problem was a major inspiration for Descartes and was finally fully solved by Newton .
For preserving the teachings of Euclid and Apollonius , as well as his own theorems of geometry , Pappus certainly belongs on a list of great ancient mathematicians .
But these teachings lay dormant during Europe 's Dark Ages , diminishing Pappus ' historical significance .
Mathematicians after Classical Greece
Alexander the Great spread Greek culture to Egypt and much of the Orient ; thus even Hindu mathematics may owe something to the Greeks .
Greece was eventually absorbed into the Roman Empire ( with Archimedes himself famously killed by a Roman soldier ) .
Rome did not pursue pure science as Greece had ( as we 've seen , the important mathematicians of the Roman era were based in the Hellenic East ) and eventually Europe fell into a Dark Age .
The Greek emphasis on pure mathematics and proofs was key to the future of mathematics , but they were missing an even more important catalyst : a decimal place - value system based on zero and nine other symbols .
Decimal system -- from India ?
China ??
Persia ???
Laplace called the decimal system " a profound and important idea [ given by India ] which appears so simple to us now that we ignore its true merit ... in the first rank of useful inventions [ but ] it escaped the genius of Archimedes and Apollonius . "
But even after Fibonacci introduced the system to Europe , it was another 400 years before it came into common use .
Ancient Greeks , by the way , did not use the unwieldy Roman numerals , but rather used 27 symbols , denoting 1 to 9 , 10 to 90 , and 100 to 900 .
Unlike our system , with ten digits separate from the alphabet , the 27 Greek number symbols were the same as their alphabet 's letters ; this might have hindered the development of " syncopated " notation .
The most ancient Hindu records did not use the ten digits of Aryabhata , but rather a system similar to that of the ancient Greeks , suggesting that China , and not India , may indeed be the " ultimate " source of the modern decimal system .
The Chinese used a form of decimal abacus as early as 3000 BC ; if it does n't qualify , by itself , as a " decimal system " then pictorial depictions of its numbers would .
Yet for thousands of years after its abacus , China had no zero symbol other than plain space ; and apparently did n't have one until after the Hindus .
Ancient Persians and Mayans did have place - value notation with zero symbols , but neither qualify as inventing a base - 10 decimal system : Persia used the base - 60 Babylonian system ; Mayans used base - 20 .
( Another difference is that the Hindus had nine distinct digit symbols to go with their zero , while earlier place - value systems built up from just two symbols : 1 and either 5 or 10 . )
The Old Kingdom Egyptians did use a base - ten system , but it was similar to that of Greece and Vedic India : 1 , 10 , 100 were depicted as separate symbols .
Conclusion :
The decimal place - value system with zero symbol seems to be an obvious invention that in fact was very hard to invent .
If you insist on a single winner then India might be it .
But China , Babylonia , Persia and even the Mayans deserve Honorable Mention !
Aryabhata ( 476-550 ) Ashmaka & Kusumapura ( India )
Indian mathematicians excelled for thousands of years , and eventually even developed advanced techniques like Taylor series before Europeans did , but they are denied credit because of Western ascendancy .
Among the Hindu mathematicians , Aryabhata ( called Arjehir by Arabs ) may be most famous .
While Europe was in its early " Dark Age , " Aryabhata advanced arithmetic , algebra , elementary analysis , and especially plane and spherical trigonometry , using the decimal system .
Aryabhata is sometimes called the " Father of Algebra " instead of al - Khowârizmi ( who himself cites the work of Aryabhata ) .
His most famous accomplishment in mathematics was the Aryabhata Algorithm ( connected to continued fractions ) for solving Diophantine equations .
Aryabhata made several important discoveries in astronomy , e.g. the nature of moonlight , and concept of sidereal year ; his estimate of the Earth 's circumference was more accurate than any achieved in ancient Greece .
He was among the very few ancient scholars who realized the Earth rotated daily on an axis ; claims that he also espoused heliocentric orbits are controversial , but may be confirmed by the writings of al - Biruni .
Aryabhata is said to have introduced the constant e.
He used π ≈ 3.1416 ; it is unclear whether he discovered this independently or borrowed it from Liu Hui of China .
Although it was first discovered by Nicomachus three centuries earlier , Aryabhata is famous for the identity
Σ ( k3 ) = ( Σ k) 2
Some of Aryabhata 's achievements , e.g. an excellent approximation to the sine function , are known only from the writings of Bhaskara I , who wrote : " Aryabhata is the master who , after reaching the furthest shores and plumbing the inmost depths of the sea of ultimate knowledge of mathematics , kinematics and spherics , handed over the three sciences to the learned world . "
Brahmagupta ` Bhillamalacarya ' ( 589 -668 ) Rajasthan ( India )
No one person gets unique credit for the invention of the decimal system but Brahmagupta 's textbook Brahmasphutasiddhanta was very influential , and is sometimes considered the first textbook " to treat zero as a number in its own right . "
It also treated negative numbers .
( Others claim these were first seen 800 years earlier in Chang Tshang 's Chinese text and were implicit in what survives of earlier Hindu works , but Brahmagupta 's text discussed them lucidly . )
Along with Diophantus , Brahmagupta was also among the first to express equations with symbols rather than words .
Brahmagupta Bhillamalacarya ( ` The Teacher from Bhillamala ' ) made great advances in arithmetic , algebra , numeric analysis , and geometry .
Several theorems bear his name , including the formula for the area of a cyclic quadrilateral :
16 A2 = ( a+b+c-d ) ( a+b-c+d ) ( a- b+c+d ) ( - a+b+c+d )
Another famous Brahmagupta theorem dealing with such quadrilaterals can be phrased " In a circle , if the chords AB and CD are perpendicular and intersect at E , then the line from E which bisects AC will be perpendicular to BD . "
He also began the study of rational quadrilaterals which Kummer would eventually complete .
Proving Brahmagupta 's theorems are good challenges even today .
In addition to his famous writings on practical mathematics and his ingenious theorems of geometry , Brahmagupta solved the general quadratic equation , and worked on number theory problems .
He was first to find a general solution to the simplest Diophantine form .
His work on Pell 's equations has been called " brilliant " and " marvelous . "
He proved the Brahmagupta - Fibonacci Identity ( the set of sums of two squares is closed under multiplication ) , and generalized it further to assist in the Pell 's solutions .
He applied mathematics to astronomy , predicting eclipses , etc .
Bháskara I ( 600 ? - 680 ? ) Saurastra ( India )
The astronomer Bháskara I , who takes the suffix " I " to distinguish him from the more famous Bháskara who lived five centuries later , made key advances to the positional decimal number notation , and was the first known to use the zero symbol .
He preserved some of the teachings of Aryabhata which would otherwise have been lost ; these include a famous formula giving an excellent approximation to the sin function , as well as , probably , the zero symbol itself .
Among other original contributions to mathematics , Bháskara I was first to state Wilson 's Theorem ( which should perhaps be called Bháskara 's Conjecture ) :
( n - 1 ) ! ≡ - 1 ( mod n ) if and only if n is prime
Bháskara 's Conjecture was rediscovered by Alhazen , Fibonacci , Leibniz and Wilson .
The " only if " is easy but the difficult " if " part was finally proved by Lagrange in 1771 .
Since Lagrange has so many other Theorems named after him , Bháskara 's Conjecture is always called " Wilson 's Theorem . "
Muhammed ` Abu Jafar ' ibn Musâ al - Khowârizmi ( ca 780 - 850 ) Khorasan ( Uzbekistan ) , Iraq
Al - Khowârizmi ( aka Mahomet ibn Moses ) was a Persian who worked as a mathematician , astronomer and geographer early in the Golden Age of Islamic science .
He introduced the Hindu decimal system to the Islamic world and Europe ; invented the horary quadrant ; improved the sundial ; developed trigonometry tables ; and improved on Ptolemy 's astronomy and geography .
He wrote the book Al - Jabr , which demonstrated simple algebra and geometry , and several other influential books .
Unlike Diophantus ' work , which dealt in specific examples , Al - Khowârizmi was the first algebra text to present general methods ; he is often called the " Father of Algebra . "
( Diophantus did , however , use superior " syncopated " notation . )
The word algorithm is borrowed from Al - Khowârizmi's name , and algebra is taken from the name of his book .
He also coined the word cipher , which became English zero ( although this was just a translation from the Sanskrit word for zero introduced by Aryabhata ) .
He was an essential pioneer for Islamic science , and for the many Arab and Persian mathematicians who followed ; and hence also for Europe 's eventual Renaissance which was heavily dependent on Islamic teachings .
Al - Khowârizmi's texts on algebra and decimal arithmetic are considered to be among the most influential writings ever .
Ya'qub ` Abu Yusuf ' ibn Ishaq al - Kindi ( 803 - 873 ) Iraq
Al - Kindi ( called Alkindus or Achindus in the West ) wrote on diverse philosophical subjects , physics , optics , astronomy , music , psychology , medicine , chemistry , and more .
He invented pharmaceutical methods , perfumes , and distilling of alcohol .
In mathematics , he popularized the use of the decimal system , developed spherical geometry , wrote on many other topics and was a pioneer of cryptography ( code - breaking ) .
( His work with code - breaking also made him a pioneer in basic concepts of probability . )
( Al - Kindi , called The Arab Philosopher , can not be considered among the greatest of mathematicians , but was one of the most influential general scientists between Aristotle and da Vinci . )
He appears on Cardano 's List of 12 Greatest Geniuses .
( Al - Khowârizmi and Jabir ibn Aflah are the other Islamic scientists on that list . )
Al - Sabi Thabit ibn Qurra al - Harrani ( 836-901 )
Harran , Iraq
Thabit produced important books in philosophy ( including perhaps the famous mystic work De Imaginibus ) , medicine , mechanics , astronomy , and especially several mathematical fields : analysis , non-Euclidean geometry , trigonometry , arithmetic , number theory .
As well as being an original thinker , Thabit was a key translator of ancient Greek writings ; he translated Archimedes ' otherwise - lost Book of Lemmas and applied one of its methods to construct a regular heptagon .
He developed an important new cosmology superior to Ptolemy 's ( and which , though it was not heliocentric , may have inspired Copernicus ) .
He was perhaps the first great mathematician to take the important step of emphasizing real numbers rather than either rational numbers or geometric sizes .
He worked in plane and spherical trigonometry , and with cubic equations .
He was an early practitioner of calculus and seems to have been first to take the integral of √x .
Like Archimedes , he was able to calculate the area of an ellipse , and to calculate the volume of a paraboloid .
He produced an elegant generalization of the Pythagorean Theorem :
AC 2 + BC 2 = AB ( AR + BS )
( Here the triangle ABC is not a right triangle , but R and S are located on AB to give the equal angles ACB = ARC = BSC . )
Thabit also worked in number theory where he is especially famous for his theorem about amicable numbers .
( Thabit ibn Qurra 's Theorem was rediscovered by Fermat and Descartes , and later generalized by Euler . )
While many of his discoveries in geometry , plane and spherical trigonometry , and analysis ( parabola quadrature , trigonometric law , principle of lever ) duplicated work by Archimedes and Pappus , Thabit 's list of novel achievements is impressive .
Among the several great and famous Baghdad geometers , Thabit may have had the greatest genius .
Ibrahim ibn Sinan ibn Thabit ibn Qurra ( 908-946 ) Iraq
Ibn Sinan , grandson of Thabit ibn Qurra , was one of the greatest Islamic mathematicians and might have surpassed his famous grandfather had he not died at a young age .
He was an early pioneer of analytic geometry , advancing the theory of integration , applying algebra to synthetic geometry , and writing on the construction of conic sections .
He produced a new proof of Archimedes ' famous formula for the area of a parabolic section .
He worked on the theory of area - preserving transformations , with applications to map - making .
He also advanced astronomical theory , and wrote a treatise on sundials .
Mohammed ibn al - Hasn ( Alhazen ) ` Abu Ali ' ibn al - Haytham al - Basra ( 965-1039 ) Iraq , Egypt
Al - Hassan ibn al - Haytham ( Alhazen ) made contributions to math , optics , and astronomy which eventually influenced Roger Bacon , Regiomontanus , da Vinci , Copernicus , Kepler , Galileo , Huygens , Descartes and Wallis , thus affecting Europe 's Scientific Revolution .
While Aristotle thought vision arose from rays sent from the eye to the viewed object , and Ptolemy thought light rays originated from objects , Alhazen understand that an object 's light is reflected sunlight .
He 's been called the best scientist of the Middle Ages ; his Book of Optics has been called the most important physics text prior to Newton ; his writings in physics anticipate the Principle of Least Action , Newton 's First Law of Motion , and the notion that white light is composed of the color spectrum .
( Like Newton , he favored a particle theory of light over the wave theory of Aristotle . )
His other achievements in optics include improved lens design , an analysis of the camera obscura , Snell 's Law , an early explanation for the rainbow , a correct deduction from refraction of atmospheric thickness , and experiments on visual perception .
He studied optical illusions and was first to explain psychologically why the Moon appears to be larger when near the horizon .
He also did work in human anatomy and medicine .
( In a famous leap of over - confidence he claimed he could control the Nile River ; when the Caliph ordered him to do so , he then had to feign madness ! )
Alhazen has been called the " Father of Modern Optics , " the " Founder of Experimental Psychology " ( mainly for his work with optical illusions ) , and , because he emphasized hypotheses and experiments , " The First Scientist . "
In number theory , Alhazen worked with perfect numbers , Mersenne primes , and the Chinese Remainder Theorem .
He stated Wilson 's Theorem ( which is sometimes called Al - Haytham 's Theorem ) .
Alhazen introduced the Power Series Theorem ( later attributed to Jacob Bernoulli ) .
His best mathematical work was with plane and solid geometry , especially conic sections ; he calculated the areas of lunes , volumes of paraboloids , and constructed a regular heptagon using intersecting parabolas .
He solved Alhazen 's Billiard Problem ( originally posed as a problem in mirror design ) , a difficult construction which continued to intrigue several great mathematicians including Huygens .
To solve it , Alhazen needed to anticipate Descartes ' analytic geometry , anticipate Bézout 's Theorem , tackle quartic equations and develop a rudimentary integral calculus .
Alhazen 's attempts to prove the Parallel Postulate make him ( along with Thabit ibn Qurra ) one of the earliest mathematicians to investigate non-Euclidean geometry .
Abu al - Rayhan Mohammed ibn Ahmad al - Biruni ( 973-1048 ) Khorasan ( Uzbekistan )
Al - Biruni ( Alberuni ) was an extremely outstanding scholar , far ahead of his time , sometimes shown with Alkindus and Alhazen as one of the greatest Islamic polymaths , and sometimes compared to Leonardo da Vinci .
He is less famous in part because he lived in a remote part of the Islamic empire .
He was a great linguist ; studied the original works of Greeks and Hindus ; is famous for debates with his contemporary Avicenna ; studied history , biology , mineralogy , philosophy , sociology , medicine and more ; is called the Father of Geodesy and the Father of Arabic Pharmacy ; and was one of the greatest astronomers .
He was an early advocate of the Scientific Method .
He was also noted for his poetry .
He invented ( but did n't build ) a geared - astrolabe clock , and worked with springs and hydrostatics .
He wrote prodigiously on all scientific topics ( his writings are estimated to total 13,000 folios ) ; he was especially noted for his comprehensive encyclopedia about India , and Shadows , which starts from notions about shadows but develops much astronomy and mathematics .
He anticipated future advances including Darwin 's natural selection , Newton 's Second Law , the immutability of elements , the nature of the Milky Way , and much modern geology .
Among several novel achievements in astronomy , he used observations of lunar eclipse to deduce relative longitude , estimated Earth 's radius most accurately , believed the Earth rotated on its axis and may have accepted heliocentrism as a possibility .
In mathematics , he was first to apply the Law of Sines to astronomy , geodesy , and cartography ; anticipated the notion of polar coordinates ; invented the azimuthal equidistant map projection in common use today , as well as a polyconic method now called the Nicolosi Globular Projection ; found trigonometric solutions to polynomial equations ; did geometric constructions including angle trisection ; and wrote on arithmetic , algebra , and combinatorics as well as plane and spherical trigonometry and geometry .
( Al - Biruni 's contemporary Avicenna was not particularly a mathematician but deserves mention as an advancing scientist , as does Avicenna 's disciple Abu'l - Barakat al - Baghdada , who lived about a century later . )
Al - Biruni has left us what seems to be the oldest surviving mention of the Broken Chord Theorem ( if M is the midpoint of circular arc ABMC , and T the midpoint of " broken chord " ABC , then MT is perpendicular to BC ) .
Although he himself attributed the theorem to Archimedes , Al - Biruni provided several novel proofs for , and useful corollaries of , this famous geometric gem .
While Al - Biruni may lack the influence and mathematical brilliance to qualify for the Top 100 , he deserves recognition as one of the greatest applied mathematicians before the modern era .
Omar al - Khayyám ( 1048 - 1123 ) Persia
Omar Khayyám ( aka Ghiyas od - Din Abol - Fath Omar ibn Ebrahim Khayyam Neyshaburi ) was one of the greatest Islamic mathematicians .
He did clever work with geometry , developing an alternate to Euclid 's Parallel Postulate and then deriving the parallel result using theorems based on the Khayyam - Saccheri quadrilateral .
He derived solutions to cubic equations using the intersection of conic sections with circles .
Remarkably , he stated that the cubic solution could not be achieved with straightedge and compass , a fact that would n't be proved until the 19th century .
Khayyám did even more important work in algebra , writing an influential textbook , and developing new solutions for various higher - degree equations .
He may have been first to develop Pascal 's Triangle ( which is still called Khayyám 's Triangle in Persia ) , along with the essential Binomial Theorem ( Al - Khayyám 's Formula ) : ( x+y ) n = n!
Σ xkyn-k / k!( n-k ) !
Khayyám was also an important astronomer ; he measured the year far more accurately than ever before , improved the Persian calendar , built a famous star map , and believed that the Earth rotates on its axis .
He was a polymath : in addition to being a philosopher of far - ranging scope , he also wrote treatises on music , mechanics and natural science .
He was noted for deriving his theories from science rather than religion .
Despite his great achievements in algebra , geometry , astronomy , and philosophy , today Omar al - Khayyám is most famous for his rich poetry ( The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyám ) .
Bháscara ( II ) Áchárya ( 1114 - 1185 ) India
Bháscara II ( also called Bhaskaracharya ) may have been the greatest of the Hindu mathematicians .
He made achievements in several fields of mathematics including some Europe would n't learn until the time of Euler .
His textbooks dealt with many matters , including solid geometry and advanced arithmetic methods ; and are the first texts to present clearly the formulae to enumerate combinations and permutations .
He was also an astronomer .
( It is sometimes claimed that his equations for planetary motions anticipated the Laws of Motion discovered by Kepler and Newton , but this claim is doubtful . )
In algebra , he solved various equations including 2nd - order Diophantine , quartic , Brouncker 's and Pell 's equations .
His Chakravala method , an early application of mathematical induction to solve 2nd - order equations , has been called " the finest thing achieved in the theory of numbers before Lagrange " ( although a similar statement was made about one of Fibonacci 's theorems ) .
( Earlier Hindus , including Brahmagupta , contributed to this method . )
In several ways he anticipated calculus : he used Rolle 's Theorem ; he may have been first to use the fact that dsin x = cos x · dx ; and he once wrote that multiplication by 0/0 could be " useful in astronomy . "
In trigonometry , which he valued for its own beauty as well as practical applications , he developed spherical trig and was first to present the identity
sin a+b = sin a · cos b + sin b · cos a Bháscara 's achievements came centuries before similar discoveries in Europe .
It is an open riddle of history whether any of Bháscara 's teachings trickled into Europe in time to influence its Scientific Renaissance .
Leonardo ` Bigollo ' Pisano ( Fibonacci ) ( ca 1170 - 1245 ) Italy
Leonardo ( known today as Fibonacci ) introduced the decimal system and other new methods of arithmetic to Europe , and relayed the mathematics of the Hindus , Persians , and Arabs .
Others , especially Gherard of Cremona , had translated Islamic mathematics , e.g. the works of al - Khowârizmi , into Latin , but Leonardo was the influential teacher .
( Two centuries earlier , the mathematician - Pope , Gerbert of Aurillac , had tried unsuccessfully to introduce the decimal system to Europe . )
Leonardo also re-introduced older Greek ideas like Mersenne numbers and Diophantine equations .
His writings cover a very broad range including new theorems of geometry , methods to construct and convert Egyptian fractions ( which were still in wide use ) , irrational numbers , the Chinese Remainder Theorem , theorems about Pythagorean triplets , and the series 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , .... which is now linked with the name Fibonacci .
In addition to his great historic importance and fame ( he was a favorite of Emperor Frederick II ) , Leonardo ` Fibonacci ' is called " the greatest number theorist between Diophantus and Fermat " and " the most talented mathematician of the Middle Ages . "
Leonardo is most famous for his book Liber Abaci , but his Liber Quadratorum provides the best demonstration of his skill .
He defined congruums and proved theorems about them , including a theorem establishing the conditions for three square numbers to be in consecutive arithmetic series ; this has been called the finest work in number theory prior to Fermat ( although a similar statement was made about one of Bhaskara II 's theorems ) .
Although often overlooked , this work includes a proof of the n = 4 case of Fermat 's Last Theorem .
( Leonardo 's proof of FLT4 is widely ignored or considered incomplete .
I 'm preparing a page to consider that question .
Al - Farisi was another ancient mathematician who noted FLT4 , although attempting no proof . )
Another of Leonardo 's noteworthy achievements was proving that the roots of a certain cubic equation could not have any of the constructible forms Euclid had outlined in Book 10 of his Elements .
He also wrote on , but did n't prove , Wilson 's Theorem .
Leonardo provided Europe with the decimal system , algebra and the ' lattice ' method of multiplication , all far superior to the methods then in use .
He introduced notation like 3/5 ; his clever extension of this for quantities like 5 yards , 2 feet , and 3 inches is more efficient than today 's notation .
It seems hard to believe but before the decimal system , mathematicians had no notation for zero .
Referring to this system , Gauss was later to exclaim " To what heights would science now be raised if Archimedes had made that discovery ! "
Some histories describe him as bringing Islamic mathematics to Europe , but in Fibonacci 's own preface to Liber Abaci , he specifically credits the Hindus : ... as a consequence of marvelous instruction in the art , to the nine digits of the Hindus , the knowledge of the art very much appealed to me before all others , and for it I realized that all its aspects were studied in Egypt , Syria , Greece , Sicily , and Provence , with their varying methods ;
...
But all this even , and the algorism , as well as the art of Pythagoras , I considered as almost a mistake in respect to the method of the Hindus .
Therefore , embracing more stringently that method of the Hindus , and taking stricter pains in its study , while adding certain things from my own understanding and inserting also certain things from the niceties of Euclid 's geometric art , I have striven to compose this book in its entirety as understandably as I could , ...
Had the Scientific Renaissance begun in the Islamic Empire , someone like al - Khowârizmi would have greater historic significance than Fibonacci , but the Renaissance did happen in Europe .
Liber Abaci 's summary of the decimal system has been called " the most important sentence ever written . "
Even granting this to be an exaggeration , there is no doubt that the Scientific Revolution owes a huge debt to Leonardo ` Fibonacci ' Pisano .
Abu Jafar Muhammad Nasir al - Din al - Tusi ( 1201 - 1274 ) Persia
Al - Tusi was one of the greatest Islamic polymaths , working in theology , ethics , logic , astronomy , and other fields of science .
He was a famous scholar and prolific writer , describing evolution of species , stating that the Milky Way was composed of stars , and mentioning conservation of mass in his writings on chemistry .
He made a wide range of contributions to astronomy , and ( along with Omar Khayyám ) was one of the most significant astronomers between Ptolemy and Copernicus .
He improved on the Ptolemaic model of planetary orbits , and even wrote about ( though rejecting ) the possibility of heliocentrism .
( Allegedly one of his students hypothesized elliptical orbits . )
Tusi is most famous for his mathematics .
He advanced algebra , arithmetic , geometry , trigonometry , and even foundations , working with real numbers and lengths of curves .
For his texts and theorems , he may be called the " Father of Trigonometry ; " he was first to properly state and prove several theorems of planar and spherical trigonometry including the Law of Sines , and the ( spherical ) Law of Tangents .
He wrote important commentaries on works of earlier Greek and Islamic mathematicians ; he attempted to prove Euclid 's Parallel Postulate .
Tusi 's writings influenced European mathematicians including Wallis ; his revisions of the Ptolemaic model led him to the Tusi- couple , a special case of trochoids usually called Copernicus '
Theorem , though historians have concluded Copernicus discovered this theorem by reading Tusi .
Qin Jiushao ( 1202 - 1261 ) China
There were several important Chinese mathematicians in the 13th century , of whom Qin Jiushao ( Ch'in Chiu - Shao ) may have had particularly outstanding breadth and genius .
Qin 's textbook discusses various algebraic procedures , includes word problems requiring quartic or quintic equations , explains a version of Horner 's Method for finding solutions to such equations , includes Heron 's Formula for a triangle 's area , and introduces the zero symbol and decimal fractions .
Qin's work on the Chinese Remainder Theorem was very impressive , finding solutions in cases which later stumped Euler .
Other great Chinese mathematicians of that era are Li Zhi , Yang Hui ( Pascal 's Triangle is still called Yang Hui's Triangle in China ) , and Zhu Shiejie .
Their teachings did not make their way to Europe , but were read by the Japanese mathematician Seki , and possibly by Islamic mathematicians like Al - Kashi .
Although Qin was a soldier and governor noted for corruption , with mathematics just a hobby , I 've chosen him to represent this group because of the key advances which appear first in his writings .
Zhu Shiejie ( ca 1265-1303 + )
China
Zhu Shiejie ( Chu Shih - Chieh ) was more famous and influential than Qin ; historian George Sarton called him " one of the greatest mathematicians ... of all time . "
His book Jade Mirror of the Four Unknowns studied multivariate polynomials and is considered the best mathematics in ancient China and describes methods not rediscovered for centuries ; for example Zhu anticipated the Sylvester matrix method for solving simultaneous polynomial equations .
Kamal al - Din Abu'l Hasan Muhammad Al - Farisi ( 1267-1319 ) Iran
Al - Farisi was a student of al - Shirazi who in turn was a student of al - Tusi .
He and al - Shirazi are especially noted for the first correct explanation of the rainbow .
Al - Farisi made several other corrections in his comprehensive commentary on Alhazen 's textbook on optics .
Al - Farisi made several contributions to number theory .
He improved Thabit 's theorem about amicable numbers , made important new observations about the binomial coefficients , and noted the N=4 case of Fermat 's Last Theorem .
In addition to his work with amicable numbers , he is especially noted for his improved proof of Euclid 's Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic .
Levi ben Gerson ` Gersonides ' ( 1288 -1344 ? )
France
Gersonides ( aka Leo de Bagnols , aka RaLBaG ) was a Jewish scholar of great renown , preferring science and reason over religious orthodoxy .
He wrote important commentaries on Aristotle , Euclid , the Talmud , and the Bible ; he is most famous for his book MilHamot Adonai ( " The Wars of the Lord " ) which touches on many theological questions .
He was likely the most talented scientist of his time : he invented the " Jacob 's Staff " which became an important navigation tool ; described the principles of the camera obscura ; etc .
In mathematics , Gersonides wrote texts on trigonometry , calculation of cube roots , rules of arithmetic , etc. ; and gave rigorous derivations of rules of combinatorics .
He was first to make explicit use of mathematical induction .
At that time , " harmonic numbers " referred to integers with only 2 and 3 as prime factors ; Gersonides solved a problem of music theory with an ingenious proof that there were no consecutive harmonic numbers larger than ( 8,9 ) .
( In fact , ( 2^3,3^2 ) is the only pair of consecutive powers ; this is Catalan 's Conjecture and was first proved in the 21st century . )
Levi ben Gerson published only in Hebrew so , although some of his work was translated into Latin during his lifetime , his influence was limited ; much of his work was re-invented three centuries later ; and many histories of math overlook him altogether .
Gersonides was also an outstanding astronomer .
He proved that the fixed stars were at a huge distance , and found other flaws in the Ptolemaic model .
But he specifically rejected heliocentrism , noteworthy since it implies that heliocentrism was under consideration at the time .
Nicole Oresme ( ca 1322-1382 ) France
Oresme was of lowly birth but excelled at school , became a young professor , and soon personal chaplain to King Charles V. ( One of his early teachers was Jean Buridan ( ca 1300 - ca 1358 ) , famous for positing what became Newton 's First Law of Motion , contrary to Aristotelian dogma . )
The King commissioned him to translate the works of Aristotle into French ( with Oresme thus playing key roles in the development of both French science and French language ) , and rewarded him by making him a Bishop .
His contributions to political science ( on human rights and popular monarchy ) influenced King Charles V .
He wrote several books ; was a renowned philosopher and natural scientist ( challenging several of Aristotle 's ideas ) ; he contributed to economics ( e.g. anticipating Gresham 's Law ) and to optics ( he was first to posit curved refraction ) .
Although the Earth 's annual orbit around the Sun was left to Copernicus , Oresme was among the pre-Copernican thinkers to claim clearly that the Earth spun daily on its axis .
In mathematics , Oresme observed that the integers were equinumerous with the odd integers ; was first to use fractional ( and even irrational ) exponents ; introduced the symbol + for addition ; was first to write about general curvature ; and , most famously , first to prove the divergence of the harmonic series .
Oresme used a graphical diagram to demonstrate the Merton College Theorem ( a discovery related to Galileo 's Law of Falling Bodies made by Thomas Bradwardine , et al ) ; it is said this was the first abstract graph .
( Some believe that this effort inspired Descartes ' coordinate geometry and Galileo . )
Oresme was aware of Gersonides ' work on harmonic numbers and was among those who attempted to link music theory to the ratios of celestial orbits , writing " the heavens are like a man who sings a melody and at the same time dances , thus making music ... in song and in action . "
Oresme 's work was influential ; with several discoveries ahead of his time , Oresme deserves to be better known .
Madhava of Sangamagramma ( 1340 - 1425 ) India
Madhava , also known as Irinjaatappilly Madhavan Namboodiri , founded the important Kerala school of mathematics and astronomy .
If everything credited to him was his own work , he was a truly great mathematician .
His analytic geometry preceded and surpassed Descartes ' , and included differentiation and integration .
Madhava also did work with continued fractions , trigonometry , and geometry .
He has been called the " Founder of Mathematical Analysis . "
Madhava is most famous for his work with Taylor series , discovering identities like sin q = q - q3/3 ! + q5/5 ! - ... , formulae for π , including the one attributed to Leibniz , and the then - best known approximation π ≈ 104348 / 33215 .
Despite the accomplishments of the Kerala school , Madhava probably does not deserve a place on our List .
There were several other great mathematicians who contributed to Kerala 's achievements , some of which were made 150 years after Madhava 's death .
More importantly , the work was not propagated outside Kerala , so had almost no effect on the development of mathematics .
Ghiyath al - Din Jamshid Mas'ud Al - Kashi ( ca 1380 - 1429 ) Iran , Transoxania ( Uzbekistan )
Al - Kashi was among the greatest calculators in the ancient world ; wrote important texts applying arithmetic and algebra to problems in astronomy , mensuration and accounting ; and developed trig tables far more accurate than earlier tables .
He worked with binomial coefficients , invented astronomical calculating machines , developed spherical trig , and is credited with various theorems of trigonometry including the Law of Cosines , which is sometimes called Al - Kashi's Theorem .
He is sometimes credited with the invention of decimal fractions ( though he worked mainly with sexagesimal fractions ) , and a method like Horner 's to calculate roots .
However decimal fractions had been used earlier , e.g. by Qin Jiushao ; and Al - Kashi 's root calculations may also have been derived from Chinese texts by Qin Jiushao or Zhu Shiejie .
Using his methods , al - Kashi calculated π correctly to 17 significant digits , breaking Madhava 's record .
( This record was subsequently broken by relative unknowns : a German ca. 1600 , John Machin 1706 .
In 1949 the π calculation record was held briefly by John von Neumann and the ENIAC . )
Nicholas Kryffs of Cusa ( 1401 - 1464 ) Palatinate , Italy
Nicholas Kryffs ( aka Nikolaus Cusanus ) was an astronomer and ordained priest .
His main work was in philosophy ( he wrote " All we know of the truth is that the absolute truth , such as it is , is beyond our reach " ) and theology ; but he also made proposals for scientific experimentation , e.g. the use of water - clocks to investigate the speed of falling bodies , and the use of weighing balances to quantify the transfer of mass from soil to growing plant .
Nicholas was also a mathematician : he wrote on geometric problems , calendar reform , and invented the Borda Count method of balloting ( although it is named after its 18th - century rediscoverer ) , but his work does n't qualify him for our list .
He belongs in our story because he deduced that the Earth orbited the Sun before Copernicus did , and made a deduction that Copernicus missed : that the universe is immensely huge or infinite ; and the fixed stars may have their own planets with their own life forms .
He was far ahead of his time , but his writings eventually influenced Galileo , Leibniz , and another mathematician - priest more famous than himself : Giordano Bruno , who wrote " If Nicholas [ of Cusa ] had not been hindered by his priest 's vestment , he would have even been greater than Pythagoras ! "
Johannes Müller von Königsberg ` Regiomontanus ' ( 1436 -1476 ) Bavaria , Italy
Regiomontanus was a prodigy who entered University at age eleven , studied under the influential Georg von Peuerbach , and eventually collaborated with him .
He was an important astronomer ; he found flaws in Ptolemy 's system ( thus influencing Copernicus ) , realized lunar observations could be used to determine longitude , and may have believed in heliocentrism .
His ephemeris was used by Columbus , when shipwrecked on Jamaica , to predict a lunar eclipse , thus dazzling the natives and perhaps saving his crew .
More importantly , Regiomontanus was one of the most influential mathematicians of the Middle Ages ; he published trigonometry textbooks and tables , as well as the best textbook on arithmetic and algebra of his time .
( Regiomontanus lived shortly after Gutenberg , and founded the first scientific press . )
He was a prodigious reader of Greek and Latin translations , and most of his results were copied from Greek works ( or indirectly from Arabic writers , especially Jabir ibn Aflah ) ; however he improved or reconstructed many of the proofs , and often presented solutions in both geometric and algebraic form .
His algebra was more symbolic and general than his predecessors ' ; he solved cubic equations ( though not the general case ) ; applied Chinese remainder methods , and worked in number theory .
He posed and solved a variety of clever geometric puzzles , including his famous angle maximization problem .
Regiomontanus was also an instrument maker , astrologer , and Catholic bishop .
He died in Rome where he had been called to advise the Pope on the calendar ; his early death may have delayed the needed reform until the time of Pope Gregory .
Leonardo da Vinci ( 1452 -1519 ) Italy
Leonardo da Vinci is most renowned for his paintings -- Mona Lisa and The Last Supper are among the most discussed and admired paintings ever -- but he did much other work and was probably the most talented , versatile and prolific polymath ever to live ; his writings exceed 13,000 folios .
He developed new techniques , and principles of perspective geometry , for drawing , painting and sculpture ; he was also an expert architect and engineer ; and surely the most prolific inventor of all time .
Although most of his paper designs were never built , Leonardo 's inventions include reflecting and refracting telescope , adding machine , parabolic compass , improved anemometer , parachute , helicopter , flying ornithopter , several war machines ( multi - barreled gun , steam - driven cannon , tank , giant crossbow , finned mortar shells , portable bridge ) , pumps , an accurate spring - operated clock , bobbin winder , robots , scuba gear , an elaborate musical instrument he called the ' viola organista , ' and more .
( Some of his designs , including the viola organista , his parachute , and a large single - span bridge , were finally built five centuries later ; and worked as intended . )
Like another genius ( Albert Einstein ) da Vinci was intrigued by the science of river meanders ; there is a meandering river in the background of Mona Lisa .
His scientific writings are much more extensive and thorough than is generally appreciated ; he made advances in anatomy , botany , and many other fields of science ; he developed much mechanics including the theory of the arch ; he developed an octant - based map projection ; he was first to concei

TEHRAN ( ISNA ) - Iran ’s UN ambassador Mohammad Khazaee called for the Security Council and other UN related bodies to show serious opposition to the US President ’s nuclear policies and his threat against an NPT signatory which does not hold nuclear weapon .
Following the US President Barack Obama ’s remarks that America will not restrict conditions of using nuclear weapons against Iran and North Korea , Khazaee sent a letter to the presidents of the UN Security Council Yukio Takasu and General Assembly Ali Treki and the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and said threats of the US officials against Iran are inhuman and go against international rules and commitments .
The full text of the letter follows :
In the Name of God , the Compassionate , the Merciful
No : 135 13 April 2010
Excellency ,
On 6 April 2010 , the United States government published its Nuclear Posture Review [ NPR ] which outlines the U.S. nuclear strategy and policy , and among others , contains groundless allegations against the peaceful nuclear program of the Islamic Republic of Iran .
Following the release of NPR , some high - ranking officials of the United States including the U.S. President and Secretaries of State and Defense , on the basis of wholly wrong assumption , have made public and implicit statements , threatening to use nuclear weapons against the Islamic Republic of Iran .
For instance , Secretary of Defense of the United States , in a news briefing held on 6 April 2010 at the Pentagon , asserted that “ the NPR has a very strong message for Iran … , because whether it ’s in declaratory policy or in other elements of the NPR , we essentially carve out states like Iran ….
And basically all options are on the table when it comes to countries in that category ” .
He added “ so , if there is a message for Iran here , it is that … all options are on the table in terms of how we deal with you . ”
In view of these developments , I would like to draw your kind attention to the following points :
1- Such inflammatory statements which are tantamount to nuclear blackmail against a non-nuclear - weapon State signatory to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) constitute a serious violation of the United States obligations and commitment , under international law , particularly Article 2 ( 4 ) of the Charter of the United Nations and also the provisions of the Security Council resolution 984 ( 1995 ) , to refrain from the threat or use of force against any State .
2- It is evident that these statements are not only declaration of intention but also part of official document which articulate the United States policy on first use of nuclear weapons , at its discretion , against a non-nuclear - weapon State Party to the NPT , and , therefore , pose a real threat to international peace and security and undermine the credibility of the NPT .
Such remarks by the U.S officials display once again the reliance of the U.S government on militarized approach to various issues , to which the threats of use of nuclear weapons are not a solution at all .
3- The Islamic Republic of Iran , as a victim of weapons of mass destruction in the recent history , is firmly committed to pursuing the realization of a world free from weapons of mass destruction , not only in words , but also by full implementation of three major legal instruments banning weapons of mass destruction , namely NPT , Biological Weapons Convention ( BWC ) and Chemical Weapons Convention ( CWC ) .
In addition , the Islamic Republic of Iran has categorically and consistently rejected the development , stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons on religious and constitutional grounds .
Iran 's nuclear activities are , and always have been , for peaceful purposes .
4- After 40 years since the entry into force of the NPT , and while the U.S. officials are apparently advocating the nuclear non-proliferation , let ’s not forget that the United States as the only nuclear power to have used a nuclear weapon against the citizens of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as a result of which 200,000 people perished , continues to illegitimately designate a non-nuclear weapon State as target of its nuclear weapons and contemplates military plans accordingly .
In view of the above - mentioned points , members of the United Nations should not condone or tolerate such nuclear blackmail in 21st century , and should take resolute action to ensure the total elimination of all nuclear weapons as the only absolute guarantee against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons .
In this regard , the United Nations and its relevant organs have a fundamental responsibility to strongly oppose the threat of use of nuclear weapons and to reject it .
It would be highly appreciated if this letter could be circulated as a document of the Security Council and that of the General Assembly , under agenda item 9 , 82 , 92 , 93 , 96 and 107 .
Please accept , Excellency , the assurances of my highest consideration .

President Obama , Vice President Biden , and Secretary of State Clinton have been uncharacteristically frank about how illegal Israeli settlements obstruct prospects for Middle East peace .
General Petraeus went even further , advising a reluctant Congress that Arab perceptions of one sided US support for Israel actually harms US national security and endangers troops .
It is now time for President Obama to cut off hidden US funding — private and public — to illegal Israeli settlements .
The American Israel Public Affairs Committee marshaled all of its congressional beneficiaries of Israel lobby campaign contributions .
AIPAC demands [ pdf ] the administration stop publicly confronting Israel , take the dispute behind closed doors and get back to the AIPAC agenda against Iran [ pdf ] .
But Obama long ago stated backroom deals with the Israel lobby were off the table , because such deals have a track record — like illegal settlements — of derailing efforts toward peace in the region .
Both Israel and its US lobby have long followed the doctrine that transgressions committed to advance Israeli interests would never be prosecuted in the United States .
David Ben-Gurion established an enormous US arms procurement , theft , and smuggling network [ pdf ] — violating scores of US export controls [ pdf ] in the 1940s — during his visits to the United States as an officially registered foreign agent of the Jewish Agency beginning in September of 1943 .
The Jewish Agency , a nonprofit corporation established to realize Theodore Herzl ’s vision of a Jewish State in Palestine has constantly clashed with Presidents and the US Department of Justice not only over arms smuggling but money laundering into the US for covert lobbying and public relations campaigns , and failing to disclose its secret covenants with the Israeli government in mandatory US foreign agent activity reports .
More recently the Jewish Agency and its twin sister ( the World Zionist Organization ) were identified in a lengthy official 2005 report by Israeli prosecutor Thalia Sasson as being at the very core of illegal settlement activity — a secret venture that has laundered $ 50 - 60 billion according to USA Today .
Historically both the Jewish Agency and its US startups dodged accountability by changing shell corporations like agile hermit crabs .
AIPAC scuttled out from under the protective shell of the American Zionist Council a mere six weeks [ pdf ] after the Department of Justice ordered its parent to register as the foreign agent of the Jewish Agency in 1962 .
The Jewish Agency - American Section , which laundered funds into the AZC , also claimed to the DOJ that it “ reconstituted itself ” into two unique and separate organizations after damning Senate Foreign Relations Committee investigators and US watchdogs caught it failing to properly file declarations of its secret ties to the Israeli government .
But even in 1970 , the DOJ found this claimed rehabilitation to be “ very sketchy ” [ pdf ] .
Today the Jewish Agency still claims to somehow be separate from its sister organization , the World Zionist Organization , even though one director heads “ both ” organizations , provides all of the funding and shares the same physical facilities .
Arcane Jewish Agency history is important to Americans .
As in the 1960s , US tax - exempt funds donated to the Jewish Agency are still quietly recycled back into the United States through the World Zionist Organization ’s American Section , itself conveniently located in the same New York office building as the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations .
Their major function is lobbying the White House and organizing AIPAC ’s executive committee .
Israel ’s leaders and lobbyists have long used intricate wire diagrams to obfuscate through complexity blatantly obvious ( and unlawful ) activities .
In the past , this has assuaged compliant US regulators during times of crisis .
The alphabet soup of ever changing , similar sounding Israel lobby organizations is as confusing to average Americans as it is to regulators — and that ’s because it ’s designed to be that way .
The Jewish Agency let lose another wire diagram in 1971 as it tried to convince skeptical Department of Justice officials that it would behave and stop infiltrating the US advice and consent process through covert lobbying and public relations campaigns .
Benjamin Netanyahu recently foisted one on Obama to show how he could n’t possibly be held accountable for the timing of the infamous 1,600 East Jerusalem housing units .
These ploys have grown very , very tiresome .
Analysis of cash flows confirms that funds for illegal settlement expansion continues to move from the US like water — pumped by US tax exemptions for committed donors as well as through Congressional siphoning of unsuspecting US taxpayers .
The Jewish Agency received at least $ 140 million in tax - favored donations in 2008 from US charitable federations .
Congress allocates $ 40 million a year in US taxpayer contributions to the Jewish Agency , but exercises no real oversight into how it actually uses the funds .
In addition to building illegal settlements , the Jewish Agency funds think tanks such as the Jewish People Policy Institute , which Dennis Ross established in 2002 and chaired before joining the Obama administration to spearhead efforts against Iran .
The Jewish Agency has long been the world ’s largest quasi governmental nonprofit corporation , its budget was $ 592 million in 2007 .
It is no secret that United Jewish Communities is the currently the designated lead US nonprofit funding umbrella for federations providing unrestricted funds to the Jewish Agency — though it has never revealed this simple fact in its mandatory public IRS filings .
US tax exemptions are supposed to be granted only to promote social welfare within designated US municipalities .
Land grab campaigns against foreign nations with which the US is at peace are not even legal , much less a charitable activity .
Tax exemptions for feeder funds and the Jewish Agency itself were granted so long ago the IRS does n’t even remember [ pdf ] precisely what justified many of them .
No new wire diagrams , appeals for secrecy , or shell company reorganizations can obscure the fact that US tax exemptions and tax dollars have long been misused to create “ facts on the ground ” that imperil US national security .
No unit of government is more responsible for enabling illegal settlement money laundering than the US Treasury Department .
In the days of Henry Morgenthau Jr. , opaque Treasury busybodies even helped and ferried pre-state terrorists through Europe and into the US — just as today they quietly wage economic warfare on Iran beyond the reach of broad public scrutiny or the Freedom of Information Act .
In 1968 , two years after the AZC foreign agent battle ended , AIPAC applied for a tax exemption .
The Internal Revenue Service of the Treasury Department not only granted it two months later , but made it retroactive to 1954 so that AIPAC could lay claim to a much longer existence than actual corporate filings or the press record warrant .
AIPAC then happily conducted the AZC ’s business as usual as if the 1962 DOJ foreign agent registration order never happened — what maneuverability the DOJ temporarily took from the Israel lobby , the US Treasury Department permanently restored .
Today public complaints about the Israel lobby ’s charitable money laundering are treated with the same contempt Harry Markopolos experienced years ago when he tried to warn the Securities and Exchange Commission about the Madoff Ponzi scheme .
US political appointees at Treasury in a position to make a difference simply refuse to receive petitions in Washington , much less enforce the law .
Although IRS commissioner Douglas Shulman was recently urged to tackle tax exempt donation laundering on National Public Radio , only action against Muslim charities is carried out behind the impenetrable wall of bureaucratic Treasury disinterest .
Dwight Eisenhower once threatened to cut off such misused tax exemptions and Treasury enablers — like Ike , ending US illegal settlements funding is something only president Obama can do .
President Obama should revoke the Jewish Agency ’s 1948 US tax exemption .
This would immediately shut down all US charities acting as feeder funds and throw into question the deductibility of individual US donor contributions .
This strong message would be timely , but generate some political backlash .
Israel lobbyists inside and outside the federal government exploit elected American politicians ’ own insatiable thirst for campaign contributions from the tributaries of this massive slush fund — politicians know they are only welcome to partake if they unconditionally support Israel and its lobby — no matter the cost to their American constituents .
But canceling all US tax exemptions for major charitable Jewish Agency feeder funds until Israel takes the necessary steps toward peace would n’t necessarily be controversial if American donors and concerned citizens are properly educated .
Sordid recent events may even convince grassroots donors to welcome an Obama ban — donors are often held in pure contempt by elite Israel lobby officialdom anyway .
Their donations have been constantly misused for nonexempt political activities and unlawful attempts to subvert the advice and consent participation in government of their fellow countrymen .
The most toxic donor contempt is perhaps no clearer than in former lobbyist Steven J. Rosen ’s insistence that AIPAC pay him $ 20 million from its coffers for what appears to be an illegal attempt to unlawfully influence US policy toward Iran through purloined classified US national defense information .
AIPAC ’s grassroots donors probably would n’t have knowingly relinquished their funds to pay AIPAC ’s legislative director Ester Kurz to mishandle and improperly dispose of classified US trade secrets either — legitimate American charitable organizations simply do n’t behave this way .
Obama must also permanently end all US taxpayer support to the Jewish Agency .
By quietly funding an entity with such a long history of arms smuggling , illicit US lobbying , propagandizing , and illegal settlement expansion , the Jewish Agency and its US lobby have compromised Congress and turned every American taxpayer into an unwitting accomplice .
No , no he did n't .

The US unemployment rate unexpectedly fell in January , to its lowest level in five months , official figures from the Labor Department have shown .
Last month 's rate was 9.7 % , down from 10 % in December .
Yet at the same time , US employers cut 20,000 jobs in January , which was also unexpected .
Most analysts had predicted the economy to add jobs .
President Barack Obama has declared that job creation would be his top priority for 2010 .
Last month 's job losses were the lowest since the US recession started , with the exception of November 2009 when a surprise rise in employment was seen .
" While unemployment remains a severe problem , today 's employment report contains encouraging signs of gradual labour market healing , " said White House economic adviser Christina Romer .
Contradicting data
The 20,000 job losses in January also compares with 779,000 losses for the same month last year .
Analysts had expected the jobless rate to rise to 10.1 % last month , and 5,000 net new jobs to be created .
Although overall , employers cut more jobs than they created , there were some sectors that performed well .
Manufacturing added 11,000 new jobs in January , its best performance since April 2009 .
Meanwhile , retailers created 42,100 new jobs , the most since November 2007 .
The apparent contradiction between the unemployment rate falling , and US employers cutting jobs in January can be explained by the fact the data comes from two different surveys .
The unemployment rate data looks at households , while the job creation figures come from companies .
Just in case there was any doubt about what he was implying the day before , Glenn Beck yesterday cleared things up and removed all doubt about the meaning of his garbled rant about administration radicals who advocated violence :
Beck :
You see , what they 've done is they 've radicalized The Man .
These people are in the center , but who 's down here ?
They know that these people always lose -- because they experienced it .
The crazy teabaggers in the streets .
Why would a government continue to poke you , and poke you , and poke you , and poke you ?
Why would they say these things ?
Why have these people said these things about good Americans ?
Because they need to separate these people from these people .
They know exactly how you feel when the president of the United States says that .
...
These guys remember .
When these guys said , ' These crazy dope - smoking hippies , ' they knew how it felt .
They knew and it drove them nuts , and it drove some of them -- it drove this guy and this guy -- to start throwing bombs !
They 're counting on it .
The Man made them do it .
And they learned that once they threw a bomb , they were done .
Martin Luther King changed the world without a single act of violence .
Gandhi was right in many ways .
This might be the most dangerous monologue I 've ever done , because I am telling you now :
They need you to be violent .
They are begging for it !
You are being set up !
Do not give them what they want .
Christians from several African states trace their origins to Israel or Palestine
The Pew Research Center has just released one of the biggest ever studies on attitudes to religion and morality in Africa , which has revealed a host of interesting facts .
Here are 10 things we have learnt from the study , which surveyed 25,000 people in 19 countries .
1. 75 % of South Africans think polygamy is " morally wrong " - bad news for their president , as Jacob Zuma took his third wife earlier this year and is engaged to a fourth .
However , the survey also revealed some possible double - standards .
While only 7 % of Rwandans approved of polygamy ( although this did include women ) , a rather higher number - 17 % - of men said they had more than one wife .
2 . An overwhelming majority of respondents disapproved of homosexual behaviour .
In three countries - Zambia , Kenya and Cameroon - this was a massive 98 % .
Interestingly , one of the countries with the highest numbers of people - 11 % - accepting homosexuals is Uganda , where an MP is trying to get legislation passed which would punish homosexual acts with life in prison and even death in some cases .
The former Portuguese colonies of Guinea - Bissau and Mozambique were also relatively tolerant of homosexuality .
3. Africa is probably the world 's most religious continent , with more than 80 % saying they believed in God in most countries .
At least half of the Christians questioned expect Jesus Christ to return to earth during their lifetimes .
In Ethiopia , 74 % of Christians say they have experienced or witnessed the devil or evil spirits being driven out of a person and in Ghana , 40 % of Christians say they have had a direct revelation from God .
About half of all Muslims expect to see the reunification of the Islamic world under a single ruler , or caliph , in their lifetimes .
4. Zimbabwe , where the Lemba people say they are the lost tribe of Israel , was not one of the countries surveyed .
But 26 % of Nigerian Christians said they traced their origins back to Israel or Palestine .
5 . Belief in witchcraft is also common - about 40 % ; a similar percentage also visit traditional healers to cure sickness .
Belief in witchcraft is highest in Tanzania with 93 % - this is the country where witchdoctors say that magic potions are more effective if they contain body parts of people with albinism .
Ethiopia had the lowest levels of belief in witchcraft - at just 17 % .
Belief that juju or sacred objects can prevent bad things happening was generally lower - between 20 and 30 % .
In Senegal , however , 75 % thought such things worked - far higher than in Tanzania ( 49 % ) .
It may come as a surprise to learn that South Africa had the highest number of people - 52 % - saying they took part in ceremonies of traditional religions , or honoured or celebrated their ancestors .
A majority of people disapproved of Sharia punishments such as amputations
6 . Predictably , there was also a religious split concerning alcohol , banned by Islam .
Surprisingly , however , more Muslims in Chad ( 23 % ) approved of booze , than Ethiopian Christians ( 5 % ) .
This comes as a huge surprise to Ethiopia experts , however , who point out that it is traditional to welcome Orthodox Christian clergy with traditional honey beer when they visit your house .
Maybe " alcohol " was only taken to mean spirits by some of the respondents ?
7. Attitudes to divorce showed a strong divide along religious lines in Nigeria .
A massive 79 % of Christians thought it was " morally wrong " , while among Muslims , a narrow majority ( 46 - 41 % ) accepted divorce .
8 . In recent years , Islamist hardliners in Somalia and Nigeria have introduced strict punishment based on Sharia law , such as amputating the hands of thieves and even stoning to death for adultery .
The majority of people disapproved of such Sharia punishments .
In Nigeria , they were backed by about 40 % of Muslims and less than 10 % of Christians .
However , a majority did approve of whippings and amputations in Senegal and Mali .
In nearby Guinea - Bissau , even 50 % of Christians backed them .
This was double the rate among Muslims in Ethiopia ( 25 % ) - maybe it feels like a more realistic prospect to them , as they share a border with Somalia and most Muslim Ethiopians are ethnic Somalis .
AFRICA HAVE YOUR SAY
The blending of religions like Islam and Christianity with African religions is one way of ensuring survival of traditional religions BaDumisani , Berlin
9 . The survey also asked about material well - being in the world 's poorest continent .
Not so long ago , Cameroon regularly topped surveys of champagne consumption per head .
However , a shocking 71 % of Cameroonians surveyed said there were times in the past year when they did not have enough money to buy food .
In Ethiopia , which is commonly seen as a country struggling to feed itself , the rate was far lower - at 30 % - the lowest of all countries surveyed .
10 . Ethiopia did , however , have the lowest numbers of people - 7 % - who said they regularly used the internet .
Rwanda 's President Paul Kagame is striving to turn his country into Africa 's answer to Silicon Valley and is being helped by the arrival of several new fibre optic cables off the east coast of Africa .
He will be encouraged by the finding that 30 % of his countrymen - the highest number - regularly browsed the web .
Mobile phones , were far more common - with 81 % of respondents in Botswana owning one .
Many countries reported more than 50 % having phones but here , Rwanda lagged behind at just 35 % .

When we heard late last year that Slayer frontman Tom Araya needed back surgery and the band would have to postpone their long awaited Canadian and American Carnage dates with Megadeth and Testament , we were disappointed like everyone else .
But we knew it was just a temporary setback .
There was no way a back injury was going to silence the mighty voice of Slayer .
A few months after going under the knife , Araya is feeling pretty good and looking forward to getting back on the road , he told Noisecreep 's '' Creep Show ' in his first interview since Slayer stopped touring in October 2009 .
And he 's feeling more metal these days than ever -- literally .
Slayer 's vocalist now has a titanium steel plate attached to his spine and held together by screws .
%VIRTUAL-globalVideoEmbed-{" videoIds " : " 517722764 " , " width " : " 400 " , " height " : " 346 " } %
Although the band has downplayed the seriousness of the surgery , it was by no means a minor procedure .
It was actually a last resort decided upon after two separate painkiller injections failed to heal the injury .
Doctors had to go in through the front of Araya 's neck to conduct the operation , which , though complex , was completely successful .
Araya told us he felt better almost immediately after and has steadily been on the mend ever since .
He did n't even use the painkillers doctors gave him when he left the hospital .
Araya said that his back injury was caused by decades of headbanging and the abnormal positioning of injured discs in his neck was due to his particular style of helicopter and figure eight headbanging .
He added that although he can still sing and play bass as well as ever , he will headbang no more .
During our candid interview , Araya discussed the experiences that led to Slayer 's decision to leave the road and postpone the Carnage shows , the grisly details of his surgery , the support he has received from fans and friends and specific plans for the upcoming Carnage dates and European tour .
After our revealing 20 minute interview with Araya , the singer joined the other panelists -- Noisecreep editor in chief Seth Werkheiser , Revolver senior writer and Noisecreep regular Jon Wiederhorn , Noisecreep lead blogger Amy Sciarretto and Noisecreep 's news guy Chris Harris -- to discuss the week 's news .
Highlights included : Ozzy Osbourne 's new song ' Met Me Hear You Scream ' receiving its debut on an upcoming episode of ' CSI : New York , ' Korn signing to Roadrunner Records for their upcoming album , ' Korn III – Remember Who You Are ' and Danzig 's first new studio album in six years .
We also hypothesized about why Stone Temple Pilots ended their Milwaukee set abruptly and gauged the possibility of Orgy staging a full - scale comeback -- with or without a New Order cover song .
Watch the excitement that went down on Good Friday and check out the latest update on Slayer 's summer tour .
Washington ( CNN ) --
To the list of instructions you hear at airport checkpoints , add this : " Put your palms forward , please . "
The Transportation Security Administration soon will begin randomly swabbing passengers ' hands at checkpoints and airport gates to test them for traces of explosives .
Previously , screeners swabbed some carry - on luggage and other objects as they searched for the needle in the security haystack -- components of terrorist bombs in an endless stream of luggage .
But after the Christmas Day attempted bombing of Northwest Flight 253 over Detroit , Michigan , the TSA began a program of swabbing passengers ' hands , which could be contaminated by explosive materials , experts say .
The TSA will greatly expand the swabbing in the coming weeks , the agency said .
" The point is to make sure that the air environment is a safe environment , " Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told CNN .
" We know that al Qaeda [ and other ] terrorists continue to think of aviation as a way to attack the United States .
One way we keep it safe is by new technology [ and ] random use of different types of technology . "
Security experts consulted by CNN said swabbing hands is a good move , and privacy advocates said they support the new swabbing protocols , provided the agency tests only for security - related objects and does not discriminate when it selects people to be tested .
It 's a " very good idea , " said security expert Tony Fainberg .
TSA screeners currently swab luggage handles and parts of bags that are likely be contaminated by human hands , he said , and swabbing a person 's hands increases the chances of finding explosive materials .
" Looking at the hands means you will probably get a better dose , " he said .
Under the new protocols , tests will be conducted at various locations -- including in checkpoint lines , during the screening process and at gates .
Newer , more portable machines make it easier to conduct tests away from fixed locations such as the checkpoint .
The TSA has more than 7,000 explosive trace detection ( ETD ) machines and has purchased 400 additional units with $ 16 million in federal stimulus money .
The president 's fiscal 2011 budget calls for $ 60 million to purchase approximately 800 portable ETD machines .
Napolitano said the tests will not significantly increase wait times at airport checkpoints .
The American Civil Liberties Union has " always supported explosive detection as a good form of security that does n't really invade privacy , " said Jay Stanley , an attorney and privacy expert with the organization .
Stanley said the ACLU is chiefly concerned that the TSA does not discriminate when selecting people for enhanced screening -- something the agency said it does not do -- and that it treat people with dignity .
" We would not want to see it implemented in a discriminatory fashion , for example , in a disproportionate way against Muslims and Arabs or , for example , people with red hair or anything else .
Security experts from across the spectrum will tell you that that 's not just unfair and unjust and not the American way , it 's also a terrible way to do security , " Stanley said .
Swabbing also should not be used to test for nonsecurity - related contraband , such as drugs , he said .
" Under the Constitution , searches in airports are only for the purpose of protecting the security of airline transportation ; they are not general law enforcement stops .
And so it would n't be permissible for the government to use these trace portal detectors to look for drugs , " Stanley said .
The TSA said the machines test only for explosives .
It declined to specify which explosives , citing security reasons .
Because some legal substances -- such as fertilizers and heart medicines -- can result in " false positives , " Stanley said the ACLU also wants to ensure that people who test positive be treated respectfully .
" It 's important that the government treat people who do show up as a positive -- fairly and with dignity -- and not parade them off in handcuffs and treat them as terrorists , but do rational things to investigate what the problem might be , " he said .
But swabbing hands does not , by itself , raise civil liberty problems , Stanley said .
" There 's really not a big privacy interest at stake here , " he said .
" They are basically looking for particles of explosives , which is not something that people normally have . "

Post , it ’s official .
The Republicans are going to filibuster Wall Street reform .
It ’s not too hard to figure out why :
The GOP is doing the work of Wall Street :
Mitch McConnell has rounded up the necessary votes to block Democrats from bringing Wall Street reform to the Senate floor , a spokesman for the Senate Minority Leader said on Friday afternoon .
Senate Majority Leader Harry ( D - Nev. ) said on Thursday he planned to bring the bill to the floor next week where it would be debated and amendments added .
McConnell has now persuaded 41 Republicans to vote against debating reform .
The Democrats better not back down .
Not one inch .
Make the Republicans filibuster .
Make them vote on cloture over and over and over .
Let ’s this spectacle play out for the American people , especially the teabaggers .
They ’ll see whose side the GOP is on .
Not theirs .
It ’s just a joke and a ruse that the GOPers are calling for bipartisanship on the Wall Street reform bill .
As we ’ve witnessed ( and let ’s hope the White House has witnessed , too ) , for Republicans , bipartisanship is code for wanting to kill legislation .
So game on , GOP Senators .
It ’s time to play hard ball .
If Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins want to side with McConnell and the Wall Street bankers , Obama should take another trip to Maine .
This time , he can talk about how Wall Street destroyed the American economy with the assistance of the Republican Party — and how Maine ’s supposed moderates are siding with Wall Street over Main Street .
Now , that would be fun to see ( but it might be a little too mean . )
Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn. ) on Sunday called the administration 's proposal to avoid the term " Islamic extremism " in national security references " absolutely Orwellian and counterproductive . "
Lieberman revealed on " Fox News Sunday " that he had sent a letter to the president 's top counterterrorism adviser , John Brennan , saying in part : " The failure to identify our enemy for what it is , violent Islamist extremism , is offensive and contradicts thousands of years of accepted military and intelligence doctrine to know your enemy . "

The chairman of the Homeland Security Committee said the letter was the product of him growing " so frustrated " with the White House over the terminology issue .
He said the Defense Department omitted references to " violent Islamist extremism " in its report on the massacre at Fort Hood .
" Clearly , from the record , [ Nidal Malik Hasan ] was motivated by Islamist extremism , and they did n't mention that term there , " Lieberman said .
" This is not honest , " the senator said , adding that by dropping the clarification of extremism , " we disrespect the overwhelming majority of Muslims who are not extremists . "
Lieberman said that the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks were not carried out by " some amorphous group of violent extremists or environmental extremists or white supremacist extremists . "
" It 's absolutely Orwellian and counterproductive to the fight that we 're fighting at risk of great life every day to stop violent extremism of an Islamist base , " he said .
I asked myself this question after reviewing the validity period for the RHCE .
See my How long is the RHCE valid post .
Back then I discovered the RHCE is valid for 2 full releases after the release on which the exam was taken .
The answer to one question only created another !
I wanted to know exactly how many years “ 2 full releases ” equated to in human years .
After scouring Google quite a few times , I came to realize that there is n’t any cut and dry answer as to how long a Red Hat Enterprise Linux ( RHEL ) release is actively developed .
Sure older versions are still sort of supported once a new major release comes out , but this quest is more about getting a feel for RedHat ’s release time - line .
The BIG question ultimately led to some digging around through RedHat press releases over here and of course ; wikipedia .
After gathering the data , I produced a quick and dirty chart comparing the different RHEL versions and their release dates by number months .
Hope this helps those with the same questions floating through their heads .
RHEL 5 : 3/1/2007 – present - 36 months as of 4/2010 – [ 6 releases ( so far ) ]
RHEL 4 : 2/14/2005 – 5/18/2009 - 51 months – [ 4 releases ]
RHEL 3 : 10/23/2003 – 6/15/2007 - 44 months – [ 5 releases ]
Armed with this information , one could guess that RHEL 5 will have a life expectancy of about 50 months .
If that ’s the case , then as of this post , we have just about 14 months left until RHEL 6 !
If anyone has any further insight , please post a comment .
( Newser ) – Swiss hookers can — quite literally — mend your broken heart .
In the Swiss town of Lugano , prostitutes are being trained to use defibrillators to re-start the hearts of their eager but elderly customers .
Several men have died doing the deed in Lugano , including a pensioner who recently perished getting busy with the help of anti-impotence drugs .
" Having customers die on us is n't exactly good publicity , " a local sex club owner tells the Telegraph .
Lugano's health officials back the plan .
The town has 38 sex clubs , fueled in large part by sex tourists from Italy and sex workers from South America and Eastern Europe .
The British Heart Foundation says defibrillators are " becoming increasingly quick and easy for the lay person to use . "

Si vous avez des questions sur la manière dont vous pouvez développer votre entreprise en ligne , n'hésitez pas à nous contacter ici .
La mise en place d'une équipe interne pour s'occuper de l'ensemble de vos efforts de marketing numérique peut s'avérer écrasante .
Chaque entreprise a des exigences différentes et ce que font les autres peut ne pas être applicable pour vous .
En outre , les compétences dont votre entreprise a besoin peuvent être soit difficiles d'accès , soit trop coûteuses , et il est insensé d'employer quelqu'un si vous n'avez pas besoin de ses compétences de manière constante .
Vos campagnes de marketing numérique peuvent changer à différentes périodes de l'année .
Par exemple , vos efforts porteront davantage sur le référencement et l'image de marque en début d'année .
De même , à l'approche de Noël et de la période des soldes , vous devez tenir compte des médias sociaux et des publicités payantes .
Ces tâches ne peuvent être accomplies que par une agence de marketing numérique plus efficace .
Elle peut appliquer la bonne combinaison de compétences pour atteindre et dépasser les objectifs de votre campagne .
Vous devez savoir à quel point les tendances , les nouvelles tactiques de marketing numérique et les algorithmes de recherche changent constamment .
À moins d'être un expert en marketing numérique , il n'y a aucune chance que vous maîtrisiez tout cela .
Il faut tant de compétences et de temps pour y parvenir .
De plus , il existe différentes facettes du marketing numérique : peu d'entre elles doivent vous être familières alors qu'il y en a beaucoup dont vous n'avez jamais entendu parler .
Il s'agit notamment des médias sociaux , du référencement , du marketing par courriel , de la vidéo , du contenu , des publicités payantes , et la liste est encore longue .
Si vous ne pouvez pas suivre toutes les tendances , alors qui le peut ?
C'est le travail d'une agence , et il est essentiel de les engager pour qu'ils soient les meilleurs dans ce que vous faites et pour conserver vos clients .
Si vous cherchez des suggestions , vous pouvez consulter le site web de Summon Digital .
Ils offrent une large gamme de services de marketing numérique , notamment PPC , SEO , Social Media , Programmatic , Content Marketing , et CRO .
Généralement , les agences numériques externalisées prennent en charge les dépenses de marketing que votre entreprise effectue avec Google , Facebook , Twitter et Instagram .
Si vous suivez vos dépenses sur différentes plateformes sans faire appel à une aide professionnelle , cela vous sera difficile et vous demandera beaucoup de temps .
Les agences de marketing numérique gèrent efficacement votre budget de marketing numérique grâce à des outils et des processus développés pour effectuer les tâches de manière plus efficace .
Travailler avec une agence fiable vous aidera à vous concentrer sur vos autres activités commerciales importantes , et vous pourrez vous reposer en sachant qu'elle gère vos efforts de marketing numérique .
Une équipe interne ou interne est limitée dans les expériences .
Ainsi , ils se concentrent uniquement sur les opérations clés de l'entreprise .
Toutefois , il est bénéfique pour votre entreprise d'obtenir de nouvelles perspectives et des aides à l'externalisation afin que vous puissiez bénéficier de perspectives externes pour apporter un éclairage utile sur les tendances existantes .
Même si vous connaissez votre entreprise de l'intérieur et de l'extérieur , il est toujours recommandé d'engager des professionnels pour faire le travail à votre place de manière plus efficace .
Lorsque vous vous associez à une agence de marketing numérique fiable , elle vous aide à exploiter cette connaissance et cette expertise de manière plus ciblée .
Pour les entreprises , il est avantageux d'engager des experts en tenant compte de facteurs importants .
Il est essentiel de savoir que si vous n'avez pas d'experts en marketing numérique dans votre entreprise , vous devriez envisager d'en engager un .
Si vous n'en avez pas , il peut s'avérer très long pour vos employés de comprendre et de mettre en œuvre toutes les stratégies de marketing telles que la gestion de la chaîne d'approvisionnement et le référencement .
Au lieu de consacrer autant de temps et d'efforts à la formation de vos employés à la gestion des tâches de marketing numérique , il est avantageux d'avoir accès à l'équipe d'experts qualifiés .
Ils s'assureront que tous vos efforts de marketing numérique sont efficaces , et votre équipe pourra se concentrer sur les objets commerciaux .
Vous devez être conscient du fait que le marketing numérique nécessite différents outils pour mener une campagne de marketing appropriée .
En matière de marketing en ligne , il n'y a rien de tel qu'un outil pour tous .
Pour mener des campagnes en ligne réussies , vous aurez besoin de recherches par mots clés , d'analyses de la concurrence , d'analyses , d'outils d'automatisation et de gestion des recherches payantes .
La plupart de ces outils sont des services de pointe , et leur coût dépend de leurs caractéristiques et de leur mise à niveau .
Si vous envisagez d'acheter ces outils , sachez que le montant que vous devrez payer pour les acquérir est assez élevé .
En revanche , les agences de marketing numérique disposent déjà de tous les outils nécessaires pour mener une campagne en ligne réussieVous avez enfin décidé de tirer parti des outils en ligne pour développer votre entreprise , n'est - ce pas ?
Mais , en regardant les options de marketing que vous avez sélectionnées , vous avez le référencement , l'e - mail , le PPC , les médias sociaux , les blogs , entre autres .
Quelque chose ne va pas ; vous ne savez tout simplement pas par où commencer .
C'est normal .
Vous voyez , le marketing numérique est un terme général qui représente les différentes méthodes de marketing en ligne et de développement de votre entreprise .
Il peut donc être quelque peu compliqué de lancer une campagne solide ou à grande échelle si votre entreprise ne dispose pas des ressources , du temps et de l'expertise nécessaires à une telle entreprise .
Allons droit au but .
Dans la plupart des cas , le marketing en ligne implique l'embauche pure et simple de nouveaux talents pour mener les campagnes .
De plus , il vous faudra y accorder une certaine attention puisque vous travaillerez avec une équipe interne .
N'oubliez pas qu'il vous faudra également des ressources et du temps pour mettre en place l'équipe et la campagne elle - même .
Cela peut prendre beaucoup de temps , et une agence peut s'avérer utile pour vous soulager de ce fardeau .
Vous ne voulez pas passer des mois à former votre équipe .
Sinon , ce temps peut être utilisé pour développer votre entreprise de l'intérieur .
Avec une agence , vous devez simplement partager vos objectifs et leur calendrier .
Il n'y a pas de formation , d'intégration ou de gestion d'une autre équipe .
Tous les éléments de votre marketing en ligne sont gérés en interne par l'équipe de l'agence .
Cela vous permet de mieux gérer votre entreprise .
Lorsqu'elles envisagent de faire appel à une agence de marketing numérique , de nombreuses entreprises comparent généralement le coût d'une opération interne au prix de l'agence .
Vous serez surpris d'apprendre qu'une agence est beaucoup moins coûteuse au fil du temps .
Les agences travaillent comme des entrepreneurs indépendants , ce qui vous évite d'avoir à payer des charges sociales .
Vous réduisez également les coûts récurrents liés au fait d'avoir des employés à temps plein , tels que les avantages sociaux , les frais de santé et les salaires .
Certains des outils dont vous avez besoin pour mener les campagnes peuvent également être fournis par un paiement unique ou des abonnements .
La plupart des agences réputées disposent déjà des outils de marketing numérique essentiels , vous n'aurez donc pas besoin de dépenser un centime pour en obtenir un .
Pour la plupart des petites entreprises , vous ne pouvez tout simplement pas engager des experts en marketing numérique dès le début de votre campagne .
C'est une question de temps et de réflexion .
De plus , il peut être long pour votre équipe de comprendre toutes les techniques de marketing en ligne , telles que les stratégies de référencement et le marketing des médias sociaux .
Au lieu de cela , vous pouvez avoir accès à une équipe d'experts expérimentés et qualifiés en travaillant avec une agence de marketing numérique .
Certaines grandes entreprises paient le prix fort juste pour engager et retenir les meilleurs talents .
Cela signifie que le coût de l'embauche de ces experts peut être assez élevé .
L'avantage est que ces experts ont déjà travaillé sur des projets similaires dans le passé .
Vous ne vous attendez donc pas à cracher des services coûteux pour tirer parti de leur expertise .
À ce stade , vous devez comprendre que la recherche est importante avant de lancer toute campagne .
Vous devez bien connaître votre secteur d'activité , vos concurrents et les dernières pratiques de marketing dans votre segment .
C'est à l'agence qu'incombe la responsabilité des pratiques marketing pertinentes pour l'industrie .
Elle est chargée d'effectuer des recherches sur votre marché et d'identifier vos concurrents .
De plus , ils suivent les derniers développements en matière de marketing numérique pour garantir des résultats quantifiables .
Ils identifient et étudient également votre public cible afin de connaître et de comprendre son comportement , ses préférences et ses intérêts .
Ceci afin de s'assurer que les stratégies de marketing adoptées produisent le maximum de résultats possibles et de tenir votre entreprise au courant des développements pertinents .
Dans le domaine du marketing numérique , il est important de noter que tout ne fonctionnera pas pour vous .
Certains peuvent donner des résultats décevants , tandis que d'autres peuvent être très utiles .
Une bonne agence vous donnera de bonnes idées sur les techniques qui vous permettront d'obtenir des résultats .
Elles vous donneront une nouvelle perspective sur certaines des choses que votre équipe a déjà réalisées .
Ils évalueront vos efforts de marketing et créeront de nouvelles idées en se basant sur le point de vue des consommateurs .
Par exemple , en ce qui concerne le marketing des médias sociaux , une agence de marketing numérique vous aidera à savoir où votre public cible est le plus disponible .
Elle déterminera les contenus les plus attrayants et la manière dont ils les partagent et les consomment .
Cela vous aidera à rationaliser vos campagnes sur les médias sociaux .
Une des choses qui font d'une agence de marketing numérique votre meilleur atout pour la croissance en ligne est son évolutivité .
Dans un cadre normal , vous devrez augmenter la taille de votre équipe chaque fois que votre entreprise aura besoin de se développer ou que vous voudrez lancer une nouvelle .
Cela signifie que votre entreprise aura besoin de ressources supplémentaires pour soutenir et alimenter la croissance .
Avec une agence de marketing , ce n'est pas le cas .
Votre équipe actuelle ne sera soumise à aucune contrainte et il ne sera pas nécessaire de l'agrandir .
Une bonne entreprise répond généralement à vos besoins au fur et à mesure que votre activité se développe .
Elle propose plusieurs plans et formules qui conviennent le mieux à la taille de votre entreprise .
Idéalement , il est important de disposer d'une agence évolutive et flexible , surtout lorsque vous visez un nouveau marché .
Aucune entreprise ne veut faire des investissements qui n'apportent aucun résultat .
Avec autant de méthodes de marketing dans le paysage du marketing numérique , il peut être difficile de connaître le véritable retour sur investissement .
Toutefois , une agence peut vous aider en déterminant les indicateurs clés de performance ( KPI ) .
Ces indicateurs aident à déterminer les performances de vos campagnes de marketing par rapport à vos objectifs .
Ils permettent également d'identifier les mesures importantes à suivre dans les différents canaux pour déterminer l'efficacité de chaque campagne .
Vous obtiendrez également des rapports mensuels ou trimestriels sur vos campagnes et un audit de votre site web pour vous aider à prendre des décisions marketing judicieuses .
En règle générale , une agence de marketing numérique offre une vision claire de la performance de vos mots clés et de la manière dont les clients potentiels s'intéressent à votre contenu et à votre marque .
Regardons les choses en face .
Le marketing numérique nécessite l'utilisation de différents outils pour rationaliser chaque campagne .
Malheureusement , il n'y a rien de comparable à un outil unique pour tous en matière de marketing .
La plupart de ces outils sont des services haut de gamme , et les coûts augmentent avec l'ajout de certaines fonctionnalités ou une mise à niveau .
Vous aurez besoin d'outils d'analyse , de recherche par mot-clé , d'analyse de la concurrence , de gestion du référencement payant et d'automatisation .
Le coût cumulé de l'utilisation de ces outils de marketing en ligne peut être assez élevé pour les petites et moyennes entreprises .
Les services de marketing numérique ont déjà mis en place ces outils pour vous aider à tirer le meilleur parti de vos campagnes .
Vous n'avez pas à vous soucier des coûts récurrents que vous risquez d'encourir pour leur utilisation .
Avec la croissance de la publicité autochtone , les spécialistes du marketing consacrent du temps et des ressources pour en savoir plus .
La possibilité d'afficher des publicités organiques sur diverses plateformes médiatiques modifie la manière dont les clients interagissent avec le contenu .
Malheureusement , savoir où afficher ses publicités natives peut être un processus ardu .
C'est pourquoi vous pouvez bénéficier des solutions basées sur les données offertes par une agence de marketing numérique pour déterminer le meilleur placement et le meilleur plan de distribution de contenu .
La publicité native offre une manière naturelle et organique d'afficher les annonces .
Lorsqu'elle est bien faite , elle peut fournir une expérience solide pour stimuler votre retour sur investissement .
Votre équipe de marketing interne travaille sans relâche à la promotion de vos produits et services .
Cela vous permet de savoir ce qu'il faut améliorer et ce qu'il faut éliminer pour rendre le produit aussi attrayant et viable que possible .
Pendant ce temps , votre agence de marketing numérique s'emploie à définir et à diffuser le message de votre marque sur différents canaux et plates - formes .
Ils contribuent à générer des relations publiques positives sur vos produits et services .
Cela contribue à améliorer votre visibilité et votre image .
Dans l'idéal , la narration d'une histoire implique la création de messages convaincants et attrayants qui établissent un lien et une résonance avec le public cible .
Votre agence y parvient en comprenant les besoins de votre public et en les associant aux bonnes solutions .
Avant de partir à la recherche d'une société de marketing avec laquelle travailler , vous voudrez peut - être d'abord freiner un peu .
Il existe un bon nombre d'entreprises , mais toutes ne proposent pas ce qu'elles prétendent .
Le marketing numérique est un processus lent et continu , alors choisissez la bonne entreprise .
Fuyez les entreprises qui vous promettent des résultats instantanés ou rapides .
Déterminez les principales limites et spécialités d'une entreprise avant de prendre votre décision .
Laissez - les vous indiquer les secteurs primaires qu'elles couvrent , et elles doivent vous faire part de certains des outils et techniques qu'elles utilisent .
Si nécessaire , vous pouvez demander des rapports sur leurs projets passés et actuels afin d'examiner leurs performances .
De même , déterminez les performances en ligne des propriétés web de l'agence .
Leur classement sur les moteurs de recherche contribue à renforcer votre relation avec eux .
N'oubliez pas de confirmer leur expérience dans le secteur .
Un fait est que le marketing numérique a le pouvoir de faire croître votre entreprise plus rapidement que la plupart des techniques de marketing .
En faisant appel à une agence de marketing numérique , vous pouvez lancer vos campagnes presque immédiatement .
Vous n'avez pas besoin de suivre la courbe d'apprentissage ni de constituer une équipe .
Il est possible de voir vos campagnes en direct dans les semaines qui suivent la création d'une stratégie .
Commencez par comprendre vos besoins et faites - en part à l'agence .
Les campagnes numériques fonctionnent mieux si toutes les parties sont sur la même longueur d'onde .
De plus , votre agence doit pouvoir prendre librement les décisions qui correspondent le mieux à vos intérêts et à votre plan budgétaire .

Marijuana substitute is more potent than pot , and legal

Weedz Alternative
A woman dressed in a hoodie and sweat pants walks into Steve Vogt ’s tiny shop on Las Vegas Boulevard , just south of police headquarters , and asks for “ schwag ” — a term for low - end marijuana .
Vogt goes into a back room and emerges with what looks like pot .
The woman pays him and as she leaves , Vogt delivers his signature line : “ Hold it in . ”
Minutes later , Vogt receives a call from a customer looking for 30 grams of his weed .
He says it will cost about $ 600 .
But this product is n’t what you ’re thinking .
Vogt ’s shop , Weedz , 628 Las Vegas Boulevard South , has over the past two years done a brisk business in mind - altering substances — King Krypto , Spice , Puff , Tribal Warrior , Sleep Walker , Black Mamba and numerous other brands — that are legal .
None of the colorful packages under the glass counter at Weedz contains THC , the active ingredient in marijuana .
Rather , the dried herbs have been treated with chemicals with names like JWH - 073 and JWH - 018 that when smoked provide a high that the academics who invented it say is more potent than marijuana .
This is Nevada ’s answer , for now anyway , to the nationwide movement to legalize marijuana gaining steam nationwide , most notably in California .
Vogt is n’t the only small - business operator selling the chemically enhanced herbs , which experts say are mostly manufactured in China , but he might be their most passionate marketer .
Wearing a T - shirt with his trademark “ Hold it in , ” and a picture of Shaggy — the “ Scooby - Doo , Where Are You ! ” character best known for his chronic case of the munchies —
Vogt said he smokes the same weed he sells .
It keeps his 42 - year - old body fit and has n’t given him problems .
“ I would n’t sell it if I did n’t believe in it , ” he said .
Best of all , he said , it gives him a better high than marijuana without the risk of arrest or jail time .
“ It keeps people out of the ( justice ) system , ” he said .
The chemicals in the herbs Vogt and other smoke shops sell — JWH - 073 and JWH - 018 — are named for John W. Huffman , a 77 - year - old chemistry professor at Clemson University who first helped synthesize them .
Huffman started researching cannabinoids — a class of compounds that bind to the same brain receptors as THC — about 25 years ago .
The research was primarily funded by the federal National Institute on Drug Abuse .
In an interview , Huffman said JWH - 018 was created in the summer of 1995 by participants in an undergraduate research program .
The event was n’t seen as anything out of the ordinary .
The student made “ all of 100 milligrams of it ” and sent it off to his pharmacology collaborators “ and that was it , ” the professor said .
Researchers wrote a paper on its receptor - binding activity and its impact on lab mice .
After JWH -018 emerged as a recreational drug about two years ago , Huffman had a post - doctoral student purify what remained in a lab freezer and then sent samples to law enforcement agencies so they could train their drug - sniffing dogs to find it .
Why did he do that if it ’s not illegal ?
Huffman chuckled , then said : “ It ’s already illegal in Kansas ; they ’re working on it in Illinois and other places . ”
Others states are lining up legislation to ban it as well .
Some politician in Nevada will probably eventually join in .
“ I have n’t heard about this yet , ” said state Assemblyman John Hambrick , R - Las Vegas , who is retired from the Secret Service .
“ But I ’m going to look into it . ”
Officer Jay Rivera , a spokesman for Metro Police , said the JWH compounds are n’t on the radar of Las Vegas police .
But officers are on the lookout for another marijuana - like chemical , HU - 210 , which Rivera said can be 800 times more potent than THC .
“ A clear tell - tale sign is if the package says , ‘ Not for sale in the USA , ’ ” Rivera said .
But Huffman cautioned that users should n’t assume JWH is safe .
It has been studied so little that , “ using the stuff is like playing Russian roulette . ”
Some people have experienced high blood pressure after taking it .
It metabolizes more slowly than THC and therefore stays in the body longer .
One mother said her daughter was high for a week after using it .
The compound is so untested that Huffman thinks it should be classified as a Schedule 1 drug , similar to marijuana , heroin or LSD .
“ It ’s dangerous , ” Huffman adds .
“ I mean , you have no idea what the long - term effects of this stuff are . ”
The drug has “ exactly ” the same effect as THC , but “ is more potent by a factor of 10 — but THC is not very potent . ”
Even though Huffman warns the public not to use JWH , he said he has been attacked for inventing it .
In a live interview with a Moscow television station last year he was “ accused of poisoning the youth of Mother Russia , ” he said .
“ They asked me why we did n’t destroy it when we made it , ” he said .
“ Well , we did n’t anticipate anybody was going to use it .
I guess we probably should have . ”
Unlike JWH compounds , THC has been studied for decades and found to be relatively safe , Huffman said .
So does he favor legalizing marijuana ?
“ I have semi-mixed feelings about it , ” Huffman said .
But legalization “ would probably be the smartest thing because it ’s not that dangerous and you ca n’t kill yourself with THC . ”
That ’s music to the ears of David Schwartz , campaign manager for Nevadans for Sensible Drug Laws , which is trying to collect 90,002 signatures to get an initiative to legalize marijuana on the ballot in 2012 .
If the signatures come together more quickly , Schwartz said , they hope to convince the 2011 Legislature to legalize pot .
“ Response has n’t been overly negative , ” Schwartz said of talks with community leaders .
“ Legalization has become more mainstream . ”
In November , California voters will weigh in on a ballot initiative calling for the legalization of marijuana , a move that ’s gaining some momentum because it could bring $ 1.4 billion in tax revenue to a state hit hard by the recession .
If marijuana were legalized in Nevada , Schwartz ’s group would like to see 50 growers approved and 120 stores , with a $ 50 excise tax plus sales tax .
Only adults 21 and older would be allowed into the stores .
Back at Weedz , anyone can get in .
And $ 40 can net you 3 grams of King Krypto , a tiny package labeled as “ herbal incense ” and “ not for human consumption . ”
Vogt says he tells people not to smoke it , “ but people will smoke whatever they want . ”
And when they do , the effects vary .
Metro visited the store about six months ago because someone smoked it and complained about getting sick .
“ She mixed it with alcohol , ” Vogt says .
“ I tell them not to mix it with alcohol . ”
Vogt never heard back from Metro .
Then there are experiences like the one memorialized on a sticky note that Vogt found in his mail slot last week .
Written in blue ink , it states : “ Wow ... I was inside the matrix of hell for like 4 hrs .
I have never been that high in my whole ( expletive ) life .
It took me like six hrs . to find my hotel .
I did n’t know my own ( expletive ) name .
You guys are ( expletive ) hilarious .
See you next time .
The Krypto King from Canada . ”
Vogt giggles at the note .
“ I ’d say that person was pretty happy with his experience . ”

We all want to increase productivity and get more done with our working hours .
There ’s just one problem :
Most people ’s view of productivity comes from the industrial age .
This leads to some fundamental misconceptions about work , including these :
If you work more hours , you get more work done .
Adding more people to a project means you can finish sooner .
Productivity is more or less constant and can be reliably predicted and scheduled .
For knowledge workers , i.e. anyone who works with information rather than physically producing stuff , these beliefs are not only wrong , they ’re actively harmful .
So here is my suggestion for 5 new rules of productivity for knowledge workers .
1 : Productivity varies wildly from day to day .
This is normal .
In an industrial setting , production and output can be planned in advance barring accidents or equipment failure .
Basically you know that if the plant operates for X hours tomorrow you ’ll produce Y widgets .
For knowledge workers you can’t possibly know in advance whether tomorrow will be a day where you :
Reach a brilliant insight that saves you and your team weeks of work .
Work tirelessly and productively for 12 hours .
Or the day where you :
Spend 8 hours gazing dejectedly into your screen .
Introduce a mistake that will take days to find and fix .
This variation is normal – if a little frustrating .
It also means that you should n’t judge your productivity by the output on any given day but rather by your average productivity over many days .
I have never seen this more clearly than when I was writing my first book .
Some days I ’d sit myself down in front of my laptop and find myself unable to string two words together .
Some mornings I banged out most of a chapter in a few hours .
Writing is a creative process .
I can do it when Im in the mood .
Trying to write when Im not , is a frustrating exercise in futility .
On the days where I could n’t write , I ’d go do something else .
Probably wakeboarding :)
The result : I wrote the book in record time ( a couple of months all told ) , the book turned out really well AND I enjoyed the writing process immensely .
Three things you can do about this :
Do n’t make project plans based only on your maximum productivity days .
Not every day will be like that .
Base your schedules on your average productivity .
Do n’t beat yourself up on the low - productivity days .
It ’s normal , it ’s part of the flow and these days have value too .
I like to think that on these days , my subconscious mind is working on some really hairy complicated problem for which the solution will suddenly appear fully formed in my mind .
If you do have a day where you get very little done , why not go home early and relax or get some private chores done ?
2 : Working more hours means getting less done
Whenever we fall behind , it ’s tempting to start working overtime to catch up .
Do n’t !
Instead , commit this graph to memory :
It comes from this excellent presentation on productivity .
Read it !
Here ’s another data point :
In 1991 , a client asked me to conduct a study on the effects of work hours on productivity and errors
My findings were quite simply that mistakes and errors rose by about 10 % after an eight - hour day and 28 % after a 10 - hour day I also found that productivity decreased by half after the eighth hour of work .
In other words , half of all overtime costs were wasted since it was taking twice as long to complete projects .
After the study was done , a concerted effort was made to increase staffing .
( Source )
This may be counter - intuitive but it ’s important to grasp :
For knowledge workers there is no simple relationship between hours worked and output !
Three things you can do about this :
Do n’t work permanent overtime .
In fact , some studies indicate that knowledge workers are the most productive when they work 35 hours a week .
Take breaks during the work day and make sure to take vacations .
Experiment to find out what schedule works best for you .
Five eight - hour days ?
Four longer days and a long weekend ?
3 : Working harder means getting less done
In an industrial environment , you can most often work harder and get more done .
An increase in effort means an increase in productivity .
For knowledge workers , the opposite is true .
You ca n’t force creativity , eloquence , good writing , clear thinking or fast learning – in fact , working harder tends to create the opposite effect and you achieve much less .
Three things you can do about this :
Take the pressure off yourself and your team .
Even if you make a mistake or miss a deadline the world probably is n’t going to end .
Less pressure means higher productivity .
Schedule a work load equivalent to only 80 % of your work week .
Trust me , you wo n’t be wasting your remaining 20 % – but you will be more relaxed and more creative .
In the words of Fred Gratzon : “ If it feels like work , you ’re doing it wrong ” .
If you find that most of what you do is a struggle , this is a sure sign that you are not at your most creative and productive .
4 : Procrastination can be good for you
In an industrial setting , any time away from the production line is unproductive time – therefore all procrastination is bad .
Search for procrastination on google and youll find a massive number of articles on how to stop procrastinating and get stuff done .
They will tell you that there is only one reliable way to get stuff done :
Check todo - list for next item Complete item no matter what it is Go to step 1
Theyll tell you that if only you had enough willpower , backbone , self - control and discipline , this is how you would work too .
Well guess what : Knowledge workers dont work that way .
Sometimes you re in the mood for task X and doing X is ridiculously easy and a lot of fun .
Sometimes doing X feels worse than walking barefoot over burning - hot , acid - covered , broken glass and forcing yourself to do it anyway is a frustrating exercise in futility .
Sometimes procrastinating is exactly the right thing to do at a particular moment .
This is largely ignored by the procrastination - is - a - sign - of - weakness , the - devil - finds - work - for - idle - hands crowd .
Three things you can do about this :
Procrastinate without guilt .
Do not beat yourself up for procrastinating .
Everybody does it once in a while .
It doesnt make you a lazy bastard or a bad person .
If you leave a task for later , but spend all your time obsessing about the task you re not doing , it does nothing good for you .
Take responsibility , so that when you choose to procrastinate , you make sure to update your deadlines and commitments .
Let people know , that your project will not be finished on time and give them a new deadline .
Remember that “ Time you enjoy wasting is not wasted ” ( according to John Lennon ) .
5 : Happiness is the ultimate productivity enhancer
The single most efficient way to increase your productivity is to be happy at work .
No system , tool or methodology in the world can beat the productivity boost you get from really , really enjoying your work .
Im not knocking all the traditional productivity advice out there  its not that its bad or deficient .
It s just that when you apply it in a job that basically doesnt make you happy , you re trying to fix something at a surface level when the problem goes much deeper .
Three things you can do about this :
Get happy in the job you have .
There are many things you can do to improve your work situation  provided you choose to do something , rather than wait for someone else to come along and do it for you .
Remember to appreciate what is already good about your job .
Often we forget , and overfocus on all the annoyances , problems and jerks .
This is a natural tendency called negativity bias , but it also tends to keep us unhappy because we forget what works .
If all else fails , find a new job where you can be happy .
If your current job is not fixable , dont wait  move on now !
The upshot
The industrial age view of productivity has serious limitations when applied to knowledge workers – but it remains the dominant view and still informs much of our thinking and many of our choices at work .
Let ’s change this !
This is not without it ’s challenges .
The old view of productivity may no longer apply , but it does give managers an illusion of control and predictability .
The new rules are … messy .
Less predictable .
They rely less on charts and graphs – and more on how people feel on any given day .
It ultimately comes down to this :
Do we want to stick with a model that is comforting and predictable but wrong or are we ready to face what REALLY works ?
Your take
What about you ?
When are you the most productive ?
What is your optimal number of working hours per week ?
What stimulates or destroys your productivity ?
Please write a comment , I ’d love to know your take .

Can you get married over the phone ?
By Kathryn Westcott
BBC News
A marriage is a time for celebration and joy , and cricketer Shoaib Malik will no doubt be eager to put the embarrassing episode of his first marriage far behind him before getting hitched to Indian tennis star Sania Mizra next week .
Smooth operator : Malik was apparently married over the phone in 2002
There will be a huge difference between the two marriages - he 'll be present in person for this one , not merely on the end of a telephone line .
Malik is reported to have conducted an internet and telephone relationship with Ayesha Siddiqui from Hyderabad , finally tying a long - distance knot with her in 2002 .
According to a story on the front page of the Indian daily newspaper The Hindu , telephone marriage has taken off among Indian Muslims , and in many Muslim countries .
" Marriages are made in heaven .
But in this age of information technology they are taking place over the net and telephone too , " it says .
But many people , it continues , have been left " wondering whether telephonic marriage is legitimate at all . "
' Everything is possible '
The Times of India has reported that Muslim clerics are divided over the legitimacy of " phone marriage " , with one arguing that it is not valid because the witnesses need to be present , alongside the bride and groom , to sign the marriage contract .
Ayesha Siddiqui's mother says she is happy with the divorce " Telephone nikah ( matrimonial contract ) is no longer valid , simply because all four parties cannot be at the same place to sign the nikahnama ( wedding registration certificate ) if the nikah is taking place over the telephone , with the bride and groom in different cities or countries , " Mohammed Khader Ali , Sadar Qazi , chief Qazi of Hyderabad , was quoted as saying .
But international lawyer Gabriel Sawma , an authority on Sharia law - including Islamic marriage contracts - argues that telephone marriages , and even internet marriages , could be perfectly legal .
" There are so many cases of marriages being conducted in so many different ways - everything is possible within reason , " he told the BBC News website .
Both the Malik and Siddiqui families are said to follow the Hanafi school of Islamic tradition .
Mr Sawma explained that in his view , a marriage contract agreed upon by a telephone conversation is valid as long as it satisfies the main Hanafi requirements , including : a proposal to marry and acceptance by the other party
providing witnesses : two male witnesses or one male and two females attesting that they heard the telephone conversation
a financial or " mahr " provision
The mahr , he explains , is an amount of money , or any object that has value , that will be given by the groom to the future bride .
" Mahr is an obligation on the husband and is a necessary component of any Islamic marriage contract , " said Mr Sawma .
In the Hanafi tradition , the mahr is divided into a " muqaddam " ( upfront ) , to be paid at the time of signing of the contract and a muakhar ( deferred ) to be paid at the time of divorce or death , he explained .
Quickie divorce
He said that the proposal must be clearly expressed and it must be met with a clear acceptance .
The husband has the right to divorce his wife by simply stating : ' I divorce you , I divorce you , I divorce you . '
Gabriel Sawma , international lawyer " Should these three elements occur , the marriage will be considered legal and binding .
The contract does not have to be written .
It can be verbal and will have the full force of the law under Islamic Sharia , " said Mr Sawma .
He drew parallels with the practice of couples entering into a marriage via correspondence , centuries ago .
" As long as the letters contained all the requirements and were signed in front of witnesses , this would constitute a marriage contract , " he said .
Given the level of interest in the marriage , Shoaib will be no doubt thankful that the divorce was relatively straightforward .
In a number of countries - including India - a Muslim man can divorce his wife in a matter of minutes .
This has included divorce by mail , over the phone and even via mobile phone text messages .
" In the Hanafi jurisprudence , the husband has the right to divorce his wife at any time or in any place at will by simply stating : ' I divorce you , I divorce you , I divorce you , ' says Mr Sawma .
His wife will be immediately divorced if there are at least two male witnesses .
The husband is then obligated to give " nafaqa " ( alimony ) to his wife for three months .
Shoaib has apparently agreed to pay 15,000 rupees ( about $ 337 ; £ 220 ) to Ayesha for three months .
According to many reports , Shoaib 's divorce means that he is now free to marry Sania next week .
But technically , they could have got married anyway , as Islam allows a man to take four wives as long as he is able to meet all their needs .

London , England ( CNN ) --
The Vatican may have forgiven the Beatles over the weekend for their " satanic " messages -- but Ringo Starr , the legendary band 's drummer , says he could n't care less .
In a tribute published to mark the 40th anniversary of the breakup of the band , who singer John Lennon once claimed were " more popular than Jesus , " the Vatican newspaper " L'Osservatore Romano " said it had forgiven them and called them a " precious jewel . "
But Starr told CNN : " Did n't the Vatican say we were satanic or possibly satanic -- and they 've still forgiven us ?
I think the Vatican , they 've got more to talk about than the Beatles . "
Starr was speaking to CNN's Becky Anderson about the launch of his latest solo album called " Y Not , " which was released in January .
Did you know McCartney had trouble learning the guitar ?
Find out why in our interactive
" I was sitting around in LA and I went on the synth and just got some rhythm patterns with some chords I enjoyed and then drummed to that , " Starr said .
" We had no song and we just played something and kept it moving and that 's how it all happened . "
Take the CNN Challenge : Beatles quiz
The album is Starr 's 15th album as a solo artist .
Starr also responded to allegations that he had asked his fans to " back off " and explained why he no longer signs autographs .
" I just said to fans that I 'm not signing anymore , " Starr said .
" That what it was , it was n't back off , I 'm not a vicious man .
I do n't sign anymore , people say sign this and I just say no . "
OTTAWA — Former prime minister Brian Mulroney broke his own ethics code , engaged in inappropriate behaviour and evaded the truth for years by purposely concealing hefty cash payments he got from lobbyist Karlheinz Schreiber , a federal inquiry judge has found .
Justice Jeffrey Oliphant also concluded Monday there is no credible evidence Mulroney performed any services for the $ 300,000 that Schreiber said he paid him in three instalments in 1993 and 1994 to lobby on behalf of a plan to build armoured vehicles in Canada for export .
Oliphant 's scathing indictment of Mulroney 's conduct was released Monday in a four - volume report that stopped short of accusing the former prime minister of lying under oath in a 1996 hearing about his relationship with Schreiber , but cut him little slack on almost all the main issues .
The major exceptions were Oliphant 's finding that Mulroney did not reach a deal to work with Schreiber while he was still prime minister on June 23 , 1993 , as Schreiber alleged , and that his job was to lobby internationally , and not domestically as Schreiber alleged .
Mulroney , who watched Oliphant 's televised statement from Toronto , said in a statement he was " pleased " by those conclusions .
" I genuinely regret that my conduct after I left office gave rise to suspicions about the propriety of my personal business affairs as a private citizen , " he added .
" I will leave it to others to assess the full impact of these events .
For now , I am merely grateful that this unfortunate chapter is over and that my family and I can move forward with our lives . "
That may be wishful thinking .
Oliphant 's findings have already spurred renewed opposition calls for the government to move to recover the $ 2.1 million Mulroney got in an out - of - court settlement of a libel suit over allegations he had received millions of dollars in kickbacks in the so - called Airbus affair .
Oliphant said Schreiber 's three cash payments to Mulroney could n't be written off simply as an " error in judgment , " as Mulroney has argued , because it happened on " three distinct " occasions .
" The conduct exhibited by Mr. Mulroney in accepting cash - stuffed envelopes from Mr. Schreiber on three separate occasions , failing to record the fact of the cash payments , failing to deposit the cash into a bank or other financial institution , and failing to disclose the fact of the cash payments when given the opportunity to do so goes a long way , in my view to supporting my position that the financial dealings between Mr. Schreiber and Mr. Mulroney were inappropriate , " he said .
Mulroney said he received $ 225,000 , not $ 300,000 as Schreiber testified , and admitted he waited seven years to declare the income to tax authorities .
Oliphant said he could not determine which dollar figure was correct , but he clearly did n't consider the dollar value as important as what it said about Mulroney 's conduct .
Quoting the ethics standard Mulroney demanded of his own ministers when he was in power , Oliphant said the former prime minister 's dealings with Schreiber " do not reflect the highest standards of conduct , nor do they represent conduct that is so scrupulous it will bear the closest public scrutiny . "
Think back over the first week and a bit of the campaign , and I 'll bet there is only one row that you can remember – Labour national insurance rises versus
Tory spending cuts .
The only subject in town has been how we pay off the bill from the financial crisis , and although the politicians are far from fully frank about it , if you follow things closely you will have picked up clear hints as to how more of the funds will be found .
All three parties have refused to rule out VAT rises , and all three have effectively signalled that public servants from teachers to refuse collectors can expect a pension cut .
With payback time in prospect for ordinary people , it is astonishing that there has been precious little debate about how it was that the great bill was racked up in the first place .
David Cameron carps a bit about Gordon Brown 's imprudence during the good years , and Brown mutters about global economic tides , but in place of the usual elephant , we have a bull and a bear in the room .
As is well familiar , City whizz kids fuelled by supersize bonuses made complex bets with other people 's dough , and when it all went wrong the government had to step in with a bailout which , in its different forms , came to £ 1.5 trillion .
And the books were further battered by the collateral damage which the financiers had done to the wider economy .
In a saner world , the election campaign would be dominated by the question of how to ensure that nothing similar can ever happen again , with the second great question being how to ensure that those who made the mess paid as much as possible towards cleaning it up .
Neither question , however , has received systematic attention .
The best we 've had on the Labour side is Brown 's reheating of some proposals on bankers ' bonuses , and the concession ( or what passes for a concession on planet Mandelson ) from the business secretary that New Labour might have erred in being too unquestioning about deregulation .
The Tory manifesto did propose a vague banking tax , but Cameron 's own stand against fat - cattery , launched in the pages of the Guardian last week , missed the point completely because it was about high - paid public servants , as opposed to still higher - paid City folk .
A week ago the Telegraph actually ran the headline – " Tory win best for the economy say top bankers " – perfectly epitomising a campaign that has utterly failed to reflect how far things have changed .
An over - boiling housing market fuelled frenzied City schemes for repackaging and passing on debt .
But instead of proposals to stop it reheating again while keeping prices affordable , the campaign was prefigured by Labour 's budget swiping a stamp - duty cut from the Tories , exactly the sort of tax bribe which stoked the flames in the first place .
Businesses still struggle to get their hands on money to do productive things , and yet – despite the nationalisation of so many banks – not a squeak is heard about any public role in directing investment .
And where on the campaign trail are the calls for the money men to take a longer - term interest in the firms that they work with ?
Whereof they have nothing to say , thereof they pass over in silence .
King Abdullah and Crown Prince Sultan flanked by 40 women in abayas but mostly with their faces bare
King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia is not normally associated with radical moves but the 85 - year - old monarch is making waves with signals encouraging greater tolerance of women 's rights .
In recent days Abdullah 's appearance in an unusual group photograph has become a talking point across his realm and the wider Arab world .
The king and his brother Crown Prince Sultan were flanked by 40 women dressed in modest abayas but mostly with their faces bare , a novelty that is seen as evidence of rare liberalism at the top .
The king 's pose , at a conference in the southern city of Najran last month , is big news because it appears to challenge the norm in a country where unrelated men and women are kept strictly apart , women are covered from head to toe and alcohol and women 's driving are banned .
Under Saudi law a woman must not leave home without a male " guardian " ( her father , husband or brother ) to whom she is legally subordinated .
" I think this is a great picture and everyone is talking about it , " said Dr Maha Muneef , a prominent physician and government adviser .
" This is a picture that sent a message that it is OK to work with women ... and that there 's nothing wrong with that . "
Overzealous enforcement by the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice – the morality police – is routinely criticised by liberals .
Saudi and foreign observers detected royal intervention when the commission suddenly reversed a decision to sack Sheikh Ahmad al - Ghamdi , its head for the Mecca region , after he questioned whether Islam in fact required gender segregration .
Ghamdi's swift reinstatement was widely interpreted as a vote of confidence by the palace in reformist ideas .
The presence of the crown prince in the group photograph , which was distributed to selected media by the palace , suggested a pointer to future policies .
There have been other signs that the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques , to use Abdullah 's full title , is challenging the ultra - conservative Wahhabi religious establishment that has ruled in tandem with the House of Saud since the modern kingdom was created in the 1920s .
Last autumn he sacked a senior cleric who demanded that religious scholars vet the curriculum at the new $ 10bn co-educational international science university near the Red Sea city of Jeddah .
Shortly before that he appointed Noura al - Faiz as the country 's first woman deputy cabinet minister , although the limits of her position were quickly underlined when PR officials removed her image from a group photograph taken with her male boss .
Analysts warn that opposition to these sorts of changes should not be underestimated .
In February Sheikh Abdul - Rahman al - Barrak , another hardline independent cleric , issued a fatwa calling for opponents of gender segregation to be killed if they refused to abandon their ideas .
" Anyone who accepts that his daughter , sister or wife works with men or attends mixed - gender schooling cares little about his honour and this is a type of pimping , " he said .
This week Barrak drew fire from a Riyadh judge , Sheikh Issa al - Ghaith , who accused him of " raising discord " and " inciting brother against brother " .
Speculation is mounting that there will be more substantial changes , including the prospect that women may be allowed to drive .
Sceptics insist they need to see substance .
" There are some good signs but we need to see women lawyers in court and women driving if the changes are to be real and tangible , " said Mai Yamani , an independent Saudi scholar .
" Having pictures of women with the king is very nice , but if you compare Saudi Arabia even with the other Gulf countries this is still all very timid . "

A fine book
This is an excellent and concise book on the problems of IP .
The printing is also fine .
by Andrew
from Rochester , NY
It IS available for free - read into a podcast AND as a .pdf
Great book - it called me to question what is considered one of the most fundamental tenants of our socio-political system .
I was very skeptical before listening to the book .
After , I 'm just a changed person .
Neo -Marxism ?
I find it hard to believe you actually read the book .
by Craig
from Sacramento Neo -Marxism at its best !
I have been slogging through this work online and have to say that this is a work that any social constructivist with Marxian foundations would love .
His argument is indistinguishable from the ones made by Kautsky and the socialists going back 100 years .
These ideas were constantly refuted by all classical liberal lovers of liberty ; it is sad and shocking that the LVMI have adopted them .
I do not understand how the Austrians who understand property rights so well have a problem understanding that intellectual property is just as valid as tangible property and that confiscation of ones intellectual property is just as much a theft as confiscation of ones tangible property .
In this I think Galambo ’s had it right where property rights are concerned and the Neo- Austrians have it dead wrong .
In this one issue I part ways with the ASE .
by Sam G .
Missing the point
Very well written and presented .
This is a belief that I came to on my own , so it is nice to see an intellectual person presenting the same POV ( given , in a much moe comprehensive and intelligent way ) .
To those who say , " Why should n't I claim this as my own work , then ? " :
There is a difference between using and benefitting from the work of another man without license and claiming authorship of another man 's work .
The first is ethical and acceptable IMO .
The second is fraud .
This POV does n't put forth the idea than anyone should be able to claim anything as his own creation , rather it suggests that I should be able to take what Kinsella has written and reproduce and redistribute it as I see fit without gaining license from the author to do so .
Apply the same principle to fine art .
I may paint a very good copy of Vincent Van Gogh 's Starry Night , but to claim it as the original would be fraud , as it clearly is not the original , but a copy .
by Jason
from Sterling , VA Probing Questions for Thought
Yes there is dead weight loss from a product not reaching everyone it could but the question is , and I do n't know the answer , is this school of economic thought for optimization of economic systems or for individual freedoms .
I still think it is a freedom to be allowed to create something that is exclude - able .
It the argument that statutory law should keep all non-competitive goods from being exclude - able .
I thought law was good when it is just contract law .
I can easily write up a contract that would exclude a customer from spreading my creation after receiving my deliverable even without patent law .
Is that contract a burden for society .
Two adults were in agreement to the contract and there is nothing wrong with it .
If a contract between two people is considered a burden for society then your thinking does n't seem very Austrian .
Sorry .
I 've been studying austian for about a year and it 's taught me to probe .

Exclusive : Tyler Perry Dares to Mess With the Hitchcock
By Dustin Rowles | Industry | April 22 , 2010 |
Tyler Perry , the successful director behind Racial Stereotype , Religious Exploitation , and Inspirationally Misogynist Piece of Shit , Too , is developing It Had to Be Murder , based on the same Cornell Woolrich 1942 short story that inspired both Hitchock ’s Rear Window and Shia LaBeouf ’s Disturbia .
The story is about Hal Jeffries , confined to a wheelchair with a broken leg and allowed only to survey the daily lives of his neighbors across the courtyard .
He discovers that one of them is a murderer and that he ’s the next victim .
Sound familiar ?
The good news here is that Perry is only producing .
The bad news is that he ’s producing through his shingle , 34th Street Films , which he specifically started to bring in other writers and directors to extend Perry ’s brand .
Which is to say , he wants to develop a Rear Window that appeals to the sentiment of his demographic .
In other words , we can look forward to Madea in a wheelchair .
Dustin is the founder and co-owner of Pajiba .

Toddler Birthdays using Inflatable Jumpers
If the Corona Virus , Covid19 has your family feeling trapped , short - tempered , or discontent you may want to do something new and exciting for your toddler .
We will all feel like celebrating when this pandemic is over , even our children , but you may not want to wait that long .
Most toddlers are happiest when they can move .
They love to jump and squeal with pleasure , especially when no one is telling them that they cannot .
Create a special day , rather it is a birthday surprise or a family celebration , that will set your families bored spirits free and create excitement with a toddler bounce house .
There are many different kinds to choose from for party rentals , and none of them will disappoint you or your child .
Inflatable Bouncers With Slides
These bouncers are the perfect size for toddlers .
They can come with different shapes and styles and their bright colors and huge size alone can put complete awe in the eyes of your toddler .
Some have long slides that have easy access and that land into the cushy softness inside the jumping structure .
Most have a short slide that the toddler will enjoy using as an exit just to climb back in .
They can jump , slide , dance , and bounce on the larger jumpers with enough room for friends , or one that is the perfect size for just one child .
Themed Inflatables
If your toddler has a special love in their life already you may be delighted to find that there are many different themes available in inflatables .
The fire - station bouncy houses are very popular .
Your little king or princess may like a bouncy castle complete with towers .
There are dinosaurs , crayons , semi- trucks , castles , and many different inflatables meant especially for toddlers .
Many of the toddler - sized inflatables can be set up in a large room inside the house or a basement or garage so that the theme can be enlarged during a party or to allow for play during inclement weather .
A Look At What To Expect With Rentals
You can research different businesses in your area to get a general impression of the things rental companies may offer .
Some companies say that if you will mark your yard where you want the inflatable set up , they will come out and set it up without ever needing to have personal contact with you .
This is a precaution for your family and their employees caused by the Corona Virus .
Things To Watch For When You Rent An Inflatable
Always note the size of the party rentals that may catch your interest .
Some of them are very large .
Most toddler bounce houses are 20 ft. in width and 25ft in Length .
Some of them will include a Height of 16 ft .
Make sure that you will be able to use your receptacle to plug the fan up with .
Most of them require only one 15 amp outlet .
When you are renting for toddlers , visibility will be important .
Some of them will say that they have a viewing window , or that they provide safety viewing built into their structure , and they may say that there are no blind spots .
If you decide on an inflatable that uses water , you will need to be able to reach from your water source to the inflatable with your hose .
About Inflatable Jumpers
Most bounce houses are made with nylon or nylon and PVC together to increase their strength and life span and to provide softness .
The insides may have slides , pop-ups , obstacles , or a climbing area .
At the bottom of the slide , there should be a protective space with at least a little height to prevent children from bouncing out of the structure when landing .
There will be a weight limit on most toddler - friendly inflatables of 300 lbs .
Though they are made with toddlers in mind , most of them will safely thrill and entertain children as old as five or six years of age for hours at a time .
Find the perfect bouncy castle to allow yourself and your family an emotional break from this Corona - induced stress as you rest and watch your toddler get more exercise than they may have gotten in weeks .
Backers of the ethnic cleansing law in Arizona claim that nationwide calls for boycotts of Arizona wo n't amount to much .
Maybe they will , or maybe they wo n't , but this wo n't be so easy to laugh off .
The Mexican government warned its citizens Tuesday to use extreme caution if visiting Arizona because of a tough new law that requires all immigrants and visitors to carry U.S. - issued documents or risk arrest .
Why should this worry Arizona ?
Because Arizona is heavily dependent ( PDF ) on the tourism industry .
From the state 's tourism board 2008 annual report ( the last year they have available ) :
The total ( direct and secondary ) impact of the Arizona travel industry in 2008 was 310,000 jobs and $ 10.2 billion earnings .
Of that amount , Mexico is a huge percentage ( PDF ) .
The results of this study , as in the past , demonstrate the economic importance of Mexican visitor spending to Arizona ’s economy .
Close to 23,400 wage and salary jobs in Arizona at eating and drinking establishments , retail establishments and other spending - related sectors are directly attributable to Mexican visitor spending .
Through local purchases of supplies by businesses and the spending of income derived from visitor - related jobs , these visitors generated almost 7,000 additional jobs in Arizona in 2007 - 08 .
These jobs account for a total income of $ 837.24 million and $ 3.61 billion in sales .
That 's over 30,000 jobs in the tourism trade alone , that Arizona xenophobes have put at serious risk .
It gets worse .
Those doubting the success of any domestic boycott should note this :
With Arizona ’s international visitorship decimated , the state now must rely on domestic visitors — many of which come from liberal California , where cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles are seeking official boycotts of the state .
Late Tuesday , Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg ( D - Sacramento ) , leader of the California State Senate , also proposed a statewide boycott of Arizona .
Indeed , according to a 2008 report on domestic visitors ( PDF ) by the office of tourism , 34 percent of all visitors to Arizona came from California .
The next largest contributor , Texas , lagged far behind at 5 percent .
Liberal Washington , New York and Illinois constitute another 11 percent of the total .
I went down to Arizona for Spring Training two of the last three years .
No longer .
And while the Arizona tourist industry is now crying about being personally hurt by these budding boycotts , let 's note this :
In the end , while many in the hotel and hospitality industry are now crying foul and asking visitors to not hurt them personally — the Arizona Office of Tourism and the Greater Phoenix Economic Council were conspicuously silent as the anti-immigrant bill became a law .
Neither wanted to touch the political hot potato , but now both are paying a price for their laissez - faire attitude .
If they do n't want to be hurt by this boycott , they need to lobby their state legislature and governor to change mid-course .
And note , it wo n't be enough to have the courts strike this travesty down .
Those elected officials need this law off the books before I step foot in Arizona ever again , and I 'm not alone in that assessment .
Any sort of legal ambiguity wo n't make Latinos ( or any other non-Anglo people ) feel any safer when Arizona law enforcement is already stepping up their harassment even though the law has n't yet been fully implemented .
Both Tony Abbott and former staffer David Kemp appealed to Malcolm Fraser not to leave the Liberal Party , reveals his biographer Margaret Simons .
As part of our 15th birthday celebrations , we ’ve trawled through the archives to bring you some of the best , weirdest and most salacious articles published on Crikey since our launch on February 14 , 2000 .
* This article was originally published on May 26 , 2010 .
Three weeks ago , Malcolm Fraser and I were signing books outside a tent in the tiny town of Clunes , two hours ’ drive north - west of Melbourne , when one of the people queued up for our signatures asked him if he was still a member of the Liberal Party .
I held my breath .
Was this when the story would break ?
We had been on a two - month publicity tour together to promote our book , and I had been sure that the news of his resignation would come out in the first five minutes .
After all , he had been interviewed by some of the best political journalists in the country , and done dozens of public events .
He had even done the Canberra Press Club .
“ It ca n’t possibly remain a secret , ” I had told him in February as we awaited the book launch .
But I was wrong .
Fraser had told me he would not lie if asked a direct question , but nor would he do anything to publicise his decision .
Not one of the nation ’s journalists had asked that direct question .
Thanks for signing up
We look forward to seeing you bright and early with your need - to - know talking points and tidbits for the day ahead .

Was this it ?
Would the news break in tiny Clunes , thanks to a question from an ordinary member of the public ?
And would I , at last , be at liberty to write the story I had been restrained from writing ?
Fraser was silent for a beat , and then replied as he signed his name : “ I ’m still a liberal . ”
And the queue moved on .
He turned to me with a grin and a raised eyebrow .
Damn it .
Fraser resigned from the Liberal Party shortly after Tony Abbott came to the leadership .
He told me about it early this year , in confidence , as his co-author .
Naturally I wanted to break the story , but he held me to the confidence .
The deal was that when the news broke , I would be at liberty to write as I chose .
But not until then .
Over the following weeks I heard news of his negotiations with his former staffer David Kemp , now the President of the Victorian branch of the Liberal Party , and with Tony Abbott himself .
Both wanted him to sort out his disagreements with the party internally , or by writing articles and by arguing , rather than taking this final step .
But the decision was made .
It was not sudden , and it was not personal .
But it had been coming for a very long while .
Why did Fraser want to keep the resignation quiet ?
Largely , it was his old - fashioned sense of honour .
Leaving the party was a painful decision .
He had nearly left in 2001 , during the Howard government ’s handling of the Tampa affair .
He and Tamie stayed at that time by the skin of their teeth , partly out of loyalty to the liberal - minded members of the party who were battling within , and partly out of hope that the party would one day return to what Fraser saw as its true liberal roots .
The decision to leave , after Malcolm Turnbull was ousted as leader , represented the death of that hope .
Fraser , and even more particularly Tamie , felt that it would be indecent to publicise the decision , although they accepted that it would eventually come out .
They particularly did not want to be seen as using the move as part of a publicity campaign for the book .
“ Do you think it would really be that big a story ? ” he asked me .
I told him I thought it would be on the front pages , and he winced .
Yesterday , The Australian Financial Review ’s Laura Tingle , having apparently heard some gossip , rang Fraser to ask if it was true he had left the party .
He confirmed it , and then rang to release me from my obligation .
But today his telephones are all on divert , and he is uncontactable .
Leaving the party which he led , and which for so many years had seemed to him to be the best political expression of his ideals , was not a sudden move .
When Fraser first entered politics in the 1950s , he was a vehement anti-Communist .
He had come of age intellectually in idealistic post - war Oxford , through his study of the core philosophers of Liberalism , including John Stuart Mill , and John Locke .
Communism seemed to Fraser , and many others , the main threat to freedom .
Menzies ’ Liberal Party — founded , as Fraser saw it , not as a conservative force but as a progressive party committed to defending freedom and the rule of law — seemed the best embodiment of his own ideals .
He remained of that view for the next 40 years .
People often ask if Fraser has changed , without fully taking account of how much the world has changed around him over that time .
By the early 1990s the Berlin wall had fallen and the Communist threat was no more .
This , in Fraser ’s view , made a realignment necessary .
It was now not only possible , but necessary , to combat other threats to freedom .
In the eight years immediately following the defeat of his government in 1983 , Fraser spoke only sparingly on domestic politics .
Inside the party he urged Peacock and Howard to stop fighting and start cooperating .
The party and the country needed both of them , he believed .
He respected Howard ’s political abilities , and Peacock ’s liberal instincts .
But these discussions remained mostly internal to the party .
His relative abstinence on commenting about domestic politics came to an end in the early 1990s , when Australia was deep in recession and unemployment was in double digits .
One of the keys to understanding Fraser ’s character is that he is an activist .
Faced with a crisis , real or perceived , he almost never concludes that the right option is to do nothing .
He feels a sense of duty and obligation to act .
In this case , he began regular newspaper columns , with the first saying he was too concerned about Australia ’s future to remain silent .
He saw a new threat that he believed was in many ways the mirror image of the Communist menace that had first motivated him to enter politics .
The new threat was an unreasoning faith in free markets as an organising principle in human affairs .
In the following years , he was a frequent critic of the free market ideology of both the Liberal and Labor parties .
Nevertheless , he was enough of a loyal party member to support the election of Hewson in 1993 , after the notorious Fightback policy , which Fraser had vehemently criticised , was softened .
Fraser sought the federal presidency of the Liberal Party in the mid 1990s — against Tamie ’s advice .
He withdrew when it became clear he could not win .
By this time , a vote for Fraser could only mean a vote against Hewson , and the prevailing direction of the party .
In 1994 , when Hewson announced a ballot for the leadership , Fraser supported the team of Alexander Downer and Peter Costello against the other contender , John Howard .
He thought Howard had had his chance , and had brought only division .
Fraser had been close to Downer ’s father , and regarded him as “ a conservative in the best sense of the word ” .
The son he thought largely untried , but he chose to hope .
When Downer became leader , he wrote that he would give the party “ direction , conviction , enthusiasm and victory … for the first time in several years I am enthusiastic about the prospects for the future of the Party . ”
He was wrong , of course .
The untried son was soon floundering , and the party turned one last time to John Howard .
Fraser chose to be hopeful .
He wrote that Howard had “ broadened his vision and understanding ” since the 1980s , and that his experience would equip him well to respond to the challenges facing the party .
But he had many private misgivings .
They were confirmed , in his mind , when Pauline Hanson became a political force in 1996 , and Howard failed to condemn her .
Fraser was appalled .
In 1997 , he wrote to the party president , Tony Staley , urging him to use all his influence to prevent the Liberal Party from directing preferences to One Nation ahead of the Labor Party .
“ I regard Pauline Hanson , the ideas and policies implicit in her statements , as of extraordinary danger to the unity and cohesion of a fair - minded , democratic Australia …
It is vitally important that the Liberal Party remove itself as far as possible from the politics of Pauline Hanson , ” he wrote .
But he was unsuccessful .
From this point on , if not before , Fraser ’s relationship with his party was under enormous strain .
Over the next three years came Howard ’s failure to apologise to the stolen generations , the Tampa crisis and the inhumanity of the immigration detention camps .
Fraser spoke out on all these issues .
During the Tampa crisis , Fraser and Tamie sat up late debating whether they should leave the party .
They stayed largely out of loyalty to other members who shared their ideals .
Chief amongst these in the Fraser mindset was Petro Georgiou , formerly a staff member of Fraser ’s who remained in Parliament and challenged the Howard line on asylum seekers .
But in November , 2008 , as Fraser and I worked on the book together , Georgiou announced that he would retire at the next federal election .
Fraser considered Malcolm Turnbull , whatever his political talents , as a true liberal .
The way in which Turnbull was treated by the party room was not so much the straw that broke the camel ’s back as the final confirmation that the party would not return to liberalism in Malcolm Fraser ’s lifetime .
To anyone who had been watching , his resignation should not have come as a surprise .
Nor should the fact that , for the moment at least , he does n’t want to talk about it .
Fraser turned 80 last Friday .
He celebrated with a quiet day at home , followed by dinner with his family .
He has seen the political advertising the Liberal Party has used , playing up the supposed “ menace ” of boat people .
It confirms him in his views .
He is at terms with his sad and painful decision .
Margaret Simons co-wrote the recently released Malcolm Fraser : The Political Memoirs with the former prime minister .
The Bahrain International Circuit is just 10 m above sea level and has an average pressure ( approx . 1,000 mbar ) , so baseline engine power should be good .
The circuit has been extended from 5.412 km to 6.299 km for this year 's event which will place different demands on engine performance .
The track still has four significant straights , including the main start - finish straight which is just over 1 km in length , but the proportion of the lap spent at full throttle will be reduced .
Engine power will play a pivotal role down the straights , particularly in the first and final sectors of the lap .
The new ' Endurance ' section consists of eight corners over a distance of almost 0.9 km , which will give the gearbox more of a workout and will also result in higher engine temperatures .
Combining that with the usually dry warm air in Bahrain will make it harder to cool the engine through this new section of the track .
Drivers will therefore need to be mindful of maximising the flow of air to their car 's radiators and not spend too much time in the wake of cars ahead .
With refuelling no longer allowed , fuel efficiency will be a key factor in the outcome of the race , particularly with the longer track configuration .
The potential tactic of running the engine lean to obtain greater fuel efficiency may exaggerate cooling problems and so finding clean air is likely to be a significant advantage .
Fast Facts
Bahrain will mark Cosworth 's return to Formula One as an engine supplier after a three year sabbatical .
Cosworth is supplying its CA2010 engines to four teams ; AT&T Williams , HRT F1 , Lotus Racing and Virgin Racing .
Cosworth V8 power helped the Williams team claim the fastest lap of the race in the 2006 event
Engine manufacturers are no longer permitted to add extra filters to prevent the intake of the Bahraini desert sand .
Filters are deemed to be a homologated part of the engine and are , as such , fixed as part of the engine freeze regulations .
The new - look Bahrain circuit is now the second longest circuit on the calendar , 0.705 km shorter than Spa - Francorchamps in Belgium .

A clampdown on clinics offering MOT health checks to the worried well – which can include whole body scans – was signalled by the government today , amid concerns over the exposure of healthy people to unnecessary radiation .
The Department of Health said it accepted all nine recommendations of the government 's advisory committee on medical aspects of radiation in the environment ( Comare ) , which called for action more than two years ago .
Comare warned that CT ( X - ray computed tomography ) scans could increase a person 's cancer risk .
It wanted whole body scans , which are carried out on a speculative basis to see if anything might be wrong , to be banned , on the basis that the risk from exposure to radiation exceeded the benefit .
It said CT - scanning machines were contributing significantly to the radiation exposure of the population .
Some 15 % of our exposure in the UK comes from medical sources – almost half of that from CT scans .
Calling for greater regulation of CT scans , Comare recommended an end to their use for spinal conditions , osteoporosis and assessing body fat .
There was a limited case , however , for the continuation of CT scanning for heart disease among those of intermediate risk and for colon cancer , though only in the over - 50s unless referred by a specialist .
But while the government says it fully backs Comare 's conclusions , its response stops short of any kind of ban .
Instead , the Department of Health says it will ask the Royal College of Radiologists and the Royal College of Physicians to prepare guidance for doctors " based on the balance of risk and benefit involved in the CT - scanning procedures concerned " .
It says that commercial CT scans will be reclassified as " individual health assessments " to make it clear they are not diagnostic scans , and they will be brought under greater regulation within the private clinics .
CT scans can be 400 times more powerful than chest X - rays , it points out .
Because they are carried out in private clinics on a commercial basis , the patient does not see their GP who would be able to weigh the likely benefit to the individual against the risk .
The health minister , Gillian Merron , said : " I am grateful to Comare for its work in this important area .
" Any scan a patient undergoes should balance the clinical benefits against the risks of the radiation involved .
I welcome the decision to define more closely the considerations that should govern CT scanning in cases of individual health assessments . "
" I look forward to working with the royal colleges of radiologists and physicians to develop practitioner guidance . "
Private screenings can cost many hundreds of pounds .
Sometimes they appear to show problems which are in fact only benign , harmless abnormalities .
This causes anxiety to the patient and may even lead to unnecessary investigations – often paid for by the NHS .
An average CT scan is said to be associated with a one in 2,000 lifetime risk of developing a cancer , which is low compared with the average normal lifetime risk of one in four .
But , said the Comare report , the risk should not be dismissed .
" If 100,000 people undergo a CT scan every five years from age 40 to 70 years … then the estimated impact is approximately 240 excess fatalities , " it said .
Even on ice , things can heat up .
Belanger lined up for a front - wheel - drive heat in his 1995 Acura Integra , which he bought for $ 200 and fitted with a roll cage .
His car , No. 35 , has a sticker that reads , “ Does not race well with others . ”
Drivers revved their engines .
They took to the track , passing one another , skidding across the ice and settling themselves after 180s or 360s .
Bumpers touched .
Belanger came off the ice .
His Acura had to be towed after a knock with another car .
“ He blew my chances for a championship , ” Belanger said .
“ It ’s broken .
The whole right front suspension is junk . ”
But there was some hope .
A small orange car was lying around , and Belanger used in the final heat .
Troy Washburn was gearing up for the rear - wheel - drive final , tinkering with his 1992 Buick along with D. J. Ellis , a mechanic .
“ It ’s a granny mobile made awesome , ” Ellis said .
Most cars are fitted with a roll cage because flipping is such a hazard on ice .
Asphalt is a faster surface , Washburn said , but ice is more fun and requires better driving .
“ This is slower , but harder to control , ” Washburn said .
The tires on each car are chained , allowing for better traction .
Drivers say that turning on ice requires finesse — turn too much , and you will spin out ; do n’t turn enough , and the turn will not happen .
Drivers must also strain to prevent the car from fishtailing .
Ellis , who does not race , said racing on ice added a whole new element for spectators .
“ You ’re on the ice , and cars are going by and all these ice chips are going up .
It ’s like watching a magic trick , ” he said .
April 16 , 2010  -- Steven Seagal has a " unique physiological reaction to sexual arousal , " according to a sexual harassment complaint filed by his ex-assistant , Kayden Nguyen , but until the case against the star goes to court , everyone involved is keeping mum as to what might be .
Nguyen 's formal sexual harassment complaint , filed Monday , spends two paragraphs discussing the existence of said " reaction " and the ability of others who have seen Seagal aroused to verify it .
For now , however , Nguyen and her attorney , William Waldo , say they have no intention of sharing specifics .
" I understand why you 're asking about it , " Waldo said , " but I ca n't go into specifics .
There is something he does -- he knows what it is and she does and everyone else who has had a similar experience with Mr. Seagal knows . "
Seagal 's manager , David Unger , has also declined to comment on the issue .
Seagal 's attorney , Marty Singer , did not respond to inquiries about Seagal 's " reaction " but in a written statement he said that the lawsuit " is a ridiculous and absurd claim by a disgruntled ex-employee who was fired for using illegal narcotics . "
Why all the secrecy ?
Waldo says it goes beyond protecting the actor 's privacy , which he admits is one factor .
But he said that this alleged secret reaction has become a way to identify other alleged sexual harassment victims of Seagal's .
" There are a lot of real victims of Mr. Seagal who are now coming forward , " Waldo said , " and as you can imagine , there are also people who are n't real victims " but who want to claim that they were " for the attention . "
Because of the unique and exceptional nature of Seagal 's sexual " reaction , " Waldo said , intimate knowledge of this trait has helped him separate the wheat from the chaff among those claiming to have been assaulted , Waldo said .
If " someone comes forward and says ' I know what that physiological thing is ' , and they really do , that helps their credibility . "
If they do n't mention it , he said , they most likely have not had sexual interactions , consensual or otherwise , with the star .
" These are n't casual allegations , " Waldo adds in response to Singer 's allegations that Nguyen 's claims are fabricated , " they 're serious and verified under penalty of perjury , because they 're true . "
In response to Singer 's statement , Waldo also said that Nguyen " was not ' fired ' , she escaped " and that " the allegation about ' using illegal narcotics ' is false . "
Strange Sex
While the details will remain hush - hush for the moment , the allegation raises questions : most notably , have bizarre physiological reactions to sexual arousal been noted in others ?
ABC News had sexual health experts weigh in on the strange things that sometimes happen when people get turned on .
When a man or a woman becomes sexually aroused , a series of events take place that ready the body for sex .
" The process starts with a reaction to some sexual stimulus ... experienced as a state of excitement and awareness of [ the manifestations of ] arousal , such as an increased heart rate , " said Dr. John Bancroft , former director of the Kinsey Institute for Sex , Gender and Reproduction .
The eyes dilate , blood flow to the genitalia increases , breathing accelerates , and blood pressure kicks it up a notch .
Why would an unexpected bodily reaction take place alongside this normal physiological chain ?
" The brain works as a whole , but is also compartmentalized ; it 's possible to have a wire crossed , " said Dr. Gil Wilshire , a reproductive endocrinologist at Mid-Missouri Reproductive Medicine and Surgery .
" This is how we get things like synesthesia , where people smell colors or see sounds , " he said , and this kind of glitch in the brain can lead to strange side effects during arousal and orgasm as the brain becomes flooded with activity .
Arousal can produce compulsive sneezing in some , spontaneous tears for others , he said , and more commonly , women will urinate a bit .
" Some girls call it spending a penny , " Wilshire said , referring to the small loss of urine during arousal or orgasm .
Given that the same nerve serves the genital and urinary system , " it 's easy to see how one affects the other , " Wilshire said .
Michael Castleman , sex educator , counselor and founder of GreatSexAfter40.com , added that " sneezing and crying are the two that are most widely noted .
They 're just about emotional release and people release emotions differently . "
" When it comes to human sexuality and the human sexual arousal response there is a tremendous degree of variation , " said Dr. David Greenfield of the Healing Center in West Hartford , Conn .
" Although there is a range of behavior that is ' normal ' there are many idiosyncratic sexual arousal responses that people have . "
As to Seagal 's alleged idiosyncrasy , Greenfield " cannot guess what [ it ] might be , " but says that " there are many unique responses that we have that seem unusual and in some cases they are less unusual then we might think . "
Waldo said that Nguyen will present her detailed description of Seagal 's alleged " unique reaction to arousal " at the trial .
No court date has been set at this time .
Thrill - seekers in France unimpressed by skydiving , rock climbing and other extreme sports are turning to designer kidnapping to test their limits .
For a £ 1000 ( $ 1633 ) basic abduction package , participants are seized by strangers , bundled into a car , bound and gagged , and kept in a cellar for four hours .
No kidding ... ( right ) for about $ 1600 , you can be seized by strangers , bundled into a car , bound and gagged , and kept in a cellar for four hours , much like the 1997 film The Game ( left ) , which starred Michael Douglas .
If that sounds too tame , boat chases and helicopter escapes can be added to the tailor - made experience , and clients kept for longer periods .
The maximum incarceration is 11 hours .
The website of Ultime Realite , a company in Besancon , eastern France , said : " You will go through the real sensations of violence , terror and fear of a real kidnapping – a psychological shock that you wo n't forget in a hurry . "
President Obama is not a socialist , Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) told conservatives gathered at the Southern Republican Leadership Conference today .
" The question has been raised about whether or not our president is a socialist , " Paul said , according to Talking Points Memo .
" I am sure there are some people here who believe it , " Paul said .
" But in the technical sense , in the economic definition of a what a socialist is , no he 's not a socialist . "
Paul went on to call Obama a " corporatist " instead :
" He 's a corporatist , " Paul continued .
" And unfortunately we have corporatists inside the Republican Party and that means you take care of corporations and corporations take over and run the country . "
Paul said examples of President Obama 's " corporatism " was evident in the heath care reform bill he signed into law last month .
Paul said the mandate in the bill put the power over health care in the hands of corporations rather than private citizens .
But he said the bill was n't the only place where corporatism is creeping into Washington .

New computational techniques developed at MIT confirmed that the complex quantum effects known as Casimir forces would cause tiny objects with the shapes shown here to repel each other rather than attract .

( PhysOrg.com ) -- MIT researchers have developed a powerful new tool for calculating the effects of Casimir forces , complicated quantum forces that affect only objects that are very , very close together , with ramifications for both basic physics and the design of microelectromechanical systems ( MEMS ) .
One of the researchers ' most recent discoveries using the new tool was a way to arrange tiny objects so that the ordinarily attractive Casimir forces become repulsive .
If engineers can design MEMS so that the Casimir forces actually prevent their moving parts from sticking together — rather than causing them to stick — it could cut down substantially on the failure rate of existing MEMS .
It could also help enable new , affordable MEMS devices , like tiny medical or scientific sensors , or microfluidics devices that enable hundreds of chemical or biological experiments to be performed in parallel .
Quantum mechanics has bequeathed a very weird picture of the universe to modern physicists .
One of its features is a cadre of new subatomic particles that are constantly flashing in and out of existence in an almost undetectably short span of time .
( The Higgs boson , a theoretically predicted particle that the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland is trying to detect for the first time , is expected to appear for only a few sextillionths of a second . )
There are so many of these transient particles in space — even in a vacuum — moving in so many different directions that the forces they exert generally balance each other out .
For most purposes , the particles can be ignored .
But when objects get very close together , there ’s little room for particles to flash into existence between them .
Consequently , there are fewer transient particles in between the objects to offset the forces exerted by the transient particles around them , and the difference in pressure ends up pushing the objects toward each other .
In the 1960s , physicists developed a mathematical formula that , in principle , describes the effects of Casimir forces on any number of tiny objects , with any shape .
But in the vast majority of cases , that formula remained impossibly hard to solve .
“ People think that if you have a formula , then you can evaluate it .
That ’s not true at all , ” says Steven Johnson , an associate professor of applied mathematics , who helped develop the new tools .
“ There was a formula that was written down by Einstein that describes gravity .
They still do n’t know what all the consequences of this formula are . ”
For decades , the formula for Casimir forces was in the same boat .
Physicists could solve it for only a small number of cases , such as that of two parallel plates .
Then , in 2006 , came a breakthrough : MIT Professor of Physics Mehran Kardar demonstrated a way to solve the formula for a plate and a cylinder .
Though negligible at larger scales , Casimir forces can cause the moving parts of micromachines , like the one shown here , to stick together .

In a paper appearing this week in Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences , Johnson , physics PhD students Alexander McCauley and Alejandro Rodriguez ( the paper ’s lead author ) , and John Joannopoulos , the Francis Wright Davis Professor of Physics , describe a way to solve Casimir - force equations for any number of objects , with any conceivable shape .
The researchers ’ insight is that the effects of Casimir forces on objects 100 nanometers apart can be precisely modeled using objects 100,000 times as big , 100,000 times as far apart , immersed in a fluid that conducts electricity .
Instead of calculating the forces exerted by tiny particles flashing into existence around the tiny objects , the researchers calculate the strength of an electromagnetic field at various points around the much larger ones .
In their paper , they prove that these computations are mathematically equivalent .
For objects with odd shapes , calculating electromagnetic - field strength in a conducting fluid is still fairly complicated .
But it ’s eminently feasible using off - the - shelf engineering software .
“ Analytically , ” says Diego Dalvit , a specialist in Casimir forces at the Los Alamos National Laboratory , “ it ’s almost impossible to do exact calculations of the Casimir force , unless you have some very special geometries . ”
With the MIT researchers ’ technique , however , “ in principle , you can tackle any geometry .
And this is useful .
Very useful . ”
Since Casimir forces can cause the moving parts of MEMS to stick together , Dalvit says , “ One of the holy grails in Casimir physics is to find geometries where you can get repulsion ” rather than attraction .
And that ’s exactly what the new techniques allowed the MIT researchers to do .
In a separate paper published in March , physicist Michael Levin of Harvard University ’s Society of Fellows , together with the MIT researchers , described the first arrangement of materials that enable Casimir forces to cause repulsion in a vacuum .
Dalvit points out , however , that physicists using the new technique must still rely on intuition when devising systems of tiny objects with useful properties .
“ Once you have an intuition of what geometries will cause repulsion , then the [ technique ] can tell you whether there is repulsion or not , ” Dalvit says .
But by themselves , the tools cannot identify geometries that cause repulsion .

Palimpsest : A Review
I first heard about the book " Palimpsest " through Livejournal spam .
I kept getting reminders that the author , Catherynne Valente , would be reading from her latest novel at the KGB Bar .
There was a plot synopsis of the novel in the announcement : something quivering and salacious , but also far , far too coy .
Something about four strangers meeting in the night .
Here 's the plot synopsis that would have got me to buy her book in person and to hear her read , something I wish I 'd done now : Palimpsest is a book about a city that is also a sexually transmitted disease .
You visit the city the night after you fuck somebody infected with it , and then the city possesses your heart and dreams .
After you are infected , you can only be conscious of the lack of magic , mystery , and beauty in your life now that you have seen the alternative .
The lack is as brutal as a spiked bat !
Palimpsest is the true reality that you have always known lies just out of reach for you .
Like HIV , once you are infected with the city , you die unless you find a cure .
But there is only one cure -- permanent immigration to Palimpsest -- and there has been a war that makes this nearly impossible .
Good fucking luck , you wanton travelers !
Or , to sum up the theme using Valente 's own far more lyric and lucid prose :***" Palimpsest " is a fantasy novel , I guess .
But it is a fantasy novel in the same way that the works of Haruki Murakami or David Mitchell are fantasy novels .
It is " high fiction , " a book that tells a story on its own terms , using an uncompromising and invented form to create higher resonance than the genres of either " literary fiction " or " fantasy " are capable of providing .
High fiction is gaining ground in literature and might be literature 's best hope for bringing in new souls .
It melds the best things about post - modernism , modernism , and genre fiction , while cutting out the excesses of all three disciplines .
High fiction would not be possible without post - modernism 's brush clearing , even though reading the triumphs of 60s , 70s , and 80s literature is like reading through the filing cabinet of an English professor while all the air is being sucked out of a sealed room , like some kind of Batman deathtrap .
But post - modernism worked !
At least , it worked in television and film .
Everything has now been leveled .
Thanks to the gimcrackery of image , New York City is just as real a place as Hogwarts .
Since this is true , fiction can tell whatever the fuck story it wants now and people will just go with it .
Settings can be manipulated and tweaked to conform to the logic of stories without rigorous world building .
Nobody cares what is real anymore , because now even telling " true " stories means we have to incorporate the mystical , the alien , the fantastical , and the arcane .
Also , memoirs and reality television have laid such siege to the truth these days that they have stolen it from fiction like a fancy toy , so fiction can do what it pleases .
However , the lessons of modernism have also taught us that formal experimentation , craft , and deployment of a unique style , are the best ways to elevate prose , and they always improve a work when used deliberately and with control .
" Ulysses " = huge success !
" Finnegan 's Wake " = unreadable , unless it is the only book you ever read .
People toiling for decades in the thankless Prose Mines of modernism taught us the limits of language and revealed many of the tricks , traps , inadequacies , and open areas of narrative exploration .
These days , while you write fantasy novels , you must read Faulkner .
Which brings us to the most important component of " high fiction . "
The fantastic .
The genre spirit .
Over the years , the genre writers kept the raw spirit of fiction alive by focusing on pure story .
Tales !
Adventure !
Imagination !
Crisis ! Catharsis !
And that 's what people want .
Genre writers realized that if they did n't get it from fiction , they 'd get it elsewhere .
Those with aspirations for high fiction can no longer neglect this audience .
This audience is all of us .
High fiction combines the structural freedom of post - modernism , the elevated style of modernism , and the story power of genre .
To write a piece of high fiction is to therefore write fiction that challenges a writer 's skills on all levels .
This is a great age for such challenges , an age where if you know how to look , you can see that the path is clear for anything .
This is the age of high fiction masterpieces such as Mitchell 's " Cloud Atlas , " Murakami's " Kafka on the Shore , " Ursula Le Guin 's " The Tombs of Atuin , " Susannah Clarke 's " Dr. Strange and Mr. Norrell , " and Peter Matthiessen 's " Shadow Country . " " Palimpsest " is part of this tradition ; a tradition struggling out of imagination 's protoplasm to reignite the novel for modern readers .***" Palimpsest " is the story of four people on three continents who journey to the city of Palimpsest together for the first time one night and are then forever linked .
The structure is simple but specially tailored to the subject .
The story cycles between the four characters -- each of whom has different desires and problems -- while alternating between the psychogeography of the sexually - transmitted city and the real life dilemmas of four very damaged human beings .
For instance , in order to keep visiting the city , the characters must keep fucking new people who have been there .
And every time they visit , they lose something or are permanently altered .
My major problem with this book is also its chief strength .
This is not a novel driven by plot or characters .
This is a novel driven by setting and by ideas , where the characterization is revealed by the setting .
The setting is actuated by the structure , and the structure is lyrical and poetic , replete with images and synesthesias that describe a city that is half - wonder and half - nonsense .
It is a place built for crazy people .
Luckily , our protagonists are crazy and fit right in .
However , it is a gamble that the reader will be able to empathize with the obsessions of these half - rendered characters .
Taken as a story about the safety valve of the imagination , however , " Palimpsest " becomes a book about what people will risk in order to fight for their rightful place .
Sometimes the end result was like reading a beautiful map instead of visiting a real place .
Or reading the rules to a game instead of playing it .
I am conventional : I wanted more change , growth , risk , and plot .
However , the map and the rules were so engrossing that I stopped caring after awhile and just let my mind savor the possibilities .
The ingredients were so fascinating and rare that it became okay that I could not always taste the dish .*** Palimpsest is also really hot .
The characters do n't care who they fuck in order to travel to their dream city .
Men , women , lepers , the disfigured , the portly , the old , the young , the good , the evil .
Every person is their own country and if you want to visit , you have to pay the price .
The tension of the book is the movement between sleaze to the sublime , which is also the tension of sex itself .
Is n't it ?
The passage from life to mystery ; the movement from the ordinary to the exalted .
The lowest world is raised up :*** Valente has a huge , wild talent and reading her book is intoxicating yet dangerous , like sipping liquor from a crystal goblet and eating dainty sandwiches while getting a massage from an assassin .
It 's a book that feels well - tuned and well - edited .
Blood was spilled on this book .
Whole ink buffalo were slaughtered , and every part was used .
Here 's a fascinating and spot - on editorial Valente wrote about why editors are so important , and why self - publishing is not a good idea .
However , in this editorial , she does bring up a very important point about electronic rights :
She is n't just whistling Dixie , either .
When her partner lost his job and they needed money , she took a YA - novel from " Palimpsest " and turned it into a persistent , online web novel called " The Girl Who Circumnavigated Fairyland in a Ship of Her Own Making .
"
You can read this book for free here , and donate what you want .
I think this is exactly how electronic novels should look , personally .
By putting out an online novel this way , an author does n't have to go through Amazon , Apple , or Google , and they are able to add artwork , audio tracks , links , and " code art " in ways that simply do n't work for ebook readers .
You can read " Fairyland " from any computer with an internet connection .
It can be tweaked .
Corrected .
Added to .
Unfortunately , " Fairyland " is also an example of a book that a professional writer had to put out without help , unable to pay for good graphic designers , good coders , or good editors , and also unable to convince publishers that this is what an ebook should look like .
Imagine what kind of electronic books publishers could make if they brought all of the resources of the New York industry to bear on this burgeoning market , instead of buying into the idea that Apple or Amazon are in a better position to create and leverage narrative art , which is a ludicrous idea .***" Palimpsest " is a radical and experimental piece of metatextual prose , cloaked in the guise of a perverted fantasy novel about A City .
It is rough , smart , and flawed .
It is a book designed to makes passing it on a radical act .
An act of transgression .
And I want to pass it on to you .
I want to put this book in your mind forever .
To make it a part of you .
To tattoo it on your flesh .
You like to read , right ?
So come a little closer ... do n't be shy ... just a little bit closer , please ...

Not justified
This is an underhanded effort to undermine privacy , and outsourcing it to ISPs .
The existing laws in Canada are such that you can use Cybertip if you 're an individual and an ISP has a " duty to report " if it know that Child Pornography is taking place .
This is an attempt to destroy privacy , cloaked as " protecting the children " nothing more .

Sounds OK to report known cases but ISPs are screwed if responsible for content that the users post .
It 's like the post office being responsible for child porn that is being sent through the mail .

The Internet is not the source of child pornography .
People are the source .
If there was no Internet , would CP still exist ?
They are ( as El Quintron hinted ) , masquerading the removal of privacy rights with the standard " For the Children " show .

I 'm sure you love your children a lot , but throwing out your freedom and privacy ( and by proxy theirs as well ) is n't going to build a better world for them .
I can sympathize with you but the laws we have in place do exactly what they 're supposed to do .
ISPs have a duty to report if they know it 's going on , and individuals can report anonymously , eliminating repercussions for individuals who report .
I'm sure you love your children a lot , but throwing out your freedom and privacy ( and by proxy theirs as well ) is n't going to build a better world for them .

EDIT : I 'm not saying they should do nothing but some kind of undercover international sting op would probably be they way to go these days to catch the worst of the worst .
This is n't going to catch any " real " predators they use VPNs and Torr among other things .
All this is going to do is put extra strain on Indy ISPs to pay for the hardware required for monitoring and storing your web history .
It sounds like a great idea but it means absolutely nothing except someone is watching and recording everything you do online and they real criminals use tools to get around it easily .
If spending a little over 10 bucks a month or free software to get around this is all you have to do whats the point of making it a law ?
I also do n't think its a good idea to have all my financial records at some centralized location managed by some guy at an ISP it just seems ripe for misuse .

Sadly , some people seem to think that the only way to protect the children is to install a camera in every adult 's bedroom in the country .
Hyperbolic argument , to be sure ; but I am just answering hyperbole with hyperbole .
That is already a requirement , without adding another law .

goto techdirt.com also and look at the pervert admin who when they put cameras they could turn on at any time without permission enjoyed over 10000 photos .

Tristan Member False positives , and complete accidents I can see this now ...
People who surf the web for legitimate 19 + porn stars ( and people who avoid porn ) clicking on links that they believe are legitimate , only to discover the link actually points to some naked 18 year old , and then being charged under this new bill .
The problem with a bill like this is it does nothing to protect the people who visit websites through malicious , maligned , and deceitful links .
Nor does it protect people from hackers that break into web servers and add or re-write links to these disgusting websites .
It basically makes the web more dangerous for those of us who want to conduct our legal private interests on the internet .
Canada has been making a lot of really bad decisions about the Internet .
It is pushing Canada 's internet to the bottom of the list - where soon enough , Canadians wo n't even want to use the internet , because we 'll be put at a disadvantage due to poor speed , we 've already lost our competitive edge , terrible penetration into outlying areas , content bobbies , and the risk of being charged for something even when we try our best to stay legal .
I think it 's good to go after the websites that offer up illegal smut , but at the same time , but to go after quite possibly innocent people and ruin their lives in the process over a link that can be re-written by hackers , or through automated techniques ( cross - site scripting , ad injection , redirection , etc. ) is plain wrong .
This will give people even more reason to distrust ISP's .
I 'm reminded of a computer I cleaned up for a family member - I discovered a single porn movie on the computer , and knowing the person who uses this computer , and the plethora of malware I removed from this PC , it is too easy for naive computer users to be exploited by the internet 's nefarious dark side .
It 's good to protect our young , but if innocent people get hurt in the process , then the law is just as bad as the criminal act .

This law * may * catch a few offenders , however , it most certainly will catch a lot of innocent people in the crossfire .
Mis clicks happen pretty frequently , viruses , child porn etc. can and will be found in such links .
Mis clicking a link or two should not be able to essentially ruin your life , which is what any case involving child porn will accomplish .

They are sick - they have a mental illness , and are quite selfish and self - centred .

There is absolutely no way for ISPs to pull this off .
China has been trying and failing for years to control and filter the Internet .
The offenders who have a clue are just going to buy an offshore encrypted vpn in some free country .
Or they 'll install and use Tor .
Or any number of secure methods .
ISPs are just going to implement some lame half - arsed filter to show they 're compliant and forward all results to avoid fine .
They are not going to dump more money into this than they have to , and partly because they know how pointless it is .
The authorities are then going to be swamped , where most are false positives .
Instead , they could be infiltrating the distribution rings and cracking down on the people who actually MAKE child porn for profit .

Is this really an invasion of privacy ?
But I do n't see it calling for DPI and inspection of active data transmission or am I mistaken ?
Instead it asks that the provider report any credible tips or occurrences that fall under the criteria .
This would allow an agency to sift through the details and establish if further action is taken but this is n't calling for people to search it out .
Quoted from the same article Hence , nothing in this legislation would require or authorise a person to seek out child pornography
hence no DPI , hence no true invasion of privacy .
Sticking with the snail mail analogy of earlier this is basically saying if you hear that your neighbour is committing mail fraud your obligated to report it .
please correct me with details on the legislation if I 'm wrong .
It 's one thing to say that ISP 's can't be held under safe harbour if they knowingly allow the content to reside on their servers and take no action to prevent it .
It 's another thing to actually police or inspect via any other means to ascertain if that content is in transmission .
Please correct me but this is n't calling for that level of invasion .
What it 's calling for is that if the ISP receives a report and confirms it to be a valid case that it is not allowed to simply terminate the customer ( or his account rather ) it is instead obligated to report this event to the enforcement agency .
If it receives a notice that content is being served from one of the ISP 's customers then it has the obligation to report it and not just take standard AUP / TOS approaches .
At the same time insuring that the content is protected for use as evidence further down the line .

For anyone that has a website in canada ( or the States ) , if they look in their user logs , they will see many hits from the Canadian RCMP .
Since the RCMP are already looking for sites that have this type of illegal content .
And the RCMP should already be contacting the site host server to get the webpage owner arrested ( maybe ) .
Then there was that RCMP guy in the southern interior , who for a day and a half , spent his time looking at all the naked adult ladies .
He got something slapped for it and told ' not to get caught again ' .

If the government wants to prevent exploitation , they should go after the producers , not the viewers .
It 's not that I condone the viewing of child porn , but going after the viewers is like going after everyone who takes crack in the " war on drugs " .
It 's a waste of effort and does n't solve the problem .

This is just another boogeyman ... to slide our way whilst getting the draconian copyright bill passed .
One of Paris 's main thoroughfares , the Champs - Elysees , has been covered in earth and turned into a huge green space in an event staged by young French farmers .
They want to highlight their financial problems , caused by falling prices for agricultural produce .
Plants , trees and flowers were brought in by lorry overnight to transform the avenue into a long green strip .
More than a million people are expected to visit over the next two days .
The event , which cost 4.2 m euros ( £ 3.6 m ; $ 5.3 m ) to stage , has been organised by the French Young Farmers ( Jeunes Agriculteurs ) union over the holiday weekend in France .
It will serve as a showcase of farm production from sheep breeding to crop growing .
The union , which represents some 55,000 farmers under the age of 35 , wants to impress on the public - and the government - the efforts required to produce what goes on the table .
" It 's about re-establishing contact with the public about what our profession is and what they want from it , " William Villeneuve , president of the Jeunes Agriculteurs , said on Friday .
" Do they want the cheapest products in the world or do they want products that pay producers ? " he added .
Monumental
Only in France are you ever likely to see such a monumental mobilisation of creativity and resources , all in the cause of that beloved but beleaguered figure : the French farmer , says the BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris .

The event also serves as a showcase for French farming produce from vineyards to famous breeds .

Overnight , 8,000 plots of earth have been brought into central Paris , and on Sunday morning , from the Arc de Triomphe down , the Champs - Elysees is one vast green space .
Some 150,000 plants have been installed - including 650 fully grown trees - representing agricultural produce from the marshes of the Camargue to the plains of Picardy , our correspondent adds .
Visitors will be able to buy boxes of the earth for their own gardens .
SAN FRANCISCO –
The giant hotel corporations that dominate this city ’s top hotels may think they can hide behind the current economic crisis to force workers to accept a contract full of takeaways .
But some 9,000 hotel workers and their union , Unite Here !
Local 2 , are saying loud and clear : “ Think again ! ”
As talks that began in August for a new citywide contract dragged on into the fall , the workers conducted a series of street actions – rallies , brief strikes , informational pickets , peaceful civil disobedience – and called for a consumer boycott of seven of the most prominent hotels .
The latest in the series – a “ two - day siege ” March 31 - April 1 at one of those hotels , the Westin - St. Francis in the heart of downtown – brought a noisy , enthusiastic picket line to the hotel ’s front door .
Patrick Cirby , a house attendant at the hotel for over 17 years , paused in his picket rounds to say that as in most current contract struggles , the main issue is the demand of the hotel ’s corporate owner , the Starwood Corporation , that workers typically earning $ 30,000 to $ 35,000 a year pay large sums for health coverage .
While he and other single workers would see their take - home pay drop significantly under the proposal , he said , workers with families could face stark choices about necessities .
Cirby said the hotel is also trying to increase workloads , to cut the number of workers by combining job categories , and to gain the right to call workers in for four hour shifts forcing them to work more days to qualify for benefits including health coverage .
As she anchored one end of the picket line , Omni Hotel cook Linda Knighten said , “ We ’re very optimistic , we ’ve been through this before and we are very confident in our union ’s leadership . ”
Knighten was recalling the two years of struggle , including a two - week strike , a 53 day lockout and a boycott , before the last citywide contract was signed in 2006 .
In the meantime , she said , the hotel is slow to hire needed replacement workers and to settle grievances and other issues , and workloads are increasing .
“ Corporate greed has n’t changed , ” Knighten said .
“ They claim they are suffering because of the economy , but the hotels are making money .
They ’re trying to get a cheap long - term deal when we know the economy will change . ”
Local 2 says the boycotts have cost the affected hotels far more than they would have paid under an inexpensive , short - term contract the union proposed last year .
“ Instead , they insisted on fighting us for a long term contract full of takeaways , ” the union said in a statement .
“ Their greed has already cost them millions in lost business , and that number is going up every week . ”
The union points out that the major hotel corporations , including Starwood , have continued to show significant profits despite the recession .
Health coverage is also the big issue across the bay in suburban Pleasanton , where over a month ago , the Castlewood Country Club locked out 60 workers including cooks , servers and dishwashers when they rejected the club ’s demand that they pay $ 739 a month for family health coverage .
Workers average a little over $ 12.50 an hour , and currently pay nothing for their health coverage .
On March 28 , over 85 people joined a peaceful march at the country club , and on March 31 , faith leaders joined the workers for a bilingual religious program on the picket line .

So there 's still no clear explanation for what just sent the Dow on that ridiculous slide .
But the questions are starting to come faster and faster .
A biggie :
What was the role of computerized trading to blame ?
On a related point , a few have pointed out some rather strange action in Procter & Gamble shares .
A P&G spokeswoman said the company does n't know what might have caused a sudden drop and said that it is looking into the matter , according to the Dow Jones reporter covering the company .
Any ideas ?
Just a fat - finger trade ?

The crash site has presented investigators with huge challenges
The flight recorders from an Air France plane which crashed in the Atlantic last year have been located to within a 5 km zone , a French official has said .
But Gen Christian Baptiste told AFP that retrieving the boxes from the ocean floor might be impossible .
All 228 people on board the flight from Rio to Paris died in the crash .
The cause remains unknown .
The plane 's airspeed probes had given false readings , but officials believe other factors must also have contributed .
Finding the boxes , which record flight data and cockpit conversations , should allow investigators to finally explain the mystery of why the plane came down .
It appears the location zone has been traced using images obtained during the first phase of searching for the wreckage , when the flight recorders were still emitting a signal .
Complex operation
French government and military officials have urged caution , saying there is no guarantee the flight recorders will be found .
" It 's like trying to find a shoe box in an area the size of Paris , at a depth of 3,000 m ( 9,800 ft ) and in a terrain as rugged as the Alps , " French navy spokesman Hugues du Plessis d'Argentre told AFP .
A fresh search was launched earlier this year involving US and Norwegian ships with sonar probes and robots , in what officials described as " one of the most complex undersea operations ever " .
The area covered by the high - tech vessels will now be reduced from 1,500 sq km ( 580 sq miles ) to just 3 - 5 sq km ( 1 - 2 sq miles ) , in a remote area far off the coast of Brazil .
Air France flight AF447 from Rio de Janeiro to Paris disappeared on 1 June 2009 in stormy weather , killing all those on board .
ANALYSIS / OPINION :
We ’re hearing a lot these days from the nation ’s capital about the coming “ clean - energy economy ” and all the green jobs we ’ll get out of it .
If truth - in - advertising laws applied to politics , however , you ’d have to replace the word “ clean ” with “ costlier ” - which is why this agenda is very bad news for jobs and the economy .
In his State of the Union address , President Obama said that “ the nation that leads the clean - energy economy will be the nation that leads the global economy . ”
He warned that America ’s global competitors already were “ making serious investments in clean energy because they want those jobs . ”
Following the president ’s cue , Congress is working on a number of bills calling for new global - warming measures and bigger subsidies for their favorite alternative energy sources - all marketed as clean - energy initiatives .
It all would come on top of the billions in “ stimulus ” money already being poured out for clean - energy projects .
Too bad Washington is pursuing proven job killers .
Take wind energy , perhaps the most politically correct energy source right now .
The president repeatedly has visited wind - turbine factories , boasting about the green jobs at each .
Washington has heavily subsidized wind energy along with solar and other alternatives and is considering a law that would force electric utilities to use more of them .
Yet wind power is tremendously expensive .
That ’s why it needs billions in federal handouts in the first place .
Those handouts siphon tax dollars and jobs away from other parts of the economy .
And the costlier electricity that results destroys additional jobs , especially in the manufacturing sector .
The president frequently mentions Spain as a model .
Yes , Spain already has a clean - energy economy , with thousands of wind turbines and solar panels covering the landscape .
It also has 19 percent unemployment , nearly twice the U.S. level .
A study conducted by Gabriel Calzada , an economics professor at the King Juan Carlos University in Madrid , estimates that for each green job created , 2.2 other jobs are killed .
Spain ’s clean - energy economy is not without its successes - if you include American pork .
In 2009 , the Spanish energy company Iberdrola received $ 546 million in stimulus money from the U.S. Treasury .
It expects to get another $ 470 million this year to install more windmills in America .
Ethanol , another highly hyped “ clean ” energy source , has already been a costly flop .
Thanks to a George W. Bush - era law , nearly 13 billion gallons of corn- based ethanol and other “ renewable ” fuels have to be mixed into the gasoline supply this year .
Ethanol increases the pain at the pump , and the diversion of nearly a third of the corn crop from food to fuel use has raised the price not only of corn itself , but of related items including meat and dairy products from corn-fed animals .
Granted , this policy has enriched corn farmers , but at a steep price for the rest of us .
Further , the claims of many new green jobs at ethanol production plants have proven to be overstated .
In fact , a number of these plants have closed down , disappointing many rural communities who supported them in hopes of an economic revival .
Beyond the phony economic boost , the clean part of the clean energy economy may be a mirage as well .
Many environmentalists have turned against ethanol , now claiming that it causes even more emissions than the gasoline it supplants .
Across the country , green groups routinely sue to block wind farms on various environmental grounds , including bird and bat deaths caused by the spinning blades .
Worst of all , costly global - warming legislation addresses what is looking increasingly like an overhyped environmental threat .
The clean - energy economy is turning out to be an environmental loser as well as an economic one .
American ingenuity can create great things , including energy breakthroughs - but not when politicians and bureaucrats are telling the private sector what to do .
Too much of the clean - energy agenda involves Washington experts picking winners and losers among energy lobbyists .
The rest of us have to live with their costly mistakes .

Los Angeles , California ( CNN ) --
The widower of actress Brittany Murphy , found dead in his home Sunday night , was scheduled to undergo heart bypass surgery this summer , a spokesman for the actress ' mother said .
British screenwriter Simon Monjack , 39 , was pronounced dead after the Los Angeles Fire Department was called to his Hollywood home for a medical emergency , police said .
There were no signs of foul play or criminal activity in the death , Los Angeles Police Sgt. Alex Ortiz said .
Roger Neal , a spokesman for Murphy 's mother , Sharon , said Monjack delayed the heart surgery until after a fundraising gala for the Brittany Murphy Foundation in September .
Murphy , his wife of less than three years , died just five months ago .
Sharon Murphy found Monjack unconscious in his bedroom and called the fire department , a family friend said .
An autopsy is scheduled to be conducted Tuesday , according to the Los Angeles County coroner 's spokeswoman .
Sharon Murphy , who shared the house with Monjack , " loved him like a son " and is devastated by his death , Neal said .
It is the same Hollywood Hills home where Brittany Murphy lived .
Murphy , 32 , died in December from a combination of pneumonia , an iron deficiency and multiple drug intoxication , a coroner said .
The drugs involved were legal and used to treat a respiratory infection , according to an autopsy .
The often bubbly , free - spirited actress appeared in films such as " Clueless , " " 8 Mile , " " Do n't Say a Word " and " Girl , Interrupted . "
She also lent her voice to animated works , including the movie " Happy Feet " -- in which she also sang -- and a regular role on the animated TV series " King of the Hill . "
Monjack and Murphy were married in May 2007 .
The couple had no children .
The foundation 's gala , which still may be held , was organized to raise money for children to study music , dance and other arts , Neal said .
This egg - laying , venomous , duck - billed , beaver - tailed , otter - footed mammal has got to be one of the strangest looking creatures on the planet .
In fact , the platypus is so weird looking , that when scientist first discovered the platypus , they thought that somebody was playing tricks on them .
This semi-aquatic mammal is the only mammal that lays eggs instead of giving birth to live young .
The platypus is an excellent swimmer and spends lots of its time in the water looking for food .
The male platypus has a spur on its back feet that that deliver a poison that can cause humans bad pain .
So if you find your self in eastern Australia , and come across a platypus – it ’s not a cat , so do n’t pick it up .

Hydrogen would command a key role in future renewable energy technologies , experts agree , if a relatively cheap , efficient and carbon - neutral means of producing it can be developed .
An important step towards this elusive goal has been taken by a team of researchers with the U.S. Department of Energy ’s ( DOE ) Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ( Berkeley Lab ) and the University of California , Berkeley .
The team has discovered an inexpensive metal catalyst that can effectively generate hydrogen gas from water .
“ Our new proton reduction catalyst is based on a molybdenum - oxo metal complex that is about 70 times cheaper than platinum , today ’s most widely used metal catalyst for splitting the water molecule , ” said Hemamala Karunadasa , one of the co-discoverers of this complex .
“ In addition , our catalyst does not require organic additives , and can operate in neutral water , even if it is dirty , and can operate in sea water , the most abundant source of hydrogen on earth and a natural electrolyte .
These qualities make our catalyst ideal for renewable energy and sustainable chemistry . ”
Karunadasa holds joint appointments with Berkeley Lab ’s Chemical Sciences Division and UC Berkeley ’s Chemistry Department .
She is the lead author of a paper describing this work that appears in the April 29 , 2010 issue of the journal Nature , titled “ A molecular molybdenum - oxo catalyst for generating hydrogen from water . ”
Co-authors of this paper were Christopher Chang and Jeffrey Long , who also hold joint appointments with Berkeley Lab and UC Berkeley .
Chang , in addition , is also an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute ( HHMI ) .
Hydrogen gas , whether combusted or used in fuel cells to generate electricity , emits only water vapor as an exhaust product , which is why this nation would already be rolling towards a hydrogen economy if only there were hydrogen wells to tap .
However , hydrogen gas does not occur naturally and has to be produced .
Most of the hydrogen gas in the United States today comes from natural gas , a fossil fuel .
While inexpensive , this technique adds huge volumes of carbon emissions to the atmosphere .
Hydrogen can also be produced through the electrolysis of water – using electricity to split molecules of water into molecules of hydrogen and oxygen .
This is an environmentally clean and sustainable method of production – especially if the electricity is generated via a renewable technology such as solar or wind – but requires a water - splitting catalyst .
Nature has developed extremely efficient water - splitting enzymes – called hydrogenases – for use by plants during photosynthesis , however , these enzymes are highly unstable and easily deactivated when removed from their native environment .
Human activities demand a stable metal catalyst that can operate under non-biological settings .
Metal catalysts are commercially available , but they are low valence precious metals whose high costs make their widespread use prohibitive .
For example , platinum , the best of them , costs some $ 2,000 an ounce .
“ The basic scientific challenge has been to create earth - abundant molecular systems that produce hydrogen from water with high catalytic activity and stability , ” Chang says .
“ We believe our discovery of a molecular molybdenum - oxo catalyst for generating hydrogen from water without the use of additional acids or organic co-solvents establishes a new chemical paradigm for creating reduction catalysts that are highly active and robust in aqueous media . ”
The molybdenum - oxo complex that Karunadasa , Chang and Long discovered is a high valence metal with the chemical name of ( PY5Me2 ) Mo - oxo .
In their studies , the research team found that this complex catalyzes the generation of hydrogen from neutral buffered water or even sea water with a turnover frequency of 2.4 moles of hydrogen per mole of catalyst per second .
Long says , “ This metal - oxo complex represents a distinct molecular motif for reduction catalysis that has high activity and stability in water .
We are now focused on modifying the PY5Me ligand portion of the complex and investigating other metal complexes based on similar ligand platforms to further facilitate electrical charge - driven as well as light - driven catalytic processes .
Our particular emphasis is on chemistry relevant to sustainable energy cycles . ”
This research was supported in part by the DOE Office of Science through Berkeley Lab ’s Helios Solar Energy Research Center , and in part by a grant from the National science Foundation .

I ’ve read a hundred books a year for the past couple years .
Last time I mentioned this , a couple people asked how I could read so many books .
Do I read unusually quickly ?
Do I spend an unusual amount of time reading ?
I did a simple calculation :
The average person spends 1704 hours a year watching TV .
If the average reading rate is 250 words per minute and the average book is 180,000 words , then that ’s 142 books a year .
To my surprise , I was n’t reading nearly enough books .
So I ’ve taken some steps to read more :
Block your favorite blogs .
I definitely have the mental habit noted in this xkcd cartoon : at the first sign of mental difficulty , I tab to a different window and begin typing the URL of a favorite blog .
This habit is purely automatic , I do it without even thinking about it .
As a result , I spend many , many hours a day reading blogs and following their links .
To overcome this habit , I added all my favorite blogs to an /etc / hosts file that redirects them to a bogus IP .
Now when I type their URLs , I get an error message .
I did the same with Hulu and other sites I use to watch TV shows ; if you have a real television , be sure to get rid of it too .
Now I usually try visiting a couple different blogs before my conscious self realizes what ’s happening , but this happens soon enough and , over the past couple weeks , I ’ve managed to pretty much train myself out of this bad habit .
Now I either focus on the problem at hand or think enough about it to take a break and go for a walk , eat something , drink some water , read a book , or take a nap .
Order lots of books at the library .
Most people think the way you read more books is by spending more time reading .
But I ’ve found that , like exercise , this is an effect and not a cause .
I spend time reading when I have a great book to read .
When I do n’t , I feel no urge to read and when I do start reading something , I put it down quickly .
But if I ’m reading a great book , I spontaneously come up with times and places to read it .
But figuring out which books are great in advance is hard .
People ’s experiences about which books they find compelling depend somewhat on their interests and finding accurate critics is problematic .
So the best way I ’ve found to see whether a book is good is to just start reading it .
My local library system ( Minuteman ) allows you to request up to 20 books online and then delivers them to the branch library nearest you .
So whenever someone makes a book recommendation or I hear about a book that seems interesting , I request it online .
Then I go and pick up a stack of books at the library every week or so .
I begin reading them and finish the ones that are exciting enough to finish and return the ones that are unpromising enough to give up on .
Then I return them all and get some more .
I also find that the due dates and the growing pile of books provides additional impetus to read them .
And the habit does n’t cost me any money this way , so I do n’t feel guilty about it .
( I ’m sure you can come up with reasons I should feel guilty , but the fact remains that I do n’t . )
Alienate everyone close to you .
The biggest consumer of time is undoubtedly other people , in large measure because talking to other people is so fun that you do n’t notice time going by .
By keeping yourself away from other people ( living alone is a good start ) , you free up an enormous amount of time for reading .
I find this is particularly useful in reading books , since books can usually substitute for human company : you can take them with you on the train and to meals and curl up with them at night and so on .
Getting rid of other hobbies no doubt also helps .
( And , unlike people , books do n’t encourage you to have other hobbies . )
I did n’t have any other hobbies , so this was less of a problem for me , but you may want to think about the things you do instead of reading books and stop doing them .
As I mentioned in this week ’s feature , Pontypool is a movie that stretches and tests the boundaries of what can or ca n’t be considered a zombie .
It ’s set in a radio station in the small town of Pontypool in rural Canada on a particularly cold and snowy day .
Strange reports of rioting and bizarre behavior start pouring in to the radio station .
For a town where the typical crime consists of public drunkenness and maybe the odd domestic disturbance , this is obviously a very strange day .
It ’s about to get a lot stranger .
It ’s hard to talk about the rest of the film without getting a little spoilery .
if you are extraordinarily sensitive to spoilers , have n’t yet seen the film and have managed to somehow avoid any of the other spoilers out there online ( the main plot point is “ spoiled ” everywhere , from the ads to the back of the box to every interview and probably every review out there ) STOP READING .
I ’ll spoil the review and tell you I thought the film is excellent and a must - see — you can come back and read the rest when you ’ve seen it .
Now , for the rest of you , I will avoid any major plot spoilers but I will reveal the aforementioned plot point in the course of discussing it .
The “ zombies ” of this film are living victims of a virus that makes them hyper aggressive , essentially mindless and highly contagious .
Sounds familiar enough so far right ?
Well , the twist is this virus is not communicated by biting or blood contact .
It ’s spread by language .
Weird enough for you ?
The victims get sucked into psychotic mental loops where they repeat sounds and phrases endlessly and mindlessly , leading to some very aggressive and typically zombie - like behavior ( biting , ripping and other physical assaults ) .
This is slowly revealed over the course of the film and finally realized and discussed by the main characters when a new character is introduced seemingly for the sole purpose of explaining it .
He literally climbs through a window , explains what is happening , then exits a window .
It ’s a little contrived and it ’s probably the movie ’s biggest weakness , but it essentially works .
Absent that deus ex machina , I ’d hazard a guess that most audiences would be utterly baffled by the story — well , even more baffled than they probably were anyway .
The whole film , apart from a brief scene in a car and two brief exterior scenes , takes place in a radio station in the basement of a church .
The confined setting works well within the scope of the story .
Much of the action is described by callers to the radio show , describing what they see ( especially a traffic reporter ) .
The zombies themselves appear relatively briefly , but are very effective in their screen time .
There ’s even a nice bit of gore thrown in that works really well and is genuinely gross and surprising .
The film has a very eerie , Twilight Zone feeling and it plays a lot of tricks with language .
The radio - show format that puts the focus firmly on the sound of the voice is particularly effective , considering the main plot point of a language - transmitted virus .
Technically speaking , it ’s a very “ talky ” film and though it does lose focus a bit in the last third it never bogs down or feels too slow .
A lot of the film rests on the shoulders of Stephen McHattie , who is brilliant as radio host Grant Mazzy , a Don Imus shock - jock type exiled to the morning show in a shithole town for unspecified reasons .
His performance , and particularly his top - notch voice and delivery , are perfect for the role — I honestly can’t imagine anyone else doing it .
So is it a zombie movie though ?
A simple description of it — a language virus that causes aggressive , murderous behavior — would probably lead me to conclude that it is not .
But in action , it so clearly looks and feels like a zombie movie , I am swayed the other way .
It plays as a brilliant deconstruction of the zombie myth , one that takes the essence of zombiedom , inverts it , adds some completely novel elements and yet ends up recognizably zombie .
It ’s comparable in its complexity and open - endedness to something like Donnie Darko , and likely will cause just as many severe reactions pro and con as that film did .
It ’s not perfect by any means , and may leave people confused , disappointed and irritated .
But if you ’ve got an open mind and want to see a genuinely novel approach to the zombie , I can not recommend it highly enough .
Director Bruce McDonald and writer Tony Burgess have crafted something special , the kind of film that comes along once in a lifetime : completely original yet firmly rooted in the genre ’s history .
Final note :
Watch the entire credit sequence at the end .
Not only are there some revealing audio clips that play over them , after they are over there ’s a scene that adds a whole new bewildering twist to the film .

She was faced with a stark choice : sacrifice her future family to save her current one .
× 5 of 5 Expand Prev Next
It has been 40 years since Elaine Riddick heard the words , but she still remembers them like yesterday : " The doctor told me I had been butchered . "
In 1968 , at just 14 years old , Elaine became one of the thousands of victims of North Carolina 's forced sterilization program .
Quietly and efficiently operating from 1929 until 1974 , the program 's purpose was to weed out the " unfit " of society by stopping them from reproducing .
Elaine is sitting in a quiet apartment high above the noise of Atlanta traffic .
A well - dressed , poised and dignified African - American woman in her mid-50s , it is difficult to imagine her as the young girl that she describes .
As a teenager in tiny Winfall , N.C. , Elaine had already known poverty and violence .
She had witnessed her father cutting her mother 's throat from ear to ear in an alcohol - induced rage .
She remembers frequently missing school .
When she did show up , she was dirty and unkempt .
She sometimes stole food from other children 's lunches because she was always hungry .
At just 13 years old , she was raped and impregnated by a neighbor 's brother who was in his 20s .
Elaine remembers that he threatened to kill her if she told anybody .
Elaine was 14 when she gave birth to what was to be her only child , a son , in 1968 at Chowan Hospital in Edenton .
She does n't remember much about her hospital visit , but she was told that she almost died and had to stay in the hospital a week longer than her son .
For the next few years , Elaine says she remembers having frequent stomach pain and hemorrhaging so severe that at 16 she was admitted to a hospital .
The doctor gave her little information , but she remembers he remarked that she 'd been " butchered . "
However , Elaine did n't know what that meant until , at 19 , she went to a doctor again .
By then she was married and she and her husband wanted to start a family .
After talking with the doctor and one of her sisters , she finally realized that she had been sterilized right after her son's birth five years before .
Like Elaine , tens of thousands of people across the country were victims of eugenic sterilizations .
But North Carolina was something of an anomaly .
Most of the states with eugenic sterilization programs dismantled them after World War II when the horrors of the Holocaust were uncovered .
North Carolina , however , ramped up its program in the postwar years , increasingly targeting poor black women during the '50s and '60s .
By the program 's end in 1974 , North Carolina ranked third among the states for number of eugenic sterilizations performedat least 7,600 over 45 years .
It was also the only state in which social workers were empowered to start the sterilization petitioning process .
The Eugenics Board of North Carolinacomprised of five bureaucrats who met monthly in Raleighapproved 90 percent of the sterilization petitions , often deciding cases within 15 minutes and without interviewing the individual to be sterilized .
More than 70 percent of the victims were sterilized for " feeblemindedness , " a vague term open to the board 's interpretationfrom supposedly possessing a low IQ to being " promiscuous , " " rebellious " or even " untidy . "
According to the petition filed with the board for Elaine in 1967 , she needed to be sterilized because of her " inability to control herself and her promiscuity . "
The petition adds that there are " community reports of her ' running around ' and out late at night unchaperoned . "
It concludes that Elaine can " never function in any way as a parent . "
Her diagnosis : " feebleminded . "
Elaine had obtained her medical records after consulting with the ACLU , who worked with her to file a lawsuit against the state for $ 1 million in damages on the grounds that her constitutional rights had been violatedwhich she lost .
She underwent a reversal procedure that did n't work .
And she tried to save a marriage with a man who called her " barren " and " a waste . "
" He said I should have died , " she remembers .
At 27 , she finally divorced him and decided to go back to school .
She got an associate 's degree , even though she had never completed high school .
" They never asked to see my transcript , " she says .
But even a college degree could not erase the stigma she felt from her sterilization and years of verbal and physical abuse .
She married another man in Georgia and suffered more abuse .
Elaine blamed herself for both abusive husbands because she was n't able to give them children .
And , she says , she internalized the " feebleminded " label placed on her by the state , believing " I was too dumb and stupid . "
Elaine continued to suffer from pain and bleeding , and finally underwent a full hysterectomy .
For years she took anti-depression medication and says she was always hiding , hurting and crying : " I would never smile . "
She avoided her family and people from her past .
" I felt like they knew about me , " she says .
" I had ' sterilization ' written all over my forehead and back . "
And she felt betrayed by her government .
" They talk about a child 's right to education and a good life .
They did n't have the same rules for me . "
While the program in later years most often targeted poor black women , it did n't begin that way .
Early on , the program focused on people in mental hospitals and training schools , which admitted those believed to have developmental disabilities or psychiatric disorders .
" It 's something that you never forget , " says Agnes , a white elderly woman who lives in Raleigh .
( She wishes to remain anonymous because no one else knows about her sterilization . )
Although her hair is white and her voice fragile , she appears much younger than her 82 years .
She sits at her kitchen table in her well - maintained home , and her eyes begin to tear as the memories from 60 years ago begin to surface .
In 1949 she was 21 years old , married and had just given birth to her second child , who was born with cerebral palsy .
She knew that something was wrong but could n't pinpoint it .
She felt angry and depressed all the time .
She would n't eat .
She cursed at her husband and her doctor , faulting him for her newborn 's problems .
At one point she attempted to jump out the window of their home .
What might be recognized as postpartum depression today was deemed a " mental breakdown . "
Agnes was sent to Dorothea Dix State Hospital in Raleigh , where she remained for eight months .
" It seemed like 50 years to me , " says Agnes , adding she " was n't the best patient . "
She received more than 25 electrical shock treatments during her hospital stay .
It 's been more than 60 years , but Agnes still shudders as she recalls being strapped to a table with a mouth guard in place and feeling the electricity course through her body .
Then she would be taken back to her ward , tied down with sheets to her hospital bed and covered with ice chips .
She also remembers being sent to solitary confinement for weeks at a time as punishment for " bad behavior . "
While at the hospital , Agnes complained of a recurring pain in her side , which the doctors suspected could be appendicitis .
She says she clearly remembers hearing them discuss their plans , " They said , ' If we have to operate on her for her appendix , why do n't we just go ahead and do a sterilization ? ' "
When she asked them why , they simply told her they did n't want her to have any more children .
" It was n't their choice , " she says .
" That should have been my choice . "
Agnes did not consent to the procedure , nor did her husband .
In fact , he was n't even aware she 'd had surgery until the following day when she told him about it .
The sterilization greatly saddened both Agnes and her husband , who died about eight years ago .
They were young and planned to have more children .
For years ,
Agnes had a secret hope to become pregnant despite her sterilization .
She would sometimes look longingly at someone else 's baby .
" I felt like , if this was my baby I would just be so thrilled . "
Elaine and Agnes , though separated by generation and race , and now by hundreds of miles , are connected by history : they are both survivors of North Carolina 's eugenic sterilization program .
There are two bills in the Legislature that , if passed , would help make amends for North Carolina 's eugenic past .
One would provide a one - time cash payment of $ 20,000 to each of the estimated 2,800 victims expected to still be alive , as long as they come forward themselves and can be verified to have been part of the program .
( State Rep. Larry Womble initially proposed $ 50,000 , but the most recent House bill reduced the amount . )
The other bill addresses health and counseling benefits for victims as well as ethics training for government employees and a directive for the state 's K–12 schools to teach about North Carolina 's eugenics program as part of its state history curriculum .
No other state has made this type of effort .
Yet , considering the uniqueness of the state 's sterilization program , the extra effort seems warranted .
To be fair , most North Carolinians knew little or nothing about the state 's forced sterilization program at the time it was happening .
Few sterilization victims spoke up about what happened to them , and the records of the Eugenics Board were closed to the public .
However , in the late 1990s , Dr. Johanna Schoen , a professor of women 's history at the University of Iowa and a graduate of UNC - Chapel Hill , was researching the history of birth control , sterilization and abortion when she was granted access to the board 's previously sealed records .
Recognizing that the stories of thousands of victims desperately needed to be told , she shared her research with a team of reporters at the Winston - Salem Journal , who combined Schoen 's research with their own investigative reporting and published a five - part series in the winter of 2002 –2003 titled " Against Their Will . "
The series detailed the flagrant abuses that occurred during the program 's tenure .
For example , more than 2,000 of the victims were ages 18 and younger .
A 10 - year - old boy was castrated .
The board sometimes backdated approval for procedures that had already been performed .
Young girls were sterilized for perceived promiscuity or rebelliousness .
Welfare recipients were sometimes threatened with loss of benefits if they did not agree to sterilization .
Not surprisingly , the Journal 's series was shortly followed by a formal apology from then - governor Mike Easley for the state eugenic sterilization program .
Easley appointed a blue - ribbon committee to study compensation for program survivors , and that committee developed several recommendationseverything from increasing public awareness to providing outreach services to survivors through monetary as well as health and education benefits .
In 2003 , it seemed that North Carolina was well on its way to making some sort of amends for a regrettable chapter of its history .
However , because of staff changes at the Department of Health and Human Services and lack of resources , most of the recommendations were left to collect dust for several years .
When State Rep. Womble ( D - Forsyth ) received a phone call from the Winston - Salem Journal in 2002 asking if he knew about the state 's eugenic history , he said he did n't .
Once he learned the details , he was flabbergasted and angry that such a program had ever taken place and vowed to do something about it .
" It 's been a long battle , " says Womble .
" First we had to take the law off the books . "
That 's right .
The sterilization law remained on the books until 2003 , although the Eugenics Board was disbanded in 1974 .
After the law was finally removed , thanks mainly to Womble 's efforts , the state developed a traveling museum exhibit describing the program .
A historical roadside marker recognizes the program 's victims .
It was unveiled in downtown Raleigh last year .
And , most recently , Charmaine Fuller Cooper of Durham was appointed executive director of the new N.C. Justice for Victims of Sterilization Foundation , which will examine options for restitution for the survivors and collaborate with other state agencies in carrying them out ( see sidebar story ) .
After seven years of promises , though , the sterilization victims have yet to see any tangible benefits , and some of them are starting to lose hope they ever will .

Among the many regrettable aspects of the state 's eugenic program , perhaps the most unforgivable is what happened to children in state training and reform schools .
Willis Lynch , now in his mid-70s and living in Littleton , was just a child when he was sterilized during his time at a state training school in the late 1940s .
He was the third of seven children being raised by a single white mother on welfare .
Although they were desperately poor , Willis fondly remembers how his mother once pulled together enough money to buy him a guitar .
He taught himself how to play .
But when Willis was 12 , the pressure of taking care of seven children on her own became too much for his mother .
Willis was sent to Caswell Training Center in Kinston , and a few of his siblings were sent to other institutions .
He remembers learning that he needed some kind of medical procedure .
" Momma told me I had to have an operation before I could get out of school . "
His mother was probably told so by authorities .
A 1935 report from the Eugenics Board states , " None of the inmates of Caswell Training School should be released before being sterilized , except in the few instances where normal children have been committed through error . "
Willis did n't know what the operation was for or why he needed it , but he complied .
He says he remembers lying on the operating table as a nurse prepared him for the procedure .
She asked him about his music .
Fourteen - year - old Willis was singing her a song as she slipped the anesthesia mask over his face .
No one ever explained to Willis what had happened to him , but eventually he figured it out on his own .
Later in life , he married a woman who already had two children , but Willis says he would have very much liked to have his own biological children .
He went on with his life , and music remains his passion .
He plays and sings Hank Williams - style songs every Friday night at a local country jamboree .
But he says his sterility was always something in the back of his mind .
" I always wondered what my kids would look likehow they would be if they was my own . "
Willis assumed he was sterilized because people thought he was " mean " and " they did n't want my kids running around . "
He was able to obtain his medical records from Kinston and learned that the doctors had tried but failed to get his mother sterilized as well .
It represents a chapter of his life he'd rather forget .
" But you can't forget things like that . "
It 's not only victims from that period who remember the program with horror .
Robin Peacock , now in her early 80s and living in Raleigh , was a social worker in the area of child welfare services in the 1960s and early 1970s .
She says that during those years she did n't understand the purpose and rationale given for the state eugenics program .
" At one point my concern turned to rage when working with a young couple who had come to the agency to apply to adopt an infant .
At that time , we looked into causes of sterility .
In talking with the wife , she confessed that in her early teens she had been sent to one of the state 's training schools for juvenile delinquents .
While there , and without her knowledge , she had been sterilized .
The memory of that painful conversation has remained with me over 40 years . "
Hundreds of children who passed through the doors of state training schools ended up sterilized .
Caswell Training Center had the most , with nearly 600 sterilizations .
The State Home and Industrial School for Girls was second , with 300 sterilizations .
It was assumed that these North Carolina children would grow up to be unfit parents , so they were sterilized before they ever had the chance .
As a man , Willis is an exception to the rule of forced sterilizations .
For the most part , men and boys were a small percentage of the victims of sterilization .
Eighty - four percent of the sterilization victims overall were women .
And by the 1960s , nearly all of the sterilization victims were female .
Women bore the brunt of the sterilization law , even though it was readily acknowledged that a tubal ligation for females was a more invasive surgical procedure requiring significant downtime for women than was a vasectomy for males , especially before the advent of laparoscopic surgery .
Eugenic sterilizations for women were secured and performed at a remarkably rapid pace , at a time when women in the general population had an extremely difficult time accessing birth control , sterilization and abortion .
Most hospitals followed the " 120 formula . "
In order to be considered for elective sterilization , you multiplied the woman's age by the number of children she had , and the number had to reach or exceed 120 .
So if a woman was 30 years old and had four children , for instance , she might be allowed to have a tubal ligation .
Even then , she would often need the endorsement of two doctors plus a psychiatrist to obtain the procedure .
There were also policies in place requiring both doctor and spousal permission for a woman to use birth control .
" In general , the whole policy [ surrounding women and reproduction ] was so contradictory , " Schoen says .
" It displayed a deep distrust toward women 's choices ....
The underlying message in these policies geared toward women is that they are not equipped to make their own responsible decisions . "
In Schoen 's book Choice & Coercion , she writes about parents who would sometimes petition the board for sterilizations of their daughters because they feared a pregnancy would ruin their family 's reputation .
In one especially troubling case , a father sought sterilization for his 14 - year - old daughter and admitted he had incestuous feelings for her .
An examination revealed that the girl had had intercourse .
The petition was approved .
We do not know what became of this young girlfirst betrayed and possibly abused by her own father , then betrayed and abused by the state .
Schoen 's book also notes cases when women themselves actively sought eugenic sterilization and sometimes were successful , other times not .
Shirley was a white woman in her 30s who had suffered from mental illness for years , had been in and out of psychiatric hospitals and had given up three children for adoption and could not care for the fourth .
She actively sought eugenic sterilization in 1966 to relieve her constant fear of pregnancy .
Her husband , however , objected to the procedure , thinking he might want to have more children in the future and hoping Shirley might be cured of " not wanting more children . "
So the board turned down Shirley 's petition .
They deferred to the male head of the household as the person best capable of making the decision .
If the eugenic sterilization program in practice was discriminatory based on a person 's gender , class or race , it was especially so for those individuals who stood at the intersection of all three .
Never an attractive program , by the early 1950s eugenics in North Carolina managed to take an even uglier turn .
Noninstitutional procedures rapidly increased .
With social workers empowered to petition the board for sterilization of their cases , black women from welfare families were increasingly targeted for the procedure .
Nial Cox Ramirez , a 64 - year - old black woman now living in Union City , Ga. , was one of them .
In 1964 , 18 - year - old Nial became pregnant .
She was from a poor family , and she recalls a white woman with a briefcase ( " the Devil from hell " ) frequently visiting the family 's home and telling the girl she needed to agree to sterilization or her entire family would lose its welfare benefits .
" She would tell me , ' If your mother loses her check , your brothers and sisters will starve and it will be all your fault . ' "
Nial was faced with a stark choice : sacrifice her future family to save her current one .
She agreed to the procedure following the birth of her daughter but tearfully pleaded with the doctor to spare herto not sterilize her and to just say that he had .
The doctor told her he had no choice .
Perhaps to make her feel better or to relieve his own guilty conscience , he told Nial that the procedure was temporary and she could get it undone later on .
" He told me a bald - faced lie .
He knew it was permanent . "
Nial 's daughter , Debra Chesson of Riverdale , Ga. , is still angry and heartbroken about what happened to her mother in North Carolina more than four decades before .
In a letter dated Nov. 18 , 2008 , to Rep .
Womble , she writes : " The memories are very painful and have left her with feelings of inadequacies which hurt me too ...
These people ( the Survivors ) should not have to prove what was done to them was wrong .
It was !
It violated not only their civil rights but their God given rights .... "
Being young , African - American , unwed and pregnant was apparently enough evidence to classify Nial as " feebleminded , " but the lynchpin was that she resided in a home that drew a welfare check and received visits from a social worker .
Presumably , there were girls and boys from wealthy and middle - class white as well as black families who could have also been characterized as " feebleminded . "
But they are largely absent from the group that ended up sterilized .
Many North Carolinians who might have otherwise ended up under the doctor 's knife didn ' tfor the simple reason that their families had money and clout .
The eugenics program of North Carolina was part of a much larger pattern of sterilization abuse across the South .
A class action lawsuit filed in federal court from Alabama in 1973 revealed that an estimated 100,000 to 150,000 poor women in the United States had been sterilized annually under federally funded programs .
Nearly half of these women were black , numbers far exceeding the percentage of African - American women in the general population .
This number of sterilizations equals the rate reached by the Nazi sterilization program in the 1930s .
" It was n't just a North Carolina issue .
These kinds of population control policies tend to target socially devalued people , " says Dr. Dorothy Roberts , a professor at Northwestern University School of Law and author of Killing the Black Body .
" The message is that certain people should n't be having children .
They are blamed for their own low social status . "
Mary English , a black woman now in her late 50s from Fayetteville , was married with three children when she started having health problems at age 22 .
Her doctor suggested she participate in a " program " in which she would undergo a procedure and not have to worry about birth control anymore .
He told her the procedure was easily reversible should she decide to have more children in the future .
According to Mary , the doctor had her sign a blank piece of paper authorizing the procedure .
A few years later , when she went back to get the procedure reversed , she was informed that it was , in fact , permanent .
" He got me and all my friends , " she says of the doctor 's blank - paper program .
Unfortunately , Mary 's name does not match with any of the records from the Eugenics Board stored in the state historical archives .
Her doctor was apparently " going rogue " and operating outside the appropriate legal channels for eugenic sterilizations .
Mary will not qualify for compensation when and if it is ever paid .
We have no way of knowing how many others may have been coerced or otherwise misled into sterilization outside of the state 's legal program .
Mary is still trying to figure out how to obtain some measure of justice .
In the 1930s and ' 40s , African - Americans represented 23 percent of North Carolina sterilizations .
That grew to 59 percent between 1958 and 1960 and finally to 64 percent between 1964 and 1966 .
Dr. Roberts says the policies surrounding women and reproduction , especially African - American women , have been shaped by a long - standing mythology .
" There 's the myth of the ' Jezebel , ' or the black woman who is mainly characterized by her unrestrained promiscuity and subsequent irresponsible childbearing . "
This myth , she says , was developed during the time of slavery in the South and was used as a way of legitimizing her rape and exploitation as a breeder to perpetuate slavery .
The Jezebel character later morphed into the " Welfare Queen , " the black woman who deviously has babies to get a fatter check .
" These myths helped legitimize white oppression and perpetuate racial inequality , " Roberts says .
" When you think about it , these forced sterilizations were very violent , brutal assaults on these women 's bodies .
The mythology helped to justify their assault because it was being done not only for the ' good ' of society but for the ' good ' of the victim as well . "
Dr. Roberts points out that it 's interesting to note what was happening historically while black women made up an increasingly larger percentage of eugenic sterilizations .
The civil rights movement , desegregation in the South and inclusion of African - Americans as Aid to Dependent Children ( ADC ) recipients greatly heightened racial tensions and fears among whites in the South .
" For centuries , black mothers were viewed as naturally inferior , deviant beings who transferred a deviant lifestyle to their childrendooming each succeeding generation to a life of poverty and delinquency .
A persistent objective of American social policy has been to monitor and restrain this corrupting tendency of black motherhood . "
Roberts contends that the regulation of black women 's reproductive decisions has often been overlooked in discussions of racial oppression , yet it has been a central aspect of racial oppression in America .
Sadly , more than half of the forced sterilization victims have already died , without ever receiving any kind of acknowledgement that what happened to them was wrong .
But for the estimated 2,800 individuals still expected to be alive today , there is still a chance to do what 's right .
Sharing their stories , acknowledging the past and trying to learn something from it is a start .
The $ 20,000 compensation being considered for survivors is not a hefty sum when you think about what the trade - off has been .
Still , it is something , and it should be paid while the survivors are still surviving .
In the letter from Nial 's daughter , she writes about how her mother is on a fixed income now and struggles to pay her medical bills .
" No , a monetary settlement will not turn time back and make everything go away but it will help her present and future .
It will make her life and the lives of all the other survivors easier ... [ It ] will not ease my mother 's or the rest of the survivor 's internal pain but it will ease their living . "
At 82 years old , Agnes is not sure she 'll live to see when or if the proposed compensation is paid .
She appreciates the efforts being made in North Carolina to reconcile its eugenic past by acknowledging what she and thousands of others in our state went through .
" It 's nice to know there are people out there that really care about your rights . "
Elaine , Agnes , Willis and Nial wonder why the American values of equal protection and individual liberty did not apply to them , and there are no simple answers to give them .
They were caught within an ideological framework that said it 's acceptable to toss aside ethics and trample over the most basic of human rights if someone is perceived to not meet certain social expectations .
Now in her mid-50s , Elaine Riddick is one of the younger survivors of North Carolina 's eugenic sterilization program .
From her apartment on the 32nd floor of an Atlanta skyrise , she has a beautiful view of the entire city .
She says she has been able to obtain some measure of peace , which she attributes to her faith in God and finally letting go of the self - blame that she carried for years .
Her adult son , Tony Riddick , whom she describes as " brilliant , " still lives in Winfall and owns his own computer electronics company .
Elaine has a loving boyfriend who , she says , takes good care of her and has a positive relationship with her son and siblings .
Still , sometimes the cruelties from her past come back to haunt her .
" Sometimes I think , what is happiness ?
Am I really happy ?
I do n't think I will ever be happy , because of what they took from me . "
ABUBAKAR AWUDU SURAJ was already unconscious when the cabin crew of EgyptAir MS965 saw him on board , before the Tokyo - to - Cairo flight .
Shortly later he was dead .
A Ghanaian who had lived illegally in Japan , Mr Suraj was being deported on March 22nd , when he was lifted and forced onto the plane in handcuffs with a towel gagging him and knotted in the back to restrain him .
An autopsy failed to determine a cause of death , yet his widow saw facial injuries when she identified the body .
Three days later an Immigration Bureau official admitted : “ It is a sorry thing that we have done . ”
The death is putting Japan 's controversial immigration policy under a sharper spotlight .
The country has long eschewed immigration .
In recent months , however , its resistance has become even tougher .
Families have been broken apart as parents of children born in Japan have been detained and deported .
People who seemed to qualify for a special residency permit ( SRP ) , designed for those who overstay their visa but wish to remain , have been denied .
Forced deportations have become more frequent and rougher , according to the Asian People 's Friendship Society , a Japanese immigrant - support group .
Japan 's Immigration Control Centres , where many illegal residents are detained , have faced special criticism .
This year alone , two detainees have committed suicide , one has publicly complained of abuse , and 70 inmates staged a hunger strike demanding better treatment .
Around 2 m foreigners live legally in Japan , which has a population of 128 m ; the justice ministry counted 91,778 illegal residents as of January .
But the number , boosted by cheap Chinese labourers , may well be much higher .
After a nine - day research trip last month , Jorge Bustamante , the UN's special rapporteur on migrants ' rights , complained that legal and illegal migrants in Japan face “ racism and discrimination , exploitation [ and ] a tendency by the judiciary and police to ignore their rights ” .
The SRP system is an example of the problem .
No criteria for eligibility are specified .
Instead , published “ guidelines ” are applied arbitrarily .
And people cannot apply directly for an SRP : illegal residents can only request it once in detention , or turn themselves in and try their luck while deportation proceedings are under way .
So most illegal residents just stay mum .
Mr Suraj fell into the SRP abyss after he was arrested for overstaying his visa .
Although he had lived in Japan for 22 years , was fluent in the language and married to a Japanese citizen , his SRP request was denied .
Why the tougher policy now ?
Koichi Kodama , an immigration lawyer assisting Mr Suraj 's widow , believes it is a reaction to the appointment last year as justice minister of Keiko Chiba , a pro-immigration reformer ; the old guard is clamping down .
The police are investigating the incident and the ten immigration officers in whose custody Mr Suraj died , though no charges have been brought .
As for Mr Suraj 's widow , she has yet to receive details about her husband 's death or an official apology .
The topic is one Japanese society would rather avoid .
The press barely reported it .
Still , when her name appeared online , she was fired from her job lest the incident sully her firm 's name .
In the once - turbulent Sunni enclave of Adhamiya , hope that the elections Sunday will herald a dramatic change in Iraq ’s leadership mingles ominously with fear that it wo n’t .
There ’s none of the reluctance that characterized the last elections in December 2005 , when a boycott call from Sunni Arab leaders and the ubiquitous presence of insurgents deterred most people from going to the polls , and candidates did n’t dare campaign for fear of being killed .
This time , huge billboards promoting Sunni and secular candidates jostle for attention on drab streets strewn with garbage .
Top politicians , including Sunni Vice President Tariq Hashimi and former Prime Minister Iyad Allawi , have made campaign appearances , mingling with citizens in markets , kissing babies and urging everyone to vote .
Everyone , it seems , says they will .
And expectations are high -- perhaps dangerously so -- that the full participation of the Sunni Arab minority will bring to an end five years of rule by the Shiite Muslim religious parties that took power after the U.S. - led invasion in 2003 .
“ This election will bring change , ” said Abdullah Sabah , 26 , a businessman who plans to vote for Allawi and has no doubt that he will win .
“ He will create equality among Iraqis because he is not sectarian , which means opportunities and jobs will be available to us . ”
Allawi , a secular Shiite whose Iraqiya coalition includes both Sunnis and Shiites , seems to be the preferred choice of most of the voters in this staunchly Sunni Arab neighborhood , a sign that politics have matured somewhat since the days when this was a stronghold of the Sunni extremist group Al Qaeda in Iraq , and Shiites , a minority in Adhamiya , were driven from their homes or killed .
How much politics have matured , however , is the fundamental question confronting Iraq as it prepares to elect a government that will steer the country beyond the planned final departure of U.S. combat troops by the end of August and all U.S. forces by the end of 2011 .
The 2005 vote was followed by a civil war in which triumphalist Shiites leveraged their control over the institutions of state , including the security forces , against Sunni insurgents , who fought a government they did n’t choose .
These elections , with their multiple competing factions and massively uncertain outcome , have the potential to be just as destabilizing , said Joost Hiltermann of the International Crisis Group .
“ Whether the results alone will trigger a renewal of conflict , I do n’t know .
But it ’s not clear whether the losers , whoever they are , will accept defeat , ” he said .
“ Anything could happen , and it will be happening just as U.S. troops withdraw . ”
Across the street from Adhamiya ’s Abu Hanifa mosque , once the scene of fiery anti-U.S. sermons and frequent attacks on U.S. forces , men gathering at a tea shop spoke darkly of renewed conflict should the same Shiite parties win .
They are convinced that full Sunni participation at the polls will bring a new government to power , headed by Allawi or by another secular or a Sunni leader .
They say they are not prepared to contemplate the alternative , a renewed mandate for the Shiite religious parties , be it Prime Minister Nouri Maliki ’s State of Law coalition or the Iraqi National Alliance .
“ Do n’t tell me that they will win .
They will not win , ” said Khalil Ibrahim Rasheed , 42 , who is a member of the local Sunni Awakening force , made up mostly of former insurgents who helped the United States drive Al Qaeda in Iraq - linked extremists out in 2007 .
“ If it happens that they do , we will give victory to the one who deserves it by force .
We are prepared to die for our religion and our country . ”
Such talk may be bravado .
In the battle for control of Baghdad ’s streets that raged in 2006 and ’ 07 , Sunnis lost .
Driven out of many once - mixed neighborhoods , they are now confined to a few enclaves scattered across the city .
Adhamiya is surrounded by a 15 - foot concrete wall , installed to keep insurgents in as well as Shiite militias out , and residents say they feel nervous every time they venture out into the majority Shiite city beyond .
Fears arose about Sunni participation after nearly 500 mostly Sunni and secular candidates were barred from running because of alleged ties to the former Baath Party .
U.S. officials say they are encouraged that it did not lead to any significant calls for a Sunni boycott .
But the ban could fuel Sunni complaints of unfairness should the election not go their way , and it has heightened the Sunnis ’ sense of alienation from a government perceived as prejudiced against them .
“ It makes them feel insecure , ” said Maysoon Damluji , a spokeswoman for Allawi ’s coalition .
Insecurity underpins the determination of Sunnis here to vote .
They complain of persecution , of arbitrary arrests and detentions , of discrimination in the job market .
Adhamiya gets fewer hours of electricity than other neighborhoods , garbage is rarely collected and reconstruction projects are virtually nonexistent , they say .
“ This government has created an imbalance , ” said Abu Adil , 70 , whose two sons have been detained without being charged for more than a year by the Iraqi security forces .
“ If balance is not restored , there will be many problems between the government and the people . ”
It ’s a prospect that worries Khaled Qassem , 33 , a former soldier who lost his job when the U.S. disbanded Saddam Hussein ’s army in 2003 .
His brother was killed in sectarian violence in 2006 .
Qassem now supports his brother ’s seven children and his own year - old baby on his meager earnings as a taxi driver .
He confides that his mother is Shiite , and he sometimes visits his Shiite relatives just across the Tigris River that splits the capital , in the rival neighborhood of Kadhimiya .
“ They are like us , ” he said of the Shiites there .
“ They complain of the same suffering as us .
Every household , on both sides , lost someone to the fighting .
If we fight again , only women and children will remain , and who will be left to support them then ? ”
But Qassem says he ’s confident there wo n’t be another war .
“ I have this very strong feeling , deep inside my heart , that this election will change everything , ” he said , patting his chest and grinning broadly .

ASYMMETRICAL POLARIZATION ….
The Washington Post ‘s editorial board recently lamented polarization in American politics , and much to my chagrin , chalked up the problem to “ the ideological purification of both parties . ”
Brookings ’ William Galston and Thomas Mann acknowledged the polarization , which is unrivaled in modern American history , but reminded the editors that “ these developments have not produced two mirror - image political parties . ”
We have , instead , asymmetrical polarization .
Put simply : More than 70 percent of Republicans in the electorate identify themselves as conservative or very conservative , while only 40 percent of rank - and - file Democrats call themselves liberal or very liberal .
It is far easier for congressional Republicans to forge and maintain a united front than it is for Democrats .
George W. Bush pushed through his signature tax cuts and Iraq war authorization with substantial Democratic support , while unwavering Republican opposition nearly torpedoed Barack Obama ’s health - reform legislation .
When Democrats are in the majority , their greater ideological diversity combined with the unified opposition of Republicans induces the party to negotiate within its ranks , producing policies that not long ago would have attracted the support of a dozen Senate Republicans .
Consider the episode that The Post cited as Exhibit A for polarization : Sen. Robert Bennett ’s commendable work with Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden to develop a bipartisan health bill , which was used against him by conservative Utah activists to deny him renomination .
The Post failed to note , however , that Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell pulled the plug on the Wyden - Bennett initiative well before health reform was taken up last year .
Bennett and other Republican co-sponsors of this bipartisan bill were told in no uncertain terms that the party strategy was to block every major domestic policy initiative of the new administration and not to engage in substantive negotiations that could produce bipartisan majorities on the floor .
During the lengthy health debate , not one Senate Republican spoke in support of the Wyden - Bennett bill .
Tea Party activists outraged at Republican incumbents for cavorting with the enemy ( i.e. , Obama and the Democrats ) took their cue from Republican Party leaders .
The media establishment is no doubt uncomfortable with this reality — though I give kudos to the Post for running the Galston / Mann piece — but here ’s hoping the “ both sides are always equally wrong , even when they ’re not ” crowd takes note .
Mandalore — or Mand ’alor in it ’s truest rendering and which meant “ sole ruler ” in Mando ’a — was the title of the leader of the Mandalorians .
The title originated with the mythical figure Mandalore the First , whose warriors were said to have conquered the planet of Mandalore .
Eventually , the term came to be applied to the Mandalorian leaders , with the first known bearer of the title being Mandalore the Indomitable , who reigned during the Great Sith War .
The last known person to claim the title of Mand ’alor was Yaga Auchs , who kept the Mandalorians on Mandalore during the Sith–Imperial War .
The title was notable for surviving several thousand years , through considerable Mandalorian hardships .
Despite several lost wars , infighting and the emergence of the “ Mandalorian mercenary ” phenomenon , at least seventeen Mandalorians declared themselves Mand ’alor throughout the years , with varying degrees of success in their attempts to lead the Mandalorian clans .
History
When the Taung species were driven from Coruscant in the early years of the Galactic Republic , they searched the galaxy for a new planet to colonize .
They decided upon a planet in the Outer Rim Territories populated by enormous mythosaurs .
The leader of these Taung , Mandalore the First , led his warriors as they slaughtered the mythosaurs , and used their bones to establish cities .
The planet was named Mandalore after this leader , and the Taung themselves started referring to themselves as “ Mandalorians ” in his honor .
Over time , Mandalorian leaders began using “ Mand’alor ” as a title .
By the time of Mandalore the Indomitable ’s reign , around 4,000 BBY , this title was represented by a war mask .
Without the mask , no new Mand ’alor could be declared .
This was the source of the great confusion and disillusionment that befell the Mandalorians at large at the end of the Mandalorian Wars — Mandalore the Ultimate had been killed in battle by the Jedi Revan , who took the mask for himself .
It was not until Revan revealed the location of the mask to Canderous Ordo that the tradition was allowed to continue .
At some later time , the tradition of passing the title by passing on the mask of the Mand ’alor faded , replaced by a simple tradition of declared succession .
Tradition
At the time of the Mandalorian Wars , the Mand ’alor was appointed based on individual worth , the definition of which is unknown .
Also , at the time , the new Mand ’alor could be declared only when they possessed the mask of Mandalore .
When the mask vanished for some time , the Mandalorian clans splintered .
The tradition declined at some point before 60 BBY , by the time of Jaster Mereel ’s reign , when it seemed Mandalorians merely flocked to powerful and charismatic leaders .
" This puts Lee in a very difficult situation , but I do not think that an Israeli - style , targeted response is likely , " said Aidan Foster - Carter , an expert on Korean affairs at Leeds University .
" That is because the United States wo n't have it and there is the danger that any retaliation will descend into a horrible war . "

The Galaxy and Chivas USA share a stadium , practice fields , a parking lot and a gymnasium , which means players from both teams frequently bump into one another in the hallways of the Home Depot Center .
Most of the time , that ’s not a problem .
When the players bump into one another on the field , however — well , that ’s a different story .
The teams renewed hostilities Thursday before an announced crowd of 19,805 and the match once again played to form , with both sides leaving blood on the field and the Galaxy escaping with a 2 - 0 victory in the Super Clasico on two goals by Edson Buddle .
“ There ’s no bad blood , ” Galaxy Coach Bruce Arena said .
“ We both want to win .
Nobody ’s going to give anything . ”
Perhaps .
But the team ’s final two matches last season ended in scuffles , including one that featured then - Chivas coach Preki and the Galaxy ’s David Beckham .
Neither was present Thursday .
Preki is coaching in Toronto and Beckham is rehabilitating his ruptured Achilles ’ tendon .
But the rivalry continued without them .
Actually , rivalry might be the wrong word to describe this series .
The Galaxy has n’t lost to its roommates since September 2007 .
But you would n’t have guessed that from the physical play Thursday , with the teams combining for more yellow cards , five , than goals .
Buddle , perhaps the most physical of all , was in the middle of most of that , scoring the only goals and figuring in two of the yellow cards , drawing one and being charged with another .
Buddle ’s goal six minutes into the Galaxy ’s season - opener was the only score in a 1 - 0 victory over the New England Revolution , and he waited an extra minute to score against Chivas .
The goal came in similar fashion , though , on a header at the end of play started by Landon Donovan .
Donovan brought the ball up the right wing and passed to Sean Franklin , whose 30 - yard pass found Buddle just outside the six - yard box .
Chivas , meanwhile , had trouble finishing off plays , just as it did in its 1 - 0 season - opening loss to the Colorado Rapids .
But Chivas had its chances .
In the 80th minute , Chivas had two less than a second apart with Jesus Padilla , who was being pulled at from behind , directing a soft shot right into the chest of Galaxy goalkeeper Donovan Ricketts and Maicon Santos booting the rebound over the wide - open goal .
Five minutes later , Santos misfired again , redirecting a header into the side of the net .
A minute after that , the Galaxy , led again by Donovan and Buddle , were racing the other way , with the captain feeding Buddle deep in the box in the 87th minute for his third goal of the season , ending any hope for a Chivas comeback .

Nokia last week asked a federal judge to toss out Apple 's antitrust claims , saying the iPhone maker indulged in " legal alchemy " when it tried to divert attention from its " free - riding " of Nokia 's intellectual property .
The filing last Thursday was the latest salvo in a battle that began in October 2009 when Finnish handset maker Nokia sued Apple , saying the iPhone infringed on 10 of its patents and that the U.S. company was trying " to get a free ride on the back of Nokia 's innovation . "
Nokia demanded royalties on all iPhones sold since Apple introduced the smartphone in June 2007 .
Apple countered in December with a lawsuit of its own that not only claimed that Nokia infringed 13 of its patents but that Nokia also violated antitrust law by using the legal system to attack Apple after it declined to pay what it called " exorbitant royalties " and refused to give Nokia access to iPhone patents .
It was the six non-patent claims by Apple that Nokia asked U.S. District Court Judge Gregory Sleet to throw out last week .
" These non-patent counterclaims are designed to divert attention away from free - riding off of Nokia 's intellectual property , a practice Apple evidently believes should only be of paramount concern when it is the alleged victim , " charged Nokia in the motion .
Nokia urged Sleet to dismiss Apple 's claims .
" Sometimes a patent dispute is just a patent dispute , " Nokia said of its fight with Apple after licensing negotiations broke down .
" Through what charitably could be called an attempt at legal alchemy , Apple employs revisionist history , misleading characterizations , unsupported allegations and flawed and contradictory legal theories to turn these fruitless negotiations into a multi-count federal lawsuit , " Nokia charged .
Both Nokia and Apple have also filed infringement actions with the U.S. International Trade Commission ( ITC ) to block imports of each other 's phones , and in the case of Nokia 's filing , virtually every Apple hardware product , including iPods and Macs .
A separate lawsuit , which covers the patents alleged in the ITC complaint , was put on hold two weeks ago by Sleet pending the Washington agency 's ruling .
It will be some time before the original case is heard by a jury .
According to a schedule proposed last week , the Nokia and Apple lawsuits wo n't go to trial until April or May 2012 .
Apple has also sued Taiwanese handset manufacturer HTC for patent infringement .
HTC makes Google 's flagship Nexus One , as well as nearly a dozen other phones that rely on Google 's Android mobile operating system .

We are very excited to announce a new fundraising effort we have been carefully pondering for a while now .
We recently had 8 of special edition black - on - white wristbands made up .
We thought it would be cool , as the creators , to have our own one - of - a - kind style .
But we then began to think of how we may use these towards the fundraising efforts we were already working on .
We are proud to announce that by the end of our wristband sale , we will have raised $ 1,130 for Children ’s Defense Fund !
We wanted a way to do more , for another cause that really needs it .
Three days after we placed our very first wristband order , the Gulf Oil Spill happened .
45 days later … it continues to happen .
By now , we ’re sure a lot of you have seen these pictures ( warning : may be a little upsetting ) , which emerged today , of the wildlife affected by the Gulf Oil Spill .
After we saw them , it seemed meant to be that our donations from this event should go towards this cause .
The Goal :
We want to raise $ 200 total to adopt an endangered brown pelican in the name of LOST Fans who are concerned about the oil spill .
It ’s a small effort , but something we can all afford and be proud to be a part of .
We will adopt the Pelican through the IBRRC ( International Bird Rescue Research Center ) , which calculates $ 200 as the cost to care for one pelican .
They have recently set up shop with a rescue team in affected areas to help get these animals cleaned and released .
After adoption , we receive a number which will identify our pelican for life , and a certificate signifying the adopter .
We plan to honor “ LOST Fans ” as the adopter of the pelican .
The Plan : We ’re going to set up a donation widget on our webpage and Facebook .
Donate as little or as much as you ’d like !
Every little bit will count .
We ’re going to accept donations throughout June .
Any amount raised over $ 200 will also go to the IBRRC .
The Bonus :
Here ’s where it gets more fun !
Rather than have a bidding competition ( which was our original idea for these wristbands ) , we want to give all donors equal opportunity to win a prize .
We will randomly select 3 donors to win a prize pack of 2 wristbands – 1 light , 1 dark – in the size of your choice .
No matter how much you donate you will be entered to win !
But , even if you are not one of the 3 lucky winners , you will receive a color PDF of the certificate of adoption .
We really hope that this will work out well and LOST fans will show their support for these animals !
With your help , there is one lucky pelican out there whose life will be saved ( or at least bettered ) by the legacy of LOST .
Pretty awesome in our opinion !
You can read more about IBRRC and how they help birds here .
Thank you guys so much for whatever you can do to help , and good luck with the prize !

G overnments intervene against the religious wishes of Jehovah 's Witness families to give blood transfusions to save the lives of their kin .
The Quebec government wants to intervene to deny health care to women whose religious wish is to wear the niqab .
In Saudi Arabia , Iran and parts of Taliban - controlled Afghanistan , police or vigilante militias crack down on women not wearing the niqab or the burqa .
In Quebec , authorities want to crack down on women who do .
Quebec officials have already chased down one niqab - wearing woman to oust her from a second French language class after she had been hounded out of her first .
The bureaucrats are emulating the gendarmes of autocrats Kemal Ataturk of Turkey in the 1920s and the first Shah of Iran in the 1930s who persecuted women wearing either the niqab or the hijab .
It is scary when a state feels compelled to keep women either covered or uncovered .
It is scarier when majorities in democracies feel threatened by a minority – in this case , a tiny minority within the Muslim minority .
Or feel the need to crush an isolated religious or cultural practice .
Had such attitudes prevailed in an earlier era , we may not have been blessed today with Hutterites , Orthodox Jews , Sikhs and others in the rich religious tapestry of Canada .
Across Europe and now sadly in Quebec , populations and governments are in a tizzy over a few dozen niqabi women .
Sadder still , Quebec is not only out of step with the rest of Canada but has taken a bigoted leap ahead of Europe , the historic home of Islamophobia .
In France – where out of 5 million Muslims , 367 wear the niqab ( as counted by the domestic intelligence service , no less ) – a parliamentary panel has pondered the issue for a year and suggested a ban from schools and hospitals but nowhere else .
In Denmark – where out of 100,000 Muslims , there are less than 200 niqabis ( as estimated by the ministry of social affairs ) , the government is still mulling a ban .
In Quebec , less than 25 women are said to wear the niqab – of whom only 10 turned up last year at the Montreal office of the provincial health board out of 118,000 visitors .
Yet the obsession with the niqab continues .
On the day Jean Charest tabled his anti-niqab bill , Hydro Quebec 's $ 3.2 billion deal to take over NB Power and gain access to the lucrative U.S. market collapsed – with nary a public concern .
His bill calls not only for showing the face for the legitimate purposes of a photo ID and security .
It also bans niqabis from working for , or even receiving services from , government and the broader public sector .
These taxpayers may be denied all schooling , including French language instruction , and all non-emergency health care , including regular checkups .
Charest rationalized it on the basis of gender equity , the secular nature of the state , the need to integrate immigrants , and the importance of personal interaction .
Except that :
The giant crucifix in the National Assembly will stay .
Property and other tax breaks given the churches will remain , including for the Catholic Church , where women must remain in the pews and not ascend to the pulpit .
Niqabi women will be driven out of the public sphere , end up with less personal interaction with others and be ghettoized .
It is a strange way to advance gender equity .
It is argued , as by Nicolas Sarkozy in France , that banning the niqab is not anti-Islamic , since it may not be a religious requirement , as opined by a senior Egyptian cleric last year .
We elect politicians not to propound fatwas but to implement secular , democratic laws in an equitable manner for one and all .
As for those enamoured of the authoritarian ways of Egypt , they are free to move there .
We are witnessing collective hysteria , prompting even liberal governments to cave in .
It was not a pretty sight to see Charest , a Liberal , competing for headlines with Ann Coulter , the Muslim - baiting neo-con from America .
That 's democracy in action , it can be said .
But we have seen many ugly manifestations of the popular will before .
Targeting the niqabis may not be in the same league as past Canadian sins against some minorities but history should provide us with the perspective to pause .

In 1994 , the United States government launched an ambitious social experiment : Federal officials offered thousands of families who were receiving housing subsidies — and living in some of the nation 's highest - crime neighborhoods — the opportunity to move away .
And so , housing vouchers in hand , about 5,000 American families in five cities — Baltimore , Boston , Chicago , Los Angeles and New York — moved to nicer urban and suburban locales , looked for jobs , entered new schools , and renewed their lives , courtesy of the government ’s $ 80 million “ Moving to Opportunity ” ( MTO ) program .
However , geography is not destiny .
The MTO experiment did not so much transform lives as produce unanticipated results :
It helped girls more than boys , for instance .
Parents enjoyed major drops in anxiety and depression — but not gains in incomes .
All told , better surroundings appear valuable but not sufficient conditions for climbing out of poverty .
“ Changing your neighborhood does not change your social world , ” says Xavier de Souza Briggs , an associate professor of sociology and urban planning at MIT .
Now Briggs has co-authored a new book analyzing the program , Moving to Opportunity : The Story of an American Experiment to Fight Ghetto Poverty , along with Susan Popkin a senior fellow at the Urban Institute in Washington , and John Goering , a professor at Baruch College in New York ; the volume was published by Oxford University Press this spring .
Safer , not richer
MTO was constructed as a randomized scientific experiment .
MTO families received housing vouchers while another set of people — the “ control group ” — remained in public housing .
But as Briggs notes , the persistence of social networks was a powerful force shaping the lives of MTO families even after they left the inner city .
Teenage boys often visited their old neighborhoods and fell back into gangs ; needy relatives still weighed on the MTO families .
“ Boys in particular remain embedded in wider networks and frequently can’t free themselves from violence and drugs , ” explains Briggs , speaking from Washington , where he is currently working in the White House as associate director of the Office of Management and Budget .
On the other hand , young women benefitted from a lessened danger of physical assault and sexual abuse .
“ It gives us reason to think the exposure of women to predatory behavior , and the resulting freedom from the fear of predation due to MTO , is very important , ” adds Briggs .
All told , MTO families moved into areas with a collective violent - crime rate that was just one - quarter of the rate in the urban neighborhoods they left behind .
Yet as the book notes , four to seven years after MTO started , there were “ no significant impacts on employment , earnings , or receipt of public assistance . ”
Later evaluations of MTO did find some “ modest ” improvements .
Working women under 33 who moved earned $ 33 more per week ( showing the program ’s unequal gender effects ) .
MTO adults who moved to suburban neighborhoods earned about $ 75 per week more .
But as the authors state , leaving crime - ridden areas “ did not , in fact , mean relocating to a job - rich zone ” for most MTO families , largely due to “ backbreaking ” rents in safer neighborhoods .
Nationally , 6 million households spend more than half their income on rent or live in “ severely substandard ” housing , up from 3.6 million in 1978 .
In the case of MTO , the vouchers helped the families pay rent , but did not wholly subsidize rents .
During a time period , after 1994 , when housing prices rose dramatically in the metropolitan areas used in the experiment , many MTO families moved back to their old neighborhoods because they could not afford to live in thriving areas .
What is to be done ?
Other researchers are impressed that Briggs , Popkin and Goering have turned the data - intensive project into a book - length narrative , which is based heavily on interviews they conducted with MTO participants .
“ It helps readers understand the problems of ghetto poverty , and tells the story of MTO , warts and all , ” says Margery Austin Turner , a vice president at the Urban Institute , a nonprofit research center in Washington .
Turner , a former official in the Department of Housing and Urban Development ( which oversaw MTO ) , acknowledges that relocation has not by itself been a panacea for poverty .
But she defends MTO , calling it “ a rigorous test of some hypotheses . ”
The experiment , Turner says , was “ a success because we ’ve learned a tremendous amount from it about how complex the lives of low - income families are . ”
That complexity leaves Briggs and his colleagues contemplating a lengthy list of policy ideas to address urban poverty in the future , beyond housing .
The parents in MTO were often under severe emotional stress ; Briggs believes the implementation of universal health - care coverage in 2013 will help the poor get treatment for their mental - health problems .
Moreover , the MTO families were so preoccupied with safety , Briggs says , they also struggled to evaluate whether or not the schools in their new neighborhoods would be a good match for their children , something relatively low - cost initiatives might remedy .
“ People are often information - poor , not just money - poor , ” says Briggs .
“ We should try to coach people on assessing schools . ”
Similarly , Briggs adds , the poor urban parents in MTO needed better job - seeking skills .
“ Rich , poor , white , black , brown — all people have similar ideas about what it takes to get ahead , ” says Briggs .
“ But they differ in knowing about self - presentation , how to succeed in job interviews , how to go about networking .
These are foreign ideas to many people . ”
“ Moving to Opportunity ” thus starts with housing , but ends with a broader focus .
MTO ’s “ costs and risks are low , ” the authors write .
But as Briggs and his colleagues acknowledge , one tool for fighting poverty is not enough .
In the future it will be necessary “ to make relocation part of a larger recipe for getting ahead — for escaping poverty . ”
Arsenal 's long - standing interest in the Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart will prompt a formal bid once the transfer window reopens this month , with Arsène Wenger having recognised the shortcomings of both Manuel Almunia and Lukasz Fabianski at the Emirates .
City , who are resigned to being without their No1 , Shay Given , for the start of next season as a result of a shoulder injury , are expected to resist any offer , leaving the 23 - year - old to agitate for a move if the transfer is to become a reality .
However , whether their pursuit is successful or not , Arsenal 's interest does at least offer an insight into Wenger 's intention to strengthen his side in the close season after enduring a fifth successive season without a trophy .
Almunia 's form has been patchy all season and , while the Spaniard is technically unavailable at present with a wrist injury , Arsenal have handed Fabianski an opportunity to prove his worth for the final few games of the season for the second year in a row .
Yet the Pole has failed to convince ; his reputation , already damaged by costly errors against Porto in the Champions League and Wigan last month , took a further pounding after Blackburn targeted him as a potential weak linkyesterday .
The hosts duly prevailed with scrappy goals from David Dunn and Christopher Samba , with Fabianski claiming fouls .
While Wenger refused to criticise Fabianski's performance at Ewood Park , preferring instead to point a finger at the performance of the referee , Martin Atkinson , for failing to offer the goalkeeper more protection , the errors underlined the need to reinforce for next season .
The France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris , at Lyon , has attracted interest and the experienced Juventus No1 , Gianluigi Buffon , 32 , suggested today that he would be willing to move to the Premier League – " England could be the destination , " he said should the Italian club be willing to release him – yet Hart appears to be Arsenal 's priority .
The England hopeful , voted into the Professional Footballers ' Association 's Premier League team of the year last week , has enjoyed an impressive campaign on loan at Birmingham City , keeping 12 clean sheets along the way , and is staking a late claim for selection to Fabio Capello 's England squad as the third - choice goalkeeper for the World Cup finals .
Should Given 's dislocated shoulder leave him unavailable for up to five months , as feared , then Roberto Mancini is expected to offer the former Shrewsbury Town youngster a chance to impress in the first team next season and , potentially , prove his quality to retain his place ahead of the Republic of Ireland veteran .
That could yet scupper any move to Arsenal , forcing Wenger to turn his attentions elsewhere .
The Frenchman has already secured the Bordeaux forward Marouane Chamakh on a free transfer for next season , but could yet lose William Gallas , most likely to Paris Saint - Germain , under freedom of contract .
The France defender , who has not played since suffering a recurrence of a calf injury in the first leg of the Champions League quarter - final against Barcelona in March , is confident he will be fit for the World Cup .
" I will be ready for France , " he said .
" Had it not been possible [ to recover in time ] , I would have pulled out .
Right now , I feel good and ready for France . "

Attention to Detail , and stuff ...
It seems like barely a year and a half ago we totally revamped our beloved gnarl - hound with updated suspension , geometry and a host of details that saw an entirely new Nomad emerging from where the old Nomad had been - lighter , sleeker , snappier and at the same time tougher .
Time flies .
It was just a year and a half ago that eight unlucky souls got mangled in the Hellride while claiming first saddle time aboard the new beast .
And while the now tried and true aluminum Nomad is still a vital part of our lineup , we decided to splice some carbon fiber into it 's DNA and see what happens .
The new Nomad -c marks our fourth carbon fiber bike , and is the culmination of what has been a very enlightening process for us , pun intended .
In this case , the move to a carbon fiber chassis has chopped a whopping 1.25 pounds off the weight of the aluminum Nomad , while at the same time increasing strength and stiffness by large margins .
The existing aluminum Nomad is n't exactly a porker in terms of weight or a wilting violet with regard to strength , so being able to reduce weight by that much and at the same time increase strength and stiffness , without skimping on any features , is about as much of a win - win scenario as we could hope for .
It 's light .
We are seeing frames weighing in at 6.1 pounds with a RockShox Monarch 3.3 shock .
( Bear in mind , this is a tad heavier than the 5.9 pounds that is floating around out there on an early - print pdf of the marketing tri-fold for the Nomad that somebody leaked onto the interwebs before we intended anything to go public .
That 's what happens when the wrong info gets out before all the proof reading is done .
And before anyone calls foul about using a light shock like a Monarch for a hard hitting bike like the Nomad , add a third of a pound for a Fox DHX air , or just over a pound for a DHX RC4 coil .
Then go compare ... )
There are three key aspects to our carbon fiber process that differentiate it from many others and at the same time allow us to achieve the strength ( and stiffness ) to weight characteristics that we are so in love with .
They are :
By laying up and curing the entire front triangle as a single piece , instead of assembling or bonding pieces together during the process , less material can be used to achieve the same end .
Suspension pivots , disc mounts and the ISCG05 tabs are all molded into the frame in this process .
Additionally , we overbuilt things in critical areas .
The underside of the downtube features five layers of UD fiber , two of aramid fiber , and one of 3 k weave , in order to thrive in sharp and pointy environments .
The chainstays also benefit from extra layers of material .
These all serve as added insurance in rocky terrain .
One piece lay - up and molding allows the use of continuous fibers throughout the frame , meaning the structure can more widely distribute loads and absorb impact energy .
Our proprietary manufacturing process allows us to precisely control both the outside and inside frame shape while compacting the laminate layers , which in turn results in superior stiffness and strength while eliminating excess material .
We do n't have any fancy acronyms for this , but it is unique - nobody else is making carbon fiber mountain bikes this way at this time .
And , while we do n't have the selling power of a carefully focus - grouped nickname behind the process , the results are pretty enough that we are proud to show off what the insides of our frames look like .
You'd be surprised what you might find inside some of the other frames out there ... The suspension on the Nomad-c is the same as found on the aluminum Nomad , featuring our latest generation Virtual Pivot Point design with 160 mm of travel .
VPP is defined by a pair of counter - rotating links that offer a falling - to rising - shock rate , and instant center migration traits that minimize chain growth and maintain lively pedaling with a designed - in degree of anti-squat .
The shock rate allows for plush , compliant suspension behavior in the early part of travel , letting the shock react quickly to trail garbage and smaller impacts .
Then , as the shock rate flips a to rising rate later in the travel , it offers a nice progression to resist bottom out near the end of the stroke .
The end result is a suspension that performs exceptionally well over a very diverse range of terrain AND at the same time pedals with an efficiency throughout that outshines many bikes with less travel .
An important aspect of our VPP suspension is the hardware .
The lower link is aluminum and has a pair of grease ports built in to ease maintenance , while the upper link is molded carbon fiber .
Pivot axles are 15 mm diameter aluminum pieces that thread into the frame on one side , and have nifty locking collet heads on the other - this allows them to tighten down and correctly preload the angular contact pivot bearings ( another not - so - common piece of hardware ) to keep everything moving smoothly and at the same time wiggle - free .
By threading into one side of the frame and then locking into the other , the pivot hardware plays an important part in ensuring that all these carefully designed , stiff , flex hating pieces of bike continue to behave in a stiff and flex - hating fashion .
They also are designed to allow for easy removal for servicing when the time comes - no need to remove the cranks or disassemble the bike around the pivot hardware .
Alongside the carbon fiber makeover , the VPP suspension , and the trickest pivot hardware in the world , we added an impact absorbent protection strip underneath the downtube and along the drive side chainstay and seatstay .
There 's a metal plate where the chainsuck gremlins usually strike .
You 'll find cable stops for dropper seatposts integrated into the frame .
An ISCG05 chainguide mount is molded into the bottom bracket area during lay - up , as are the disc brake tabs and dropouts .
There 's a 1.5 " headtube up front , since we figured this bike would probably be getting treated with a bit more abuse than most taper - steerer forks would be intended to see .
You can have it any color you want , so long as you like white with black decals or a matte carbon color with gold pinstripey decals .
The Nomad -c will also be available for delivery starting mid-June , in all the usual build options per our website ( but we wo n't have a page up for this specific model for a few more weeks .
Hang in there , we 're working on some crunchy new website goodness ! ) , with prices starting at $ 2499 US MSRP ( read that again , US MSRP ) for a frame and Monarch 3.3 shock .
THE FINAL FOUR – The Butler Did It
Butler University is a private liberal arts university in Indianapolis .
It was founded by abolitionist and attorney Ovid Butler in 1855 .
It serves over 4,000 undergraduate and graduate students in 60 degree programs through five colleges : Business , Education , Liberal Arts and Sciences , Pharmacy and Health Sciences , and the Jordan College of Fine Arts .
Butler ’s tuition , room and board total $ 41,500 annually , and over two - thirds of students receive some form of need - based aid .
It has an endowment of $ 113 million , and on Saturday April 3rd , 2010 , the Butler University Bulldogs will be at the center of the basketball universe .
Butler ’s basketball arena , Hinkle Fieldhouse , was the largest basketball arena in the US for several decades .
It is considered a Hoosier Hysteria icon : from its opening in 1928 until 1971 , it was the site of the final rounds of the Indiana state high school basketball tournament and was the site for the championship game in the movie Hoosiers .
In 1954 , Butler hosted the historic final when Milan High School ( enrollment 161 ) defeated Muncie High School [ now Muncie Central ] ( enrollment over 1,600 ) to win the state title .
The state final depicted in the 1986 movie Hoosiers , loosely based on the Milan Miracle story , was shot in Hinkle Fieldhouse .
All college basketball fans know that Indiana is a basketball state , and the Final Four is in Indianapolis this year , So , when Butler ( enrollment 4,500 ) tips off against Michigan State ( enrollment 47,000 ) , basketball neutrals will be rooting for Butler .
The other game between West Virginia ( enrollment 28,000 ) and Duke ( enrollment 14,000 ) is almost a sideshow .
Basketball legends , Larry Bird , Oscar Robertson and John Wooden are all from Indiana , all the stars are in alignment .
A Butler victory in this tournament would be the second great sports story of the year , the first was the New Orleans Saints winning the Superbowl .
Prediction : Butler to win it all .
The Butler Bulldogs .
When looking for a cheap , reliable way to track gestures , Robert Wang and Jovan Popovic of MIT 's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory came upon this notion : why not paint the operator 's hands ( or better yet , his Lycra gloves ) in a manner that will allow the computer to differentiate between different parts of the hand , and differentiate between the hand and the background ?
Starting with something that Howie Mandel might have worn in the 80s , the researchers are able to use a simple webcam to track the hands ' locations and gestures -- with relatively little lag .
The glove itself is split into twenty patches made up of ten different colors , and while there 's no telling when this technology will be available for consumers , something tells us that when it does become available it 'll be very hard not to notice .
Video after the break .
Just received a nice letter from Rob Wang , who points out that his website is the place to see more videos , get more info , and -- if you 're lucky -- one day download the APIs so you can try it yourself .
What are you waiting for ?

For Immediate Release , April 21 , 2010 Contact : Randy Serraglio , ( 520 ) 784-1504 or rserraglio@biologicaldiversity.org Center for Biological Diversity Gives Out 250,000 Endangered Species Condoms for Earth Day Wildly Successful Educational Project Highlights Devastating Impacts of
Human Overpopulation on the Environment TUCSON , Ariz . —
Through a network of 5,000 volunteers operating in all 50 states – as well as Canada , Puerto Rico , and Mexico – the Center for Biological Diversity will distribute 250,000 free Endangered Species Condoms at Earth Day events as part of its campaign to address unsustainable human population growth .
The Center ’s Earth Day distribution is supported by an educational Web site – www.EndangeredSpeciesCondoms.com – with information about the devastating impacts of human overpopulation on endangered species .
The site also offers options to volunteer to distribute these unique condom packages and enter to win free condoms for life .
“ Since the original Earth Day in 1970 , global population has nearly doubled , ” said Randy Serraglio , a conservation advocate leading the Center ’s overpopulation campaign .
“ In 1970 , it was well understood that overpopulation was causing the environmental challenges that we faced .
Today , on the 40th anniversary of Earth Day , unsustainable human population growth is too often ignored , even though it continues to drive all of the major environmental problems that plague our planet .
“ The pressures of 6.8 billion consumers on the planet are particularly damaging to endangered species and their habitats , ” said Serraglio .
“ All of the major threats to the earth ’s biodiversity – sprawl , pollution , competition for water , climate change , and so on – are driven by a huge and rapidly growing human population . ”
The Endangered Species Condoms , featuring catchy slogans and beautiful artwork depicting six different endangered species , will be distributed at Earth Day events on college campuses , in bars , and at concerts , markets , clinics , and other places by a diverse group of volunteers .
Stated Serraglio , “ These condoms are designed to appeal to people ’s sense of humor and remind them that , in the long run , we will not be able to solve our environmental problems and protect the amazing diversity of life on earth without stabilizing global human population . ”
The Center has enlisted more than 5,000 volunteer distributors to hand out 350,000 Endangered Species Condoms to date .
“ The response has been overwhelming , ” said Serraglio .
“ More requests are coming in every day , and we ’re hearing back from volunteers that Endangered Species Condoms are wildly popular in their communities . ”
Endangered Species Condoms are being distributed for free to highlight the need for universal access to free birth control for everyone who wants it .
“ The 350,000 Endangered Species Condoms that we have distributed thus far roughly equals the number of births around the world each day , ” said Serraglio .
“ Absent educational programs such as this one , and vastly improved access to birth control , global human population could reach 10 to 15 billion people by mid-century .
It is mind - boggling to consider the impacts of 15 billion people on the earth ’s resources .
The earth simply cannot sustain our current growth and still provide a living for all species , including humans .
“ With extremely high levels of consumption and the fastest - growing population of any developed nation , the United States is a fundamental part of the problem , ” continued Serraglio .
“ The United States could be a fundamental part of the solution by taking the lead in promoting policies that will stabilize runaway human population growth .
Through the empowerment of women , education on the dangers of overpopulation , and universal access to free birth control , we can stabilize global human population at a sustainable level . ”

She has built her fame and considerable fortune by baring her soul to a nation of telly addicts on an almost daily basis .
But despite her carefully cultivated " woman of the people " image , Oprah Winfrey takes an exceedingly dim view of any outsiders impertinent enough to wonder what really makes her tick .
That , at least , is the verdict of the celebrity biographer Kitty Kelley , one of the book industry 's foremost scandalmongers , who claims the magisterial chat - show host 's personal privacy is protected by a brand of media censorship so far reaching that it might have turned Senator McCarthy green with envy .
Ms Kelley , who has previously taken a typewriter - shaped hatchet to the lives of such luminaries as Nancy Reagan , Frank Sinatra , and the British Royal Family , will tomorrow publish an unauthorised biography of Winfrey , which is expected to delve into her abusive childhood and somewhat mysterious sex life .
The eagerly awaited tome will have a print run of 500,000 , and sufficient buzz already to be in the top 25 of Amazon 's sales charts .
Yet in contrast to almost every other biography of Ms Kelley 's career ( many of which have been number one bestsellers ) the launch of Oprah has attracted virtually no interest from major TV channels .
Every US network – with the exception of NBC , which will have her on Monday 's Today show – is reported to have decided , after some consideration , not to feature the author in its programmes .
The management of ABC allegedly slapped a formal ban on her appearing on its airwaves .
In an interview this week , Kelley blamed the blackballing on a collective paranoia across the industry about upsetting Winfrey , who remains one of the most powerful individuals in broadcasting and exerts a mysterious hold over prominent talk show hosts who have refused to have anything to do with the new book .
" We have already been told by Barbara Walters ' producer ' no , you cannot be on The View .
I cannot disrupt my relationship with Oprah ' , " Kelley revealed to The New York Times last week .
" Joy Behar , the same thing .
Charlie Rose ; Larry King said ' I will not do it , it might upset Oprah ' .
Even David Letterman . "
Her disclosure has prompted soul - searching in US media circles , where broadcasters like at least to pay lip service to the notion that powerful individuals cannot exert undue influence on their news agendas .
It has also highlighted Winfrey 's enduring hold on the levers of power , which was very publicly evident during the rise of Barack Obama , and persists despite her recent announcement that she intends to retire from her chat show next year .
A spokesman for Kelley , who interviewed roughly 850 of the TV presenter 's acquaintances during three years of research for the book , said the networks that refused to invite Kelley on air had " cited sensitivity to their relationship with Ms Winfrey " .
The TV stations are perhaps right to be cautious : the author is a formidable and very thorough disher of celebrity dirt whose latest biography , according to at least one critical reading , will present Winfrey as " a cold manipulator who requires everyone around her to sign confidentiality agreements " .
According to some reports , the book will say that Oprah wo n't even give her phone number to her own mother – she has to ring the star 's PA and leave a message .
The book will delve into the tough Mississippi childhood which Winfrey occasionally refers to , but about which she is notoriously sensitive .
She was sexually molested and made pregnant at the age of 14 , but bore a son who died in infancy .
" This book names the boy that she gave birth to , presents the birth certificate and tries to show how these secrets controlled Oprah for most of her life , " says Kelley .
Labour politicians and activists have spent the last few days merrily confusing motions of no confidence and dissolution , as I discussed on Thursday .
Many have stuck to the easily disproven claim that the coalition government proposes a 55 % threshold for a vote of no confidence .
It does n’t : a vote of no confidence requires 50%+1 MP now and will continue to do so .
The other line of attack has been to suggest that 50 % of MPs can currently vote to dissolve parliament .
Those who ’ve taken the trouble to check their facts at least do n’t claim that MPs can actually vote to dissolve parliament .
That power rests with the monarch , under advice from the Prime Minister .
Rather they claim that , since dissolution always follows a successful vote of no confidence , the change in effect removes the ability of 50 % + 1 MP to force a dissolution .
So it is true ?
Does a dissolution of parliament always follow a vote of no confidence ?
No , it does n’t .
And it ’s perhaps something Labour activists with an eye for history might have remembered , since the first Labour Prime Minister came to power in just such a situation .
The Conservatives won the General Election of 1923 , with 38 % of the vote .
Labour came second with 30.7 % and the Liberals came third ( stop me if this is sounding at all familiar ) .
Stanley Baldwin , the Conservative leader , became Prime Minister but lost a vote of no-confidence .
Was there a dissolution of parliament ?
No. Instead , Ramsay Macdonald became Prime Minister of the first ever Labour administration .
He clearly had n’t won the election , but in this country we elect a parliament , not a government .
Since then we ’ve had only two successful motions of no-confidence – to oust Ramsay Macdonald and James Callaghan .
In both cases the Prime Minister chose to seek a dissolution of parliament , but it was the choice of the PM .
It would have been perfectly constitutional for them to stand down without dissolving parliament and give another party leader the chance to form a government , and they might have done if such an outcome had seemed possible .
So let ’s say a vote of no confidence is passed and the Government falls .
The Prime Minister will no longer have the power to seek a dissolution of parliament , since that power will for the first time rest with MPs .
Would it still happen ?
Of course it would .
If no government could be formed , why would anyone disagree ?
The PM who would otherwise have dissolved parliament would surely support it , as would the opposition who ’d just brought down the government .
Let ’s wrap up .
Does this change allow a government to cling on if opposed by a majority of MPs ?
No .
Just as today , the government falls if it loses a vote of no confidence .
It ’s possible that a different party might then form a government as Ramsay Macdonald did , but probably more likely that MPs from all parties would vote to dissolve parliament – something they ’re unable to do at the moment .
And we should n’t forget that Labour were very happy to require two - thirds of MSPs to vote to dissolve the Scottish parliament , and that the whole point of the higher threshold is precisely to prevent the Prime Minister engineering a dissolution for party political benefit .
Uh-oh .

Duke marches to first NCAA title game since '01
The Duke Blue Devils moved within 40 minutes of their first national title in nine years Saturday night , getting 23 points from Jon Scheyer to pull away from West Virginia for a 78 - 57 victory .
I said earlier , heck everyone said ti , that the Coyotes needed to get back to their style of play and dictate how this game was going to be played .
They did it right off the bat and while there was a time that the Coyotes let Detroit pile on the shots , they never controlled the game in really any way .
The Coyotes started of pressing into the Detroit zone off the faceoff and Sami Lepisto scored just : 29 seconds in putting in a rebound off of a Petr Prucha shot .
Prucha took a shot , got a rebound , shot again and still managed to keep going to generate the chance .
It caught Detroit completely off guard and took the crowd out of the game for a large portion of the period .
Detroit would tie things up later in the period when Valtteri Filppula wristed in a chance that bounced around and found it 's way past Ilya Bryzgalov .
THe Coyotes continued to lock things down defensivly though and it ended 1 - 1 at the end of the first .
The second was all Coyotes all the time .
The Wings got some shots on Bryzgalov , but could n't get a rhythm going at all .
There was a scary moment when Shane Doan tripped over Jimmy Howard and then fell awkwardly into the boards .
He left the game on his own feet , but was obviously in pain and went back to the dressing room .
He would n't return to the game though and the coaching staff said he would be reevaluated tomorrow to see if he could play on Tuesday .
The Coyotes continued to pressure the Red Wings even with the Captain out .
They slowed the pace of the game until , with just 32 seconds left in the period , Wojtek Wolski put in a rebound from the left slot over Howard to retake the lead .
The third was just more of the same , but the Detroit defense just kept looking worse and worse .
That is until Petr Prucha had possibly the prettiest goal of these playoffs .
After technically losing a defensive zone faceoff Prucha and Radim Vrbata pressed the blue line to gain control of the puck and were off to the races .
Prucha entered the zone and was about to get cut off .
He banked the puck off the boards to the trailing Vrbata .
Vrbata thne sent it back to Prucha as he streaked to the front of the net .
Petr went forehand - backhand and just around Howard 's skate to go up 3 - 1 .
Less than two minutes later the Wings closed the lead back to one goal as Johan Franzen lifted one over Bryz 's shoulder .
Once again down to a one goal lead the Coyotes would catch the Wings on a bad change just moments later .
Radim Vrbata took a slapshot from the circle and Howard fanned on the save .
4 - 2 Coyotes .
That would be the final score even though the Wings pressed in the final minutes .
The Coyotes took a couple penalties , but were able to hold the Wings off to take control of the Series again , now leading the series 2 - 1 .
What Wings fans will be crying about until Tuesday : Two " disallowed " goals .
Both were similar in that Bryzgalov had made the save and was holding the puck .
Then you hear the whistle as the Red Wing players continue to hack away .
One might have been under the intent to blow rule , but the other was , whistle , then hack , then in .
Player of the game :
Petr Prucha # 16 / Left Wing / Phoenix Coyotes Height : 6 - 0 Weight : 170 Born : Sep 14 , 1982
No doubt .
He created the first goal by being aggressive and then set up his own with Vrbata 's help .
1 - 1 - 2 on the night and playing very well on a resurgent Czech line .

Rockwell , who is getting lots of great attention for his role as Justin Hammer in Iron Man 2 , joins the cast as Doc , a local bar owner .
According to The Hollywood Reporter ,
Once Favreau and the writers — Alex Kurtzman , Roberto Orci and Damon Lindelof — learned that Rockwell was interested in the movie , they reconceived and expanded the role , which initially called for a heavy - set man .

AUSTRALIAN scientists are baffled as to why enormous Queensland groper fish are washing up dead on North Queensland beaches without a scratch on them .
The Townsville Bulletin reported today researchers have determined the Queensland gropers - the largest reef - dwelling fish in the world - were dying from septicemia caused by bacterial infections but are at a loss to explain why , a Fisheries Queensland spokeswoman said .
Mystery surrounding the deaths continue after a 1.7 m groper washed up on Saturday morning at Rowes Bay , a Townsville coastal suburb 1363 km north of Brisbane , Queensland .
Field Officer Jeremy Thompson said he and officer Vaughn Heath were alerted to the gargantuan fish on the beach by residents from a nearby caravan park .
Mr Thompson said the public then helped the officers get the fish on to the back of their truck and they brought it back to their office to freeze it for Biosecurity Queensland to collect and research .
" The members of the public who saw it seemed a bit excited about the size of it , " he said .
" It would have to be about 70kg . "
A fisheries spokeswoman said although it was rare for the monster fish to wash up in Townsville , it was common in the far north .
The problem became so bad between Cairns and the Daintree , the Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries began researching why the problem occurred .
In the past two years , more than 50 gropers have washed up dead on North Queensland beaches , mainly north of Cardwell , all infected with the bacteria Streptococcus agalactiae .

[ digg - reddit - me ] Watching Lamar Alexander being interviewed on This Week it struck me that he was defending how the least popular institution in America works .
Being a politician , he would n’t admit this outright – but his meaning was rather clear :
Well , you know , former governors — and I ’m one — always have a hard time with the Senate .
You know , we ’re — we ’re used — governors are used to saying , “ Let ’s go this way , ” and a legislator in a reactor to things .
So that ’s part of the problem .
According to Alexander , the problem is that governors expect to get things done – that ’s “ part of the problem . ”
Lamar Alexander defends the the Senate as an institution designed to slow things down ; but he further defends the current status quo which combines recent rules changes and a changed political atmosphere , to create an institution now seemingly designed to prevent any major legislation from being passed at all .
Lamar Alexander though – and many other Republicans these days – defend this status quo .
Alexander claims that this inability to create big programs means we instead will have to adopt a piecemeal approach , which is better .
From an interview with Ezra Klein :
It is arrogant to imagine that 100 senators are wise enough to reform comprehensively a health - care system that constitutes 17 percent of the world ’s largest economy and affects 300 million Americans of disparate backgrounds and circumstances .
He lists all the failed bills that attempted to find comprehensive solutions to problems that failed in the Senate : Immigration and social security reform under Bush , health care reform under Clinton , health care and climate change under Obama .
But Alexander sees this as a good thing :
We do n’t do comprehensive well in the Senate .
It ’s not because we do n’t do our job well .
It ’s because we ’re such a complicated country .
The common understanding , and probably the true one is that Alexander – like George Will – apparently has come around to this disdain for comprehensive solutions in the period since a Democrat took office .
Accusations always fly back and forth over convenient flip flops regarding institutional power and procedures once the balance of powers changes .
This is n’t news – and its hard to figure out how to approach this issue if you do n’t take the position being offered at face value , even if you can see the partisan strings that seem to be motivating the change in position .
Even Alexander ’s position seems at odds with the Republican plans he cites and supports – allowing insurance to be sold across state lines for example which is an extremely radical move .
But if you squint you may see some consistency in Alexander ’s positions .
Alexander may not be deriding radicalism as it seems , but , as his words say , “ comprehensive ” radicalism .
The problem is n’t then that the Senate might introduce a radical change that entirely changes America ’s health care system – it ’s that the solution is comprehensive and complicated .
One thing each of the comprehensive failures Alexander points out have in common is that they all involved difficult and contentious issues with many interests groups competing and the reform attempted to preserve many elements of the status quo .
The only status quo that I ’ve heard Lamar Alexander defend however is the broken legislative body of which he is a member .
On the other hand , Alexander was a major proponent of Bush ’s tax cuts which were radical , budget - busting legislation that significantly re-wrote America ’s social contract .
They were n’t part of some comprehensive plan though – they were just one isolated measure enacted ( perhaps ) without regard to the consequences or preserving the status quo .
( Or , actually several isolated measures . )
He supported the Iraq War which was certainly radical – but once again , did n’t seem to be part of any comprehensive plan to accomplish anything .
He supported Medicare Part D – which seem much closer to being comprehensive , but could also be seen as merely “ fixing a hole in the roof ” and helping out the seniors who he needs to get reelected .
Senator Alexander ’s problem then is n’t with radical measures passing the Senate .
It is with well - thought out and complicated legislation – with , in his words , “ comprehensive ” legislation .

* Some U.S. reform not addressing crisis - TD Ameritrade CEO
* Wall Street tax could hurt investors - Tomczyk
* Single “ fiduciary ” standard maybe not best - Tomczyk
NEW YORK , April 14 ( Reuters ) - U.S. financial reform legislation may not be aimed at the real causes of the financial crisis and may unintentionally hurt mainstream investors , TD Ameritrade Holding Co AMTD.O Chief Executive Fred Tomczyk said on Wednesday .
A proposed a tax on Wall Street trading and a debate over whether to require all financial advisers to abide by the same fiduciary standard might be missing their mark , Tomczyk told reporters at a brokerage industry conference .
Tomczyk said the proposed tax could unintentionally hurt mainstream investors .
“ The person who designed it or proposed it is really targeting Wall Street .
It ’s an anti-Wall Street bill .
But the reality is the relative impact is more severe on the online brokerage and the average investor , ” he said .
“ That tax will be a multiple of what we charge them to trade , ” Tomczyk explained .
“ That ’s not at the root cause of the crisis , so why are you doing it ? ”
Two years after financial markets nearly collapsed after years of recklessness , financial reform is a key issue for the Obama administration and congressional Democrats battling Republicans over imposing tougher rules on banks and capital markets .
President Barack Obama met with Congressional leaders from both sides of the aisle on Wednesday Both sides said they believed a deal could be reached but did not provide a timetable .
[ ID :nN13110937 ]
Tomczyk also sounded a cautionary note about proposed legislation aimed at assigning all financial advisers the same level of accountability to their clients .
Currently , financial advisers must operate under a fiduciary standard which requires them to select the best investments and products for their clients .
Most brokers are required only to select investments and products that are suitable , but not necessarily the best .
“ It ’s hard for me to comprehend that this is at the root cause of the crisis , ” said Tomczyk .
He said that if there is a move to a single standard it should be to the higher fiduciary standard , but it might also make sense to let broker dealers operate under different rules .
The debate is especially tricky for Ameritrade , an online brokerage with a largely self - directed clientele .
“ What does it mean to be a fiduciary when all you ’re doing is making the products available and people are buying them ?
What does that mean ? ” he said .
“ Does that mean we ’re responsible for their own actions ? ”
The new rules could reduce choice and increase costs , he said .

They ’re trying a dome because the robots did n’t work .
No , really .
Damage control for the oil - rig disaster in the Gulf of Mexico is sounding like a bad science - fiction movie :
Engineers are crafting a giant underwater dome to help to contain an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico after attempts to shut off the leak using robotic submarines failed .
…
While the robots continued their efforts one mile down and a new rig arrived to drill into the leaking well and plug it in an operation that could take months , BP said that its dome should trap the escaping oil and funnel it to tanks on the surface .
The 11 workers missing after the oil - rig explosion are presumed dead , and the leaking oil is expected to reach the Louisiana coast as early as Saturday .
The spill is 48 miles at its widest , 39 miles at its longest and has a circumference of 600 miles , according to reports .
And :
Louisiana is one month away from opening its inshore shrimping season , its crab season is just starting and oyster beds could be closed if the oil gets into coastal estuaries .
As The Wall Street Journal reports , this sort of casts a pall over BP ’s fantastic quarterly earnings report , which beat analysts ’ forecasts by 18 percent .
At the G20 meeting in Pittsburgh last fall , President Obama promised to scale back government subsidies to the fossil - fuel industries : “ I will work with my colleagues at the G20 to phase out fossil - fuel subsidies so that we can better address our climate challenge . ”
The continuing Louisiana disaster provides a favorable political climate to make good on that pledge .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Interior Department on Thursday issued the final terms for leasing almost 37 million acres in the central Gulf of Mexico to energy companies so they can drill for oil and natural gas .

The area to be leased may hold up to 1.3 billion barrels of crude oil and 5.4 trillion cubic feet of gas , according to the department , which is also shortening the time that companies would have to develop the tracts .
Lease Sale 213 involves about 6,958 tracts spread over 36.9 million acres located 3 to 230 miles off the coasts of Louisiana , Mississippi and Alabama .
The blocks are in water depths from 10 feet to more than 11,200 feet .
The lease sale will include about 4.1 million acres in an area known as 181 South , off the Alabama - Florida border .
Drilling off Florida in the Gulf is only allowed far from the state ’s shoreline .
The lease sale , which will be held on March 17 , will cut the time energy companies have to develop oil and gas resources on certain tracts .
The leasing period for blocks in waters 400 to 800 meters ( 1,312 to 2,625 feet ) deep would change from eight to five years , but when an exploratory well is drilled the lease could be extended by three years .
Blocks 800 to 1600 meters ( 2,625 to 5,249 feet ) deep would have lease terms of seven years instead of 10 years .
There would also be an extension of three years with an exploratory well .
The current 10 - year leasing period would continue for blocks in 1,600 meters ( 5,249 feet ) of water .
Liz Birnbaum , director of the department ’s Minerals Management Service , said the shorter leasing periods will “ provide a fair return to the public for ( offshore ) resources and a fair opportunity for lessees to explore , develop and profit from their leases while encouraging diligent development . ”
Oil and gas companies have opposed the cut in the leasing periods .
“ MMS recognizes that advances in technology have decreased the time necessary for exploration and development in some water depths , while frontier conditions still exist in the deepest waters of the Gulf , ” said Birnbaum .
“ The reduction of some initial lease periods with possible extensions is a way to expedite development . ”
Companies will have to pay the government a royalty fee based on 18.75 percent of the value of the oil and gas they drill in the offshore tracts .

The Lutzes claimed that they were subjected to a terrifying supernatural ordeal - walls oozing slime , sinister images appearing on the walls , a plague of flies descending upon the house and a crucifix turning upside down before their eyes .
Mr Lutz said he was awoken every night at 3.15 am , the time of the DeFeo killings , and that he had seen his wife levitate from the bed .
He also reported that his five - year - old daughter was visited by a demonic , pig - like creature with glowing eyes .

Hoboes
Bindlestiffs , Fruit Tramps and the Harvesting of the West
Mark Wyman
Hill and Wang : 336 pp. , $ 28

Given the legislation recently passed in Arizona , designed to send all those pesky undocumented workers back south of the border , it ’s ironic to read in Mark Wyman ’s valuable history of migrant labor “ Hoboes ” that , as early as 1912 , Arizona cotton growers were actively recruiting Mexican workers .
When anti-immigrant sentiment flared during the economic slump following World War I , Southwestern landowners argued that it would mean “ ruin and bankruptcy ” if Congress denied them the right to import foreign labor .
Do n’t worry about them hanging around after the cotton was picked , Texas Rep. Joseph Mansfield assured a 1920 congressional hearing : “ My observation is that when a Mexican gets a little money he wants to go back to Mexico to spend it . ”
The attitude toward Mexicans was exactly the same as it had been toward every ethnic group that joined the itinerant labor force harvesting crops across the American West after intensive agriculture requiring large numbers of seasonal workers took hold at the end of the 19th century .
Whether they were white hobos shocking wheat on the Great Plains , Native Americans drying hops in the Pacific Northwest , German - Russians topping sugar beets in Nebraska , Chinese or Japanese picking fruit in California , growers wanted them to show up when they were needed , then disappear once the crops were harvested .
Their long - term presence was neither needed nor desired ; if they tried to buy land themselves or demand better wages and working conditions , they were no longer welcome at all .
This floating agricultural proletariat had more in common with the workforce of America ’s burgeoning industries than it did with the independent proprietors of small family farms .
( Indeed , loggers and miners sometimes resorted to picking berries or chopping cotton during shutdowns and layoffs . )
Western agriculture , Wyman reminds us , was a capital - intensive business serving a national market .
When railroads with refrigerated freight cars made it possible to move fruits and grains across the continent beginning in the 1870s , vast profits beckoned Western farmers .
Irrigation projects made formerly arid lands productive ; now you could grow apples in Eastern Washington and citrus fruits in Southern California .
But these innovations came at a price .
“ Western farmers ’ start - up costs could be enormous , ” Wyman writes , forcing them “ to stake everything on intensive plantings that would provide the returns they needed to survive . ”
Individual farms and entire regions increasingly relied on large - scale cultivation of a single crop .
There were not enough local hands to harvest these huge fields in the sparsely populated West , and specialization meant that the growers in a given area would all need lots of migrant workers at the same time .
Since a crop left rotting in the pasture spelled financial disaster , growers unsurprisingly devoted a great deal of attention to encouraging an abundant labor supply at harvest time and very little to worrying about what to do if too many people showed up .

The book begins with such a scene : 200 men packed into the Aberdeen Commercial Club , “ begging for work with no questions asked as to wages , while farmers in that area of South Dakota for miles around in all directions were supplied with all the harvest hands they could use . ”
This was the local result of both the federal government and the region ’s newspapers proclaiming that some 100,000 workers were needed across the Great Plains in the summer of 1914 .
The new system of farming , which turned the West into the bread - and fruit - basket of the nation , had human consequences , and those are Wyman ’s subject .
His narrative moves from the Great Plains to the Pacific Northwest , down to Kansas and Nebraska , then on to the Southwest before winding up in California , as he delves into the particulars of cultivating various crops and the ways they shaped the lives of the people who worked in them .
This is a scholarly text , and not every reader will be dying to get the step - by - step details of stoop labor in the sugar beet fields or to know that the ratio between steady annual employment and harvest - time labor in a citrus grove was 1 to 10 .
But Wyman , who has written several books on immigration and labor , connects his data to personal outcomes : the child screaming from back pain after working all day “ in the beets ” ; the Minnesota farmhand who went to pick fruit and returned saying that he had “ not been treated much better than a dog by his employers in California . ”
Vivid , accessible prose mitigates the effect of excessive repetition .
Wyman colorfully describes the rough camaraderie among hobos riding the rails and sharing their scant food in outdoor “ jungles , ” the only accommodations available to transients so distrusted by settled folks that any hobo venturing into a town was likely to be jailed as a vagrant .
Later chapters stirringly cover the battles fought by the radical Industrial Workers of the World , the only group willing to represent migrant workers viewed by other labor unions as unskilled and impossible to organize .
In fact , the care of many crops required expert handling , and the author persuasively argues that “ a new spirit of organization was starting to appear among migrant workers of all groups ” during the transitional years 1910 - 20 .
Wyman closes with “ the arrival of the gasoline tramps ” in the 1920s .
Automobiles made Western workers even more mobile and their existence slightly less precarious ; they could drive directly from job to job , with no down time waiting to catch a train .
Changing social attitudes and opportunities cemented the predominance of Mexicans in the migrant labor force , as white and African American soldiers home from the war headed for steady , high - paying factory jobs .
“ The West had been transformed , ” Wyman writes , and “ the role of harvest workers was absolutely crucial . ”
Yet these essential workers were never accepted as full members of the communities in which they labored ; a problem we still grapple with today .

Smith is the author of “ Real Life Drama : The Group Theatre and America , 1931 - 1940 . ”
I want to translate something from English ….into plain English .
As we help prevent the spread of Coronavirus around the world many of us are in isolation or near isolation .
It ’s weird .
It ’s overwhelming .
It ’s challenging .
This quote is from The Social Construction of Reality by Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann .
It is a book I ’ve been meaning to give focus to forever .
Do n’t worry about this quote not making sense .
That ’s what I am here for :
“ While the social products of human externalization have a character sui generis as against both their organismic and their environmental context , it is important to stress that externali­zation as such is an anthropological necessity .
Human being is impossible in a closed sphere of quiescent interiority .
Human being must ongoingly externalize itself in activity . ”
Ok let me translate that , as the idea is important .
In their 1966 book , hailed as one of the five most important sociology books of all time , Austrian - born writers Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann suggest that being human is only possible through activity and connection outside of our inner selves .
Berger and Luckmann explain that humans create reality ( this is what they mean by the “ social products of human externalization ” ) .
We , in turn , are molded and shaped by that reality .
This is what they mean by “ human being . ”
Being is an active word here , not a noun .
Human being is something we do , not just something we are .
When we are living actively in the world we ’ve agreed upon , when we connect with others , and when we are externalizing the conflicting feelings , emotions , ideas that fill our minds and hearts …. that ’s when we are being most human .
That ’s three ways in which we come into the fullness of our humanity .
We engage , we connect , and we share .
We are alive in the reality we ’ve created and things tend to make sense for us as a result .
We know where the borders and edges are .
We know where we stand .
So what happens with a human creature in isolation who does n’t know what ’s happening ?
Or more to the point , as my phone buzzes with a text from a close friend who is telling me , “ I ’m already so bored , ” after just a day of social distancing : what happens to a creature who is trying to still be human when the modes it is used to for that being have been curtailed and are n’t as familiar all of a sudden ?
Berger and Luckmann talk about reality as being made up of the familiar patterns we ’ve collectively gotten accustomed to over time .
There is a huge threat of loss right now as many of us are feeling distanced from one another and from our normalcy .
We are so used to being with people and defining ourselves through our interactions in the world .
And even the introverts amongst us are in unfamiliar territory socially as normal constructs shift .
But now , as the familiar is gone , rather than get overwhelmed psychologically , we need to keep figuring out ways of being by redefining what it means to put ourselves out there and externalize even as times are tough .
Its easy to crumble .
We need to build from within .
There are a number of methods we can use to externalize amidst this ( hopefully temporary ) new reality .
For me , typing this .
For you , reading this .
Figuring out creative ways to support one ’s community ( someone just posted the idea of buying leftover perishable food stock from restaurants which are closing ) .
Reaching out to marginalized people , using whatever resources are available to offer support .
Painting or drawing something and bringing art , no matter how brilliant or how bad , into existence .
Weeping to a friend .
Connecting with someone electronically .
Getting outside for a walk and feeling the sun .
Expressing frustration and fear .
Breathing deeply and audibly to work through tension .
Marking out a new plan for a failed business .
Imagining and sharing with others what we can do socially as we prepare for the next crisis .
All of these are not just ways to pass the time ; they are ways our human beingness survives .
Taking this time to interact differently with the world requires some creativity .
Sure , we want restaurants and bars open ( especially if we own them ! ) .
We want to be going to shows and living socially ( especially if we make our living through public gatherings ! ) .
However , according to Berger and Luckmann , if they are right , as I think they are , our human being depends on us finding new ways to externalize during a time when the socially agreed upon measures of what constitute reality are not available to us .
This is a perfect time to expand in new ways .
It is essential that we do .
We will create new patterns and a new reality together .
Given financial terror , the seeming collapse of this system , fear abounding , and imposed isolation , we must start rebuilding society from ourselves first and foremost .
We can not collapse inward .
Externalization ( read that as reaching outward and expressing ourselves to others and figuring out new ways to be in the world ) , is how we be human .
It ’s not just a means of overcoming an unusual time .
It means much more than that .
Sinking completely inward - as I did yesterday while reading too much of the sensationalized news - is literally self destructive .
If anything is going to save this planet moving forward , it ’s a redefining how we expand not how we shrink .
Berger and Luckmann would likely say that this work is done together .
Following simply as a junior interpreter of their brilliant lead , I ’m suggesting that this work - society and reality building together - starts with us first as we take the first steps .
We ’ll blend our versions of reality together later and figure out what this all means .
We often hear it said that to change the world , we have to change ourselves .
These days are where that is being put to the test .
If our reality is indeed socially constructed , agreed upon , and defined by us together , then we are in a perfect position to craft this world into what we want it to be , but we have to start getting creative if we are going to keep our humanity intact .
The media is intense .
The president does n't care about our well - being , or any being other than himself .
The barrage of information can overwhelm us .
All this , yet I am writing from the perspective that humanity still has value especially if we can continue to be less destructive as we interact with the world .
And , especially if we can keep sending energy out , and come together even as we are physically apart .
The new definition for what society will be in the aftermath of Coronavirus is as yet unwritten , but the first thoughts , words , and building blocks of it will be felt , penned , and fashioned from individuals who have not lost their sense of self amidst this , but rather from those who have come more into being as a result of it .
When we crumble inward we lose everything .
When we breathe , write , listen , hear , think , reach out , expand , we gain back an essential part of ourselves which would be otherwise lost , perhaps forever .
No matter the conditions , we must continue to look outward , move forward , and connect more deeply , however that manifests .
We were a part of creating this world , whether we feel like we were or not , and we will be a part from this moment moving forward of refashioning it into something new .
It starts with us not collapsing inward .
It starts with us being .
Psychoanalyst Otto Rank said in the early 1900 ’s that humans have the unique capacity to make the unreal real .
He meant that humans have the ability to imagine something which has not yet existed and bring it into existence using our intelligence and ability to think symbolically .
Following Rank , Berger and Luckmann let us know that we indeed make the unreal real , and it ’s a group effort .
Our reality is fashioned by a collective agreement , passed along and down over time , and synthesized until it is this reality surrounding us that we know and understand : the reality of here and now .
We are in an incredible moment in time in that no one really knows what happens next .
No one has any idea what the world or our being human in it will look like .
It might be the same as we ’ve known .
It might be fundamentally different moving forward .
But each of us has a role to play in fashioning whatever that is going to be .
We have to stay present , grounding ourselves in any way we can , staying healthy through exercise , movement , communication , and calm even as the world seems to crumble .
We need to be as in touch as we can with what we feel , see , know , and imagine , no matter if that ’s painful , scary , or unsure …. and then expand outward and share .
We need to be building reality , together .
Our being , our human being , and the future of the world we live in and agree upon , depend on it .
New cars and lorries would be required to carry black boxes to record crash information and manufacturers would help fund the US government 's motor industry safety agency , under a series of proposals following Toyota 's massive recalls .
The House of Representatives ' Energy and Commerce Committee released a draft that could form the basis of legislation to strengthen vehicle safety and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration .
Politicians have vowed to address car safety after Toyota recalled more than eight million vehicles worldwide and paid a record £ 11 million US government fine for responding too slowly to a recall .
The draft legislation , released by Energy and Commerce chairman Henry Waxman , a Democrat , would eliminate the cap on civil penalties a car maker could face and allow NHTSA to order an immediate recall if it finds an " imminent hazard of death or serious injury " .
It would also require new safety standards related to brake override systems , the prevention of pedals from getting trapped in floor mats and vehicle electronics .
Toyota has said it will install brake override systems in all future models and retroactively on some existing ones .
The system automatically disengages the throttle if a driver presses on the brakes .
Some Toyota owners have filed lawsuits saying that Toyota 's electronic throttle control systems are to blame for vehicles suddenly accelerating .
The company has insisted electronics are not causing the problem .
The proposal would require a US motor industry executive to certify the accuracy of information submitted to NHTSA in response to a government investigation .
Any executive who provided false information could face up to £ 163 million in fines .
Vehicles would be required to be equipped with event data recorders , commonly known as black boxes , to help authorities reconstruct the elements that led to a crash .
The plan also creates a " vehicle user fee " of £ 2 per vehicle , increasing to £ 6 in its third year , to fund NHTSA 's vehicle safety programme .
Safety groups have said the agency is underfunded and ill - equipped to investigate complicated safety problems .

And the lies came fast and furious :
First the Foxers claim :
" When you put the Government Option in people are going to emigrate to that , it 's cheaper and the quality is n't as good but people are going to want it ... "
Fact : Under both the House and Senate Bills the Health Care Exchange would provide better quality insurance , with life - time out of pocket caps and where pre-existing conditions & unreasonable care rescissions are banned .
For the most part the CBO reported that the cost difference would be Negligible for people who currently get their health care through small or large businesses .
Weiner Answered this with :
Do n't we want people to have a choice ?
If they do n't think they 're getting quality , they do n't want government control , they wo n't choose it .
Point : Weiner .
Then they claim businesses are likely to drop coverage :
What if I 'm an employer , which is wear most people get their insurance - and I 'm looking at the bottom line and I say I 'll go to the Public Option because it 's cheaper .
Weiner :
That 's prohibited under the plan .
For the first 5 years .
All Net Three - pointer from the Wing to Weiner .
That 's right , Employers can't just dump coverage for cost reasons and force their workers to buy healthcare on the private market or rely on the government sysem - y'know , the way that Walmart Already Does .
Again CBO stated that 83 % of the public who currently get their health insurance through their employer , will not see any significant changes in either price or quality .
Fox :
But what about after those 5 years are up ?
Wiener :
Then those businesses will have to pay a sanction for dropping coverage .
Gretchen Foxer :
After those 5 years those private offerings are going to go Bye - Bye !
Weiner : Well , why ?
Why are their costs higher ?
Let me answer that for you , because right now Insurance companies are working with about a 30 % overhead and profits .
Right now we 're giving money to our insurance companies and we 're saying give it to our doctors and their taking a piece of the action on every transaction .
So why are we paying share - holders instead of people who work for us ?
Tomahawk DUNK to Wiener .
It 's simple : if private industry can't compete on price and quality - they Deserve to go " Bye - Bye " .
Foxer : Right now healthcare takes up 16 % of the economy , do you really want the government controlling 20 % of the economy if we bring these 22 Million additional people one
Typical Foxer looking at his own pocket and not at the fact that 20 - 30 Million People who do n't have care - will be able to GET IT .
Money ?
Yay !
Saving Lives ?
Boo !
Besides , with rate hikes like the kind we 're getting from Wellpoint of 39 % in a single year , healthcare is going to become 20 % - 25 % of the economy if we do nothing .
Weiner : Right now 40 % of all of our tax dollars are going to a Federal Funded Health Care program , Medicaid , Medicare , DOD ( Tricare ) and the VA .
If you do n't like those programs go tell Senior Citizens , go tell Michael Steele " Government funded Healthcare is so wrong " .
The only question here is who we 're giving the money to .
The current best rated and best ranked Healthcare system in the Country is n't Cigna or Pacific Care or Wellpoint - it 's TRICARE the Government Funded and Government RUN Healthcare for our soldiers and Military .
Foxer : I have bad news for you , they have done the math ( On Medicare ) , it 's going to run out .
Weiner : I agree with you , but Republicans have stood up against removing waste from Medicare .
Foxer :
Well , we 're not ( nice of you to admit what side you 're on ) against removing waste , we 're not " Pro- Waste " .
Weiner : Republicans have put out a statement saying " Do n't change anything in Medicare , including removing waste and abuse " .
So how are you going to control costs ?
You 're going to have to do some things about waste .
On the money , the Republican plan is to do nothing - or worse yet when they do have a good idea , like removing waste , they turn against their own idea simply to score political points and demagogue democrats .
Like Senator
Bunning who was totally for spending money we do n't have and against PAY GO - until last week when he all of a sudden he was n't anymore .
Putting thousands of people out of work in the middle of a recession was n't about principle or deficit reduction - Bunning was just being An ASSHOLE , because he could .
Just think about all the Assholes you 've ever known - chances are - they 're Republicans .
Gretchen Foxer :
Here 's a problem , there 's a thing called " History " and people have watched how their money has been spent by this government .
You mean like how we spent $ Billions on Halliburton , KBR , Triple Canopy and Blackwater ?
How we spent nearly a $ Trillion on the Iraq War and Tax Cuts for people who'd rather spend their money betting against American Businesses in the Stock Market than buy American Goods or providing American Jobs ?
Is that the kind of " Historical wasteful spending " you ment ?
Nope , apparently not .
Gretchen : People are like " Holy Cow , If the government can't run Cash for Clunkers how can it run Healthcare ? "
Golly Gee Willickers Pa! Pretend No-Nothing Valedictorian - Hick Dip Wad Shill Spokes Model says Wha ?
Cash for Clunkers was a unmitigated success , and All of it has been PAID !
Cash for clunkers has it's own Post - Mortem Site

November 23 , 2009 at 6:33 pm i think you should do another cash for clunkers deal !!!
i missed the date barley .
i would ’ve owned my car a year on november 3 , 2009 !!!!
Alessandra says :
October 10 , 2009 at 12:42 am I have an old old Honda that is hanging on by a string which means I ’m driving around in an unsafe car .
I was told I would not qualify because the gas milage is too good .
I think it is a travesty to punish the people who have been doing what they can to keep things clean and reward those who have been polluting the environment and not really giving a damn about it .
Something is just not right with how this was handle
Most of the people complaining , were annoyed that they could n't use the program because it was limited , not that it was n't run well or " did n't work " .
Weiner :
You ask people who are on Medicare whether THEY like it or not .
Foxer :
It 's losing money .
Weiner : Ask the people on it .
Medicare Works .
Douche Foxer :
Most people like it , but the fact is that doctors in hospitals are n't able to continue to exist under the rates that Medicare pays .
Weiner :
So is your problem that Medicare pays too little or pays too much ?
One of the changes in the Bills , and most recently in the modifications offered by the President in agreement with a " Republican Idea " - is an increase in Medicare Rates paid to doctors .
Toward the end of the clip Weiner goes on to shut down their talking points on both " Buying Across State Lines " and " Tort Reform " ( two Republican ideas that do n't work , but are in the Bill anyway and Republicans STILL wo n't support it ) - and this appearance was from last August during the Height of the Tea Parties .
More recently Weiner has Called FOX out for their Orchestrated Lies .
Weiner :
On programs like this there 's been an enormous amount of disinformation about the Bill .
Foxer : According to you .
That 's what you think .
Weiner : Look , I think there 's been orchestrated effort in a lot of quarters to Lie about the Bill .
Yes , they 've been lying about the bill - and they 're going to keep lying - I promise .
Lying is the Republican Party Template , it 's their Mantra , it 's the one thing THEY DO WELL - it 's their THEME SONG .
All you need to understand about the Tea Parties and Fox News was documented / predicted by Henry Rollins :
This is who they are , never forget it .

I would draw your attention to the categories of construction and manufacturing above .
Both employ more men than women .
You can see just how drastic the hit construction was for men .
For manufacturing , in fact , a slightly larger portion of women lost their jobs , but it 's still a male dominated industry , so their sheer number of job losses was greater for men .
The report says that within goods producing sectors men lost 2.9 million jobs , while women lost only 765,000 .
The study continues by pointing out that some industries with heavier concentrations of women fared relatively well .
Education and health services are the standouts there .
In fact , actual job growth was seen in these industries .
That also gave jobless women an advantage over unemployed men at getting some of the few jobs available .
From the chart above , however , I do notice a few oddities .
First , despite the fact that financial services and manufacturing are male dominated , though slight , they still saw a larger percentage drop in women than in men .
I would have thought such industries would have preferred firing more men , so to keep the gender proportions less lopsided .
But natural resources and mining saw the opposite .
There , somehow , more women managed to find employment while 9.7 % of men lost their jobs .
One thing is clear : men will continue to have a more difficult time finding employment during the recovery than women , given the industries each gender tends to dominate .
Construction , in particular , will likely be a major struggle , while education and health services should endure .

The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security have launched an investigation into letters sent by an anti-government group to over 30 governors demanding they resign within three days or face peaceful removal from office .
The letters , sent by a group calling themselves the “ Guardians of the Free Republics , ” do not threaten violence but warned recipients they would be removed from office if they did not resign by the deadline , law enforcement and state officials said .

Virginia ’s Republican Governor Robert McDonnell and Arkansas ’s Democratic Governor Mike Beebe were among those who received the letters , as was Texas ’s Republican Governor Rick Perry .
The letters arrived amid recent spates of vandalism and harassment — including death threats — against other lawmakers in the wake of the health reform bill ’s passage .
Mere days earlier , eight members of what the government described as a “ Christian militia ” were arrested and accused of planning to attack police officers .
Investigators worried the Guardians ’ rhetoric could unleash violent behavior , according to US media .
“ While there does not appear to be credible or immediate threats of violence attached to the letters , we are working with state and local authorities and continue to assess the matter , ” the FBI and DHS said in a joint statement .
Media almost universally treated the statements as threats against the governors , echoing the government ’s tenor of concern .

Guardians of the Free Republics claims on its website that it seeks to restore US institutions by peacefully dismantling and rebuilding parts of government .
“ The Restore America Plan is a bold achievable strategy for behind - the - scenes peaceful reconstruction of the de jure institutions of government without controversy , violence or civil war , ” the website says .
On their site , the group claims that a “ Plan ” is underway to peacefully reconstruct the government .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ After consultation with high ranking members of the United States armed forces , the Plan is in the process of assembling the Guardians of the Free Republics and reinhabiting the De jure Grand Juries , ” they write .
“ De jure ” is a legal term , meaning something is lawful or legitimate .
The reference to the grand jury appears to be similarly rooted , as guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment for anyone accused of an “ otherwise infamous ” crime in federal court .

In a YouTube clip titled “ Restore America Counter - Punch , ” a man purporting to be the “ state coordinator for Texas ” claims the group ’s plan “ has the backing of International foreign courts ” and suggests that soon , “ everything is gonna change ” once the military and Supreme Court accept their argument .
First , he claims , all foreclosures will stop , then new forms of identification will be issued guaranteeing citizens “ diplomatic immunity ” to travel anywhere .
The video was published to YouTube by user jonah70757 , who on his homepage addresses media coverage of the group ’s demands and suggests that the “ enemies ” are in the White House .
His “ favorite ” videos on the site are almost all of a political nature , with several referencing Joe Stack , the Austin - based accordion player who crashed his airplane into an IRS office building , killing one person .

This video was published March 23 , 2010 .
The group ’s demands , in full , are :
Restore and reinhabit the de jure institutions of lawful government .
Terminate illicit corporations posing as legitimate governments , in particular the territorial jurisdiction United States Federal Corporation ( corp. ref. 28 U.S.C. 3002 ) posing as the de jure United States of America .
Terminate all presumed powers of attorney to such corporations .
End the foreclosure nightmare ( for borrowing against oneÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s own credit ) .
End tax prosecutions for resisting the transfer of private wealth to foreign banking cartels such as I.R.S. ( former Puerto Rico Bureau of Taxation ) .
End street assaults against the sovereign People for failing to exhibit a State - issued confession of subject - class citizenship .
End all prosecutions which lack an injured party .
End admiralty prosecutions for kidnapping and other heinous crimes against mankind as Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ commercial crimesÃ¢â‚
¬
Â against the corporate State under a contrived corporate color - of - law venue ( corp. ref. 27 C.F.R. 72.11 ) .
Terminate the intrusion of corporations posing as the state into every aspect of the PeopleÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s lives .
End the use of covert contracts such as Form 1040 , car registrations , birth certificate applications , and bank signature cards which confess the signer to be a legal fiction subject of the United States Federal Corporation ( Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å “ U.S. personÃ¢â‚ ¬Â ) that has waved his / her rights in favor of state - issued privileges .
End the use of deeds which classify the People as Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ tenantsÃ¢â‚ ¬Â  on their own land , thereby transferring control to incorporated County registrars and tax assessors .
End the perversion of marriage into a commercial system of state - issued privileges through the so - called Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å “ marriage licenseÃ¢â‚
¬
Â whereby incorporated Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ courtsÃ¢â‚ ¬Â presume the Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ rightÃ¢â‚ ¬Â to trespass on families and kidnap children .
End the hijacking of automobile ownership through DMV registrations which covertly exchange the divine rights of travel and ownership for the state - issued Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ privilegesÃ¢â‚ ¬Â of Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ drivingÃ¢â‚ ¬Â  and Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ title.Ã¢â‚¬Â
In place of all of the above , substitute sovereign identification , diplomatic immunity and sovereign passports to facilitate safe passage throughout the world free from corporate State molestation and terror .
Restore the PeopleÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s money and wealth from the banking institutions , war profiteers , and international loan sharks .
Instantly vest all mortgages , auto loans and personal business loans Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ issuedÃ¢â‚ ¬
Â by members of the Fed .
The state shall hold no paper on , or debts against , the sovereign People , directly or through its agencies and licensed banking institutions .
Instantly end all non-consensual and unlawful taxation including all taxes on the sacred rights of labor and privacy .
Empower and inspire the sovereign People to righteousness through such renewed abundance .
Issue orders to the military and police powers to enforce the PeoplesÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ divine rights of birth .
Reabsorb all de facto actors into lawful de jure capacity .
End the perverse act of requiring the People to pray to Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ courtsÃ¢â‚ ¬
Â  as is now required under corporate rules and traditions .
Restore the de jure judicial institutions including the district court of the United States and the one supreme Court .
Quietly mirror the strategies of 1933 thereby using their ( our ) institutions , military and public officials to undo eighty years of subterfuge without provoking alarm , controversy or armed conflict .
Return the military and law enforcement institutions to proper and lawful de jure sovereign authority from the clutches of corporate actors .
Forgive all corporate actors who repent for their State - sponsored crimes against mankind .
Remove the recidivists from office .
Do all of the above , and more , peacefully , discreetly , quietly and honorably , behind the scenes , without public proclamations or provocative actions against a general public that is mostly unaware of the hijacking of their free de jure American republics , and their hapless media .
“ [ Although ] the Guardians lay out an interesting legal theory Ã¢â‚¬â€œ arcane federal law and how it ’s interpreted is core to the sovereign citizen movement Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the idea that they could quietly , and , as they suggest , without ridicule , work behind the scenes to slide America back nearly a century seems , in retrospect , folly , ” Patrik Jonsson chided , writing for the Christian Science Monitor .

Jokes Pat Robertson does n’t have the power to cut off your arms
Bill Maher , a self - described Libertarian but outspoken critic of Bush and many conservative GOP policies , has many fans on the left .
But even though he ’s pretty much against all religions , his thoughts on Islamists and the Muslim faith in general might turn a few heads .
During an interview with CNN ’s Anderson Cooper Wednesday night , the comedic host of HBO ’ sÃ‚Â Real Time with Bill Maher shared his thoughts on the Times Square bombing suspect , Pakistani native Faisal Shahzad , and the Muslim faith .

Cooper played a clip from Maher ’s latest show which aired Friday , in which he claimed that “ our culture ” was better than Islamist culture because its better at taking jokes :
When “ South Park ” got threatened last week by Islamists incensed at their depiction of Mohammad , it served , or should serve , as a reminder to all of us that our culture is n’t just different than one that makes death threats to cartoonists .
It ’s better .
Because when I make a joke about the pope , he does n’t send one of his Swiss guards in their striped pantaloons to stick a pike in my ass .
When I make a Jewish joke , rabbis might kvetch about it , but they do n’t pull out a scimitar and threaten an adult circumcision .
And when I insult Scientology , the worst that happens is that …
“ So I mean , why is Islam the one religion about which so many in America and the west censor themselves when it comes to talking about it or making fun of it ?
Is it just fear ? ” Cooper asked Maher .
Maher , who is known for his outspoken , blistering religious critiques , answered ,
Absolutely .
Absolutely .
Because they ’re violent .
Because they threaten us , and they are threatening .
They bring that desert stuff to our world .
I said the same thing Friday night .
You know , we do n’t threaten each other ; we sue each other .
That ’s the sign of civilized people .
And — and they do n’t .
You know , yes , we do have religious nuts in this country .
There was a cleric in Iran who recently said that earthquakes were caused by slutty women .
Well , Pat Robertson once said that abortions caused hurricanes , I think .
But the difference is Pat Robertson does n’t have the power to cut your arms off .

Aside from abortion extremists , there really is n’t a big problem with violence from the devout in America .
“ You know , I mean , people who want to gloss over the difference between western culture and Islamic culture and forget about the fact that the Islamic culture is 600 years younger and that they are going through the equivalent of what the west went through with our Middle Ages , our Dark Ages , when religion had way too much power and we had inquisitions and things like that , do so at their peril .
You know , when they caught this guy — yes , go ahead . ”
CNN ’s 360 host gets more direct in his questioning of Maher with “ When you hear , you know , the oft refrain from American Muslims is the vast majority of American Muslims abhor this kind of stuff .
You know , they will say , look , Islam is a religion of peace .
Do you buy that ? ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Yes , they blow you up .
There ’s a piece of you over there .
There ’s a piece of you over there .
There ’s a piece of you over there , ” is Maher ’s response .
“ Is it a religion of peace ?
You know , I do n’t know .
I have not read the Koran in its original .
When you read the translation , there are many , many , many passages that are not peaceful at all , that are about killing the infidel and so forth . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ There are many passages like that in the Bible , too .
Not as many .
And we do n’t take it seriously .
That ’s the difference .
We blow off our religions .
If we took the Bible seriously , we ’d look over our fence on Sunday morning , see our neighbor mowing his lawn and think , “ Hmm , working on Sunday .
I really should kill him . ”
But we do n’t do that . ”
“ You know , there are entire schools — you know this , Anderson .
You ’re a globetrotter .
You ’ve been to madrassas in Pakistan and so forth .
Entire schools where the kids read just one book .
They ’re memorizing the Koran .
That ’s all they do .
You know , that ’s not what we do in this country . ”
Bill Maher also wrote , directed , and acted in the film ‘ Religulous , ’ a rather snarky documentary — billed as the “ # 1 sacreligious comedy in America — in which he bluntly disputes the value of religion .

The prospect and reality of Obamacare have woken up many people to the need to stop the socialization of medical care in America .
It will produce here what it has produced everywhere : stagnation , overutilization , rationing , and the sacrifice of individual well - being in the name of collective justice .
This is the result not only of every experiment in socialized medicine but of every experiment in socialism generally .
The reasons were spelled out by Mises in 1922 .
He explained that , without property and market prices , economic rationality disappears .
The result is unworkable , chaotic , and impoverishing .
Medical socialism is but one variety of a larger problem .
But it is one that is particularly devastating to people , because it affects their capacity for staying healthy and alive .
By robbing individuals of their rights to exchange and choose , Mises wrote , state - run medical systems are comparable to those run by the army or by prisons , which are not centers of health but of disease and disaster .
What was Mises responding to ?
The nascent systems of universal medical care already in place in Germany .
In the United States , it has taken much longer , but consider that the first national conference calling for universal health and social insurance came about during the 1910s .
This followed the monopolization of the medical profession by the American Medical Association ten years earlier .
In other words , it has taken more than 100 years for the push toward total control to get this far .
And consider that even now , even under Obamacare , nothing like total socialism in medical services is really being considered an option .
What is really happening are continuing efforts to patch up a failed system that has been cobbled together for more than a century .
The fact is that 29 percent of all American adults already depend on the government to provide their healthcare .
And Uncle Sam provides healthcare for more than three - quarters of those over 65 , whether they realize it or not , as the famous town - hall exchange between Republican Congressman Bob Inglis and one of his constituents in South Carolina illustrates .
" Keep your government hands off my Medicare , " demanded the man who could n't be convinced that Medicare was already a government program .
In all the debate over this legislation , this longer - term perspective is being lost .
We need to grasp the political dynamic under which this legislation is being passed .
It seeks to address genuine problems that were generated by the present system , which mixed private enterprise with a ghastly regulatory apparatus of government subsidies , licenses and controls , patents and monopolies , consumption controls , outright welfare , and fascistic impositions on every sector .
The current system cries out for fixing .
And how does the state propose to fix it ?
Never through more freedom , never by rolling back the real problem .
Instead , it proposes more power .
This has been the systematic trajectory during every presidential administration for many decades .
" Medical socialism is but one variety of a larger problem .
But it is one that is particularly devastating to people , because it affects their capacity for staying healthy and alive . "
One of the worst problems concerns the wedge that the state drove between the payer and the healthcare provider .
Businesses became the wedge .
When ?
During World War II wage controls .
Businesses scrambled to find ways to pay their employees without running afoul of the law .
They turned to providing medical care .
This is no different from how banks offered toasters to depositors when interest rates were controlled in the 1970s .
It is the market desperately trying to get around a problem created by the state .
But once this happens , if the controls are not repealed , the escape hatch becomes the norm .
And this is precisely what happened .
This is how the seeds of the current legislation were sown — not after Obama 's election or during Clinton 's term or even during Johnson 's presidency but all the way back 65 years ago during wartime , with intervention that hardly anyone objected to because of the national emergency .
" The health of American children , like their education , should be recognized as a definite public responsibility , " President Harry Truman told Congress on November 19 , 1945 , just after the war and only seven months into his presidency .
" The right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health , " was a part of Truman 's proposed Economic Bill of Rights .
Another was the " right to adequate protection from the economic fears of … sickness . "
Truman proposed in that speech that a national health - insurance fund be created and run by the federal government .
Even the American Medical Association ( AMA ) called the bill " socialized medicine " and said that those in the Truman White House were " followers of the Moscow party line . "
Despite support from the large labor unions , Truman was forced to abandon his attempted government healthcare takeover .
But like most bad ideas hatched in Washington , parts of Truman 's proposal lived on to resurface as legislation two decades later .
In 1965 , President Lyndon B. Johnson signed Medicare into law at the Harry S. Truman Library and Museum and reminded onlookers that Medicare " all started really with the man from Independence . "
There is no greater example of why it is morally incumbent on everyone to oppose all forms of government intervention in all times .
That includes , especially , wars that socialize the economy .
Even seemingly small interventions can become huge and terrible decades later , even after those who imposed the measure are long dead .
This is also why Mises and his best students were so intransigent in arguing against any and all government intervention .
There is another factor that hardly anyone mentions .
How is all of this free government medical service going to be paid for ?
If the government were going to tax everyone , it could never work .
The citizens would n't stand for it over the long term .
The national debt is already beyond belief .
Where are the resources to pay for this glorious utopia of perfect health equality ?
It seems like an inauspicious place to look , but we must look to the marble palace on Constitution Avenue : the Federal Reserve .
Here is the institution that runs the moneymaking machines that guarantee all the debt and that will create the phony money to pay for these insane dreams of universal happiness .
Without the Fed , I can promise you , no one in Washington would be in a position to promise such absurdities .
If you think about it , then , the real problem is not that politicians dream impossible dreams .
They 've been doing that for a hundred years , a thousand years , and even back to the ancient world .
The real problem is structural and institutional : it is the central bank that leads politicians to imagine that their visions can be achieved .
It is the central bank that unhinges them — at our expense .
In some ways , then , a worsening system of medical provision is only the beginning of the downside of universal health insurance .
The unseen costs include inflation down the line , worsening business cycles , and , quite possibility , the final destruction of the dollar and the wiping out of all private wealth .
" There is no greater example of why it is morally incumbent on everyone to oppose all forms of government intervention in all times .
That includes , especially , wars that socialize the economy . "
Yes , the problem is serious .
But protests and partisan politics only go so far .
Ultimately the solution comes from intellectual understanding of the broader issues , which go well beyond the details of this particular legislation .
We must understand the dynamic of intervention and the role of fiat money and the central bank in funding the whole process .
Another book we need to reread is by Henry Hazlitt .
It is called Time Will Run Back .
It tells the story of a despot who inherits a decrepit , burned out , totalitarian society , and he is inspired to rethink the logic of the system .
With the aid of some reading , he and his aides systematically unravel the interventions .
The same logic that led the state to ramp up its control led it to retreat and allowed freedom to flower .
I believe this is in our future .
But we can't have that future without the right intellectual resources .
This is why I 'm so grateful to the Mises Institute , the source for nearly every important book on socialism , regulation , central banking , and intervention .
The Mises Institute is the intellectual source for an enlightened future .
We can follow the headlines and despair or we can support the source of light and have hope .
Please join the Mises Institute in our work of bringing that light to a new generation .
As Mises said , ideas are more powerful than armies and certainly more powerful than the meddling legislative bodies and huckster politicians that manipulate them .
This mess can be rolled back , and freedom can triumph .
Obesity is the leading reason young Americans are rejected for military service , and that 's a threat to national security , according to a new report by retired generals and admirals .
They call for legislation to make school lunches healthier and banning junk foods and high - calorie drinks from campuses .
The study , " Too Fat to Fight , " found that more than 9 million Americans ages 17 to 24 — more than 25 % of the age group — are too overweight for the armed forces .
The study cited research showing that students get up to 40 % of their daily calorie intake at school and that 80 % who were overweight when they were 10 to 15 years old were obese by 25 .
" We believe that the child obesity issue is so serious it has become a threat to our national security , " said retired Lt. Gen. Norman Seip of the research by Mission : Readiness , a non-profit group of more than 130 retired admirals , generals and other senior military leaders .
Watch the video from the press conference or read the news release , which summarizes the goals for improving child nutrition .
Overall , the report notes , 75 % of young Americans are n't military material because they have failed to graduate high school , have criminal records or are physically or mentally unfit .
The Associated Press has more .

Citing a DePaul University study , the Chicago Tribune reports
More than 42 percent of small rental buildings in Cook County are ‘ underwater ’
Owners of 96,000 two - to six - unit rental buildings in Cook County are upside - down on $ 12.6 billion of mortgage debt , potentially putting 42 percent of small rental buildings in the county at risk of default , new data show .
A study by DePaul University 's Institute for Housing Studies , released Wednesday , also found that $ 3 billion in multifamily building mortgages already are in foreclosure , affecting more than 32,000 rental units in Cook County , or 6.8 percent of multifamily mortgages .
That compares with about 38,000 single - family homes in foreclosure in Cook County .
Researchers analyzed 25,822 sales of existing small rental buildings and 591 sales of buildings with seven or more units in Cook County .
Multi-family foreclosure rate spikes in Cook County
The foreclosure rate on multi-family rental properties in Cook County has spiked , and falling property values have put 30 percent , or more than $ 13 billion in Cook County ’s multi-family mortgages at default risk , according to a study released today by DePaul University ’s Institute for Housing Studies .
The report found that there are more than 32,000 rental units in Cook County impacted by foreclosures .
The percent of loans in foreclosure on small two - to six - unit properties jumped to 8.75 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009 from 1.67 percent five years ago .
On large seven - plus unit rental properties foreclosure rates jumped from 0.3 percent in 2004 to 3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009 .
For one in eight rental apartment units , revenues are falling below operating costs for owners .
Owners of about 74,000 rental units in Chicago or 13 percent of the market , are currently spending more to operate buildings than they are collecting in revenues , placing them at significant risk of decreased or discontinued maintenance .
“ The multi-family foreclosure crisis has not received as much attention as the crisis in the single - family housing market , but the trends outlined in this report demonstrate that it should , ” study author James Shilling , chair of Real Estate Studies , said in a statement .
He added the problem is not just a Chicago issue , noting the same trends are happening in New York , Los Angeles , San Francisco , Phoenix , Atlanta and other cities .
Multifamily Housing Market Analysis
Summary of Key Findings
Prices of large ( 7+ unit ) rental properties in Cook County have declined from an index value of 166 in the third quarter of 2006 to 123 in the second quarter of 2009 , a decline of 26 % .
Prices of small ( 2–6 unit ) rental properties in Cook County have fallen from an index value of 193 in the second quarter of 2007 to 104 in the second quarter of 2009 , a decline of 46 % .
Falling property values in Cook County have put roughly $ 13 billion of multifamily mortgages ( or approximately 30 % of the total outstanding multifamily mortgage debt ) at risk of default .
Total value - at - risk for small 2 –6 unit rental properties is $ 12.6 billion .
For large 7 + unit rental properties , the total value - at - risk is $ 747 million .
Falling property values have forced many lenders to “ pretend and extend . ”
Lenders have delayed foreclosures on about $ 1.5 billion of multifamily mortgage debt in Cook County .
As local lending institutions have scaled backed their lending to large 7 + unit properties in 2008 and 2009 , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have essentially become indispensable to the Cook County multifamily mortgage market .
The GSEs ’ share of the large 7 + unit multifamily mortgage market in Cook County is around 65 to 70 % of all lending .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are also indispensable to the small 2–6 unit multifamily mortgage market in Cook County , but for an altogether different reason .
Net rental revenues are currently at or below total operating costs for about 74,000 rental units in the city of Chicago .
Long - run policy must necessarily take into account the extent to which Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac subsidize interest and create an incentive to take on excessive debt .
Loan to Value Ratios for 2 - 6 Unit Properties
Loan to Value Ratios for 7 + Unit Properties
Multifamily Foreclosure Rates In Cook County
Multifamily GSE Originations
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could be required to expand their multifamily housing lending , which already has been expanded under the 2010 – 2011 Enterprise Affordable Housing Goals .
Expanding lending in these areas could be risky .
But presumably the public should be willing to bear some of this increased risk , especially if this increased lending activity were to reduce the feedback effects in the short - run from falling property prices to increased foreclosures , back to reduced property prices and increased foreclosures .
But there are some caveats to this policy prescription : if the US economy were to stumble along for years — like Japan ’s economy did during the “ lost decade ” in the 1990s — then presumably it would be best to accelerate foreclosures and abandonment , rather than take steps that might prolong the process .
The sooner properties are removed from the housing stock , the sooner rents will begin to rise and the sooner the long - run equilibrium will be restored .
Property Tax Policy Exacerbates Problems
Cook , Lake , and DuPage counties have some of the highest property tax rates in the nation , higher than California and parts of New York / New Jersey !
By and large , these counties have so far refused to lower actual absolute tax amounts on individual properties consistent with the real decline in market value .
This situation that has effectively raised property tax rates for thousands of homes by 1 % + and translates into real annual tax rates of 2.5 % - 5 % of actual market value !
This is a powerful and devastating anchor on rental property cash flows for every property rented in these counties regardless of the purchase price , financing terms , or rental management challenges that owners face .

Under Major , Blair and Brown , the UK Government has followed a deliberate policy of running down its internal IT expertise and relying on external providers – mostly big companies like Capita and EDS – to provide IT expertise , systems and services .
The result , many argue , has been expensive IT that ’s been very successful in maximising the profits of the consultants but rather less good at meeting the needs of the public sector or , for that matter , the public .
Project after project has run massively over budget and time , with the companies responsible often seeming to be rewarded for their shortcomings .
So what ’s the new coalition government going to do about it ?
Back in 2008/09 , Dr Mark Thompson wrote a report for the Conservatives on just this issue ( and , to be fair , it moved them well ahead of the Lib Dems on IT policy ) .
Thompson ’s report was pretty good , and recommended fewer big IT projects , breaking projects down into smaller modules where possible and more use of open standards and open source .
That work ’s made it into the coalition agreement in the form of two paragraphs :
We will take steps to open up government procurement and reduce costs ; and we will publish government ICT contracts online .
We will create a level playing field for open - source software and will enable large ICT projects to be split into smaller components
Which is all good , but the devil ’s in the detail .
To give one example , Labour would claim that there ’s already a level playing field for open source software – guidelines issued a few years ago made it clear that open source and proprietary should both be fairly considered .
In reality , though , that ’s not quite happened .
The combination of a lack of in - house expertise , and open source being perceived as riskier by bureaucrats who quite reasonably do n’t want to damage their careers by going out on a limb has held it back .
Further , the reliance on the model of the last twenty years of buying in IT solutions externally ( as opposed to the more common method of developing them in - house prior to that ) makes it difficult to get the full benefit from open source .
To really benefit from the development model , you want to be taking open source software , adding to it and then releasing it so as many parts of the public sector as possible can use it .
You want a piece of software developed by the Treasury to be usable – with no licensing cost – by the NHS , the Department of Education and your local council , and for their developers to be able to modify it to meet their specific needs .
So the direction of travel under the coalition – thanks to the work the Conservatives have done – is much more promising than anything for the last twenty or thirty years ; but it still needs to get there .
That ’s where we come in .
Tech - savvy Lib Dem members can play an important role in shaping how the Government actually delivers on these promises and good intentions , and in the process catch up on an area of policy where the party ’s fallen behind .
The Act group Lib Dems for some decent IT policy , with over 120 members , has the chance to work with other groups and shape the way Government does IT .
If we can get it right , we ’ve got the opportunity to save billions of pounds and improve public sector IT into the bargain .
University of Berkeley was again the site of an anti-Israel provocation when the Students for Justice in Palestine assaulted a pro-Israel advocate .
University of California at Berkeley was again the site of a clash involving pro-Israel and anti-Israel activists last Friday when Husam Zakharia , leader of the Students for Justice in Palestine , assaulted Jessica Felber of the pro-Israel Tikvah group with a shopping cart .
The incident occurred during competing events from the SJP - run “ Israel Apartheid Week ” and “ Israel Peace and Diversity Week ” organized by Tikvah .
Felber was holding a sign that read “ Israel Wants Peace ” when Zakharia intentionally slammed her from behind with a shopping cart filled with toys donated for the welfare of Arab children in the Hamas - controlled Gaza region .
Felber told Israel National
News that she responded to the incident by immediately placing her attacker under citizens ’ arrest .
Police arrested him later that day and Felber expressed hope that the District Attorney will see the case through and file charges against Zakharia .
Felber said that Friday ’s incident was not the first time Zakharia used violence against pro-Israel advocates .
According to her , physical intimidation has frequently been employed as a tool by SJP to silence students opposing their anti-Zionist activities on campus .
“ SJP students have been terrorizing us for three years with intimidation , accusations and threats .
This incident is simply the culmination of it all and we are not going to tolerate it anymore . ”
SJP ’s tactics backfired on at least one occasion when , in November 2008 , the group attempted to disrupt a concert organized by the Zionist Freedom Alliance during “ Israel Liberation Week ” on the UC Berkeley campus .
After striking a ZFA activist in the head , Zakharia found himself beaten to the ground .
Following the incident , Zakharia and two fellow SJP members , along with two Zionist activists , were cited for battery but no charges were officially filed .
The UC Berkeley Hillel and leaders of the California Bay Area Jewish community condemned the violence at the time but made no moral distinction between SJP and ZFA .
This time around , however , Felber said Hillel and many other Jewish organizations have been very supportive and she expressed hope that SJP will no longer be able to intimidate her or other students on campus .
View video below of Husam Zakharia and fellow SJP activist handling out anti-Israel propaganda on campus while standing on an Israeli flag .
Peter Robinson has lost his East Belfast seat
Election 2010 : Who were the winners and losers ?
What now for unionism ?
Who is Naomi Long ?
First minister and DUP leader Peter Robinson 's future in politics is under threat after he lost the Westminster seat he held for 31 years .
Alliance deputy leader Naomi Long is the new MP for East Belfast .
Both main unionist leaders have suffered defeat in the election as Sir Reg Empey lost in South Antrim .
Sinn Fein's Michelle Gildernew was returned in Fermanagh / South Tyrone after beating Rodney Connor by four votes in a third recount .
After the second recount , Mrs Gildernew , Sinn Fein , was just two votes ahead of independent unionist unity candidate Rodney Connor .
She had 21,300 votes to Mr Connor 's 21,298 .
With all seats declared in Northern Ireland , the DUP have eight , Sinn Fein have five , the SDLP have three , the Alliance Party has one seat and one seat has been won by the independent , Lady Hermon .
Meanwhile , despite his party 's pact with the Conservatives , Ulster Unionist leader Sir Reg Empey has lost to William McCrea , DUP , in South Antrim .

Senior Ulster Unionist David McNarry said Sir Reg was " finished " as party leader .
But Mr McNarry said he was " not in the stakes for leadership " , turning the focus , instead , on unionist unity .
BBC NI political correspondent Martina Purdy revealed that later on Friday the UUP party officers are due to meet for a post - mortem on the election .
There is speculation about whether Sir Reg Empey will continue as leader but so far there has been no comment from him .
In a shock turnaround , DUP leader Mr Robinson 's vote fell from a 6,000 majority in 2005 .
This time , he took 11,306 votes and Ms Long won with 12,839 votes .
His wife , Iris Robinson 's resignation and questions over expenses and land deals may have played a role in his defeat .
Speaking after the result was announced , Mr Robinson said he would have " preferred not to stand " in East Belfast .
" I have a job to complete with my mandate at the Assembly and I will continue to carry out that important work , " he said moments after the shock result was announced .
Ms Long said her election was a positive message from the people of East Belfast Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" They want stability and they want peace and I think that those are positive messages coming not only from people who voted for me but also those who voted for the former incumbent in that seat they want to move forward , " she said .
" I think we need to take that very seriously and make sure that 's exactly what we deliver . "
BBC NI political editor Mark Devenport said the shock defeat " damages Mr Robinson 's stock " .
" None of the DUP MPs who we have been speaking to on our election special wishes to be Brutus wielding his dagger , but the results increase the standing of the Paisley and potentially the Dodds dynasties in the party .
Pipe bomb " So who will be in charge of any negotiations with the future would - be Prime Ministers ? "
In better news for the DUP , in Antrim North , Ian Paisley Jnr polled 19,672 votes , winning the seat comfortably despite the contest from TUV leader Jim Allister .
Overall , the TUV polled badly and did not cause significant damage to the DUP vote .
And the Ulster Unionists ' pact with the Conservatives has not produced the fightback they had hoped for .
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams has retained his Belfast West seat polling 22,840 votes Bairbre de Brun , SF , said the recent bad publicity surrounding Gerry Adams has not had any effect on his vote .
The turnout in his constituency is down by almost 14 % but Mr Adams ' share of the vote is slightly up .
The SDLP saw off the Sinn Fein challenge from Stormont Education Minister Caitriona Ruane in South Down .
SDLP leader Margaret Ritchie polled 20,648 votes , taking over the mantle from party veteran Eddie McGrady .
In Londonderry , the count was suspended after a pipe bomb was left at the Templemore sports complex .
But it later resumed and Mark Durkan was returned as Foyle MP and Gregory Campbell returned as East Londonderry MP .

( * But not in the post I link to ; rather in the dozens of other posts where he ridicules the idea that tax cuts for the rich , deregulation and privatization produce prosperity . )
Suppose you had gotten a room full of economists together in 1980 , and made the following predictions :
1 . Over the next 28 years the US would grow as fast as Japan , and faster than Europe ( in GDP per capita , PPP . )
2 . Over the next 28 years Britain would overtake Germany and France in GDP per capita .
And you said you were making these predictions because you thought Thatcher and Reagan ’s policies would be a success .
Your predictions ( and the rationale ) would have been met with laughter .
Indeed around that time most of the top British economists signed a petition asserting that Thatcher ’s policies would fail .
For those of you not old enough to remember 1980 , let me explain why .
Labour rule of Britain had reduced their economy to a shambles .
The government ran the big manufacturing corporations and labor unions were running wild .
They had 83 % MTRs , 98 % on capital .
There was garbage piling up in the streets of London .
Britain had been the sick man of Europe for decades , growing far more slowly than Germany , France and Italy .
The US was n’t doing as badly , but certainly was n’t doing that well either .
We had also been growing much more slowly than Europe and Japan .
Unlike Britain , we were still richer than most other developed countries , so this convergence was viewed as partly inevitable ( the catch - up from WWII ) , and partly reflecting the superior economic model of the Germans and Japanese .
Now let ’s look at what actually happened over the next 28 years .
All GDP per capita data are from the World Bank , and are normalized as a fraction of US GDP / person :
Country 1980 1994 2008
USA 1.000 1.000 1.000
Australia .841 .770 .837
Canada .905 .818 .843
Britain .688 .705 .765
France .780 .730 .713
Germany .803 .812 .763
Italy .756 .754 .675
Sweden .868 .777 .794
Switz .
1.146 .987 .915
Asia
HK .547 .845 .948
Japan .732 .815 .736
Singapore .577 .899 1.064
Latin America
Argentina .395 .300 .309
Chile .210 .251 .311
Note that four countries gained significantly on the US , two were roughly stable ( Australia , Japan ) and the rest regressed .
The four that gained were Chile , Britain , Hong Kong and Singapore .
Of course lots of poor countries gained on the US , but that ’s to be expected .
But I will show that the performance of every single country on the list is consistent with my view that the neoliberal reforms after 1980 helped growth , and inconsistent with Krugman ’s view that they did not .
Krugman makes the basic mistake of just looking at time series evidence , and only two data points : US growth before and after 1980 .
Growth has been slower , but that ’s true almost everywhere .
What is important is that the neoliberal reforms in America have helped arrest our relative decline .
The few countries that continued to gain on us were either more aggressive reformers ( Chile and Britain ) , or were developing countries that adopted the world ’s most capitalist model .
( According to every survey I have seen HK and Singapore are the top two in economic freedom . )
Australia : A traditionally rich country whose commodity export model started to sputter in the 1970s .
They did major free market reforms ( under a left wing government ) .
Reforms continued when the conservatives took power .
After 1994 they reversed their relative decline .
Japan : Just the opposite of Australia .
Their free market export model did very well in the post war years , and did n’t hit a wall until about 1990 .
After that their economy was unable to find domestic growth sectors , as their dysfunctional government refused to reform their statist domestic economy .
HK and Singapore : Both are in the process of becoming much richer than the US .
Some of that is due to their status as city - states .
But in modern developed economies the rural populations are small and not that poor , so I think in time people will recognize that Singapore ’s success is more than just demographics .
Chile and Argentina : Chile is the most famous Latin American example of neoliberal reforms .
Note how in 1980 they were barely half as rich as their neighbor Argentina , and are now a bit richer .
Almost every serious development economist attributes their relative success to their neoliberal reforms .
BTW , there was a severe recession in Chile in 1974 - 75 , but rapid growth from 1975 - 80 .
In addition , they were much poorer than Argentina in 1970 as well , so the starting date does n’t explain much .
Canada : Similar to Australia , except that they were not as statist as Australia in the earlier period , and their reforms occurred in the 1990s when they began dramatically shrinking the size of government as a share of GDP .
The 1990s reforms worked as their relative decline to the US was reversed , and they started catching up after 1994 .
France and Germany : Did some reforms , but much less than Britain .
They suffered a decline relative to both Britain and the US .
I think the 1980 German numbers include the East , but ca n’t be certain .
I do know that Germany ’s relative decline increased after 1994 , by which time the East German incomes had definitely been incorporated in the data .
Italy : Did even less reforms than Germany and France , and has a more statist model .
Fell far behind Britain .
Sweden :
Had a bad recession in the early 1990s and had suffered decades of relative decline .
Did major cuts in MTRs , privatization and deregulation during the 1990s , and its relative performance improved after those reforms .
Switzerland :
Is the glass half full or half empty ?
Switzerland has always been regarded as one of the most capitalist countries in Western Europe , but has also been among the least aggressive countries in terms of neoliberal reforms .
That pattern would predict high levels of GDP / person , but relative decline vis-a - vis the US .
And that is exactly what has occurred .
They rested on their laurels and slipped quite a few notches down the Heritage and Fraser rankings .
I suppose the highly democratic system allowed them to avoid the worst socialist excesses of the 20th century , but also prevented them from reforming as fast as more dictatorial forms of democracy , such as the UK .
So there you are , all these countries support my hypothesis that neoliberal reforms lead to faster growth in real income , relative to the unreformed alternative .
There are two kinds of economists .
Those who read the Economist ( or FT ) every week , and have a pretty good sense of what is going on in the world , and who know why some countries are doing better than others .
And those who are lost in their ivory tower doing arcane research .
The latter group is often much more highly skilled than I am , and come up with more important new ideas than I ever will .
But when talking to this group I often find they are totally oblivious to the neoliberal revolution of the past 30 years .
( BTW , this is n’t a jab at the left , most of the guys I am thinking of are right - wingers . )
You ca n’t just take a single data point to evaluate a complex phenomenon .
“ Eh , you say there ’s a neoliberal revolution ?
OK , let me check to see whether most countries grew faster or slower after 1980 .
That should settle the argument . ”
Actually it does n’t .
The neoliberal revolution occurred precisely because growth was slowing almost everywhere in the 1970s and 1980s , and after 1980 growth slowed the most in those countries that reformed the least .
PS .
I do n’t mean to suggest the left does n’t have any counterarguments .
Reasonable progressives would admit than some of the reforms were sensible ( cutting MTRs below 90 % , privatizing British steel and autos , abolishing the CAB , etc. )
And they ’d also point to the fact that leisure has increased faster in Europe and thus the hourly real wage numbers look somewhat better vis-a - vis the US .
And then I ’d respond that the French productivity numbers are inflated by the fact that their labor market keeps many of the least productive people unemployed ( teens and immigrants . )
And they ’d respond by pointing to our large prison population .
The debate never ends .
But Krugman was using simple real income numbers in his recent post .
And by that criterion the results are clear — neoliberal reforms produce higher levels of GDP per capita .
HT : James , Marcus
Update : Several commenters mentioned median income rather than GDP / person .
The median income data does show slower growth than GDP / capita , partly because of increasing inequality , but partly because of statistical problems with the data ( health benefits are excluded , etc . )
I believe consumption data is far superior to median real income , and that shows Americans doing much better .
Will Wilkinson has posted on this .
The consumption data also show a much smaller increase in inequality .
But I was primarily interested in international comparisons , for which all I had was GDP data in PPP terms .
The point was that countries that did more reforms did better than those that did fewer reforms .
I am not denying that growth in US living standards slowed after 1973 , rather I am arguing that it would have slowed more had we not reformed our economy .

Am I the only one who has a problem with them calling themselves the " Tea Party ? "
As an American who is proud to have the American Revolution as part of our rich history , a group of conservative activists choosing to name their party after a key moment in our revolt from the British government offends me deeply .
And the results are downright stunning .
In stark contrast with composite polls showing the religiousness of Americans as a whole , a look at the numbers across generations shows almost all aspects of religious belief dropping generation over generation , reaching a low point with the current youngest generation , the millenials .
The media , including Pew themselves , seemed unable ( or unwilling maybe ) to spell out the implications of this study .
The Los Angeles Times for instance , in a typical treatment put it this way :
Is faith losing its grip on the young ?
That would be one way to read a new report by the respected Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life , which found that more than one - quarter of Americans age 18 to 29 have no religious preference or affiliation , and fewer than one in five attend services regularly .
That makes them easily the least religious generation among Americans alive today , perhaps the least religious ever .
Or does it ?
Yes , actually , it does .
Most shocking for me was the finding that absolute belief in God for millenials is only 53 % .
That means that about half of the current younger generation are questioning whether God even exists .
But equally consequential is the drastically reduced belief among across generations as a whole in the literal truth of the Bible .
Of course , these numbers also clearly show that some elements of religiousness rise as individuals age .
For instance , although Gen Xers start at a slightly higher point on every metric than Millenials , they have grown more religious as they approach middle age , as have Boomers - which in some ways , seems logical .
It should be pointed out , though , that for the most part , these are not huge increases , but on the level of about 5 points , only 2 points greater than the margin of error .
We also lack corresponding data for older generations from when they were , say , in their 20s , but here , common sense observation of our culture around us should be able to tell us something .
It strains credulity for me personally , for instance , to think that only 27 % of young adults in the 40s or 50s believed in a literal interpretation of the Bible , or that such a low number attended church .
It also seems wrong , in my opinion , to casually dismiss those metrics that have shown the most change - such as belief in a literal interpretation of the Bible .
NOT interpreting the Bible literally is now an accepted strain of Christian thought , but it goes against how the religion has been practiced for most of its 2,000 - year history .
On the other hand , the metric that has shown the most growth over the course of people 's lives , " importance of religion , " does n't at all imply or suggest a literalist interpretation .
Overall , for religious belief to change this much over the course of 50 years is hardly something to be brushed under the rug - it deserves extended examination in the press .
Findings like these would seem to be bolstered by the results of a recent USA Today study , which compared polling from 1990 and last year , and found that ALL denominations are losing members , and that people not affiliated with a religion - a group that includes atheists and agnostics - is now nearly the largest single religious group ( oh , the irony : )
The percentage . of people who call themselves in some way Christian has dropped more than 11 % in a generation .
The faithful have scattered out of their traditional bases : The Bible Belt is less Baptist .
The Rust Belt is less Catholic .
And everywhere , more people are exploring spiritual frontiers — or falling off the faith map completely .
...
So many Americans claim no religion at all ( 15 % , up from 8 % in 1990 ) , that this category now outranks every other major U.S. religious group except Catholics and Baptists .
In a nation that has long been mostly Christian , " the challenge to Christianity … does not come from other religions but from a rejection of all forms of organized religion , " the report concludes .
It should be noted that the rejection of belief is n't an either / or proposition , and that those who reject a traditional religious outlook , but are n't ardent enough nonbelievers to call themselves " atheists " will probably see their numbers grow the most .
Still , if this trend continues I wonder if we can safely infer that the next generation after millenials will consist of a clear majority who question belief in God .
One also wonders how much current events , such as the neverending scandal consuming the Catholic Church , or further advances in our understanding of the world made through science , will have on this trend .
And just today , Nick Clegg - an openly declared atheist - has taken the lead in the race to become the next Prime Minister of the UK in at least some polls .
And that 's a good thing .
Conservatives often make the argument that religion is a necessary element of a fair and just society .
Once and possible future Republican Presidential candidate Mitt Romney went so far as to suggest , in a somewhat mind - bending statement , that " freedom requires religion . "
In fact , empirical observation tells us that exactly the opposite is true .
In study after study , European , and more specifically , Scandinavian countries are consistently ranked as having the highest quality of life .
A recent Forbes study , for instance , rated the " happiest " countries along a variety of factors .
Their results were as follows :
Denmark
Finland
Netherlands
Sweden
Ireland
Canada
Switzerland
New Zealand
Norway
Belgium
That 's a remarkably high number of countries from a single part of Europe .
Enough , in fact , to make you ask what these countries have in common .
Of course , one factor could be their generally more equitable economic systems .
But another key commonality is their lack of religiousness .
As the New York Times put it :
Anyone who has paid attention knows that Denmark and Sweden are among the least religious nations in the world .
Polls asking about belief in God , the importance of religion in people ’s lives , belief in life after death or church attendance consistently bear this out .
It is also well known that in various rankings of nations by life expectancy , child welfare , literacy , schooling , economic equality , standard of living and competitiveness , Denmark and Sweden stand in the first tier .
Well documented though they may be , these two sets of facts run up against the assumption of many Americans that a society where religion is minimal would be , in Mr. Zuckerman ’s words , “ rampant with immorality , full of evil and teeming with depravity . ”
Which is why he insists at some length that what he and his wife and children experienced was quite the opposite : “ a society — a markedly irreligious society — that was , above all , moral , stable , humane and deeply good . ”
While most people in these countries do n't consider themselves " atheist , " the effect , in terms of the role of religion in public life , is pretty much the same .
This indifference or obliviousness to religious matters was sometimes subtly enforced .
“ In Denmark , ” a pastor told Mr. Zuckerman , “ the word ‘ God ’ is one of the most embarrassing words you can say .
You would rather go naked through the city than talk about God . ”
One man recounted the shock he felt when a colleague , after a few drinks , confessed to believing in God .
“ I hope you do n’t feel I ’m a bad person , ” the colleague pleaded .
It kind of boggles the mind given everything we think we know , but that could be where America is headed over the next half century .
John Lennon would be proud .
UPDATE : Some of the skeptics below have a point when they say I have n't given enough space to the phenomenon of people growing more religious as they age .
I 've added a couple of paragraphs to address those points , which I had acknowledged before .
Of course , we 'll never have a complete understanding of this issue , but I do think the data here shows a powerful trend .
Everyone is welcome to make up their own mind obviously .
Digg Dumps 10 Percent of Staff
When former Digg CEO Jay Adelson announced his departure from the social news site earlier this year , he described it as a company maturing well beyond its start - up phase .
“ Digg Ads [ are ] doing well , ” he wrote .
“ Our sales force [ is ] growing [ and ] our hiring ramping . ”
Odd , then , to hear that Digg sacked 10 percent of its staff today for what founder and CEO Kevin Rose says is “ the long - term health of the company . ”
“ This is one of the hardest decisions we ’ve had to make recently but we strongly believe that it is the right decision for the long - term health of the company , ” Rose wrote in a memo to employees .
“ In order to achieve our goals , ” he added , “ we are putting more emphasis on the engineering and development efforts .
In fact , we are still hiring for these teams as they are critical in getting us to where we need to be for the future , for our impending upcoming redesign , and much beyond .
The only way for us to truly succeed is to adapt and adjust as necessary . ”
That 2006 BusinessWeek cover , “ How This Kid Made $ 60 Million In 18 Months , ” must seem like a distant memory now …
The New York Times
In early April , Edna McCloud woke up to find her hands tied to her hospital bed .
She had spent the past four days on a ventilator in a hospital in St. Louis County , Missouri , thrashing and kicking under sedation as she battled a severe case of COVID - 19 .
" They told me , ' You were a real fighter down there , ' " recalled McCloud , a 68 - year - old African American retiree with a history of diabetes and heart problems .
She weighed close to 300 pounds when she caught the coronavirus , which ravaged her lungs and kidneys .
Nearly six months later , she feels proud to have pulled through the worst .
" They said people with the conditions I have , normally , this goes the other way , " she said .
As rates of obesity continue to climb in the United States , its role in COVID - 19 is a thorny scientific question .
A flurry of recent studies has shown that people with extra weight are more susceptible than others to severe bouts of disease .
And experiments in animals and human cells have demonstrated how excess fat can disrupt the immune system .
But the relationship between obesity and COVID - 19 is complex , and many mysteries remain .
Excess weight tends to go hand in hand with other medical conditions , like high blood pressure and diabetes , which may by themselves make it harder to fight COVID - 19 .
Obesity also disproportionately affects people who identify as Black or Latino -- groups at much higher risk than others of contracting and dying from COVID - 19 , in large part because of exposure at their workplaces , limited access to medical care and other inequities tied to systemic racism .
And people with extra weight must grapple with persistent stigma about their appearance and health , even from doctors , further imperiling their prognosis .
" A new pandemic is now laying itself on top of an ongoing epidemic , " said Dr. Christy Richardson , an endocrinologist at SSM Health in Missouri .
Regarding obesity 's effects on infectious disease , she said , " We are still learning , but it 's not difficult to understand how the body can become overwhelmed .
" The correlations between COVID - 19 and obesity are worrisome .
In one report published last month , researchers found that people with obesity who caught the coronavirus were more than twice as likely to end up in the hospital and nearly 50 % more likely to die of COVID - 19 .
Another study , which has not yet been peer - reviewed , showed that among nearly 17,000 hospitalized COVID - 19 patients in the United States , more than 77 % had excess weight or obesity .
Similar links were unmasked during the H1N1 flu pandemic of 2009 , when researchers began to notice that infected people with obesity were more likely to wind up in the hospital and to die .
Flu vaccines administered in subsequent years performed poorly in individuals with extra weight , who fell ill more often than their peers even after getting their shots .
" Obesity resets human physiology , " said Dr. Anne Dixon , a pulmonologist at the University of Vermont Medical Center who studies how excess weight can affect respiratory conditions like asthma .
" People who are very obese are living on sort of a precarious position .
This is not just cosmetic .
" Experts said part of obesity 's threat is mechanical : Large amounts of fat , for instance , can compress the lower parts of the lungs , making it harder for them to expand when people breathe in .
The blood of people with obesity also seems to be more prone to clotting , plugging up delicate vessels throughout the body and starving tissues of oxygen .
Fat , or adipose tissue , can also send out hormones and other signals that make nearby cells go haywire .
" Adipose tissue is very active , " said Rebekah Honce , a virologist at St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital in Tennessee and an author on a recent review describing how metabolism intersects with immunity .
" It 's not a dormant tissue .
" One of fat 's most potent effects appears to involve quelling the body 's initial immune response to the virus , allowing the pathogen to spread unchecked .
Eventually , the body 's immune soldiers get their act together .
But this delayed assault might do more harm than good :
When late - arriving immune cells and molecules finally rouse themselves into action , they go berserk , driving uncontrolled bouts of inflammation throughout the body .
These aberrant early responses can have severe long - term consequences as well , said Melinda Beck , who studies how nutrition affects immunity at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill .
The constant inflammation , she said , can wear away at the immune system 's ability to generate a long - lived population of " memory " cells , which store intelligence about past encounters with pathogens .
Similar trends have been noted in the immune systems of elderly patients , who also struggle to marshal effective defenses against pathogens .
When obesity enters the picture , Beck said , some of the immune cells found in 30 - year - old people " look like those of an 80 - year - old .
" These problems could have a big impact on the first coronavirus vaccines , Beck said .
If the immune systems of people with obesity are more prone to pathogen amnesia , then they may need different dosages of a vaccine .
Some products might not work at all in people carrying extra weight .
But little attention has been paid to these risks in ongoing vaccine trials .
When asked if they were testing the effects of weight on vaccine effectiveness , representatives from Novavax and AstraZeneca , two of the leaders among companies in the race for a coronavirus vaccine , said there were no public plans to investigate the issue .
Representatives from their competitors Moderna and Pfizer did not respond to repeated requests for comment .
Johnson & Johnson , whose coronavirus vaccine candidate entered late - stage clinical trials this month , is enrolling people with obesity , according to a company spokesman , Jake Sargent .
The company " will have the opportunity to evaluate this question during development , " he said .
Like many other conditions that can exacerbate COVID - 19 , excess weight does not have a quick fix -- especially in areas where access to healthy food and opportunities for exercise are vastly uneven among communities .
"
If we do n't address these social underpinnings , I think we 'll continue to see a recurrence of what is happening now , " said Dr. Jennifer Woo Baidal , a pediatric weight management specialist at Columbia University .
In her neighborhood in St. Louis County , where there have been more than 23,000 cases of the coronavirus since March , McCloud has struggled to find fresh , affordable produce at her local grocery store .
Availability has plummeted further since the start of the pandemic , she said , and what little is on the shelves is often on the verge of rotting .
" I have to cook it right away , or it starts to turn , " she said .
McCloud will sometimes travel a bit further to buy salad mixes or leeks -- a favorite that adds zing to her meals .
But the closest store with any variety is an inconvenient car ride away .
She estimates that since contracting COVID - 19 , she has lost 20 or 30 pounds .
She wants to keep her weight down , she said , but her circumstances have made that hard , and " it has only gotten worse since the pandemic started .
" A few months after McCloud got sick , her younger sister , Elaine Franklin , 62 , began to experience terrible headaches .
When she spoke to family members , they asked why she sounded so out of breath .
" My son said , ' Mama , you need to go to urgent care , ' " Franklin recalled .
A test soon revealed that she , too , had caught the coronavirus .
Franklin's case of COVID - 19 was more moderate than her sister's .
But she still deteriorated quickly , to the point where she could no longer reach the bathroom without assistance .
" I was so weak , I could n't balance myself , " she said .
Her physical symptoms have n't been the only hardship .
Franklin , who is overweight , said she had been irritated by incessant messaging in news reports blaming illnesses like hers on excess fat .
" The way they were saying it is that because you 're obese and did n't take care of yourself , you 'll get this disease , " Franklin said .
" I feel like that was unfair .
" Even medical professionals show bias when caring for patients with excess weight , said Dr. Benjamin Singer , a pulmonologist at the University of Michigan and an author on a recent review of obesity 's influence on immunity .
Studies have shown that doctors tend to be more dismissive of patients with obesity and may brush off worrisome symptoms as irrelevant side effects of their weight .
Drug dosages and diagnostic machines are also often incompatible with patients carrying excess weight , making it difficult to tailor treatments .
Such interactions can be a powerful disincentive to some of the people who most need care .
" These are not easy conversations , " said Dr. Kanakadurga Singer , a pediatric endocrinologist at the University of Michigan .
( She and Benjamin Singer are married . )
Not everyone who weighs more than average is unwell , she said .
" It 's more than just the numbers , and it 's not just the weight we should focus on .
" In St. Louis County , McCloud and Franklin have recovered well , although both sisters still grapple with lingering symptoms .
McCloud has occasional fatigue and an intermittent cough .
" I ca n't talk like I did before , " she said .
Franklin's headaches never disappeared , and her mind now feels constantly clouded by a fog .
Both women have worried about their sons , who also developed COVID - 19 .
Chris McCloud , a teacher , was like his mother put on a ventilator and spent several weeks in the hospital shortly before Edna McCloud fell ill .
He was overweight as well .
Franklin suspects she might have contracted the coronavirus from her son Darren Catching , who most likely caught it from a former co-worker .
He had recently lost a large amount of weight , Franklin said , and was not hospitalized either , instead recovering at home .
In July , when she was infected , she sought medical attention twice .
She had lupus , an autoimmune disease , and worried that she would n't be able to fight off the virus .
Thoughts of friends and acquaintances who had died from COVID - 19 rushed through her head .
But both times , Franklin was sent home -- first from an urgent care facility and then from a hospital emergency room .
She managed to heal on her own , she said .
Still , she wonders if her weariness and brain fog might have been prevented by more attentive clinical care .
" I 'm not a doctor or anything , " she said .
" But if I had been in the hospital , maybe it would have been better .

China has earned a new degree of recognition for its growing influence on the global economy , after members of the World Bank decided Sunday to increase Beijing ’s voting power behind only the United States and Japan in the international lending body .
The boost underscored a broader decision at the bank ’s meeting to raise the share of votes held by developing countries to just over 47 percent , as part of ongoing reforms to give poorer countries a greater say in setting World Bank lending policy .
“ It will enhance the role that developing countries can play in World Bank affairs and also help the bank play a greater role in helping developing countries improve economic development and reduce poverty , ” Chinese Finance Minister Xie Xuren said in a statement .
The World Bank , started after World War II , lends money to low - to middle - income nations at low interest rates to spur development and fight poverty .
A bigger role
China ’s voice has resonated with growing volume in international economic bodies as its economy is now the second largest ( by gross domestic output ) in the world , behind the US .
The international financial and economic crisis amplified that voice , especially since the G20 , where China is a leading member , has become more influential in setting global policy than the G8 of developed capitalist countries .
At the personal level too , China has become more visible .
Since 2008 the World Bank ’s chief economist , a key figure , has been Justin Yifu Lin , a distinguished Chinese economist .
Sunday ’s move “ is symbolic recognition of what is happening anyway ” says Michael Pettis , who teaches finance at Peking University in Beijing .
“ China is getting a bigger voice … if for no other reason than its investments abroad are growing much more significant .
It has reserves and it is prepared to fund development . ”
More voting power to come ?
The World Bank ’s 186 members decided Sunday to increase China ’s voting power from 2.77 percent to 4.42 percent .
This is still well behind Washington , whose 15.85 percent share gives it effective veto power , and also short of Japan ’s 6.84 percent .
The bank requires an 85 percent vote to pass decisions .
The 3.1 percent increase in “ developing and transition countries ” share of World Bank votes gives them 47.2 percent ; since the bank includes some high - income countries in its definition .
But countries more normally classified as “ developing ” in fact hold just over 42 percent , according to the Bretton Woods Project , an international network of monitoring the World Bank and International Monetary Fund .
Mr. Xie said he saw Sunday ’s reform as “ an important step towards equitable voting power between developing and developed members , ” but he clearly expects more , both for his country and other developing nations .
“ The future shareholding principles should continue to be based on economic weight , ” he added “ and aim to achieve the ultimate goal of equitable voting power . ”

The Vatican has already suggested the pope is immune from prosecution because he is a head of state .
But Dawkins and Hitchens believe that because he is not the head of a state with full United Nations membership , he does not hold immunity and could be arrested when he steps on to British soil .
This is the advice they have been given by their lawyers – solicitor Mark Stephens and human rights barrister Geoffrey Robertson QC .
" I 'm convinced we can get over the threshold of immunity , " said Stephens .
" The Vatican is not recognised as a state in international law .
People assume that it has existed for time immemorial but it was a construct of Mussolini , and when the Vatican first applied to become a member of the UN , the US said no .
So as a sop they were given the status of permanent observers rather than full members . "
But the Holy See insists it is a state like any other .
Earlier this month , Giuseppe Dalla Torre , Vatican tribunal chief , said : " The pope is certainly a head of state and he has the same legal status as all heads of state . "
Stephens said there are three lines of approach to put the pope in the dock .
" One is that we apply for a warrant to the international criminal court .
Alternatively , criminal proceedings could be brought here , either a public prosecution brought by the Crown Prosecution Service or a private prosecution .
That would require at least one victim to come forward who is either from this jurisdiction or was abused here .
The third option is for individuals to lodge civil claims , " said Stephens .
He said he had recently been approached by seven wealthy individuals who donated money to the Catholic church and were dismayed their money had not only been used to fund abuse but also buy the silence of victims .
These people could potentially sue the pope , Stephens suggested .
Writing in the Washington Post on Friday , Dawkins described Ratzinger as a " leering old villain in a frock … whose first instinct when his priests are caught with their pants down is to cover up the scandal and damn the young victims to silence . "
Without admitting that he had consulted lawyers he added : " This former head of the Inquisition should be arrested the moment he dares to set foot outside his tinpot fiefdom of the Vatican , and he should be tried in an appropriate civil – not ecclesiastical – court .
That 's what should happen .
Sadly , we all know our faith - befuddled governments will be too craven to do it . "
Pope Benedict will be in Britain from 16 - 19 September where he will beatify the theologian Cardinal John Henry Newman .
I knew it was only a matter of time before someone used stainless steel 3D printing to make an awesome looking robot .
Little did I realize that robot would be art , not automaton .
Mani Zamani , an Algerian artist working in Europe , has taken his amazing looking digital designs and printed them using Shapeways ’ stainless steel printing .
Combined with Revoltech joints from Kaiyodo , the stainless steel frames allow Zamani to create miniature pieces of robot sculpture with a level of detail and artistry that will blow your mind .
His creations have been mentioned several times on the Shapeways site , where you can also find the designs for many of his figures .
You need to see how cool these robots look ; check out the videos of the printed and hand painted creations below .
3D printing is really coming into its own as a new avenue for art .
We ’ve seen full installations in museums and countless amateur creations via MakerBot , RepRap , and Shapeways .
The ability to draft a sculpture and fine tune its look before it ’s made is a powerful tool for the visual artist .
The replicative nature of 3D printing also turns every artist into a possible store .
Zamani is working on his own joints to replace the Revoltech parts so he can sell his robot statues without restrictions .
While some may see perfect replication as degrading the value of each individual artwork , for the struggling artist 3D printing can provide the means to become financially self sufficient by selling many copies of each work .
As art takes advantage of 3D printers , we may see the fall of the winner - takes - all system that makes a few sculptors famous as the rest toil in obscurity .
Or we could just see a lot more neat robot figurines .
Either way , pretty cool .

A very popular movie in Japan was Pride , The Fateful Moment , which shows Prime Minister General Hideki Tojo in a favorable light .
With six others , he was hanged in 1968 as a war criminal .
During his trial , his lawyers stated to the International Tribunal for the Far East , the Asian version of Nuremberg Trials , that Tojo 's war crimes could not begin to approach the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
The prosecutors immediately objected , and censored their statements .
That was the last time there was any official recognition of the atomic bomb massacres in Japan .
Japanese officials have been effectively prevented from taking any stand on this matter because the American military occupation , which officially ended in 1952 with the Treaty with Japan , was quietly continued .
Today , 49,000 American troops are still stationed in Japan , and there is no public discussion of the crimes of Hiroshima and Nagasaki .

Albert Einstein ; lifelong Zionist who initiated the United States ' atomic bomb program with a personal letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1939 .
The Secret History Of The Atomic Bomb SUBTITLE Why Hiroshima Was Destroyed - The Untold Story By Eustace C. Mullins June 1998
The world was stunned to learn that India has now tested nuclear weapons .
For many years , all nations have been concerned about the proliferation of atomic explosives .
Even in their distress , no one seems to be interested in the historic or the psychological record of why these weapons were developed , and what special breed of mankind devoted themselves to this diabolical goal .
Despite the lack of public interest , the record is clear , and easily available to anyone who is interested .
My interest in this subject , dormant for many years was suddenly rekindled during my annual lecture tour in Japan .
My hosts had taken me to the city of Nagasaki for the first time .
Without telling me their plans , they entered the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum .
I thought it would be an interesting experience , but , to my surprise , when I walked into the exhibition rooms , I was suddenly overcome by sadness .
Realizing that I was about to burst into tears , I moved away from my companions , and stood biting my lip .
Even so , it seemed impossible to control myself .
I was surrounded by the most gruesome objects , the fingers of a human hand fused with glass , a photograph of the shadow of a man on a brick wall ; the man had been vaporized in the explosion .
A NEW MISSION
When I returned to the United States , I knew1 had to unearth the sinister figures behind greatest of human catastrophes .
It took many weeks of research to uncover what turned out to be the most far - reaching conspiracy of all time , the program of a few dedicated revolutionaries to seize control of the entire world , by inventing the powerful weapon ever unveiled .
The story begins in Germany .
In the 1930s , Germany and Japan had a number of scientists icing on the development of nuclear fission .
In both of these countries , their leaders sternly forbade them to continue their research .
Adolf Hitler said he would never allow anyone in Germany to work to work on such an inhumane weapon .
The Emperor of Japan let his scientists know that he would never approve such a weapon .
At that time the United States had no one working on nuclear fission .
The disgruntled German scientists contacted friends in the United States , and were told that there was a possibility of government support for their work here .
As Don Beyer tells these immigrants to the United States pushed their program .
" Leo Szilard , together with his long time friends and fellow Hungarian physicists , Eugene Wigner and Edward Teller , agreed that the President must be warned ; fission bomb tehnology was not so farfetched .
The Jewish emigres , now living in America , had personal experience of fascism in Europe .
In 1939 , the three physicists enlisted the support of Albert Einstein , letter dated August 2 signed by Einstein was delivered by Alexander Sachs to Franklin D. Roosevelt at the White House on October 11 , 39 . "
CRIMINALS ON DISPLAY
At the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum , photographs of two men are prominently displayed ; Albert Einstein , and J. Robert Oppenheimer , who developed the atomic bomb at Los Alamos laboratories , New Mexico .
Also on display is a statement from General Eisenhower , who was then supreme Military Commander , which is found in number of books about Eisenhower , and which can be found on p.426 , Eisenhower by Stephen E. Ambrose , Simon & Shuster , NY , 1983 .
" Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson first told Eisenhower of the bomb 's existence .
Eisenhower was engulfed by " a feeling of depression ' .
When Stimson said the United States proposed to use the bomb against Japan , Eisenhower voiced 'my grave misgivings , first on the basis of my belief that Japan was already defeated and that dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary , and secondly because I thought that our country should avoid shocking world opinion by the use ( of atomic weapons ) . '
Stimson was upset by Eisenhower 's attitude ' almost angrily refuting the reasons I gave for my quick conclusion ' .
Three days later , Eisenhower flew to Berlin , where he met with Truman and his principal advisors .
Again Eisenhower recommended against using the bomb , and again was ignored .
Other books on Eisenhower state that he endangered his career by his protests against the bomb , which the conspirators in the highest level of the United States government had already sworn to use against Japan , regardless of any military developments .
Eisenhower could not have known that Stimson was a prominent member of Skull and Bones at Yale , the Brotherhood of Death , founded by the Russell Trust in 1848 as a bunch of the German Illuminati , or that they had played prominent roles in organizing wars and revolutions since that time .
Nor could he have known that President Truman had only had one job in his career , as a Masonic organizer for the State of Missouri , and that the lodges he built up later sent him to the United States Senate and then to the presidency .
ATOMIC TERRORISM
The man who set all this in motion was Albert Einstein , who left Europe and came to the United States in October 1933 .
His wife said that he " regarded human beings with detestation " .
He had previously corresponded with Sigmund Freud about his projects of " peace " and " disarmament " , although Freud later said he did not believe that Einstein ever accepted any of his theories .
Einstein had a personal interest in Freud 's work because his son Eduard spent his life in mental institutions , undergoing both insulin therapy and electroshock treatment , none of which produced any change in his condition .
When Einstien arrived in the United States , he was feted as a famous scientist , and was invited to the White House by President and Mrs. Roosevelt .
He was soon deeply involved with Eleanor Roosevelt in her many leftwing causes , in which Einstein heartily concurred .
Some of Einstein 's biographers hail the modern era as " the Einstein Revolution " and " the Age of Einstein " , possibly because he set in motion the program of nuclear fission in the United States .
His letter to Roosevelt requesting that the government inaugurate an atomic bomb program was obviously stirred by his lifelong commitment to " peace and disarmament " .
His actual commitment was to Zionism ; Ronald W. Clark mentions in Einstein ; His Life And Times , Avon , 1971 , p.377 , " He would campaign with the Zionists for a Jewish homeland in Palestine . "
On p.460 , Clark quotes Einstein , " As a Jew I am from today a supporter of the Jewish Zionist efforts . " ( 1919 ) Einstein 's letter to Roosevelt , dated august 2 , 1939 , was delivered personally to President Roosevelt by Alexander Sachs on October 11 .
Why did Einstein enlist an intermediary to bring this letter to Roosevelt , with whom he was on friendly terms ?
The atomic bomb program could not be launched without the necessary Wall Street sponsorship .
Sachs , a Russian Jew , listed his profession as " economist " but was actually a bagman for the Rothschilds , who regularly delivered large sums of cash to Roosevelt in the White House .
Sachs was an advisor to Eugene Meyer of the Lazard Freres International Banking House , and also with Lehman Brothers , another well known banker .
Sachs ' delivery of the Einstein letter to the White House let Roosevelt know that the Rothschilds approved of the project and wished him to go full speed ahead .
A UNITED NATIONS PROJECT
In May of 1945 , the architects of postwar strategy , or , as they liked to call themselves , the " Masters of the Universe " , gathered in San Francisco at the plush Palace Hotel to write the Charter for the United Nations .
Several of the principals retired for a private meeting in the exclusive Garden Room .
The head of the United States delegation had called this secret meeting with his top aide , Alger Hiss , representing the president of the United States and the Soviet KGB ; John Foster Dulles , of the Wall Street law firm of Sullivan and Cromwell , whose mentor , William Nelson Cromwell , had been called a " professional revolutionary " on the floor of Congress ; and W. Averill Harriman , plenipotentiary extraordinary , who had spent the last two years in Moscow directing Stalin 's war for survival .
These four men represented the awesome power of the American Republic in world affairs , yet of the four , only Secretary of State Edward Stettinius Jr. , had a position authorized by the Constitution .
Stettinius called the meeting to order to discuss an urgent matter ; the Japanese were already privately suing for peace , which presented a grave crisis .
The atomic bomb would not be ready for several more months .
" We have already lost Germany , " Stettinius said .
" If Japan bows out , we will not have a live population on which to test the bomb . "
" But , Mr. Secretary , " said Alger Hiss , " no one can ignore the terrible power of this weapon . "
" Nevertheless , " said Stettinius , " our entire postwar program depends on terrifying the world with the atomic bomb . "
" To accomplish that goal , " said John Foster Dulles , " you will need a very good tally .
I should say a million . "
" Yes , " replied Stettinius , " we are hoping for a million tally in Japan .
But if they surrender , we wo n't have anything . "
" Then you have to keep them in the war until the bomb is ready , " said John Foster Dulles .
" That is no problem .
Unconditional surrender . "
" They wo n't agree to that , " said Stettinius .
" They are sworn to protect the Emperor . "
" Exactly , " said John Foster Dulles .
" Keep Japan in the war another three months , and we can use the bomb on their cities ; we will end this war with the naked fear of all the peoples of the world , who will then bow to our will . "
Edward Stettinius Jr. was the son of a J.P. Morgan partner who had been the world 's largest munitions dealer in the First World War .
He had been named by J.P. Morgan to oversee all purchases of munitions by both France and England in the United States throughout the war .
John Foster Dulles was also an accomplished warmonger .
In 1933 , he and his brother Allen had rushed to Cologne to meet with Adolf Hitler and guaranteed him the funds to maintain the Nazi regime .
The Dulles brothers were representing their clients , Kuhn Loeb Co. , and the Rothschilds .
Alger Hiss was the golden prince of the communist elite in the united States .
When he was chosen as head of the prestigious Carnegie Endowment for International Peace after World War II , his nomination was seconded by John Foster Dulles .
Hiss was later sent to prison for perjury for lying about his exploits as a Soviet espionage agent .
This secret meeting in the Garden Room was actually the first military strategy session of the United Nations , because it was dedicated to its mission of exploding the world 's first atomic weapon on a living population .
It also forecast the entire strategy of the Cold War , which lasted forty - three years , cost American taxpayers five trillion dollars , and accomplished exactly nothing , as it was intended to do .
Thus we see that the New World Order has based its entire strategy on the agony of the hundreds of thousands of civilians burned alive at Hiroshima and Nagasaki , including many thousands of children sitting in their schoolrooms .
These leaders had learned from their master , Josef Stalin , that no one can rule without mass terrorism , which in turn required mass murder .
As Senator Vandenberg , leader of the Republican loyal opposition , was to say ( as quoted in American Heritage magazine , August 1977 ) , " We have got to scare the hell out of " em . "
THE JEWISH HELL - BOMB
The atomic bomb was developed at the Los Alamos Laboratories in New Mexico .
The top secret project was called the Manhattan Project , because its secret director , Bernard Baruch , lived in Manhattan , as did many of the other principals .
Baruch had chosen Maj. Gen. Leslie R. Groves to head the operation .
He had previously built the Pentagon , and had a good reputation among the Washington politicians , who usually came when Baruch beckoned .
The scientific director at Los Alamos was J. Robert Oppenheimer , scion of a prosperous family of clothing merchants .
In Oppenheimer ; the Years Of Risk , by James Kunetka , Prentice Hall , NY , 1982 , Kunetka writes , p. 106 , " Baruch was especially interested in Oppenheimer for the position of senior scientific adviser . "
The project cost an estimated two billion dollars .
No other nation in the world could have afforded to develop such a bomb .
The first successful test of the atomic bomb occurred at the Trinity site , two hundred miles south of Los Alamos at 5:29:45 a.m. on July 16 , 1945 .
Oppenheimer was beside himself at the spectacle .
He shrieked , " I am become Death , the Destroyer of worlds . "
Indeed , this seemed to be the ultimate goal of the Manhattan Project , to destroy the world .
There had been considerable fear among the scientists that the test explosion might indeed set off a chain reaction , which would destroy the entire world .
Oppenheimer 's exultation came from his realization that now his people had attained the ultimate power , through which they could implement their five - thousand - year desire to rule the entire world .
THE BUCK PASSES TO TRUMAN Although Truman liked to take full credit for the decision to drop the atomic bomb on Japan , in fact , he was advised by a prestigious group , The National Defense Research Committee , consisting of George L. Harrison , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York ; Dr. James B. Conant , president of Harvard , who had spent the First World War developing more effective poison gases , and who in 1942 had been commissioned by Winston Churchill to develop an Anthrax bomb to be used on Germany , which would have killed every living thing in Germany .
Conant was unable to perfect the bomb before Germany surrendered , otherwise he would have had another line to add to his resume .
His service on Truman 's Committee which advised him to drop the atomic bomb on Japan , added to his previous record as a chemical warfare professional , allowed me to describe him in papers filed before the United States Court of Claims in 1957 , as " the most notorious war criminal of the Second World War " .
As Gauleiter of Germany after the war , he had ordered the burning of my book , The Federal Reserve Conspiracy , ten thousand copies having been published in Oberammergau , the site of the world - famed Passion Play .
Also on the committee were Dr. Karl Compton , and James F. Byrnes , acting Secretary of State .
For thirty years , Byrnes had been known as Bernard Baruch 's man in Washington .
With his Wall Street profits , Baruch had built the most lavish estate in South Carolina , which he named Hobcaw Barony .
As the wealthiest man in South Carolina , this epitome of the carpet - bagger also controlled the political purse strings .
Now Baruch was in a position to dictate to Truman , through his man Byrnes , that he should drop the atomic bomb on Japan .
LIPMAN SIEW
Despite the fact that the Manhattan Project was the most closely guarded secret of World War II , one man , and one many only , was allowed to observe everything and to know everything about the project .
He was Lipman Siew , a Lithuanian Jew who had come to the United States as a political refugee at the age of seventeen .
He lived in Boston on Lawrence St. , and decided to take the name of William L. Laurence .
At Harvard , he became a close friend of James B. Conant and was tutored by him .
When Laurence went to New York , he was hired by Herbert Bayard Swope , editor of the New York World , who was known as Bernard Baruch 's personal publicity agent .
Baruch owned the World .
In 1930 , Laurence accepted an offer from the New York Times to become its science editor .
He states in Who 's
Who that he " was selected by the heads of the atomic bomb project as sole writer and public relations . "
How one could be a public relations writer for a top secret project was not explained .
Laurence was the only civilian present at the historic explosion of the test bomb on July 16 , 1945 .
Less than a month later , he sat in the copilots seat of the B - 29 on the fateful Nagasaki bombing run .
WILL JAPAN SURRENDER BEFORE THE BOMB IS DROPPED ?
There were still many anxious moments for the conspirators , who planned to launch a new reign of terror throughout the world .
Japan had been suing for peace .
Each day it seemed less likely that she could stay in the war .
On March 9 and 10 , 1945 , 325 B - 29s had burned thirty - five square miles of Tokyo , leaving more than one hundred thousand Japanese dead in the ensuing firestorm .
Of Japan 's 66 biggest cities , 59 had been mostly destroyed .
178 square miles of urban dwellings had been burned , 500,000 died in the fires , and now twenty million Japanese were homeless .
Only four cities had not been destroyed ; Hiroshima , Kokura , Niigata , and Nagasaki .
Their inhabitants had no inkling that they had been saved as target cities for the experimental atomic bomb .
Maj. Gen. Leslie Groves , at Bernard Baruch 's insistence , had demanded that Kyoto be the initial target of the bomb .
Secretary of War Stimson objected , saying that as the ancient capital of Japan , the city of Kyoto had hundreds of historic wooden temples , and no military targets .
The Jews wanted to destroy it precisely because of its great cultural importance to the Japanese people .
THE HORROR OF HIROSHIMA
While the residents of Hiroshima continued to watch the B - 29s fly overhead without dropping bombs on them , they had no inkling of the terrible fate which the scientists had reserved for them .
William Manchester quotes General Douglas MacArtbur in American Caesar , Little Brown , 1978 , p.437 [ quoting : ]
There was another Japan , and MacArthur was one of the few Americans who suspected its existence .
He kept urging the Pentagon and the State Department to be alert for conciliatory gestures .
The General predicted that the break would come from Tokyo , not the Japanese army .
The General was right .
A dovish coalition was forming in the Japanese capital , and it was headed by Hirohito himself , who had concluded in the spring of 1945 that a negotiated peace was the only way to end his nation 's agony .
Beginning in early May , a six - man council of Japanese diplomats explored ways to accommodate the Allies .
The delegates informed top military officials that " our resistance is finished " .
[ End quoting ]
On p.359 , Gar Alperowitz quotes Brig .
Gen. Carter W. Clarke , in charge of preparing the MAGIC summary in 1945 , who stated in a 1959 historical interview , " We brought them down to an abject surrender through the accelerated sinking of their merchant marine and hunger alone , and when we did n't need to do it , and knew we did n't need to do it , we used them as an experiment for two atomic bombs . "
Although President Truman referred to himself as the sole authority in the decision to drop the bomb , in fact he was totally influenced by Bernard Baruch 's man in Washington , James F. Byrnes .
Gar Alperowitz states , p. 196 , " Byrnes spoke with the authority of - personally represented - the president of the United States on all bomb - related matters in the Interim Committee 's deliberations . "
David McCullough , in his laudatory biography of Truman , which was described as " a valentine " , admitted that " Truman did n't know his own Secretary of State , Stettinius .
He had no background in foreign policy , no expert advisors of his own . "
The tragedy of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was that a weak , inexperienced president , completely under the influence of Byrnes and Baruch , allowed himself to be manipulated into perpetrating a terrible massacre .
In the introduction to Hiroshima 's Shadows , we find that " Truman was moving in quite the opposite direction , largely under the influence of Byrnes .
The atom bomb for Byrnes was an instrument of diplomacy - atomic diplomacy . " ( p.ix ) MASS MURDER
On August 6 , 1945 , a uranium bomb 3-235 , 20 kilotons yield , was exploded 1850 feet in the air above Hiroshima , for maximum explosive effect .
It devastated four square miles , and killed 140,000 of the 255,000 inhabitants .
In Hiroshima 's Shadows , we find a statement by a doctor who treated some of the victims ; p.415 , Dr. Shuntaro Hida : " It was strange to us that Hiroshima had never been bombed , despite the fact that B - 29 bombers flew over the city every day .
Only after the war did I come to know that Hiroshima , according to American archives , had been kept untouched in order to preserve it as a target for the use of nuclear weapons .
Perhaps , if the American administration and its military authorities had paid sufficient regard to the terrible nature of the fiery demon which mankind had discovered and yet knew so little about its consequences , the American authorities might never have used such a weapon against the 750,000 Japanese who ultimately became its victims . "
Dr. Hida says that while treating the terribly mangled and burned victims , " My eyes were ready to overflow with tears .
I spoke to myself and bit my lip so that I would not cry .
If I had cried , I would have lost my courage to keep standing and working , treating dying victims of Hiroshima . "
On p.433 , Hiroshima 's Shadows , Kensaburo
Oe declares , " From the instant the atomic bomb exploded , it became the symbol of all human evil ; it was a savagely primitive demon and most modern curse ....
My nightmare stems from a suspicion that a ' certain trust in human strength ' or ' humanism ' flashed across the minds of American intellectuals who decided upon the project that concluded with the dropping of the bomb on Hiroshima . "
In the introduction to Hiroshima 's Shadows , we find that " One of the myths of Hiroshima is that the inhabitants were warned by leaflets that an atomic bomb would be dropped .
The leaflets Leonard Nadler and William P. Jones recall seeing in the Hiroshima Museum in 1960 and 1970 were dropped after the bombing .
This happened because the President 's Interim Committee on the Atomic Bomb decided on May 31 ' that we could not give the Japanese any warning ' .
Furthermore , the decision to drop ' atomic ' leaflets on Japanese cities was not made until August 7 , the day after the Hiroshima bombing .
They were not dropped until August 10 , after Nagasaki had been bombed .
We can say that the residents of Hiroshima received no advance warning about the use of the atomic bomb .
On June 1 , 1945 , a formal and official decision was taken during a meeting of the so - called Interim Committee not to warn the populations of the specific target cities .
James Byrnes and Oppenheimer insisted that the bombs must be used without prior warning . "
" Closely linked to the question of whether a warning of an atomic bomb attack was given to the civilian populations of the target cities is the third ' article of fifth ' that underpins the American legend of Hiroshima ; the belief that Hiroshima and Nagasaki were military targets .
The Headquarters of the Japanese Second army were located in Hiroshima and approximately 20,000 men - of which about half , or 10,000 died in the attack .
In Nagasaki , there were about 150 deaths among military personnel in the city .
Thus , between the two cities , 4.4 % of the total death toll was made up of military personnel .
In short , more than 95 % of the casualties were civilians . "
On p.39 of Hiroshima 's Shadows we find that ( at Hiroshima ) " strictly military damage was insignificant . "
How are we to reconcile this statement with Harry Truman 's vainglorious boast in Off The Record ; the Private Papers of Harry S. Truman Harper , 1980 , p.304 , " In 1945 I had ordered the Atomic Bomb dropped on Japan at two places devoted almost exclusively to war production . "
In fact , many thousands of the Hiroshima casualties were children sitting in their classrooms .
The bomb was dropped because ( p.35 ) " The Manhattan Project 's managers were lobbying to use the atomic bomb .
Byrnes sat in on these meetings .
Maj .
Gen .
Groves seems to have been the author of the claim that the use of the bomb would save a million American lives - - a figure in the realm of fantasy . "
Truman himself variously stated that the use of the use of the atomic bomb saved " a quarter of a million American lives " , a " half - million American lives " , and finally settled on the Gen .
Groves figure of " a million American lives saved . "
Meanwhile ( p.64 ) William L. Laurence , who was writing for the New York Times at full salary while also receiving a full salary from the War Department as the " public relations agent for the atomic bomb " published several stories in the New York Times denying that there had been any radiation effects on the victims of the Hiroshima bombing ( Sept. 5 , 1945 et seq. ) in which he quotes General Groves ' indignant comment , " The Japanese are still continuing their propaganda aimed at creating the impression we won the war unfairly and thus attempting to create sympathy for themselves . " ( p.66 ) " The Legation of Switzerland on August 11 , 1945 forwarded from Tokyo the following memorandum to the State Department ( which sat on it for twenty - five years before finally releasing it ) : ' The Legation of Switzerland has received a communication from the Japanese Government . '
On August 6 , 1945 , American airplanes released on the residential district of the town of Hiroshima , bombs of a new type , killing and injuring in one second a large number of civilians and destroying a great part of the town .
Not only is the city of Hiroshima a provincial town without any protection or special military installations of any kind , but also none of the neighboring regions or towns constitutes a military objective . "
The introduction to Hiroshima 's Shadows concludes that ( p.lxvii ) " The claim that an invasion of the Japanese home islands was necessary without the use of the atomic bombs is untrue .
The claim that an ' atomic warning ' was given to the populace of Hiroshima is untrue .
And the claim that both cities were key military targets is untrue . "
A PILOT'S STORY Corroboration of these statements is found in the remarkable record of Ellsworth Torrey Carrington , " Reflections of a Hiroshima Pilot " , ( p.9 ) " As part of the Hiroshima atomic battle plan my B - 29 ( named Jabbitt III , Captain John Abbott Wilson 's third war plane ) flew the weather observation mission over the secondary target of Kokura on August 6 , 1945 . " ( p. 10 ) " After the first bomb was dropped , the atom bomb command was very fearful that Japan might surrender before we could drop the second bomb , so our people worked around the clock , 24 - hours - a - day to avoid such a misfortune . "
This is , of course , satire on Carrington 's part . ( p. 13 ) " in city after city all over the face of Japan ( except for our cities spared because reserved for atomic holocaust ) they ignited the most terrible firestorms in history with very light losses ( of B - 29s ) .
Sometimes the heat from these firestorms was so intense that later waves of B - 29s were caught by updrafts strong enough to loft them upwards from 4 or 5,000 feet all the way up to 8 or 10,000 feet .
The major told us that the fire - bombing of Japan had proven successful far beyond anything they had imagined possible and that the 20th Air Force was running out of cities to burn .
Already there were no longer ( as of the first week in June 1945 ) any target cities left that were worth the attention of more than 50 B - 29s , and on a big day , we could send up as many as 450 planes ! "
" The totality of the devastation in Japan was extraordinary , and this was matched by the near - totality of Japan 's defencelessness . " ( as of June 1 , 1945 , before the atomic bombs were dropped . ) ( p. 14 ) " The Truman government censored and controlled all the war information that was allowed to reach the public , and of course , Truman had a vested interest in obscuring the truth so as to surreptitiously prolong the war and be politically able to use the atom bomb .
Regarding the second element of the Roosevelt - Truman atomic Cold War strategy of deceiving the public into believing that Japan was still militarily viable in the spring and summer of 1945 , the centerpiece was the terribly expensive and criminally unnecessary campaign against Okinawa .
Carrington quotes Admiral William D. Leahy , p. 245 , I Was There , McGraw Hill : " A large part of the Japanese Navy was already on the bottom of the sea .
The combined Navy surface and air force action even by this time had forced Japan into a position that made her early surrender inevitable .
None of us then knew the potentialities of the atomic bomb , but it was my opinion , and I urged it strongly on the Joint Chiefs , that no major land invasion of the Japanese mainland was necessary to win the war .
The JCS did order the preparation of plans for an invasion , but the invasion itself was never authorized . "
Thus Truman , urged on by General Groves , claims that " a million American lives were saved " by the use of the atomic bomb , when no invasion had ever been authorized , and was not in the cards .
Carrington continues , p. 16 , " The monstrous truth is that the timing of the Okinawa campaign was exclusively related to the early August timetable of the atomic bomb .
J'accuse !
I accuse Presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman of deliberately committing war crimes against the American people for the sole purpose of helping set the stage for the criminally unnecessary use of atomic weapons on Japan . "
Carrington further quotes Admiral Leahy , from I Was There , " It is my opinion that the use of this barbarous weapon at Hiroshima and Nagaski was of no material assistance in our war against Japan .
The Japanese were already defeated and ready to surrender because of the effective sea blockade and the successful bombing with conventional weapons . "
Carrington concludes , p.22 , " Truman 's wanton use of atomic weapons left the American people feeling dramatically less secure after winning World War II than they had ever felt before , and these feelings of insecurity have been exploited by unscrupulous Cold War Machine Politicians ever since . "
As Senator Vandenberg said , " We have to scare the hell out of ' em " in order to browbeat the American people into paying heavy taxes to support the Cold War .
DID THE ATOMIC BOMB WIN THE WAR AGAINST JAPAN ?
Admiral William Leahy also stated in I Was There , " My own feeling is that being the first to use it ( the atomic bomb ) we had adopted an ethical standard common to the Barbarism of the Dark Ages .
I was not taught to make war in that fashion , and wars can not be won by destroying women and children . "
Gar Alperowitz notes , p. 16 , " On May 5 , May 12 and June 7 , the Office of Strategic Services ( our intelligence operation ) , reported Japan was considering capitulation .
Further messages came on May 18 , July 7 , July 13 and July 16 . "
Alperowitz points out , p.36 , " The standing United States demand for ' unconditional surrender ' directly threatened not only the person of the Emperor but such central tenets of Japanese culture as well . "
Alperowitz also quotes General Curtis LeMay , chief of the Air Forces , p.334 , " The war would have been over in two weeks without the Russians entering and without the atomic bomb .
PRESS INQUIRY : You mean that , sir ?
Without the Russians and without the atomic bomb ?
LeMay :
The atomic bomb had nothing to do with the end of the war at all . "
September 29 , 1945 , statement .
THE NAGASAKI BOMB
When the Air Force dropped the atomic bomb on Nagasaki , with William Laurence riding in the co-pilot 's seat of the B - 29 , pretending to be Dr. Strangelove , here again the principal target was a Catholic church .
P.93 , The Fall Of Japan , by William Craig , Dial , NY , 1967 , " the roof and masonry of the Catholic cathedral fell on the kneeling worshippers .
All of them died . "
This church has now been rebuilt , and is a prominent feature of the Nagasaki tour .
After the terror bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , the victorious Allies moved promptly to try Japanese officials for their " war crimes " .
From 1945 - 51 several thousand Japanese military men were found guilty of war crimes by an International Military Tribunal which met in Tokyo from 1946 to 1948 .
Twenty - eight Japanese military and civilian leaders were accused of having engaged in conspiracy to commit atrocities .
The dissenting member of the Tokyo tribunal , Judge Radhabinod of India , dismissed the charge that Japanese leaders had conspired to commit atrocities , stating that a stronger case might be made against the victors , because the decision to use the atomic bomb resulted in indiscriminate murder .
A very popular movie in Japan today is Pride , The Fateful Moment , which shows Prime Minister General Hideki Tojo in a favorable light .
With six others , he was hanged in 1968 as a war criminal .
During his trial , his lawyers stated to the International Tribunal for the Far East , the Asian version of Nuremberg Trials , that Tojo 's war crimes could not begin to approach the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
The prosecutors immediately objected , and censored their statements .
That was the last time there was any official recognition of the atomic bomb massacres in Japan .
Japanese officials have been effectively prevented from taking any stand on this matter because the American military occupation , which officially ended in 1952 with the Treaty with Japan , was quietly continued .
Today , 49,000 American troops are still stationed in Japan , and there is no public discussion of the crimes of Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
AMERICAN MILITARY AUTHORITIES SAY ATOMIC BOMB UNNECESSARY
The most authoritative Air Force unit during World War II was the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey , which selected targets on the basis of need , and which analyzed the results for future missions .
In Hiroshima 's Shadow , the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey report of July 1 , 1946 states , " The Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombs did not defeat Japan , nor by the testimony of the enemy leaders who ended the war did they persuade Japan to accept unconditional surrender .
The Emperor , the lord privy seal , the prime minister , the foreign minister , and the navy minister had decided as early as May 1945 that the war should be ended even if it meant acceptance of defeat on allied terms ....
It is the Survey 's opinion that certainly prior to December 1 , 1945 and in all probability prior to November 1 , 1945 , Japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated . "
Both military , political and religious leaders spoke out against the atomic bombing of Japanese civilians .
The Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America issued a formal statement in March 1946 ( cited by Gar Alperowitz ) : " The surprise bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are morally indefensible .
Both bombings must be judged to have been unnecessary for winning the war .
As the power that first used the atomic bomb under these circumstances , we have sinned grievously against the laws of God and against the people of Japan . " - Commission on the Relation of the Church to the War in the Light of the Christian Faith .
On p.438 , Gar Alperowitz quotes James M. Gillis , editor of Catholic World , " I would call it a crime were it not that the word ' crime ' implies sin , and sin requires a consciousness of guilt .
The action taken by the Untied States government was in defiance of every sentiment and every conviction upon which our civilization is based . "
One of the most vociferous critics of the atomic bombings was David Lawrence , founder and editor of U.S. News and World Report .
He signed a number of stinging editorials , the first on August 17 , 1945 .
" Military necessity will be our constant cry in answer to criticism , but it will never erase from our minds the simple truth , that we , of all civilized nations , though hesitating to use poison gas , did not hesitate to employ the most destructive weapon of all times indiscriminately against men , women and children . "
On October 5 , Lawrence continued his attack , " The United States should be the first to condemn the atomic bomb and apologize for its use against Japan .
Spokesmen for the Army Air Forces said it was n't necessary and that the war had been won already .
Competent testimony exists to prove that Japan was seeking to surrender many weeks before the atomic bomb came . "
On November 23 , Lawrence wrote , " The truth is we are guilty .
Our conscience as a nation must trouble us .
We must confess our sin .
We have used a horrible weapon to asphyxiate and cremate more than 100,000 men , women and children in a sort of super - lethal gas chamber - and all this in a war already won or which spokesman for our Air Forces tell us we could have readily won without the atomic bomb .
We ought , therefore , to apologize in unequivocal terms at once to the whole world for our misuse of the atomic bomb . "
David Lawrence was an avowed conservative , a successful businessman , who knew eleven presidents of the United States intimately , and was awarded the Medal of Freedom by President Richard M. Nixon , April 22 , 1970 .
ANOTHER EISENHOWER SPEAKS
Although Eisenhower never changed his opinion of the use of the atomic bomb , during his presidency he repeatedly voiced his opinion , as quoted by Steve Neal , The Eisenhowers Doubleday , 1978 .
P.225 , " Ike would never lose his scepticism of the weapon and later referred to it as a ' hellish contrivance ' . "
His brother , Milton Eisenhower , a prominent educator , was even more vocal on this subject .
As quoted by Gar Alperwitz , p.358 , Milton Eisenhower said , " Our employment of this new force at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was a supreme provocation to other nations , especially the Soviet Union .
Moreover , its use violated the normal standards of warfare by wiping out entire populations , mostly civilians , in the target cities .
Certainly what happened at Hiroshima and Nagasaki will forever be on the conscience of the American people . "
During his Presidency , Dwight Eisenhower tried to find peaceful uses for atomic energy .
In The Eisenhower Diaries , p.261 , we find that " The phrase ' atoms for peace ' entered the lexicon of international affairs with a speech by Eisenhower before the United Nations December 8 , 1953 . "
Control of atomic energy had now given the New World Order clique enormous power , and Eisenhower , in his farewell speech to the American people on leaving the Presidency In Review ( Doubleday , 1969 ) , on January 17 , 1961 , warned , " In the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence , whether sought or unsought , by the miliary - industrial complex .
The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist . "
By failing to name the power behind the military - industrial complex , the international bankers , Eisenhower left the American people in the dark as to he was actually warning them against .
To this day they do not understand what he was trying to say , that the international bankers , the Zionists and the Freemasons had formed an unholy alliance whose money and power could not be overcome by righteous citizens of the United States .
MACARTHUR'S WARNING General Douglas MacArthur also tried to warn the American people of this threat , as quoted in American Ceaser , by William Manchester , Little Brown , 1978 , p.692 , " In 1957 , he lashed out at large Pentagon budgets .
' Our government has kept us in a perpetual state of fear - kept us in a continuous stampede of patriotic fervor - with the cry of grave national emergency .
Always there has been some terrible evil to gobble us up if we did not blindly rally behind it by furnishing the exorbitant funds demanded .
Yet , in retrospect , these disasters seem never to have happened , seem never to have been quite real . "
This was the restatement of Senator Vandenberg 's famous comment , " We have to scare the hell out of 'em . "
THE NEW ATOMIC AGE
The scientists who had built the atomic bomb were gleeful when they received the news of its success at Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
In the book , Robert Oppenheimer , Dark Prince , by Jack Rummel , 1992 , we find , p.96 , " Back in the United States the news of the bombing of Hiroshima was greeted with a mixture of relief , pride , joy , shock and sadness .
Otto Frisch remembers the shouts of joy , ' Hiroshima has been destroyed ! '
' Many of my friends were rushing to the telephone to book tables at the La Fonda Hotel in Santa Fe in order to celebrate .
Oppenheimer walked around " like a prizefighter , clasping his hands together above his head as he came to the podium " . ' "
Oppenheimer had been a lifelong Communist .
" He was heavily influenced by Soviet Communism " : A New Civilization , by Sidney and Beatrice Webb , the founders of Fabian Socialism in England .
He became director of research at the newly formed U.S. Atomic Energy Commission , with his mentor , Bernard Baruch , serving as chairman .
Oppenheimer continued his many Communist Party Associations ; his wife was Kitty Peuning , widow of Joe Dallet , an American Communist who had been killed defending Communism with the notorious Lincoln Brigade in Spain .
Because Oppenheimer was under Party discipline , the Party then ordered him to marry Kitty Peuning and make a home for her .
Baruch resigned from the Atomic Energy Commission to attend to his business interests .
He was replaced by Lewis Lichtenstein Strauss , of Kuhn , Loeb Co. Strauss was apprised of Oppenheimer 's many Communist associations , but he decided to overlook them until he found that Oppenheimer was sabotaging progress on developing the new and much more destructive hydrogen bomb .
It seemed apparent that Oppenheimer was delaying the hydrogen bomb until the Soviet Union could get its own version on line .
Furious at the betrayal , he asked Oppenheimer to resign as director of the Commission .
Oppenheimer refused .
Strauss then ordered that he be tried .
A hearing was held from April 5 to May 6 , 1954 .
After reviewing the results , the Atomic Energy Commission voted to strip Oppenheimer of his security clearance , ruling that he " possessed substantial defects of character and imprudent dangerous associations with known subversives " .
Oppenheimer retired to Princeton , where his mentor , Albert Einstein , presided over the Institute for Advanced Study , a think tank for refugee " geniuses " , financed by the Rothschilds through one of their many secret foundations .
Oppenheimer was already a trustee of the Institute , were he remained until his death in 1966 .
THE REBIRTH OF ISRAEL Einstein considered the atomic age merely as a stage for the rebirth of Israel .
On p.760 of Einstein ; His Life And Times we find that Abba Eban , the Israeli Ambassador , came to his home with the Israeli consul , Reuben Dafni .
He later wrote , " Professor Einstein told me that he saw the rebirth of Israel as one of the few political acts in his lifetime which had an essential moral quality .
He believed that the conscience of the world should , therefore , be involved in Israel 's preservation . " by Ronald W. Clarke , Avon Books 1971 .
On March 1 , 1946 , Army Air Force Contract No. MX - 791 was signed , creating the RAND Corporation as an official think tank , defining Project RAND as " a continuing program of scientific study and research on the broad subject of air warfare with the object of recommending to the Air Force preferred methods of techniques and instrumentalities for this purpose . "
On May 14 , 1948 , RAND Corporation funding was taken over by H. Rowan Gaither , head of the Ford Foundation .
This was done because the Air Force had sole control of the atomic bomb , RAND Corp. developed the Air Force and atomic bomb program for the Cold War , with the Strategic Air Command , the missile program , and many other elements of the " terror strategy " .
It became a billion dollar game for these scientists , with John von Neumann , their leading scientist , becoming world famous as the inventor of " game theory " , in which the United States and the Soviet Union engaged in a worldwide " game " to see which would be the first to attack the other with nuclear missiles .
In the United States , the schools held daily bomb drills , with the children hiding under their desks .
No one told them that thousands of schools children in Hiroshima had been incinerated in their classrooms ; the desks offered no protection against nuclear weapons .
The moral effect on the children was devastating .
If they were to be vaporized in the next ten seconds , there seemed little reason to study , marry and have children , or prepare for a steady job .
This demoralization through the nuclear weapons program is the undisclosed reason for the decline in public morality .
In 1987 , Phyllis LaFarge published The Strangelove Legacy , The Impact Of The Nuclear Threat On Children , chronicling through extended research the moral devastation wreaked on the children by the daily threat of annihilation .
She quotes Freeman Dyson , who stated the world has been divided into two worlds , the world of the warriors , and the world of the victims , the children .
It was William L. Laurence , sitting in the co-pilot 's seat of a B - 29 over Nagasaki , and the children waiting to be vaporized below .
This situation has not changed .
THE LEGAL ASPECTS OF NUCLEAR WARFARE Because Japan was occupied by the U.S. Military in 1945 , the Japanese Government was never allowed any opportunity to file any legal charges about the use of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
Although Japanese leaders were tried and executed for " war crimes " no one was ever charged for the atomic bombings .
It was not until 1996 that the World Court delivered an opinion on the use of nuclear weapons , ( p.565 , Hiroshima 's Shadows )
" In July 1996 , the World court took a stand in its first formal opinion on the legality of nuclear weapons .
Two years earlier , the United Nations had asked the Court for an advisory opinion .
The General Assembly of the United Nations posed a single , yet profoundly basic , question for consideration .
It the threat of use of nuclear weapons on any circumstances permitted under international law ?
For the first time , the world 's pre-eminent judicial authority has considered the question of criminality vis-a - vis the use of a nuclear weapon , and , in doing so , it has come to the conclusion that the use of a nuclear weapon is ' unlawful ' .
It is also the Court 's view that even the threat of the use of a nuclear weapon is illegal .
Although there were differences concerning the implications of the right of self - defense provided by Article 51 of the U.N.
Charter , ten of the fourteen judges hearing the case found the use of threat to use a nuclear weapon to be illegal on the basis of the existing canon of humanitarian law which governs the conduct of armed conflict .
The judges based their opinion on more than a century of treatise and conventions that are collectively known as the ' Hague ' and ' Geneva ' laws . "
Thus the Court ruled that nuclear weapons are illegal under the Hague and Geneva conventions , agreements which were in existence at the time of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings .
They were illegal then , and they are illegal now .
GANDHI SPEAKS
Among world leaders who spoke out about the United States ' use of atomic weapons in Japan , Mahatma Gandhi echoed the general climate of opinion .
P.258 , Hiroshima's Shadow : " The atomic bomb has deadened the finest feelings which have sustained mankind for ages .
There used to be so - called laws of war which made it tolerable .
Now we understand the naked truth .
War knows no law except that of might .
The atomic bomb brought an empty victory to the Allied armies .
It has resulted for the time being in the soul of Japan being destroyed .
What has happened to the soul of the destroying nation is yet too early to see .
Truth needs to be repeated as long as there are men who do not believe it . "

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday strongly limited the power of the Bush administration to conduct military tribunals for suspected terrorists imprisoned at the U.S. Navy base in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
The 5 - 3 ruling means officials will have to come up with a new policy to prosecute at least 10 so - called " enemy combatants " awaiting trial .
It does not address the government 's right to detain suspects .
The case was a major test of President Bush 's authority as commander in chief during war .
Bush has aggressively asserted the power of the government to capture , detain and prosecute suspected terrorists in the wake of the attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
( Watch analyst say administration has to start over -- 3:50 )
At the center of the dispute was a Yemeni man , Salim Ahmed Hamdan , captured in Afghanistan in 2001 shortly after the 9/11 attacks .
Officials said he has admitted being a personal assistant , bodyguard and driver to al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden .
" The military commission at issue is not expressly authorized by any congressional act , " said Justice John Paul Stevens , writing for the majority .
The tribunals , he said , " must be understood to incorporate at least the barest of those trial protections that have been recognized by customary international law . "
" In undertaking to try Hamdan and subject him to criminal punishment , the executive [ Bush ] is bound to comply with the rule of law that prevails in this jurisdiction , " Stevens wrote .
" Congress has not issued the executive a ' blank check , ' " Justice Stephen Breyer wrote in a concurring opinion .
" Indeed , Congress has denied the president the legislative authority to create military commissions of the kind at issue here . "
Breyer noted , however , that " nothing prevents the president from returning to Congress to seek the authority he believes necessary . "
The other justices in the majority were Ruth Bader Ginsburg , David Souter and Anthony Kennedy .
" To the extent there is latitude to work with the Congress to determine whether or not the military tribunals will be an avenue in which to give people their day in court , we will do so , " Bush said at a news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi .
( More reaction )
The ruling means the Bush administration will have to adopt a military commission system for trying accused terrorists that meets international standards .
The court 's ruling also establishes that federal courts have jurisdiction to hear appeals involving " enemy combatants " held overseas in U.S. military custody .
The Bush administration had argued they lacked it .
Late last year , Congress passed and Bush signed the Detainee Treatment Act , which ostensibly limited court intervention over the prisoner issue .
Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist said Thursday afternoon he would introduce legislation after the Fourth of July break that would authorize military tribunals .
" To keep America safe in the war on terror , I believe we should try terrorists only before military commissions , not in our civilian courts , " said the Tennessee Republican .
Dissenting in the ruling were justices Antonin Scalia , Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito , each of whom entered separate opinions .
Scalia called the court 's reasoning a " mess , " and Thomas wrote that the ruling would " sorely hamper the president 's ability to confront and defeat a new and deadly enemy . "
" The president 's decision to try Hamdan before a military commission for his involvement with al Qaeda is entitled to a heavy measure of deference , " Thomas said .
" It seems clear that the commissions at issue here meet the standard " established by the government to try the accused terrorists , Alito wrote .
Chief Justice John Roberts did not vote , recusing himself because he ruled on the case at the appellate level .
Hamdan 's lawyers argued that Bush exceeded his authority by setting up military commissions to try terrorist suspects , whom the administration terms " enemy combatants , " rather than prisoners of war .
( Watch military lawyer defend terror suspect -- 2:18 )
They also argued that the government 's charge of conspiracy against Hamdan is not allowed under international standards of law for prisoners of war , and that earlier federal courts had rejected that standard as well , since it was too broadly defined .
The administration 's position was that the term means detainees do not have the rights usually afforded prisoners of war , as outlined in the Geneva Conventions .
The enemy combatant designation , according to the Bush administration , means the suspect can be held without charges in a military prison without the protections of the U.S. criminal justice system , such as the right to counsel -- a status the court rejected .
The Guantanamo Bay facility opened in 2002 and holds about 460 men suspected of links to al Qaeda and the Taliban .
Many world leaders have pressured Bush to close the camp , and he said last week he was considering doing so , noting he would decide after the court ruled .
" I 'd like to end Gitmo , like it to be over with , " he said at a European Union summit in Vienna .
" One of the things we will do is that we will send people back to their home countries .
We have about 400 people left ; 200 have been sent back .
There are some who need to be tried in U.S. courts , " Bush said .
" They are cold - blooded killers .
They will murder somebody if they are let out on the street .
And yet we believe there ought to be a way forward in the court of law . "
Most of the prisoners were captured in Afghanistan , where U.S. troops are still battling remnants of the Taliban , the Islamic movement that harbored al Qaeda when it ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001 .
