Obama 's Plan to Reduce Foreign Oil Dependence
June 5th , 2008 by Sarah Lozanova
As Americans spend $ 41 million in foreign oil an hour and are left broke at the pump , what plan does Obama have to solve this problem ?
Oil is destined to be a heated issue in this upcoming presidential election and Barack Obama ’s opposition to the gas tax “ holiday ” has already been a hot topic .
Obama has made it clear that national energy policy needs to be taken in a new direction .
“ We send a billion dollars to foreign nations every single day and we are melting the polar ice caps in the bargain , ” said Obama .
“ That has to change . ”
Here are some of the key elements of Obama ’s energy plan :
Fuel Economy Standards
Doubling fuel economy standards within the next 18 years is a priority to Obama .
Research in engines and advanced lightweight materials will help meet this goal .
He also wants to assist auto makers in increasing fuel economy standards through loan guarantees and tax credits for domestic auto manufacturers .
“ We are going to raise fuel efficiency standards on cars because that is the only way that we can actually lower gas prices over the long - term and I know you need that , ” said Obama .
Next Generation Biofuels
Obama ’s goal is to have two billion gallons of cellulosic ethanol in use by 2013 .
He plans to use tax incentives , government contracts and cash prizes to help this industry mature and specifically wants to encourage farmer - owned refineries .
He would like renewable fuel standards to increase , such that 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels are in the fuel supply by 2030 .
A National Low Carbon Fuel Standard is a mechanism that Obama plans to use that requires fuel suppliers to decrease carbon emissions from fuels by 10 % by 2020 and he specifically wants to encourage non-petroleum fuels to reach this target .
“ The only way we are going to seriously reduce the price of gas is if we actually start investing in alternative fuels and we raise fuel standards on cars , ” said Obama .
Renewable Energy
By 2025 , Obama would like 25 % of U.S. electricity to be generated from clean , renewable sources including wind , solar and geothermal with a Renewable Portfolio Standard .
Obama calls for $ 150 billion to be invested over 10 years in clean energy and infrastructure to support it .
Investment in a national digital electric grid would allow greater amounts of renewable energy to be utilized and make plug - in hybrids more environmentally sound .
“ For the sake of our security , our economy , our jobs and our planet , the age of oil must end in our time , ” said Obama .

Marathon talks in Geneva aimed at liberalising global trade have collapsed , the head of the World Trade Organisation has said .
Pascal Lamy confirmed the failure , which officials have blamed on China , India and the US failing to agree on import rules .
EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson said the result was " heartbreaking " .
The talks were launched in 2001 in Doha and were seen as providing a cornerstone for future global trade .
The main stumbling block was farm import rules , which allow countries to protect poor farmers by imposing a tariff on certain goods in the event of a drop in prices or a surge in imports .
India , China and the US could not agree on the tariff threshold for such an event .
Washington said that the " safeguard clause " protecting developing nations from unrestricted imports had been set too low .
Possible solution ?
The negotiations floundered as trade officials gathered for a ninth day .
" There 's no use beating around the bush , this meeting has collapsed , " Mr Lamy said .
" Members have simply not been able to bridge their differences . "
He added that time was needed to determine " if and how " WTO members could end the stalemate .
This is a better outcome for the world 's poorest people than the bad deal on the table

The end of Doha dreams Q&A : Crunch trade talks
The Doha development round of trade talks initially started in 2001 with the aim of remedying inequality so that the developing world could benefit more from freer trade .
However , the talks have repeatedly collapsed as developed countries failed to agree with developing nations on terms of access to each others ' markets .
The US and the European Union want greater access to provide services to fast - growing emerging countries , including China and India .
Meanwhile , developing countries want greater access for their agricultural products in Europe and the US .
Recent complications Analysts have said that the collapse of the Doha talks could symbolise an end to multilateral trade agreements .

The talks in Geneva were complicated by recent increases in the price of food and fuel .
Higher prices have prompted protests in both developed and developing nations , making it harder for negotiators to reach a compromise on opening up their markets to greater competition , analysts said .
Mr Mandelson , the EU trade commissioner , blamed the collapse on a " collective failure " but warned that the " consequences would not be equal " , predicting that it would be countries that most needed help that would be hit hardest .
" They [ the consequences ] will fall disproportionately on those who are most vulnerable in the global economy , those who needed the chances , the opportunities most from a successful trade round . " he said .
' Protecting livelihoods '
Trade officials had struck an optimistic tone on Friday , but this evaporated over the weekend amid acrimonious exchanges with the US accusing India and China of blocking progress .
The US said they were being overly protective towards their own farmers and are failing to do enough to open their markets , with US trade representative Susan Schwab calling the stance " blatant protectionism " .
" In the face of the global food price crisis , it is ironic that the debate came down to how much and how fast could nations raise their barriers to imports of food , " she said .
But India 's trade minister , Kamal Nath , who had been criticised by a number of countries for his intransigence said the US demands were unreasonable .
" It 's unfortunate in a development round we could n't run the last mile because of an issue concerning livelihood security , " Mr Nath said .

Mr Icahn has a history of waging corporate battles
The billionaire investor Carl Icahn has launched a battle to topple the Yahoo board and replace its 10 members with his own slate of directors .
Mr Icahn said in a letter to Yahoo that it was clear the board had acted " irrationally " in its dealings with Microsoft , which tried to buy it .
Shareholders will now get the choice between the two boards at the annual meeting on 3 July .
Mr Icahn wants to buy an additional $ 2.5 bn worth of Yahoo shares .
' Unconscionable '
The manoeuvre follows much anger and criticism over Yahoo's decision , led by co-founder and chief executive Jerry Yang , to turn down Microsoft 's $ 47.5 bn ( £ 24.4 bn ) offer to buy the company .
Yahoo had wanted Microsoft to increase its bid of $ 33 a share to $ 37 a share .
Mr Icahn said it was " unconscionable " that the firm had not put the decision to shareholders , saying the offer was a 72 % premium to the value of Yahoo shares before the bid was tabled .
" I and many of your shareholders strongly believe that a combination between Yahoo and Microsoft would form a dynamic company and more importantly would be a force strong enough to compete with Google on the Internet , " Mr Icahn said .
Microsoft has already said that , contrary to rumours of it possibly making another move later in the year , talks with Yahoo are over .
Mr Icahn has reportedly already spent more than $ 1bn to buy about 50 million Yahoo shares - a 3.6 % stake - allowing him to increase the pressure on Yahoo's board .

The moment a mother loses a desperate battle to save her duckling from the jaws of a heron
As a duck , trying to battle with a heron and force it to give up its quarry was always going to be a difficult task .
But as a mother , animals and humans will do anything for their offspring which is why this bird refused to let the heron fly off with one of her own without a fight .
These amazing pictures show , frame by frame , how the heron swooped on the duck and her family as they swam near Bray Harbour in County Wicklow .
Hovering :
The heron spots her target and hones in for the kill
Escape :
The mother duck frantically tries to lead her offspring to safety
Trapped :
The duckling has no chance and is caught in the heron's bill
Chaos :
The heron stands tall as the family of ducks are left flailing in the water
Stare :
The heron and the duck lock eyes as it holds the duckling aloft
Distraction :
The mother duck attempts to stop the heron flying away
Desperate :
She tries to fly off in pursuit
The heron , believed to be local to the seaside town 20 km south of Dublin , plucked the duckling from the water but as it took flight , the mother duck set off in pursuit .
Unfortunately , her mission ended in tragedy when the predator ate up the bird whole before her very eyes .
Quick meal :
With one gulp , the duckling is gone
Herons , which are wading birds , usually eat mainly fish or frogs and only occasionally bolster their meals with small mammals or birds .
With a wingspan of between 7 to 8ft , they are terrifying to smaller animals and birds when in full flight .
It is also an exceptionally patient creature that can stand still for long periods , stalking their prey before striking with their formidable speak - like bills .
There are 14,200 nests of herons in the UK but they are usually solitary birds , or sometimes found in pairs .
They feed along the edge of wetlands or by the coast .
Click to viewA few days ago , the Weird Universe blog dug up a 1993 report on a UFO abduction survey , investigated by sociology professor Ted Goertzel at Rutgers University .
The report was checking into a previous study 's claim that 3.7 million Americans were suffering from " UFO abduction syndrome . "
While the Goertzel report largely debunked the idea that millions of Americans are actual abductees , you might still be in some danger — especially if you live in South Jersey .

Goertzel 's study first reviewed an existing UFO abduction survey , which asked about five major experiences that could indicate a possible abduction :
1 . " Waking up paralyzed with a sense of a strange person or presence or something else in the room . "
2 . " Experiencing a period of time of an hour or more , in which you were apparently lost , but you could not remember why or where you had been . "
3 . " Feeling that you were actually flying through the air although you did n't know why or how . "
4 . " Seeing unusual lights or balls of light in a room without knowing what was causing them . "
5 . " Finding puzzling scars on your body and neither you nor anyone else remembering how you received them or where you got them . "

Survey respondents would qualify as " abductees " if they recognized four out of five of those experiences .
Goertzel published percentages of those respondents , both nationally and locally in South Jersey :
It turns out people in South Jersey are 1.7 times more likely to be " abductees . "
This early study may have been flawed , however — Goertzel and his team refined it , adding several more questions , with the goal of getting deeper and more detailed information on those Americans who apparently were former abductees .
When they did , they found some ambiguity .
In this case , there are at least two alternative theories which can explain why the measure is internally consistent .
One is that the respondents are consistently reporting on similar experiences as UFO abductees .
The other is that the individuals who score high on the scale share a psychological tendency to have false memories .
Flournoy ( 1911 ) referred to this phenomenon as cryptomnesia .
Psychologist Robert Baker ( 1992 : 78 ) states that this phenomenon of " seeing complex visual images in one 's head that you cannot remember ever having seen before or ... suddenly hearing voices from unknown and unrecollected sources is not only a much more common occurrence than is generally known but is also one of the more interesting and intriguing anomalies in the field of ' normal ' human behavior . "
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
To investigate the cryptomnesia phenomenon , Goertzel mapped out the correlation between the various survey responses and the reports of unusual personal experiences .
People who believe that high government officials were involved in the Kennedy assassination , for example , had a 21 % correlation with those supposed " abductees . "
There was a 20 % correlation between " abductees " and those who think the Air Force is hiding evidence of flying saucers .
But the most overlap occurred with two separate groups of survey respondents :
Those who admitted to feeling that others were conspiring against them , and those who said they enjoyed " reading books about UFOs and other strange phenomena . "
Well , if that 's the case , it looks like quite a few io9 readers might be suffering from cryptomnesia .
So if you find yourself freaking out about that moving white light in your bedroom , just ask yourself :

Dickson Despommier , a professor of public health at Columbia University , hopes to make these zucchini - in - the - sky visions a reality .
Dr. Despommier ’s pet project is the “ vertical farm , ” a concept he created in 1999 with graduate students in his class on medical ecology , the study of how the environment and human health interact .
The idea , which has captured the imagination of several architects in the United States and Europe in the past several years , just caught the eye of another big city dreamer : Scott M. Stringer , the Manhattan borough president .

When Mr. Stringer heard about the concept in June , he said he immediately pictured a “ food farm ” addition to the New York City skyline .
“ Obviously we do n’t have vast amounts of vacant land , ” he said in a phone interview .
“ But the sky is the limit in Manhattan . ” Mr. Stringer ’s office is “ sketching out what it would take to pilot a vertical farm , ” and plans to pitch a feasibility study to the mayor ’s office within the next couple of months , he said .
This installment highlights 3 individual sections of the larger compilation : 1 ) a provisional summary table of updated ( or as updated as we have ) EROI figures for various fuels , 2 ) an insightful ( but counterintuitive - I had to read it twice ) analysis on the EROI of imported oil from the perspective of the importing country ( USA ) , and 3 ) an analysis on the EROI of natural gas .

While it is still in draft form , it is hoped ( with some help from TOD readers ) to be refined and directed into the formal peer review literature .
But Professor Hall ( and I ) believe this type of thinking also needs to be considered outside the academy , and increasing the level of energy discourse in our nation is one reason for him choosing to display his draft essays on theoildrum.com .

Introduction
Energy return on investment , sometimes called EROI and sometimes called EROEI , is thought by many , including myself , to be a critical issue for determining the past , present and future status of human society .
It is usually considered in terms of energy return on energy investment , but it can also be considered in terms of energy return on monetary investment .
While much of human progress has been attributed , rightfully , to technology , much of that technology has been a means of using more energy for human ends .
This is true for fire , knife blades and spear points ( energy concentrating devices ) , the development of agriculture and the increase in its productivity and , essentially all aspects of the industrial revolution .
EROI is simply the energy delivered by an energy - obtaining activity compared to the energy required to get it .
If the numerator and denominator are expressed in the same units ( barrels per barrel , MegaJoules per MegaJoule ) the result is a dimensionless ratio , i.e. 100:1 or 10:1 ) .
Obviously a higher ratio implies a more desirable fuel than a lower one , other things being equal ( which is rarely the case ) .
The concept is extremely simple in theory but often very difficult in execution , mostly because society generally maintains its records in monetary rather than energy terms .
Another problem is that the U.S. Government has not supported such studies in a consistent fashion and it is my perception that the quality of some energy records as are kept by e.g. the U.S. Departments of Energy and of Commerce appear to be deteriorating in recent years .
Thus deriving the energy cost of getting energy ( or most other things ) is generally somewhat , and oftentimes exceedingly , difficult .
A second problem is that the usual measure of the quantity of a fuel , its heat value , often does not give a full assessment of that fuel ’s ability to do economic or other work .
Most simply electricity and thermal heat from e.g. coal or oil have a great difference in their ability to do work , such as we are willing to trade three or four heat units of coal or oil in a thermal plant for one thermal unit of higher quality electricity .
Thus if the input and output fuels are of different quality then it is often thought desirable to weight in some way the inputs and the outputs .
A third problem is that it is important to consider boundaries : how large should we draw the boundaries of the energy analysis for the inputs ?
We will consider these issues in far more detail in later publications but there are many reasons why it is important to make summaries of EROI available at this time even though many uncertainties exist in the numbers that we present here , and indeed with any numbers that might be possible to generate .
At this time humans are especially dependent upon oil and natural gas , collectively called petroleum , for they supply about two thirds of the industrial energy both in the US and in the world .
Petroleum is an especially advantageous fuel for human society because of its abundance , energy density and , at least in the past , high EROI .
The concern at this time is twofold : there are many arguments and more than a little data that we may be approaching “ peak oil ” for the world , as has already happened , often long ago , for the United States and some 50 other oil producing nations .
A related issue is that the EROI for oil and gas nationally and globally appears to be declining fairly substantially .
For example , in the US in 1930 the EROI for oil was at least 100 barrels returned for each barrel invested ( i.e. EROI = > 100:1 ) , but declined to about 30:1 in 1970 to from 11 to 18 : 1 in 2000 ( Cleveland et al.
1984 , Hall et al. 1986 , Cleveland 2004 ) .
Similarly , Gagnon et al. ( in preparation ) have estimated that the EROI for global petroleum has been declining steadily in recent years .
Were these trends to continue , and there is little to indicate that they would not , then oil and somewhat later natural gas would be not only less available due to peaking but also much more expensive in terms of society ’s resources , including energy , required to obtain them .
Consequently there is considerable interest , at least amongst those relatively few who think about it , about what might be the EROI and scalability of alternative fuels .
At the present time the most available ( and promoted ) alternative to oil as a transportation fuel is ethanol made from corn .
EROI has been an important part of the debate about the desirability , or lack thereof , of this fuel ( See e.g .
Farrell et al.
2006 as well as the many responses to that article , including our own , in Science , June 23 2006 ) .
Different estimates of the EROI for corn - based ethanol range from 0.8:1 to 1.6:1 .
The debate has usually focused on whether the EROI is greater or less than one for one , as obviously it would not make sense to invest one Joule of existing oil or gas to generate less than one Joule of alcohol .
( Some arguments have been made that if we would invest one Joule of lower quality fuel such as coal to make one Joule ( or less ) of liquid fuel it would make sense ) .
We will argue in later papers that if proper boundaries are drawn the minimum EROI needed for a fuel to make a real contribution to society , and not be subsidized by petroleum , is not 1.1:1 but closer to 5:1 .
However it is not the issue of this paper to make such arguments but to simply examine what might be the EROIs of various energy sources “ out there ” , as well as consider the potential magnitude and environmental aspects of various fuels .
An additional critical component of the value of a fuel is its magnitude , both in actuality as well as potential .
A fuel may have a very high EROI but be limited in magnitude to less than one percent of e.g. the energy use of the U.S. , as is the case for wind energy now in the U.S.
In addition there are many other criteria that might be used , including , as noted above , magnitude and environmental issues .
Additional considerations might include labor , financial , land use and many other issues .
Some of these can be quantified .
A comprehensive , although controversial approach to quantification is emergy analysis ( e.g. Odum 1998 ) whereas all environmental as well as industrial energies are considered .
Nevertheless it seems obvious that not all issues can be easily quantified , and some important aspects can only be listed .
In the meantime it is important to quantify what we can .
Such quantification can help us to judge various alternatives , eliminate some obvious bad choices and understand how the future may be very different as we continue to exploit and deplete our highest quality fuels .
Methods
Unfortunately there does not exist at this time a large and sophisticated literature on this important problem , primarily because most records kept on energy analysis are monetary - based rather than energy - based , reflecting the obvious and understandable focus of business on the monetary end of things and the basic way that information on our economy is maintained in the US ( and the rest of the world ) .
In addition there is not yet any explicit publication or protocol by which we could agree to undertake EROI analyses , and different analysts use different methods , procedures and , most importantly , boundaries to do their particular analysis .
Finally a given technology may have inherently different EROIs depending upon the location where the analysis is applied .
For example , different dam sites can give enormously different EROIs , and corn grows much more efficiently in Iowa than Maine or New Mexico .
While we await a more explicit protocol ( which we are working on ) the approach used here can only be described as “ hammer and tong ” , that is , using anything that can be possibly brought to bear on the problem .
Our preference is for an explicit “ meta analysis ” using a sophisticated assessment of extensive data reported in reviewed literature .
Unfortunately these conditions are rarely met , so we used whatever information we could find with some comments about the quality of the literature we found .
In addition we have developed new analyses for several fuels .
Some alternative approaches that can be used to calculate EROI include :
1 ) Top down ( National aggregate ) approach :
1a ) National energy / GDP ratio .
The crudest approach is simply to examine the amount of energy used by the entire economy per unit of economic production to give an average amount of energy used per dollar of economic production .
This is obtained easily by dividing the total GDP of the economy in question by the total energy used by that economy .
For example in 2005 the GDP for the United States was 12.456 trillion dollars , and the energy used was 100 quadrillion BTU ’s ( English units ) , equal to 105.5 ExaJoules in Metric units ) .
The quotient is 8.47 ExaJoules per trillion dollars or , in more useful terms , 8.47 MJoules used per dollar of production .
This of course is not especially useful for most applications because different economic activities have different energy intensities .
For example Herendeen ( personal communication ) estimated that in 2005 heavy construction requires about 13 MJoules per dollar of activity , and very heavy industry needs more .
Nevertheless , earlier work by Hannon , Bullard and Herendeen at the University of Illinois showed that because of the extreme interdependency of our economy ( i.e. different sectors purchase considerably from each other ) and the concept that , perhaps , energy is in some sense the ultimate raw material for economic production ( Costanza 1980 ) the difference was not enormous for most final demand except fuel itself .
1b ) Direct energy :
The approach that had been used most commonly in the past was to divide the energy generated by a resource by the energy used to obtain that resource as indicated by national assessments of the total energy used by that sector of the economy ( See e.g. Cleveland et al. 1984 ; Hall et al. 2006 ) .
These are derived in turn by questionnaires sent out every five years by the Department of Commerce to many players in each sector and scaling up the results to the entire industry .
This is sometimes called a “ top down ” approach because it derives the analysis for the entire industry from aggregate data collected on key players in the industry .
Unfortunately this approach cannot be used for many of the alternatives to principal fuels because they are not important enough quantitatively for the Department of Commerce to maintain such data .
This is a very sound way to get minimal estimates of energy used to get energy , although I and others have felt that there has been a degradation in the quality of the data maintained in recent years .
1b + ) Indirect energy :
In addition to the direct energy used to produce a fuel , energy is used off site ( i.e. indirectly ) to generate the materials used by that industry .
These can be derived in various ways , most accurately by using the “ Leontief I - O ” approach adjusted from money flows to energy flows ( e.g. Bullard et al.
1975 , Bullard et al. 1978 , Hannon 1981 ) .
The direct and indirect flows are added to provide a more complete assessment of energy used .
An analysis using much larger boundaries and including the energy used by nature is the emergy approach ( e.g. Odum 1996 ) .
While this method is controversial it is useful in generating an upper bounds for an analysis .
2 ) Summarizing existing literature .
Ideally this would be based on peer reviewed literature published in reputable scientific or economic journals .
This is an important criterion as many such analyses as are “ out there ” are clearly advocacy pieces for or against one fuel or another .
When such analyses are done well and include many studies as well as a consideration of the quality of the methods and results it is often called a “ meta analysis ” .
Unfortunately such quality control is rarely possible .
Thus we rank the analyses presented below as “ literature summaries ” and “ meta analyses ” based on the above criteria .
3 ) A “ bottom up ” approach
This approach scales up information for some hopefully representative part of the industry to the industry as a whole .
In this case an inventory is made of the energy and materials used for an activity and all are converted to energy units ( see energy intensities ) .
4 ) Other approaches
Their use is too rare and too diffuse to summarize .
All of these methods are incomplete for many reasons , because they do not include all of the energies used to create the product or all of the energy loses due to the products ’ production or use .
These include , but are not limited to , the energies required to overcome environmental impacts , to support the labor used and to construct the machines and infrastructure necessary to use the energy .
In addition for non-renewable energies they do not include the energy used to make or replace the energy itself , but rather only that energy used for exploitation .
The inclusion of these additional energies are controversial and complex , and are not used here .
Hence EROI values given ( that are current ) are probably maximums , in some cases substantially so .
The information summarized below was obtained by an intense month - long “ EROI sweatshop ” where about a dozen dedicated and carefully - selected graduate and undergraduate students were directed by Charles Hall to seek whatever information might be available on the magnitude , EROI and environmental impacts of various energy sources .
Disclaimer :
The results given here are preliminary , sometimes perhaps quite crude and subject to revision .
Almost always we did not find enough obviously reliable information such that we could feel really certain about our conclusions .
On the other hand it is our general sense that for most of the analyses presented our numbers are well within the ballpark and are unlikely to change substantially in the future , but we could be wrong about that too .
Subjectively we are least certain about nuclear energy ( because most of the analyses were old , although reinforced by several modern ones ) , coal ( because the analyses are very incomplete ) , hydropower ( because the results are so site - specific ) photovoltaics ( because the technologies are changing so rapidly and the materials supply for major expansion so uncertain ) .
It is also important to remember that our results are based on existing operating technologies and not on some future perceived improvement .
We welcome any additional objective and reliable information that we have overlooked .

RESULTS
We have four main results :
1 ) First there will be almost certainly a continued decline in the EROI of most major fuels , including especially liquid fuels , used in the U.S. economy .
This problem is likely to be as much due to an intensification of effort as to the decline of the resource base itself ( see 3 ) .
The probable decline in EROI includes domestic and especially imported oil and probably natural gas as well .

Arrows connect fuels from various times ( i.e. domestic oil in 1930 , 1970 , 2005 ) , and the size of the “ balloon ” represents part of the uncertainty associated with EROI estimates .
Click to Enlarge .
2 ) Few of the energy sources put forth as alternatives to oil and gas have anything like the quality ( e.g. EROI ) or quantity ( total resource available at a national level ) necessary to in any meaningful way act as replacement fuels for oil and gas .
This is especially true for liquid fuels ( Table 1 and Figure 1 , See also Hall et al. submitted ) .
Greater details are given in Appendices A - G , Hall et al. ( submitted ) and also other work in progress .
Solar , especially photovoltaics , and perhaps nuclear , do have very large potentials but their costs at this time are very high , storage is a huge problem and material costs appear to be escalating rapidly .
It is unclear for nuclear whether there is enough high grade uranium ore for conventional reactors , what the possibility of thorium is , and terrorism may present some additional problems .
Now designs based on e.g. thorium might offer solutions but are only on the drawing boards .
3 ) The EROI benchmark required for any really useful fuel for modern infrastructure has to be substantially higher than unity , 5:1 at a guess .
4 ) Intensification of effort is often counter productive , leading to little or no more resource but an increase in energy used to get the fuel .
Thus market incentives may have a counter productive effect ( e.g. figure 2 ) .

EROI FOR GLOBAL OIL AND GAS
The EROI for oil and gas globally , and it 's slope , are obviously of great concern .
The problem , as usual , is in the data available : while it is straightforward to convert global oil and gas production figures ( from EIA , BP and so on ) into energy units , most of the cost data is in monetary units , and even that data is limited .
Fortunately we have been able to work closely with personnel at John S. Herold Inc. which is a repository for financial data on “ upstream ” ( i.e. pre sales ) of oil and gas for publicly traded companies .
We have derived energy intensities ( i.e. energy used per dollar spent ) for a number of countries and used this to convert the dollar - based Herold data into EROI estimates .
The details are in a separate paper by Nate Gagnon and Charles Hall which is being prepared for submission to a journal and which is not publicly available at this time .
Our preliminary estimates are that the EROI for global oil and gas has declined steadily from roughly 35:1 in 1999 .
Details will be available when the paper is in press , which we hope is soon .

CRUDE AND REFINED OIL IMPORTED TO THE UNITED STATES
Palcher , Sarah , Mike C. Herweyer and Charles Hall
Definition
The Energy Information Administration defines crude oil as “ a mixture of hydrocarbons that exist in liquid phase in natural underground reservoirs and remains liquid at atmospheric pressure after passing through surface separating facilities . ”
They define imported crude oil as “ Receipts of crude oil into the 50 states and the District of Columbia from foreign countries , Puerto Rico , the Virgin Islands and other US possessions and territories . ”
The definition is probably increasingly inadequate because the United States imports an increasing proportion of refined oil and the total imported oil , both crude and refined , is normally what is considered .
This oil can come from many parts of the world but Canada , Mexico , Venezuela , the Middle East and North and West Africa have been traditionally the major suppliers .
The term “ imported oil ” thus refers to all oil no matter where it came from or no matter the precise form .
History
Before World War
I the demand for oil was reasonably constant and few or no shortages occurred within the U.S. During World War I , however , the importance of oil for military operations and of controlling domestic oil demand came to be realized .
It was the first realization that humanity was becoming dependent on oil resources , although after the war that concept was rapidly forgotten .
In the 1950s the various oil exporting countries realized that oil production could be regulated in order to regulate prices throughout the world .
In 1960 OPEC ( The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ) was formed with originally five founding members , Iran , Iraq , Kuwait , Saudi Arabia , and Venezuela .
By the end of 1971 Qatar , Indonesia , Libya , United Arab Emirates , Algeria , and Nigeria had joined the organization ( WTRG economics , 2006 ) .
OPEC was a very important actor in the “ energy crisis ” of the 1970s .
Most people today view the two oil crises as one , but there were actually two separate “ crises ” with at least two separate causes .
The first real “ oil crisis ” was in 1973 and was caused by the Yom Kippur War .
On October 6th 1973 – on the Jewish holiday “ Yom Kippur ” - Egypt and Syrian troops invaded Israel following long standing altercations amongst the participants .
The troops of Egypt and Syria were supported by the Arabic world , and those of Israel were supported by the US .
In response to the support of Israel the OAPEC ( the Arabic part of OPEC ) declared an oil embargo at October 20th against the US , the Netherlands and other states helping Israel .
This was the beginning of the 1973 energy crisis when the oil prices tripled .
The issue was exacerbated by a main pipeline in the Middle East being ruptured by a bulldozer .
The second oil crisis occurred in 1979 when the Iranian Revolution started as Iranians rebelled against the Shaw of Iran ( who had been installed by US intervention some decades earlier ) .
During this period the oil prices ( corrected for inflation ) rose to the highest levels ever seen in the U.S .
The total increase over 7 years was a factor of ten , from $ 3.50 a barrel to $ 35 .
Figure 1 : history of crude oil prices , in 2006 US dollars , with some main influences from political events ( source : WTRG Economics ) .
The price has increased subsequently to as much as $ 100 a barrel .
The US had imported small amounts of oil since the beginning of the 20th century , but after a peak in the domestic oil production in the beginning of the 70s , imports increased rapidly .
The dependency on ever more expensive imported crude oil resources was a very new phenomenon for Americans and was evidenced by economic stagnation , inflation , long lines to purchase gasoline and a reduction in National confidence .
But in time the US started to import less oil even though domestic production continued to decline .
This was due mainly to a reduction in demand and hence price as companies and municipalities had made large investments into making plants , buildings , and equipment more energy efficient , and also the shift in electricity production from oil more towards coal and gas .
Around 1986 , the price of oil dropped sharply .
A surplus in supply relative to demand occurred and continued until about 2000 .
The effects of these and other events can be seen in Figure 1 .
From the mid 1980s until the end of 2001 the oil supplies became more secure , the US oil demand grew steadily , but the domestic crude oil production continued to decline .
In reaction the US started to again import more and more crude oil to satisfy the demand , and in 2005 about 60 percent of the US crude oil supply was imported .
These oil imports cost as of 2007 was about 250 billion dollars a year , much of it paid for through debt , so that with interest the cost will in the future be larger .
Figure 2 shows the historical pattern of imports of crude oil to the US .
Figure 2 . US dependence on imported petroleum , 1960 - 2005 ( Source : EIA , monthly energy review , Sept 2006 )
According to the EIA ( The US Energy Information Agency , Annual energy review 2005 ) ) about 52 % of the total US petroleum consumption in 1950 was in the transport sector .
In 2005 it was 68 % .
Thus today more than two thirds of the total petroleum products consumed in the US is used by the transport industry .
Since there is no ready substitute for this petroleum on the scale required this is the most vulnerable aspect of the US energy situation .
Resource base
The crude oil resources which can be found outside the US are still large , although “ large ” depends on the definition and who is doing the analysis .
The world has consumed about one trillion barrels as of 2006 , which can serve as a benchmark .
There are probably at least 3 to 5 trillion barrels left in the ground , but the trick is , what proportion of that can be extracted ?
The usual proportion that can be extracted is given as about 35 percent , but there is a huge variation depending upon the specifics of the field ( Deffeyes 2005 ) .
The US Geological Survey undertook a very exhaustive survey in 2000 ( USGS 2000 ) .
They gave a 95 percent confidence ( i.e. very high probability of that much oil being ultimately produced ) of 1.9 trillion barrels , a median ( 50 percent probability ) value of 2.9 trillion barrels , and a high ( 5 percent probability ) value of 4.0 trillion barrels .
These numbers imply that the world has extracted and consumed from about a quarter to about one half of all of the oil it will ever extract .
Much of the variability in those numbers depends upon what proportion of the oil in place can be extracted .
Obviously increasing the proportion extracted usually increases the energy cost of that barrel , but it might make the reserve estimates substantially larger .
According to the Oil and Gas Journal ( Dec 19th , 2005 ) the world ’s proven reserves of oil ( crude oil , natural gas liquids , condensates and non-conventional oil ) amounted to 1.293 trillion barrels .
About 62 % of these reserves are located in the Middle East and North Africa .
Figure 3 shows the top twenty countries with proven oil reserves .
There are two caveats that go with this figure : the first is that there is considerable controversy about the actual size of the reserves of most OPEC nations as there was a suspiciously large jump in reserves of these nations following the 1986 agreement to allow pumpage in proportion to reserves .
Thus as much as a half of the reserves of some nations might be “ political ” vs “ geological ” reserves .
The second is that the majority of the reserves for Canada are “ unconventional ” crude oil resources ( mainly oil sands ) .
While these reserves are large their rate of exploitation is likely to be restricted by the needs for water , natural gas or environmental or social issues .
Given that the United States is the world ’s largest consumer its need to import is obvious .
These estimates represent values with , at least in theory , a very high probability of actually being extracted .
In addition it is likely that an unknown quantity of other oil resources will be found and added to these reserves .
If that number is small and Canada ’s unconventional oil sands are not included then this assessment would not be too different from the USGS ( 2000 ) low value .
Thus if the USGS median or high quantities of conventional oil are to be realized a great deal of additional oil must be found , which would require a large change in the finding patterns we have witnessed since about 1970 .
Figure 3 , Top twenty countries proven oil reserves ( at the end of 2005 ) .
Note that Canada includes non-conventional proven reserves .
( Source : Oil and Gas Journal , December 19th , 2005 ) .
The reserves to production ratio indicates the number of years of production at present rates that would exhaust known reserves .
EROI
Methodology
The EROI of imported oil for the US ( from the perspective of the US ) , must be calculated differently from how it is done for most other fuels .
The EROI for actually getting the oil to the surface ( i.e. the oil produced divided by the energy required to get it ) is covered in a forthcoming publication on global oil and gas ( Gagnon and Hall , Appendix A ) and was roughly 35:1 and declining as of 1999 .
But the actual energy cost to the importing nation is not simply the energy cost of recovering the oil from the ground and shipping it across the ocean but rather is the energy that must be used to generate the goods and services that in ( a net sense ) must be traded for that oil , and this depends on the price of a barrel of oil relative to the prices of the goods and services exported to get foreign exchange ( Hall , Cleveland and Kaufmann 1986 , chapter 8 , originally authored by Robert Kaufmann ) .
This methodology can be applied only to an individual country and has little to do with the fundamental EROI of global oil and gas .
In a sense the money we spend to provide our imported oil supports export nation ’s government subsidies ( both as dollars and the energy associated with those expenditures ) to the burgeoning populations and the often opulent life - styles of their leaders .
These supplier nations , of course , gain enormous financial leverage because of the US ’s and the world ’s increased addiction to a resource that most countries can no longer fully supply for themselves , and for which there are no , or certainly no easy , substitutes .
In addition , since almost all US economic transactions are done in terms of dollars and not energy , we are forced to , again , translate economic transactions done in terms of dollars to energy values using energy intensities of economic activities .
( If you are unhappy with this use of energy intensities of economic activity then you must ask the government ( or someone ) to keep a separate set of books based on Joules ! )
The EROI for an imported fuel can change dramatically as the price of oil relative to our exported goods and services increases and decreases due to economic , political , meteorological , psychological and other factors , and the cost to the U.S. recently is far above production costs ( in both dollars and energy ) due , I suppose , mostly to the geography of supply and demand .
As imported oil gets more expensive and diverts more of the total economic activity of importing nations , then , as suggested in our first post , the discretionary money and energy available to the population becomes less .
We have examined these issues in some detail for Costa Rica and other countries , where they may have an even larger impact than in e.g. the U.S .
We exclude from this analysis the interest on the debt with which we increasingly pay for oil — but that would increase the energy cost of the oil assuming the debt is eventually paid .
We derive the EROI in a way similar to other EROI calculations in that we divide the energy of the delivered crude oil by the energy required to obtain it .
However in this case it is the energy used in the general economy to generate enough exported goods and services to pay for that oil .
More specifically , the energy delivered is determined by the energy content of one barrel of imported oil , about 6,164 MegaJoules / barrel , by the energy required to generate the dollar cost of an imported barrel , that is by multiplying the international price of a barrel of oil ( i.e. in nominal dollars ) by the average energy intensity of the US economy ( in MJ / nominal dollar ) for that specific year ( equation 2 ) .
In other words to get the foreign exchange to buy one barrel of crude oil the U.S. needs to generate enough goods and services to be sold abroad to generate the necessary money to buy it .
This methodology calculates the energy cost to the U.S. economy to import the energy contained in crude oil , using monetary values as a transitional stage .
For an example , a farmer has to earn money to buy one gallon of gas so he has to sell some of his or her crop , much of which goes overseas .
To produce the crop he has to do economic work , which is by definition an energy - intensive procedure , usually requiring oil or some other energy source .
So to earn the money to buy his or her fuel he has to invest a certain amount of energy in growing and harvesting the crop .
While the farmer does not pay the supplier in Mexico or Saudi Arabia directly the oil importer must , using in part that farmer ’s purchases .
How much energy we as a nation must invest on average to get the energy embodied in one barrel of crude oil is calculated in formula 1 .
Where : Eboe = Energy content of one barrel of oil equivalent ( 6164 MJ / boe )
Eintensity , y = Energy intensity of the total US economy in year : ( MJ / USD/y )
Pboe =
Price of one barrel of oil equivalent in year : ( USD / boe /y )
Econs =
Total energy consumed in the US in year : ( MJ/y )
GDP = Gross Domestic Product in year : ( USD/y )
This study is based on Kaufmann ’s ( 1986 ) analysis of EROI of imported oil .
Kaufmann calculated the EROI of imported liquid petroleum by calculating the energy needed for sector - specific exports .
However we could not follow the original methodology because much of the data needed is no longer collected by the US government .
Thus we use the average value for the US national economy .
The results of Kaufmann ’s study , however , can be used to validate our results .
Results
Our estimated EROI values for crude oil imported to the US from 1968 until 2005 varies from about 45 to about 5 barrels of oil obtained per barrel invested in the general economy to make goods and services for export .
These values are plotted as a time series in figure 4 along with the price of a barrel of oil in international markets .
The effects of the first and second oil crisis can be seen clearly .
In 1973 - after the first oil crisis started - the imported EROI for oil dropped from 26:1 to 9:1 as the price of a barrel of oil increased relative to the price of our exported goods – assuming that the goods and services we exported were as energy - intensive on average as the society in general .
It cost the US society almost three times more energy ( embodied in money and in the goods and services exported to pay for the oil imported ) to gain the imported energy embodied in a barrel of crude oil than it cost to get domestic oil .
Money lost its ( energetic as well as monetary ) value in terms of buying a barrel of oil .
A second drop in the EROI to about 5:1 can be seen in the beginning of the 1980s .
From 1986 until 2001 the price of a barrel of oil dropped and remained relatively low , while inflation had increased the dollar value of exported goods and services so that the EROI increased to as much as 55:1 .
But starting in about 1998 the price of oil gradually increased again ( and more rapidly than the inflation of goods and services ) and the EROI declined , a trend that appears to be continuing .
The EROI for oil imported to the US declined during this period from 27:1 in 2001 to 15:1 in 2005 .
Given that as of September 2007 the price of a barrel of oil has increased to nearly $ 80 dollars a barrel with ( thus far ) a relatively small increase in general price levels ( about 10 percent ) we might assume that the EROI has continued to decline to perhaps 10 to 12 to one ( and to much less by 2008 ) .
If the price of oil continues to increase rapidly compared to the price of exported goods and services then an increasing and very large proportion of the total output of the U.S. economy will be required to gain imported oil .
Figure 4 : EROI Imported Crude Oil into the US plotted with the crude oil price from 1968 until 2005 , and validated against Kaufmann ’s EROI ( 1986 ) for liquid petroleum .
( Data from U.S. BEA , 2007 ; EIA , 2007 ) .
When the EROI is examined against the total imported crude oil , a clear trend can be seen ( Figure 5 ) .
In 1973 the EROI declined , but the amount of oil imported still increased ( because of the decline in domestic US production , and the slow reaction in crude oil demand ) .
In 1979 the quantity of imported crude oil stabilized and declined until 1985 , because of slowed economic growth , some efficiency improvements , conservation , and especially an increase in the use of other energy sources ( coal , gas , and nuclear energy ) .
The inflation caused by increased oil prices takes a while to work through the economy but eventually makes exported goods more expensive so that in 1986 the EROI went back up to 24:1 .
The EROI remained relatively constant until 2001 but began to decline again .
From 1986 until 2004 the amount of crude oil imported rose steadily even as its relative price increased .
The trend from 2001 until 2005 is similar to what occurred in 1973 / 74 .
In 1973 the oil embargo happened abruptly and the US government was not well prepared .
The EROI decline happened quickly and steeply .
Following 2001 a less steep decline in the EROI occurred .
Currently the US is faced with an increased dependence on imported oil , the same trend as in 1970s , except that now the global peak is on the horizon , so a large increase in imports might not be possible .
With this knowledge we can assume that the EROI ( from the perpective of the US as importer ) will decline in the near future , and after a little increase in the price of crude oil imports they may decline as well .
Figure 5 : EROI plotted against total energy content in imported crude oil from 1968 until 2005 .
( Used data : BEA , 2007 ; EIA , 2007 )
Validation
We compared our results with Kaufmann ’s ( 1986 ) analysis which we read off his graphical output ( Figure 4 ) .
Kaufmann ’s EROI ’s tend to have a very similar pattern to ours but are somewhat lower by from about 5 to 30 percent .
The lower values perhaps can be explained by the differences in research boundaries or by the possible fact that exported goods and services are more energy - intensive than is the case for the general economy .
The United States used to maintain much better energy ( and other ) statistics .
Thus Kaufmann was able to derive sector - specific energy intensities , and multiply these by the weighted value of exported goods and services .
Our values are more aggregated but show very similar trends , although at about a 5 - 30 percent smaller energy intensity than Kaufmann’s .
Thus we can say that our aggregated estimates are reasonably but not perfectly validated by an earlier more detailed study .
There is little we can do to improve on this until if or when the United States decides again to again maintain more comprehensive energy statistics .
In the meantime it is probably safe to say that our analyses are conservative , that is represent a high estimate of the EROI for imported oil .
Environmental impacts
The environmental and social impacts for imported oil to the US include both spillage and routine releases of transported oil ( e.g. Hall et al. 1978 ) but also all of the general impacts associated with the entire US economy , for it is the results of that economic activity that pays for the imports .

NATURAL GAS : POTENTIAL , EROI AND SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS .

INTRODUCTION
Definition : “ A mixture of hydrocarbon compounds and small quantities of various nonhydrocarbons , widely used as a fuel throughout the industrialized world ; it exists in the gaseous phase or in solution with crude oil in natural underground reservoirs ” ( Cleveland 2006 ) .
History Time line of Natural Gas ( naturalgas.org )
TECHNIQUES
Natural gas is often found along with oil and hence can be found by the same geological procedures as oil is found : surface geological features ( including seeps ) , subsurface geology ( using seismic processes etc ) , and geophysics .
As a well is drilled the substrate removed by the hollow drilling device emerges at the surface and can be analyzed for its geological , paleontological and petrochemical properties .
As more and more wells have been drilled geologists have been able to construct regional maps of the underground substrate so that we have very detailed information for many oil and gas producing regions .
In some regions , such as Indiana County Pennsylvania , many thousands of wells have been drilled to extract gas from relatively low yielding but very extensive fields .
The spacing of wells depends on highly variable subsurface geology , although tight gas wells are more closely spaced at less than 1,000 feet .
New drilling is limited by transmission pipeline availability .
All sedimentary basins that have gas potential have been identified .
Size and geometry of these basins are established by plate tectonic setting .
The process of drilling a gas well on land is usually more or less as follows unless the terrain is unusually difficult ( such as on marshland or on permafrost ) .
First the drilling site , chosen by seismic or other means is prepared by constructing a road , clearing the site itself ( usually less than a hectare ) , moving drilling and gas handling machinery onto the site and then stockpiling the materials required .
Once the drilling rig is assembled the drilling begins , normally using incrementally larger drill bits with the smaller cheaper holes furthest into the Earth and larger holes ( usually up to 9 inches in diameter ) nearer the surface .
Next , casing ( a kind of pipe ) is inserted into the hole for it ’s entire length .
Once the hole and casing are finished cement is poured down the outside of the casing .
At all stages the characteristics of the substrate are assessed using “ wireline logging ” techniques where various instruments are lowered into the bore hole .
Then the portion of the pipe that is thought to be in gas - holding strata is “ shot ” with a series of projectiles similar to rifle bullets .
The slugs go through the pipe and into the substrate , and their shock waves help to open up the substrate for some hundreds of meters .
Acid is typically poured down the pipe and into the substrate to further open up the substrate .
Gas then flows under its own pressure through the substrates and the holes in the pipes and to the surface , where it is collected , merged with other wells ’ gas in trunk lines , separated into various fractions in holding tanks ( e.g. removing brine ) and shipped through pipelines to consumers .
Production from mature natural gas field production tends to fall off much more rapidly than that from oil fields .
TYPES OF GAS FIELDS
In general natural gas is the end result of the “ cracking ” ( i.e. breaking up ” ) of the original long chain molecules of petroleum that had once been various biological materials into shorter and shorter pieces as a result of the application of heat and pressure from the thousands of meters of sediments overlying the organic material .
The type of gas depends upon how many atoms of carbon remain linked together .
Methane ( CH4 ) for one , ethane ( C2H6 ) for two , Propane ( C3H8 ) and butane ( C4H10 ) are all useful gaseous forms familiar to use in routine economic activity .
Natural gas is usually divided into “ conventional ” ( meaning from oil and gas or gas “ fields ” of usually limited spatial extent and specific form , vs. “ unconventional ” which are from more diffuse fields as indicated below ) .
Another categorization is as “ associated ” ( with oil — usually conventional ) , and “ non associated ” fields .
The various unconventional fields include :
Coal Bed Methane ( CBM ) --
“ An unconventional form of natural gas formed in the coalification process and found on the internal surfaces of the coal .
To commercially extract the gas , its partial pressure must be reduced by removing water from the coal bed .
The large quantities of water , sometimes saline produced from coal bed methane wells pose an environmental risk if not disposed of properly ” ( Cleveland et al. 2006 )
Marginal Wells , defined as wells that produce less than 60 Mcf per day ( Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission , 2006 ) .
Marginal currently comprise about 9 % of total U.S. gas production ( Sell 2007 ) .
Tight Gas defined as “ A category of unconventional natural gas that is trapped underground in extremely hard rock , or in unusually impermeable sandstone or limestone formation ; tight gas requires much greater extraction efforts for acceptable rates of gas flow ” ( Cleveland et al. 2006 ) .
Off
Shore defined as “ A general turn for oil and gas industry operations taking place along a coastline ( e.g. , in Louisiana ) or in open ocean water ( e.g. , the North Sea field ) .
Thus , offshore drilling , offshore lease , and so on ” ( Cleveland et al 2006 ) .
Methane Hydrate defined as “ the most recent form of unconventional natural gas to be discovered and researched .
These interesting formations are made up of a lattice of frozen water , which forms a sort of ' cage ' around molecules of methane .
These hydrates look like melting snow and were first discovered in permafrost regions of the Arctic ” ( NaturalGas.org 2004 ) .
RESOURCE BASE
Overview :
The current official reserves for the United States for 2005 are 608 trillion cubic feet , compared to use of about 24 trillion cubic feet a year .
Thus current reserves would last some 24 years as the simple quotient of the two , although this neglects the probably more important issue that the gas appears to have peaked in 1973 and then secondarily in 2001 , that the current production appears to be falling , and that many or most major conventional fields appear to be approaching depletion .
Thus it is becoming an issue of flow rate versus reserves .
Production has shifted increasingly from large fields in Louisiana , the traditionally largest producer state , to often unconventional fields in the Rocky Mountain States .
If one examines the rate at which gas has been found ( shifted forward for 23 years ) vs. produced for conventional gas there is a very close overlap and a strong indication that production , at least for conventional gas , is likely to take a strong downward course in the near future ( Figure 1 ) .
Unconventional production has been flat for a decade at about one quarter the rate of conventional gas , but has recently started to increase .
Some observers believe that U.S. and North American production is likely to decline sharply in the near future ( i.e. Darley 2000 ) .
Natural gas is abundant , for the time being , in Russia , Qatar , Iran and some other places , but it very difficult to ship overseas .
One solution to that is LNG , the liquefying of the gas ( requiring roughly 10 percent of the energy liquefied ) and shipping it overseas in a special “ LNG ” tanker .
Port facilities for this in the U.S. are expensive and rare , but could be increased .
More specifically the reserves or resources of natural gas are very uncertain and depend upon the quality of the resource one might want to exploit and our ability to mobilize technology to exploit currently unexploitable resources .
According to the EIA ( 2005 ) the “ Technically Recoverable Natural Gas Resource Estimates for the U.S. in 2004 ( EIA2 , 2005 ) include :
Undiscovered Conventional Reservoired Fields 682 Trillion Cubic Feet
Discovered Conventionally Reservoired Fields 390 Trillion Cubic Feet
Total Conventional Reservoired Fields 1,072 Trillion Cubic Feet
Undiscovered Unconventionally Reservoired Fields 359 Trillion Cubic Feet
IMPORTED GAS
Currently the U.S. cannot meet all of its gas demand with domestic production and hence imports about 18 percent of its gas from Canada , although there are arguments that this gas will be needed to develop the Alberta tar sands .
If additional gas is to be imported it will have to be done so using LNG technology , where the gas is liquefied and sent long distances in specially - designed ships .
Major conventional gas resources are found in Russia , Iran and Qatar .
The dollar costs for this fuel depend upon volatile international pricing and may follow oil prices .
In 2006 high gas prices drove many gas - intensive U.S. manufacturing firms overseas or to close shop .
The energy cost to the US depends upon the relative prices of gas and what we export as we have discussed for oil .
EROI
The problem :
There appears to be little or no information that would allow us to derive the EROI from explicit national - or regional - level data about the gas industry because 1 ) oil and gas data , when available , tend to be combined and 2 ) the data maintained at the Federal level on energy costs of various industries appears less reliable than in the past .
Therefore we can either give up or start “ from the bottom up ” to derive EROI for specific plays / regions , which is what we have chosen to do .
Therefore we must make the following disclaimer : “ There is no readily available literature either on , or by which , one might derive the Energy Return on Investment ( EROI ) of Natural Gas .
Published summaries of natural gas reservoir studies and general overviews of drilling practices are sparse .
Even with such a broad study , it would be difficult to assess natural gas production generally because each kind of operation is very field - specific " .
However we undertook an analysis with Bryan Sell , a geology graduate student of Syracuse University who had previously worked for three years as a field driller , to calculate the EROI of a random sample of 100 wells in Indiana County , Pennsylvania .
Due to the maturity of this field it may be representative of many gas operations in the U.S.
This county was chosen because it is made up of a mature dry gas field composed of marginal wells (< 60 Mcf / day ) and the necessary data was fairly easily accessible because of Brian ’s contacts .
With the completion of this specific EROI analysis a general research protocol is established that could be applied elsewhere .
Most data was obtained from Pennsylvania state completion reports and electronic data of the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources .
Fuel consumption data was obtained from surveying industry contacts .
This study explores the minimum requirements for natural gas drilling and establish a baseline for natural gas EROI studies .
We used wells in Indiana County because they are relatively simple , but the drilling practices are very similar to other producing fields in the onshore United States .
We extended the results by applying the energy consumption per foot of drilling in Indiana County to EIA data for national - level drilling and production data , to generate a crude estimate of the EROI of the United States ( Figure 1 ) .
We calculated the EROI for conventional dry gas wells in Indiana County , Pennsylvania .
This started by assessing the amount of energy needed to drill and complete a well , which was adjusted to the energy cost per foot ( about 0.35 GJ per foot , including secondary operations such as cementing ) .
For our methods we calculated the direct energy ( diesel fuel ) that is principally used by the machinery drilling the wells and the indirect energy is for the materials ( steel , cement , sand , water ) consumed in drilling the wells .
Acids and other chemicals are not yet included .
Energy for cement production was obtained from Worrell and Galitsky , 2004 , steel from Worrell et al. 1999 , and sand from Department of Energy Report 2002 .
The largest indirect energy cost ( approximately 60 % ) of drilling is from steel , principally used in the cladding .
We also calculated the indirect energy includes the energy used to produce the materials consumed ( e.g.cement ) during the plugging and abandonment of wells , and the energy used to generate dry holes , which have gone from 80 percent to about 50 percent of all wells , therefore the actual EROI is about one fifth to one half as much as for one successful well when they are included in the analysis .
Pipelines contribute a minor energy cost and are assumed to be negligible .
Operational energy costs are not yet included .
The EROI value of marginal gas fields in Indiana County would decrease with a more inclusive analysis that included e.g. the energy cost of pipelines , acid , field vehicles and so on .
PRELIMINARY RESULTS
The EROI for a producing well was calculated to be about 29:1 in the early 2000 ’s , or somewhat less than half that if the cost of dry holes are figured in .
Coalbed methane wells were calculated similarly to be 15:1 .
Thus as of 2005 the EROI for gas fields in the U.S. is an estimate 10:1 .
Figure 1 . EROI time series for Indiana County , Pennsylvania , plotted against a production curve for the U.S. ( Sell 2007 ) .
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
The environmental impacts from burning natural gas are relatively low compared to oil and especially coal because the gas is essentially pure methane with relatively few impurities .
It ’s CO2 emissions are about half that of coal and about two thirds that of oil .
Carbon Dioxide Emissions in U.S. from Natural Gas in 2005 ( DOE 2006 ) was 261.7 Million Metric
Tons of CO2 from residential sources and 166.3 Million Metric Tons of CO2 from industrial sources .
There are virtually no emissions from sulfur dioxide and there were 80 % less emissions of nitrogen oxides than from the combustion of coal .
The water produced as a by - product of Coal Bed Methane ( Keith et al. 2003 ) can be a problem when discharged or impounded as it impacts salt sensitive plants ( including agricultural plants ) and animals .
Although discharging this water ( or brine ) is not allowed for new wells , it still occurs through past “ grandfathered ” systems .
The drilling technique called “ hydraulic fracturing , ” is a potential polluter of underground drinking water is exempt from the Safe Drinking Water Act .
These pollutions occur in part because natural gas companies are exempt from the Federal Water Pollution Control Act for their construction activities surrounding gas drilling .
The density of wells in many gas producing regions of Eastern and Western United States has interrupted once - continuous ecosystems and destroyed any sense of wilderness in these areas .
SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS
• Land Rights
o Companies can buy mineral rights to coal found under private lands .
With the mineral rights to the coal they are legally allowed to drill coal bed methane wells on private property ( Hopey 2007 ) .
However , overall the area taken up by a gas operation , while destroying the continuous nature of the environment , is not a large proportion of even intensely developed regions and hence in most cases interferes little with agriculture and forestry .
It does interfere with the “ wilderness ” sense of the region .
ECONOMICS
• The U.S. may have reached a peak or plateau in natural gas production .
“ Production decreased by 2.7 percent in 2005 , declining below the 2000 level , and reaching the lowest production level since 1993 ” ( EIA 2006 ) .
“ The number of producing gas wells has increased each year since 2000 , rising from almost 342,000 wells in 2000 to more than 405,000 wells in 2004 .
However , production has not increased proportionally ” ( EIA1 2006 ) .
Thus it has not been possible to increase production simply by drilling more .
This is the case despite the subsidies $ 1.035 billion and regulatory rollbacks in the energy bill of 2005 ( Public Citizen 2005 ) :

PARIS – Israel and the Palestinians have never been as close to peace as they are now , Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said on Sunday during a French - hosted regional conference .
" It seems to me that we have never been as close to the possibility of reaching an accord as we are today , " Olmert told reporters standing alongside Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and French President Nicolas Sarkozy .
During a one - on - one meeting at the Elysee Palace , Olmert promised Abbas that Israel would release additional Palestinian prisoners as a gesture to the Palestinian Authority .
An Israeli state official said however that Olmert did not commit himself to releasing a specific number of prisoners .
Sarkozy ( M ) with Abbas ( L ) and Olmert ( Photo : AFP )
Referring to the peace talks with Syria , Olmert said that " while the talks are indirect at this time , we hope to make the negotiations direct in the near future .
This avenue will not be pursued at the expense of the Palestinian one . "
Abbas reiterated the sentiment , saying the Palestinian Authority is serious in its efforts to achieved peace .
" We respect the Road Map and all other international treaties .
We know that peace in the Middle East is the basis for world peace and unless achieved , world peace is at risk , " he said .
' We have more common challenges than conflicts '
Sarkozy said , " During this conference ( representatives ) of Israel and all the Arab nations are sitting at the same table in the same hall ; this does not mean that all of the problems have been solved , but it does mean that the Middle East belongs to everyone .
" We must learn to love each other again instead of hating and fighting each other over and over , " the French leader said .
Later on Sunday Olmert met with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan in a Paris hotel to discuss the possibility of direct talks between Israel and Syria .
Earlier Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni told the 43 -nation Union for the Mediterranean conference that " when I look at my neighbors I first of all see human beings facing similar challenges .
" The only way to deal with these challenges is through cooperation .
Do n't let the region 's nations ' ability to cooperate be held hostage by political considerations , " she said .
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem left the conference hall in protest before Livni spoke , but several other representatives of Arab countries that do not have diplomatic relations with Israel remained seated .
Livni continued to say that " I know that part of the conference participants view the Israeli - Palestinian conflict as an obstacle on the way to promoting joint projects , but I do not accept this .
Cooperation and joint ventures contribute to the leaders ' ability to make decisions .
We have more common challenges in the region than conflicts . "
About the author
( NewsTarget ) Mitsubishi Motor Company is continuing to refine its all - electric sub - compact car dubbed iMiev ( Mitsubishi Innovative Electric Vehicle ) , and plans to begin sales to the general public in the latter half of 2009 .
This sub -compact car is about the size of a " light car " in Japan ( " keijidousha " ) with an engine displacement of up to 660 cc .
It has seating for four , but in reality it 's adequate for two medium - sized adults in the front seats and two small children , or better yet a few bags of groceries , in the back seat .
Where you 'd see the gasoline tank filler cap on an ordinary car , you find the outlet for charging the iMiev .
It can be charged overnight from an ordinary home 100 - volt outlet ; if you have the electric company wire you up a 200 - volt outlet ( until now used mainly for large electric appliances like large air conditioners and electric ranges ) , the charging time of the iMiev is cut in half .
Special quick - charge outlets at gasoline stations , where you could get about 80 % charged in 20 minutes or so , are envisioned for the future .
Mitsubishi says you can drive 160 km ( 100 miles ) on a full charge under optimal conditions .
The iMiev produces no exhaust , and the overall greenhouse gas load produced from the electricity it uses is said to be well under a third of what a typical sub - compact gasoline car produces .
The electric engine makes a barely audible whirring sound , so after you turn the key to start it , a chime lets you know that the engine is running and the car is ready to go .
At the same time , a few prototypes are already running on the streets of Tokyo where the latest extreme testing is taking place .
One involves driving through streets flooded 20 to 30 centimeters ( 8 to 12 inches ) deep in order to see whether anything will go wrong with the all - electric vehicle .
It 's also being put through extreme cold temperature testing at minus 10 degrees Celsius ( about 14 degrees Fahrenheit ) ; the power of any battery is weakened by low temperatures , and especially starting at extremely cold temperatures seems to be a worry for the company .
The best part is the cost of running the iMiev : the electricity it uses is estimated to be about one yen per kilometer .
One hundred yen for 100 km , or about $ 0.97 ( yes , ninety - seven cents at the current exchange rate ! ) for 62 miles of running .
Look at the newest gasoline sub -compact cars in Japan that get up to 50 miles per gallon of gasoline , and you can see that the comparison is mind - boggling ( gasoline in Japan right now is " only " about $ 4.60 a gallon , because a special gasoline tax expired , but will rise again to about $ 5.50 a gallon when the ruling party holds a re-vote and reinstates the tax ) .
And as the cost of gasoline continues to rise in the future , the difference will become even greater .
Of course you can't pack up the family , the dog , and all the camping gear into the iMiev for a weekend getaway , but for a daily commute for one or two persons , or for everyday shopping and other errands , it might be ideal .
How much will the iMiev cost ?
Nobody knows for sure yet , but the first two or three years will probably show a sticker price of around $ 25,000 .
That 's more than most people are willing to pay for a small car .
However , there are rumors that the Japanese government will subsidize 50 % of the purchase cost because the vehicle is considered a " zero- emission " car ; if this is true , Mitsubishi could see high sales right from the start .
As Toyota has been the leader in hybrid technology in Japan , and has had the Prius , the first gasoline - electric hybrid car , on sale to the general public for ten years already , many Japanese are surprised that Mitsubishi will be the first company to sell an all - electric car .
On a personal note , I recently gave up my car , which I did n't use so much because I work at home ( actually " live at work " is more like it ) , and bought a bicycle , mainly to help stop polluting the Earth .
I 'm now enjoying savings of around $ 300 a month on various car taxes , insurance , parking fees , and gasoline , and am getting a lot more exercise and sunshine than before .
If I find I really need a car for commuting in the future , a small all - electric car will be the first thing I 'll consider buying .

Stop Using Internet Explorer !
Recent Note ( 16 February 2014 )
The text and opinions expressed in this page , are no longer too accurate , or relevant , as they were when it was written in 2004 .
It is kept here for historical reasons .
You can also read a more detailed explanation about the situation then and today .
You should stop using Microsoft Internet Explorer for surfing the web .
This is because :
It is insecure .
Many exploits were discovered in it so far , and more are constantly discovered .
It lags behind other browsers in standards - compliance and so prevents web designers from using some very nice tricks in their pages .
Some of this is caused by the many bugs it has .
It does not have many of the usability features that more modern browsers like Mozilla , Opera , or Konqueror have .
Use a different browser for a while and you would n’t want to switch back .
You ’ll need to upgrade the OS , in order to update it , as Microsoft announced that it wo n’t be updated separately any more .
I hereby testify that my pages will remain fully clean and standards compliant , but not necessarily viewable correctly with Explorer .
This is in fact , different than writing web - sites that function perfectly in MSIE , but not in other browsers .
All of this is because :
Latest versions of MSIE and above are specific to a certain operating system and architecture .
Mozilla and similar browsers are truly cross-platform .
- as such MSIE may not be available on the development platform of the web designer .
I design all my sites on Linux and have tested them on MSIE by using a different Windows computer .
Now , I ’m not going to bother .
MSIE is not open source .
Mozilla is - I cannot fix the bugs there even if I wanted to .
If bugs exist in an open source project I can either fix them myself , hire someone else to do it , or blame myself for not doing either .
With MSIE , I have every right to blame Microsoft for their incompetence .
And I can have them eat their own arrogance .
Users can always switch to Mozilla or whatever - I can always tell them to do so .
On the other hand , I cannot switch to Internet Explorer if I ’d like to use Linux ( which I do ) .
MSIE is not standards compliant while other browsers are - in fact , a prominent Microsoft engineer said standards - compliance is not a high priority for the MSIE team .
Since I design according to web standards , I do n’t want the new Netscape Navigator 4 to be in my way .
MSIE is not going to be maintained independently - the only prospect of getting a browser upgrade for MSIE is to buy a new OS .
Buy a new OS just to get a new version of the browser ?
That ’s the joke of the month .
Other browsers come with periodic upgrades with many improvements - all for free .
Internet Explorer does not have a public , accessible bug tracker , similar to Mozilla ’s Bugzilla or what other similar browsers have .
This makes bugs harder to report , reproduce , check and track and undermines the users and web developers .
So expect to see more and more non-MSIE - compatible embellishments on my sites , or otherwise pages that were not tested there .
Please use a different browser to browse my sites , trust me - you ’ll like it .
Theoretically , these pages should have looked OK , but if they do n’t - blame Microsoft not me .

The product : Dust , cigarette smoke , pollen and pet dander :
With so many irritants floating around our homes and work places , clean air is a hot commodity .
Americans spend hundreds of millions of dollars on furnace filters and air cleaners each year .
Though some consumers are simply trying to bring a little extra freshness into their lives , many others hope that their investment will help relieve their asthma or allergies .
If you ’ve ever shopped for an air cleaner -- or if you ’ve ever idly flipped through a SkyMall catalog -- you ’ve undoubtedly seen ads for ionic air purifiers , devices that take an unusual approach to clearing the air .
Instead of relying on fans to move air through filters , the machines release a steady stream of negatively charged ions that electrify the bits of dust , dander or other flotsam .
The airborne particles pick up the negative charge and become strongly attracted to positively charged collection plates inside the machine .
( In many cases , they also become attracted to other charged surfaces such as walls , table tops and TV screens . )
Except for a few models that use fans to help suck in the charged particles , most ionic air purifiers work silently .
And , as ads are quick to point out , the devices generally do n’t have any motors or moving parts , and there are no filters to replace .
There ’s another thing that separates ionic air purifiers from other technologies :
To varying degrees , all ionic air purifiers release ozone , a potential pollutant .
A 2006 study by researchers at UC Davis found that one popular brand , the Ionic Breeze Quadra , released about 2.2 milligrams of ozone per hour , or about as much as a constantly running photocopier .
( Ionic purifiers should n’t be confused with ozone generators that are marketed as “ air cleaners . ”
By design , these devices can release 50 to 200 milligrams of ozone per hour . )
Ionic purifiers are sold at drugstores , at department stores and via the Internet .
The well - known and heavily advertised Ionic Breeze line is one of the cornerstone products of the Sharper Image , the high - end gadget store .
One current offering , the Ionic Breeze GP , stands more than 2 feet tall and as an added feature comes equipped with a UV light to help kill airborne germs .
If you buy one for $ 400 , the second costs $ 200 .
The Sharper Image also sells a 13 - inch unit for $ 150 .
You can buy a 28 - inch Ionic Pro Turbo Air Purifier from Wal - Mart for $ 180 .
An online company called Heaven Fresh sells the table - top XJ - 2000 ionic air purifier for about $ 50 .
The claims : According to the Sharper Image website , the Ionic Breeze is “ proven effective at reducing airborne allergens and irritants -- with no fan , no motor and no noise . ”
The Heaven Fresh website says that its purifiers can provide relief from “ asthma , bronchitis , hay fever and other respiratory diseases . ”
Heaven Fresh also claims that the ozone emitted by its machines helps clean the air .
According to the site , “ ozone is one of the purest and most powerful oxidants and germicides known . ”
The bottom line : Ionic air purifiers have undeniable appeal , but there ’s a problem :
They do n’t really improve air quality , says Dr. James Sublett , a clinical professor at the University of Louisville ; a fellow at the American College of Allergy , Asthma & Immunology ; and co-chair of the 2007 ACAAI Healthy Indoor Environment conference .
“ We [ allergists and immunologists ] generally do n’t recommend them , ” he says .
“ This is a windmill that I ’ve been tilting at for a number of years . ”
According to Sublett , the devices do n’t effectively remove dust , dander and other irritants from a room .
Without fans , he explains , they can’t collect airborne particles from more than a few feet away .
And when even small amounts of dust enter the device , the plates inside quickly lose much of their power to attract more particles .
Meanwhile , the charged particles that stick to walls or TV screens have n’t left the room and can always billow up again to cause trouble .
The ozone released from the devices is another deal - breaking shortcoming , Sublett says .
“ Ozone is a pollutant and an irritant .
Even small amounts are too much . ”
People who use several units at a time are especially likely to get an ozone overload , he says .
One of Sublett ’s patients noticed a great improvement in her breathing when she turned off the six ionic purifiers in her home .
The California Air Resources
Board recently banned all devices that create an ozone concentration of more than 50 parts per billion , starting in 2009 .
Under normal conditions , ionic purifiers ( as opposed to ozone generators ) would fall below that threshold , says Jeffery Siegel , an assistant professor of civil , architectural and environmental engineering at the University of Texas at Austin who has studied the devices in laboratories as well as his own bedroom .
Still , he says , the new standard is misleading because even products that release small amounts of ozone could easily reach that concentration in small , poorly ventilated spaces .
Sublett says people with asthma or allergies should consider installing high - efficiency particulate air ( HEPA ) filters in their heating or cooling systems .
The ultra - fine mesh on these filters traps all sorts of irritants that would otherwise circulate through the home .

Nicole and I have both written posts about the mysterious circumstances surrounding the death of PFC LaVena Johnson , and Democracy Now ! had a heartbreaking interview with her family last week .
LaVena 's family has worked hard to find the truth about her death and have finally had a breakthrough in the case .
Unfortunately , the new details they uncovered are so disturbing that they could potentially make the Pat Tillman and Jessica Lynch stories pale in comparison .
The above video from Cenk of The Young Turks captures my exact feelings about this horrific case .
What you 're about to read will sicken and enrage you .
The Army claims the 5 ’ 1 ” African - American soldier from North County died from a self - inflicted gunshot wound with a rifle on July 19 , 2005 .
Her father , John H. Johnson , Ph.D. of Florissant , said color photos and documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act from the military suggest otherwise .
“ Our worst fears were substantiated when we started going through information from the Army , ” Johnson said .
He said the pictures and documents from the incident proved that his daughter had been brutalized - raped , beaten , shot and set on fire .
" Someone poured lye in her vagina to destroy evidence , " her father said .
" Her body was dumped in a dirty , filthy contractor 's tent .

World ’s First Tidal Turbine Power Station Goes Online , Does n’t Blend Seals
However exciting the rubber robot snake wave power generator sounds , a real seagoing power station is way more interesting .
And over in the UK , they ’ve just turned on the world ’s first commercial tidal power generator station .
SeaGen is situated in Strangford Lough , Northern Ireland , and it has twin turbines that spin as the tide rushes into and out of the lough at up to 8 knots .
The moving seawater spins the turbines for around 20 hours each day and when it ’s up to full operating capacity , SeaGen will be pushing out 1.2 megawatts of power , roughly enough to supply 1,000 homes .
And since the revolution speed is only around 10 to 15 per minute , the blades should n’t offer a threat to sealife like the local common seals .
Eco-friendliness all ’round .
[ Daily Mail ]
Company sources said that human remains and ornaments linked to royalty suggested it could be the caravel of Bartolomeu Dias , the Portuguese explorer , which went down off the Cape of Good Hope in 1500 .
Max Boot is admirably candid .
He helps us realize that this election is indeed at root a decision on whether to keep troops in Iraq for the next century or more :
In order to build on the success that General Petraeus and his soldiers have had , we need to maintain a long - term commitment in Iraq - for 100 years if need be , as John McCain has said .
That does n’t mean 100 years of fighting ; clearly , that would be unsustainable .
It does mean a long - term troop presence designed to reassure Iraqis of our commitment to their security against an array of enemies .
Their security ?
Heh .
In fifty years ' time , the Iraqis will not be able to defend themselves against Iran ?
Or Syria ?
Please .
If they 've managed this much progress in the last year , we could be almost out of there in the next president 's term of office .
Even under Saddam , the Iraqis were n't defeated by the Iranian mullahs .
Notice also how a few months of relative calm are instantly deployed to justify a century of occupation .
Can you imagine what the next platform for invasion will be ?
And on what planet does Boot live to think that permanent US troops in the heart of the Muslim Middle East will not require endless , endless fighting ?
This obviously is n't about Iraq , as we are fast discovering .
It 's about an ever greater American entanglement in the Middle East in part to secure oil supplies we need to wean ourselves off and in part a foolish attempt to protect Israel .
And Joe Klein is in no way engaging in anti-Semitism - please - by pointing out the increasingly obvious fact that the Iraq war was in part launched to assist Israel ( even though many Israelis were against it ) :
You want evidence of divided loyalties ?
How about the " benign domino theory " that so many Jewish neoconservatives talked to me about -- off the record , of course -- in the runup to the Iraq war , the idea that Israel 's security could be won by taking out Saddam , which would set off a cascade of disaster for Israel 's enemies in the region ?
As my grandmother would say , feh !
Do you actually deny that the casus belli that dare not speak its name was n't , as I wrote in February 2003 , a desire to make the world safe for Israel ?
Why the rush now to bomb Iran , a country that poses some threat to Israel but none -- for the moment -- to the United States ... unless we go ahead , attack it , and the mullahs unleash Hezbollah terrorists against us ?
Do you really believe the mullahs would stage a nuclear attack on Israel , destroying the third most holy site in Islam and killing untold numbers of Muslims ?
I am not ruling out the use of force against Iran - - it may come to that -- but you folks seem to embrace it gleefully .
The truth is :
We did n't need this war , we now see , and neither did the Israelis ; and a war that was originally about our existential security should not be morphed into a permanent US occupation of a region that chews up outsiders and spits them out with alarming economy and frequency .

ACAPULCO , Mexico - Environmental officials in Mexico say dozens of dead sea turtles apparently killed in fishing nets have washed up on beaches in recent days .
Authorities say 59 Olive Ridley turtles have been found on beaches in and around the resort of Acapulco .
Environmental protection officer Manuel de Jesus Solis says his agency found 12 dead turtles bearing marks apparently caused by fishing nets .
It was unclear which fishing boats were involved .
Victor Berdejo says another 47 dead turtles were found by personnel at a turtle - protection area he supervises .
The sea turtles , once hunted in Mexico for their meat and eggs , were declared a protected species in 1990 .
Fishermen are required to include turtle escape devices in their nets .
Windows could be used as powerful solar panels thanks to a clever new technology that concentrates the sun 's rays .
The technique uses transparent dyes to capture , concentrate and redirect light along the surface of the glass to photovoltaic ( PV ) cells in the frame , which convert the light into electricity .
The breakthrough means that there is a tenfold increase in power output compared to use of the PV cell alone .
The team , from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) , claims the technology could slash the cost of generating electricity from sunlight , making it more competitive with standard grid power .
This is because the expensive PV cells only need to be installed at the sides of the panels , rather than across the whole surface .
Sunlight is concentrated in existing solar power devices using large , mobile mirrors that track the sun as it moves across the sky .
But these can be expensive to deploy and maintain .
In the MIT device , called an " organic solar concentrator " and described in the latest issue of Science , the researchers painted a mixture of organic dyes onto the surface of a pane of glass .
The dyes trap different wavelengths of sunlight and then guide the energy along the glass towards the PV cells at the edges .
" The point of all this is to get away with using far fewer solar cells , " said Marc Baldo , an electrical engineer at MIT .
" The concentrator collects light over its whole front surface , but the solar cells need only cover the area of the edges . "
As the edges of a glass panel can often be 100 times smaller in area than the surface itself , he added , solar panels would need 100 times fewer PV cells to collect the same energy .
" So we can save money .
Since industry can't produce enough solar cells to satisfy demand , this might also be a good way to stretch production . "
As well as windows , the technique can be applied to standard solar panels on roofs and walls to improve their efficiency .
" We think the technology should cost less than $ 1 per watt [ to build ] " , said Baldo .
The MIT device is relatively simple to manufacture and researchers claim it could be commercially available within three years .
Martyn Berry , senior research and development engineer at solar - energy company Solarcentury , said the biggest challenge for PV technology was to make it competitive with standard electricity .
"
The notion that we could see a tenfold reduction on the cost of PV technologies through the use of organic solar concentrators is certainly exciting .
Current concentrator technology is not generally suitable for the mass market . "
Baldo said any transparent material could be used as the concentrator .
" In the window application you 'd probably design the window for 10 % transmission [ of light ] .
The remaining 90 % is captured and used to generate electricity . "
A more immediate use of the concentrator technology would be to coat the conventional solar panels used on the roofs of buildings , to boost their light collecting ability .
" We saw approximately 30 % higher performance in the combined system compared to a stand alone solar cell , " said Baldo .
" We think that ultimately this approach will allow us to nearly double the performance of existing solar cells for minimal added cost . "
A similar method to concentrate solar energy was developed in the 1970s .
But the system , which painted dyes onto plastic surfaces , was abandoned because it could not collect enough of the sunlight and much of the retransmitted light was absorbed and lost as it travelled through the material to the PV cells .
To make their breakthrough , Baldo 's team used advances originally developed to improve lasers and organic light - emitting diodes .
By using the newer dyes in carefully chosen ratios and applying it only to the surface of a glass panel , the scientists were able to more accurately control how much light was absorbed and transported across it .
" We made it so the light can travel a much longer distance , " said Jonathan Mapel of MIT , who also worked on the solar concentrator .
Greenpeace 's chief scientist , Doug Parr , said : " Innovations like this show renewable technologies can take a quantum leap forward if given proper financial support from governments .
Rather than betting the farm on outdated nuclear technology and hoping that coal will one day be ' clean ' , Gordon Brown should be creating green jobs and pushing at the real technological frontier of the 21st century - renewables . "
The Modis instrument scans the Earth 's surface every eight days
Researchers found that during the 2005 drought , many parts of the rainforest " greened " , apparently growing faster .
This finding contrasts with some computer models of climate change , which forecast that the Amazon would dry out and become savannah .
Writing in the journal Science , the researchers say it is unclear how the forest would respond to a long drought .
" We measured the changes between the drought ( of July to September 2005 ) and an average year , " explained study leader Scott Saleska from the University of Arizona , Tucson , US .
Some of the models , in particular the Hadley Centre group , became famous for predicting collapse of the Amazon and a change into savannah
Scott Saleska
The scientists used the Modis ( Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ) instrument on the US space agency 's ( Nasa ) Terra satellite to make their observations .
Some areas of the Amazon had seen reduced growth during the drought , but these were regions heavily impacted by human activities .
Clear skies
It has been thought that stressed trees in drought conditions would try to preserve their water by reducing loss through leaves ( transpiration ) , with this shut - down having a consequent knock - on for photosynthesis .
This , in turn , would be expected to exacerbate the drought by interrupting the supply of water into the atmosphere , a supply which contributes to rainfall .
" There 's a prompt response to the initial drought : trees down ( transpiration ) , they release less water to the atmosphere so there 's less to recycle as rain ; and in that model world , it pushes the forest over the edge .
" We 've tested whether that mechanism is there , and found it 's not there on a short timescale .
That does n't mean the forest wo n't collapse , but it says that the scenario in that model is not right in that particular [ situation ] . "
Although increased photosynthesis in drought conditions might appear counter - intuitive , the group said it could be explained if the trees were still able to access water reserves with deep root systems .
Persistent bright skies during a drought would allow more sunlight through to the leaves , driving photosynthesis and leading to the " greening " seen from space .
Model refinement
Chris Jones from the UK's Hadley Centre for Climate Change commended the study , and said it demonstrated the importance of using real - world observations to challenge and fine - tune the models .
He added that the Hadley and Saleska teams were sharing data .
The British researcher agreed that the satellite images showed up the short - term constraints of the Hadley model , but did not overturn the long - term predictions of his group .
" The key thing here is that the tree roots access water deeper than is often represented in models , " he told BBC News .
" In most models , including ours , this goes down to about three metres , which for most of the world 's vegetation is fine .
But these ( Amazon ) trees can clearly go deeper than that , so while our model predicts they would suffer during a couple of months of drought , in reality they have access to a much deeper store which does n't respond on that timescale . "
He said , however , that a climatic shift to longer and more frequent drought conditions would eventually diminish the deep - water stores , and make the trees suffer .

Consumer advocates taking part in a food safety conference in Orlando , Florida , this week said food produced by using nanotechnology is quietly coming onto the market , and they want U.S. authorities to force manufacturers to identify them .
Nanotechnology involves the design and manipulation of materials on molecular scales , smaller than the width of a human hair and invisible to the naked eye .
Companies using nanotechnology say it can enhance the flavor or nutritional effectiveness of food .
U.S. health officials generally prefer not to place warning labels on products unless there are clear reasons for caution or concern .
But consumer advocates say uncertainty over health consequences alone is sufficient cause to justify identifying nano - foods .
“ I think nanotechnology is the new genetic engineering .
People just do n’t know what ’s going on , and it ’s moving so fast , ” Jane Kolodinsky , a consumer economist at the University of Vermont , said at the conference .
American consumers are generally more complacent about genetically modified or cloned foods than their counterparts in Europe .
But Michael Hansen , a senior scientist with the Consumers Union , said polls show that 69 percent of Americans are concerned about eating cloned meat .
He said that in focus groups run by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration , no parents were willing to feed their children meat from cloned animals or their offspring .
In a recent CBS / New York Times poll , 53 percent of Americans said they would n’t buy genetically modified foods .
SCANT AWARENESS
Hansen said there is scant public awareness , however , about foods produced through nanotechnology .
New consumer products created through nanotechnology are coming on the market at the rate of 3 to 4 per week , according to an advocacy group , The Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies ( PEN ) , based on an inventory it has drawn up of 609 known or claimed nano - products .
Nano - products in common use today include lightweight tennis rackets and bicycles , and sunscreens containing clear , nonwhite versions of zinc oxide and titanium dioxide .
They also include lipsticks , and many items labeled as anti-microbial that contain silver ions such as socks , washing machines , salad spinners and food containers .
On PEN ’s list are three foods -- a brand of canola cooking oil called Canola Active Oil , a tea called Nanotea and a chocolate diet shake called Nanoceuticals Slim Shake Chocolate .
According to company information posted on PEN ’s Web site , the canola oil , by Shemen Industries of Israel , contains an additive called “ nanodrops ” designed to carry vitamins , minerals and phytochemicals through the digestive system .
The shake , according to U.S. manufacturer RBC Life Sciences Inc. , uses cocoa infused “ NanoClusters ” to enhance the taste and health benefits of cocoa without the need for extra sugar .
The tea , says manufacturer Shenzhen Become Industry & Trade Co. , Ltd. of China , is prepared with nanotechnology to “ release effectively all of the excellent essences of the tea ” and increase by a factor of 10 “ the selenium supplement function . ”
Hansen , whose organization publishes the nonprofit product - testing magazine Consumer Reports , said there is no requirement that nano - products be identified as such .
He called for stronger federal regulations to require safety testing and labeling .
“ Just because something is safe at the macro level , does n’t mean it ’s safe at the nano size , ” Hansen said .
“ All scientists agree that size matters . ”
Hansen said recent studies have shown that nano - sized particles in some cases can invade cells and breach the blood - brain barrier , and that some forms of nano - sized carbon could be as harmful as asbestos if inhaled in quantity .
“ This represents science at the cutting edge .
These technologies raise basic scientific issues , ” Hansen said .
I am a 23 year - old male college student .
Im born and raised in Salt Lake City , Utah .
As many of you probably know , The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints ( also known as LDS or Mormon ) is the predominant religion in Utah and one that I am proud to be associated with .
Anyway , many young men in the LDS church serve as missionaries for 2 years .
I chose to do so and lived in South Korea for 2 years where I had the opportunity to learn the Korean language .
After my return , I continued my Korean studies .
I was also pursuing a double major in Mass Communication and International studies .
After finishing my Korean class one day , I went into the hall and saw a poster saying something to the effect of  Join the FBI . 
I checked out their website and saw that Korean was a language theyd be interested in .
I looked into being a linguist .
I took the test at the FBI office and didnt pass .
In order to get my Korean up to par , I decided to spend a semester abroad as an exchange student ( through the University of Utah ) at a college in South Korea .
In the meantime , I had applied and been accepted for the volunteer internship program in Quantico , VA , pending a polygraph and background investigation .
The internship was to be with the Practical Applications Unit .
On the day I received my acceptance letter I was ecstatic .
After filling out some paperwork and taking a drug test at the SLC FBI office , I was told that Id have a polygraph test before long .
The person I talked with at the SLC FBI office told me that it would be better to do no research on polygraph testing before I had the actual test , so I didnt research more than the little I already knew .
The day of the Polygraph came .
I happily took the day off work to take the test .
The polygrapher was very friendly when we first met .
His demeanor would soon change .
After the first set of questions , he sits down in front of me and accursedly asks ,  Are you doin countermeasures on me ? 
I told him that I didnt even know what countermeasures were ( I didnt at that time ) .
He continued to badger me that I was doin something .
The test progressed for 2 hours .
He told me that there were a few questions I was having trouble with .
I figured it must be because the questions were so ambiguous , such as  Have you ever told a deep , dark lie ?  or  Have you ever betrayed someone you love ?
He was convinced I was lying to him .
I explained that the questions were ambiguous and we went though and reworded the questions .
I dont know if this helped , but it seemed to as the test continued long after that .
At one point , he said that the machine indicated that I had had contact with foreign intelligence persons .
He admitted that he didnt think that was accurate !
He said I was too young to have even of had that kind of opportunity .
As the test wrapped up , he continued by saying  I am a great judge of character .
You seem like a good egg to me , but there s something you arent telling me .
I dont know what it is , but there is something . 
When I insisted there wasnt anything , he very curtly escorted me out of his office without so much as a handshake .
I thought my chances were gone .
5 months later ( after my return from my semester abroad ) , I got a phone call from the same polygrapher saying hed like to schedule another test .
I had debated whether or not I wanted to do the test again ( because I knew what to expect this time ) but I really wanted to do this internship .
The polygrapher was very friendly on the phone .
When we met again in the SLC FBI office , he was still friendly .
He told me that during our last interview , the question I had the most problem with was drugs .
Drugs ?!
I couldnt believe it .
One of the few questions I could answer without ambiguity in my mind !
Im a Mormon !
( Not that Mormons are immune to the effects of drugs ) Im a poster American kid .
I have no police record 
Ive never even gotten a speeding ticket .
Ive never even gone to a party where drugs were used .
My friends dont use drugs .
Crap , I think Ive only seen people using maybe once or twice in the city Park .
Anyway , I explained this to the polygrapher , but he didnt believe me .
He was convinced of the accuracy of his test .
But contrary to our first interview , he was very kind and sincere this time .
I honestly felt like he wanted to help me pass the test .
Well actually , he wanted me to admit to using drugs .
 We re all young and stupid once ,  he said .
 A lot of people in this office have used .
You just cant have done anything in the last three years . 
I continued to tell him the truth that I had never been close to drugs , let alone use or sell them .
He told me that I would make a great FBI agent .
 America is in trouble .
They need people like you .
You have a great opportunity in front of you .
Dont lose it by holding on to this lie . 
I almost wished I had of had something to tell him about .
He made it sound so easy to get rid of .
 If you ve used , we just do an addendum and that s that .
But if I had used , that means I would have been lying up to that point !
How could they possibly hire someone who had blatantly been lying ?!
I told the polygrapher that there was no ambiguity in my mind about drug use .
He replied ,  I agree with you there .
Theres no ambiguity .
Evidently , I scored a - 5 on that question ( on a scale from - 5 to +6 ) .
I continued to say I dont know why .
I asked him about one of the more basic questions ,  Do you intend to lie to me today ? 
He said that I had scored a 0 on that question , meaning ,  Ideally , you re in the positives , +4 to +6 .
A score in the negatives means you re planning on lying to me .
A zero means I better be paying attention because you re thinking about lying to me .
That coupled with a - 2 on the truthfulness of my FBI application cemented in this polygraphers head that I was trying to hide some kind of drug use .
 Heres what I think ,  he said .
 Some time in high school , you re at a party , a friend offers you a joint , and you take a hit . 
I denied the allegation to no avail .
I reminded the polygrapher that I had told him I was not going to lie to him today .
I would not admit to something I didnt do .
He told me that if I didnt admit to it , the door on my FBI future would be shut FOREVER .
I told him I really wish that wouldnt happen , but it looks like I dont stand a chance .
He thanked me , walked me out of the office and cordially told me to take care . 
As disappointing as it was to know that the FBI was now closed to me , I felt good .
I could hold my head high .
I had stuck to my guns and told the truth .
Someday , Im going to prove to that polygrapher that I was telling the truth !
The most amazing thing in this whole ordeal was that this was for an UNPAID internship !
I was sacrificing time and money so that I could get my foot in the door .
Not to toot my own horn , but Im an intelligent , law - abiding through and through American .
I would have loved to have served my country in this capacity .
Now that my FBI options are shot , I must figure out what to do next .
At any rate , I am glad to see I am not alone in this .
I intend to write my Senator , Orin Hatch , but between the bureaucracy and the apathy in politicians , I do not expect much of a result .
If everybody does this , perhaps we can someday make a difference .

Environment correspondent , BBC News , Tuvalu
The group of nine tiny islands in the South Pacific only just break the surface of the ocean - but for how much longer ?
During a King Tide , which is what the islanders call the highest tides of the year , waves rolling off the ocean can have a devastating effect .
The islands ' main road is submerged and nearby homes are threatened by the rising waters .
" We have never seen this in the past , " a concerned resident tells me .
" We have never seen water coming in this far . "
No respect
It is not just the shoreline that is at the mercy of the King Tide 's sovereignty , the water also surges up from underground through the coral on which the islands are built .
The floods are fun for children , but what does the future hold ?
In the space of just an hour , the lowest areas are all flooded .
Everyone feels the impact ; a priest has to step carefully through the waters on his way to conduct a funeral .
The higher the King Tides get , the harder it is to keep things going here .
A woman tells me that she is unable to grow any food crops because the land has become too salty .
The sea water is poisoning the soil and people are nervous .
" It makes me feel scared , " another woman confesses .
" What will happen to us in 10 years ' time ? "
The rising waters are slowly creeping into the heart of these islands and slowly but effectively killing them off .
Water bubbles up in tiny streams ; and everywhere you look , it just lies on the surface .
And the problem is getting worse .
A local meteorologist tells me that the King Tides are getting higher , and it is a trend set to continue .
" The King Tides are getting worse and most of the coastal areas will be washed out , " he forecasts for the coming decade .
Runway ' essential '
It is a gloomy prognosis for life on these shores .
A typical high tide reaches about two - and - a - half metres , while a King Tide like this can be more than three metres .
The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) forecasts a rise of up to another half metre .
It is cold comfort for Tuvaluans , when the highest point of the islands reaches just about four - and - a - half metres above the encroaching waves .
Each scenario will cost Tuvalu precious land .
Only a small rise will see parts of the islands disappear .
This includes the runway , which is a vital lifeline to the outside world .
People here say there must be a technological fix if a rich country like UAE can build entirely new islands .
But the problem is that these islands are founded on coral which is porous ; saving these islands will cost a fortune .
For the children , the floods are fun .
However , for them to lead their lives on these islands will require massive international support .
But with a population of just 11,000 people , will the outside world think it is worthwhile ?
The Invention of Palestine as a Psychological Weapon for Conquering Eretz Yisrael
Summary
Almost 2,000 years ago , the Roman Emperor Hadrian cursed the Jewish People and decreed that Judea should be henceforth called " Palestine " after the Philistines , an ancient enemy of Israel that had disappeared from the world 's stage more than 600 years earlier .
It was his final twist of the knife and legacy after wars , massacres , persecutions , and exiles that had largely extinguished the Jewish presence from Judea .
Today , the modern enemies of a resurrected Jewish Nation have dusted off Hadrian 's curse and are attempting to pull off a monumental theft : the Arab world have reincarnated " Palestine " to steal Israel 's heritage and the Land of the Jewish People .
Hadrian 's Curse will expose the BIG lie of the " Palestinian cause " in a full - length 120 - minute documentary .
The film will document that there never was a " Palestinian " people , The world has become so accustomed to the " truth " of the " Palestinian " perversion of history and work backwards , exposing recent claims and acts whose absurdity and villainy shock uninformed observers .
When Arafat declared : " Our nation is the Arabic nation that stretches from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea and beyond it " , it turns out that Arafat 's nation already stretches over an area larger than all of Europe .
His is the twisted story of one of the biggest , most remarkable fraud in history .
It is such a successful fabrication that many otherwise informed people have been duped and mislead .
This propaganda has become a powerful weapon used Israel 's enemies , the Arabs , to try to conquer Eretz Yisrael without firing a shot , without an army , tanks or jets .
The Jewish People eventually bested Hadrian .
They returned to their land and reestablished sovereignty over it .
They rebuilt Jerusalem as their capital , and resettled desolate Judea .
They did all this only to now confront the reincarnated curse of Hadrian in the guise of Arabs renaming themselves " Palestinians " and claiming all the ancient Land as their own .
As explained in the film , many Israelis and lovers of Zion have accepted this misnaming and misidentification .
Hadrian 's ancient curse now threatens Israel 's very existence .
Israel 's success and endurance and the world 's hope for peace in the 21st century , demands that the deceit and danger of a Palestinian state must be exposed and avoided .
It is our fervent hope that Hadrian 's Curse will expose the historical truth .
Part I –– The Secret All the Arabs Know
At the Annapolis Conference , George Bush spoke about his vision regarding the virtues of two nations for two peoples .
One of those peoples has a clear identity –– the Jewish People .
Yet it would be interesting to know the identity of that second people : Already in 1977 , one of the central spokesman of that " second people " , a member of P.L.O. leadership , Zahir Muhsein , the leader of the al - Sa'iqa Organization , revealed the truth in an interview to the Dutch newspaper Trouw :
" The Palestinian people does not exist .
The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity .
In reality today there is no difference between Jordanians , Palestinians , Syrians and Lebanese .
Only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a Palestinian people , since Arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct ' Palestinian people ' to oppose Zionism for tactical reasons , Jordan , which is a sovereign state with defined borders , cannot raise claims to Haifa and Jaffa .
While as a Palestinian , I can undoubtedly demand Haifa , Jaffa , Beer - Sheva and Jerusalem .
However , the moment we reclaim our right to all of Palestine , we will not wait even a minute to unite Palestine and Jordan . "
Are you in shock ?
If the Palestinian People does not exist , what does exist ?
Arabs who live in Eretz Yisrael and who have disguised themselves as " Palestinians " for fraudulent purposes .
" Only a means for continuing our struggle against the State of Israel , " in Muhsein 's words .
A fraud so successful that even George Bush can be found seeking a state for that fraud !
Do you think Zahir Muhsein is alone ?
This transparent fraud about the so - called existence of Palestine is revealed to us by all the Arabs ' leaders :
In 1974 , the late Syrian President , Hafez al - Assad , declared : " It would be fitting for us to mention to the responsible Israeli authorities that we view Palestine not just as an inseparable part of the Arab nation , but as a part of Southern Syria . "
In 1987 , he reiterated himself at a conference in Amman , " A country named ' Palestine ' has never existed . "
Jordanian King Hussein responded , " The appearance of the national Palestinian persona serves as a response to Israel 's claim that Palestine is Jewish . "
Yet the prize goes to Arafat who in 1970 , with candid simplicity , told the reporter Arianna Palazzi [ phonetic spelling of " Oriana Fallaci " ] :
" The question of borders does n't interest us ...
From the Arab standpoint , we must n't talk about borders .
Palestine is nothing but a drop in an enormous ocean .
Our nation is the Arabic nation that stretches from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea and beyond it .....
The P.L.O. is fighting Israel in the name of Pan-Arabism .
What you call " Jordan " is nothing more than Palestine . "
Such revelations are an eye - opener for anyone who has not understood until today the masked - ball being run by the Arabs :
The true meaning of Arafat 's words , that " Palestine is Jordan , " is that for the Arabic people , living under the " Pan - Arab " umbrella , in addition to over twenty Arabic countries , there is already a country called Jordan that was established by the British for the Arabs on 77 % of the Land of Israel , promised to the Jewish People by the League of Nations in 1922 .
Anywhere else on earth , would an additional country be established for a people that already has twenty - one countries ?
All the same , there is nothing like the testimony of the founder of the P.L.O. himself , Ahmed Shukari .
Already in 1956 he proclaimed from the podium of the U.N. , as the Arab League 's ambassador there , that
" such a creature as Palestine does not exist at all .
This land is nothing but the southern portion of Greater Syria ... "
And if Ahmed Shukari says that Palestine does not exist at all , the logical inference is that " Palestinians " do not exist at all either .
That same Shukari was born of a Turkish mother in Lebanon , was himself a Jordanian lawyer , served as the ambassador of Syria to the U.N. , the ambassador of the Arab League to the U.N. , and the ambassador of Saudi Arabia to the U.N .
In 1964 , after this talented actor who changed loyalties like a chameleon was fired by the Saudis , Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser hired him to found the " Palestine Liberation Organization " , the P.L.O. , an organization dedicated to the liberation of a country that in his own words did not exist at all .
All the prominent spokesman of that poor , homeless " people " say openly :
The Arabs who live in Eretz Yisrael are precisely the same Arabs who live in Syria , Jordan or Lebanon .
They are not a separate country , but a fragment of the enormous Arab nation divided amongst many Arab countries .
In their identity they are Arabs and the invention of Palestine is just a transparent bluff : " a means for continuing our struggle against the State of Israel for our Arab unity " .
Can any testimony be better than that of the Arabs themselves , exposing the lies and deception involved in Palestine 's creation ?
Yet the most compelling argument for the idea that the " Palestinian People " is a fraudulent invention , and that the Arabs are all one people , was expounded by none other than Mr. Husseini , head of the Supreme Arab Committee , to the U.N. special committee that was deliberating on Eretz Yisrael in 1947 :
" An additional consideration of great importance for the Arab world is racial uniformity .
The Arabs lived in a broad expanse stretching from the Mediterranean Sea to the Indian Ocean .
They spoke one language , and shared a common history , tradition and aspirations .
Their unity was the solid foundation for peace in one of the most central and sensitive regions in the world .
For that reason , it does not make sense that the United Nations should facilitate the establishment of a foreign entity within that well - rooted unity . "
Indeed , Mr. Husseini is correct .
His declaration before the investigative committee of the United Nations exposes the simple fact that there is no " Palestinian " language and no unique " Palestinian " culture .
The Palestinians are Arabs , and they cannot be set apart from the Jordanians , Syrians , Lebanese , Iraqis , etc .
Remove from the argument the lies and untruths and you reveal that the conflict is taking place between the Arabic , Muslim empire of twenty - one states and the Jewish People , claiming their right to their one and only historic homeland , consisting of less than one fifth of one percent of the lands under Arab control .
This is the twisted story of the biggest , most unprecedented fraud in history .
It involves such a successful bluff that many people have no doubt about its veracity .
This propaganda has become a powerful weapon by which means Israel 's enemies , the Arabs , are trying to conquer Eretz Yisrael without firing a shot , without an army , tanks or jets .
Part II –– The Arabs ' Ultimate Goal
Following the Six Day War , the Arab countries , defeated by a small county determined to survive , understood that Israel would be impossible to beat militarily .
They understood that the Israeli Samson would be possible to beat only by way of the cunning of the Philistine Delilah .
And that 's what happened ....
No longer would there be cries firing up the masses to genocide , but rather , sophistication ...
A melody carefully aimed at the delicate western ear .
The Arabs discovered that from a propaganda standpoint , it was easier to convince world public opinion of the rights of the poor , small , deprived " Palestinian People " to its own state , than to justify the demand of the enormous Arab empire for an addition of territory from a tiny country fighting for its life .
The Palestinian People is a fabrication invented with aforethought as a psychological weapon of Arab countries defeated in battle , a " Trojan Horse " for conquering Eretz Yisrael , as Feisel Husseini said after the Oslo Accords .
So was born the worldwide propaganda campaign that turned matters on their head .
The Israeli " David " against the Arab " Goliath " was transformed , by way of sophisticated propaganda , into the Israeli " Goliath " oppressing the Palestinian " David " .
The object of this propaganda is to blot out and forget the name and identity of the ancient , Biblical Eretz Yisrael , and to transform it into the land of " the Palestinian People " fabricated by Arab propaganda .
By such means did their false propaganda gain such a strong foothold in the media and the bastions of liberalism that no one has paid any attention to the simple truths spoken openly by Zahir Muhsein , Assad , Shukari , King Hussein or Arafat .
By means of brainwashing , fabrications , lies , falsification , and taking advantage of the world 's ignorance and the international media 's superficiality , a process has been taking place in broad daylight , for several dozen years already , of counterfeiting and blotting out history .
And just as Goebbels and Hitler , the arch propagandists of the 20th century said derisively , the bigger the lie , the more people will believe in it .
Fulfilling the demands of the Palestinian lie , will put an end to the identity of Eretz Yisrael .
Following the loss of the Land 's identity , will come the loss of our right to the land .
For , if there are " Palestinians " , that implies that there is also a land called Palestine , and if there is a Palestine ... then there is no Eretz Yisrael .
The most terrible part is that large sectors of Israel , itself , have already fallen into the Arab propaganda trap .
It is they who are opening the door to the Trojan horse that will destroy the identity of Eretz Yisrael .
This is a war that is not being waged by means of weapons and armies , or over physical territory .
It is being waged on the battlefields of awareness of the Land 's identity .
The Roman name " Philistia " was a fiction invented by the Roman emperor Hadrian after the Bar Kochba Revolt in 135 C.E. , a fiction of Hadrian then , and a fiction of the Arabs today , to the same degree .
It is a fabrication that represents no people , not then and not today .
It is a sophisticated fiction invented for one purpose and one purpose alone : to wipe out a land 's identity .
If the land is called Palestine , then the Jewish people are occupiers .
If the land is called Eretz Yisrael , then the Arabs are occupiers .
This is the essence of the Arab propaganda war , which is intended to steal the identity of Eretz Yisrael and to transform it into Palestine , and by such means to turn the Jewish people into occupiers of Eretz Yisrael .
That 's the whole story .
Now it 's already clear .
The Palestinian identity is tactical , artificial and temporary .
It is just a tool in the pan -Arab struggle against Israel .
The amazing thing is that it 's all out in the open .
Section 12 of the Palestinian charter summarizes the idea of this temporary identity , by stating that :
" The Palestinian people believes in Arab unification .
It believes that in order to fulfill its task towards achieving this goal , it must , at this stage of its national struggle , preserve all the components of its Palestinian personality , and it must increase awareness of its existence , and reject all plans liable to weaken it or make it disappear . "
Is there another people in the world that writes in its charter of self - definition the expression " at this stage " ?
And what will be in the next stage ?
Obviously , after conquering Israel , the territory will be divided up between Arab countries , and those Arab countries themselves will throw Palestine into the wastebasket of history .
As Arafat said , the Palestinian people are a fiction .
The same is true regarding the Jordanian people , and all the other Arabic speaking peoples in the Middle East .
These are not peoples with separate identities , but part of the great Arab nation .
Only that has a true identity .
By their self - definition , they cannot be divided up into a number of peoples with individual identities .
Rather , they constitute one nation consisting of many states , as Arafat himself said to Arianna Palazzi in an incautious moment .
For the sophisticated Saudis , with their Saudi Peace Plan , it is clear that its purpose is not to actualize the rights of the Palestinian people to self - determination , for no such people exists .
They conceal the truth that the great Arab nation has already actualized its right to self - determination by establishing a large number of countries , one of which extends over about 78 % of the area of mandatory Eretz Yisrael .
For the Arabs , exploding with laughter over the foolishness of the West , it is clear that if an additional Arab state arises in the western portion of Eretz Yisrael , that will not serve the right of self - determination , but the demand of imperial conquest of all Eretz Yisrael by the Arab nation .
Is George Bush dragging Israel to its destruction ?
The Palestinian fabrication is exposed precisely when we listen to authentic Arab voices .
The prominent Arab historian , Dr. Philip Hitti , who expressed himself at the Anglo - American commission of inquiry in the State Department building in 1947 , said as follows :
" Sir , Palestine never existed throughout history .
Absolutely not ! "
Moreover , Professor Juhan Hazam , in his testimony before that same commission , added :
" Before 1917 , when Balfour made his declaration , there had never been a Palestinian question , and there was no Palestine as a political or geographic unit . "
Also a local Arab leader , Abd al - Mahdi , testified before the Peele Commission in 1937 as follows :
" There is no such land .
Palestine is a term invented by the Zionists .
There is no Palestine in the Bible .
Our land was for hundreds of years a part of Syria . "
Indeed , this is a picture of the real situation in 1918 and at the start of the British conquest of Eretz Yisrael ...
Were there any trace of truth to the claim regarding the historicity of a Palestinian People , we should certainly have expected to find mention of it in the history books and encyclopedias , as well as in archaeological research .
Part III –– Will Israel finish Hadrian 's Work ?
Thus , the way to Palestinian Hell was paved with the good intentions of Christian Zionists like Lord Balfour , the British foreign secretary .
In the Balfour declaration , and by the decree of the Mandate , they decided , based on historic rights , to grant Eretz Yisrael to the Jewish people .
Yet they called it Hadrian 's Roman name , Palestine , which had originally had the precise intention of blotting it off the map .
From that moment on , the way was prepared for the birth of the Palestinian fiction .
The name Palestine , by which the British accidentally called the land , bore the seeds of destruction of the Palestinian bluff , as if the entire Land was the stolen property of the Palestinian people , an ancient , rooted people , thousands of years old .
This was such an incredible but successful fabrication that large portions of Israeli society fell into its snare .
In the report presented in 1938 to the League of Nations , the British made it very clear :
" The name ' Palestine ' is not a country but a geographic region . ' "
No one could have imagined in 1917 , at the time of the Balfour declaration during WWI , that anyone would use the name Palestine to create a monstrous , hostile , false identity , for propaganda purposes , and would engrave on their flag the destruction of Israel .
The reporter and writer Joan Peters , in her book From Time Immemorial , writes ,
" The one and only identity never adopted [ by the inhabitants of Eretz Yisrael ] before 1967 was that of ' Palestinian Arab ' . "
The Palestinian lie was not hatched by any land or any people , but by a map , a map drawn by two European colonial ministers , an Englishman , Herman Sykes , and a Frenchman , George Picot , and on the map was written ... " Palestine " .
It was clear to the British that Palestine as a sovereign political unit had never existed .
No nation had ever borne its name .
No people had ever prayed for its welfare .
It was a name that had n't existed at all for 1300 years , ironically , precisely when Muslim empires were dominant .
" Palestine " was a Roman political fabrication that had faded and disappeared together with the empire that had created it .
The Land regained independence only when the name Eretz Yisrael [ the Land of Israel ] , the name in the hearts of the first Zionists , was restored to it .
Had not this identity been preserved by the Jewish People , and had it not been preserved in the hearts of the Christian Bible - loving nations who made up the League of Nations , the national rebirth of the Jewish People might never have taken place .
This is the substance of the war being waged on millions of television screens throughout the world .
It is being waged over the identity of Eretz Yisrael .
It is being waged by means of all the media , and it seems as though the Arabs have the upper hand , while Israel leaves an impression of impotence , of not yet having even identified the battlefield on which its fate will be sealed .
While Israel prepares jets and tanks for a military struggle , Israel 's enemies are preparing their weapons for the final battle , for sticking the last dagger into the back of a State of Israel that does not understand and is not even ready for this battle .
Unless Israel prepares for this battle , comes to an understanding of its complexity and frees itself from the false terminologies and constant brainwashing , Israel will be defeated and its land will be irrevocably taken from it .
Will Israel , which valiantly vanquished all the Arab armies when they attacked it also know how to face this propaganda attack that is threatening to destroy it ?
It would seem as though the battle is already decided .
The Arab propaganda has already penetrated the nervous system and destroyed the immune system that defended the Jewish People for 2000 years , with even the Israeli Prime Minister and Foreign Minister saying that " Israel 's interest is to establish a Palestinian state " ...
In other words , what they want is for the Bible to be rewritten and for King David 's land of the Bible to become the land of Goliath the Philistine .
Could anything be more insane ?
Is there another nation on earth that behaves this way ?
Is it possible that Israel will be beaten without a single shot being fired , simply handing over their land to a wretched fabrication , a coarse , primitive , charlatan canard , a deception that conceals the destruction that the Arabs are preparing for Israel ?
Could Israel 's leaders be too blind to see the danger looming of the Land 's Jewish identity being lost ?
Will precisely the vision of the prophets , fulfilled with the establishment of the State of Israel , bring with it the destruction of the identity of the Jewish People 's land , and lead to its exchange for the false identity of Hadrian 's Palestine ?
When lies are repeated many times , they become true .
Such a lie is the fabrication regarding the existence of a historic Palestinian identity .
That false identity , which began with Hadrian 's curse and that was revived by Lord Balfour , has become a first rate propaganda tool .
It became that the moment the Arabs understood the potential of destroying the identity of Eretz Yisrael , and with it the identity of the People of Israel , whose name bears the stamp of ownership of the Land .
The struggle against Israel was the glue that bound the Arab world , otherwise sunken in endless internal quarrels .
The Arabs ' aim in fabricating Palestine was not to build a nation but to annihilate a nation .
Yet to conceal that plan , they invented the plan of " phases " .
The first phase is the invention of a " Palestinian People " .
The second phase is the liquidation of Israel , weakened and wearied after Oslo .
By such means did the Arabs conceal their genocidal intent with a " new tool " , in the words of Zahir Muhsein , for conquering Eretz Yisrael without firing a shot .
All of these lies and falsehoods , this whole " costume ball " is being marketed by the media , which is turning out to be an obsessive collaborator with the biggest lie on earth .
Precisely this Hadrian understood .
That 's why he chose the name Palestine .
Precisely this is understood as well by Hadrian 's heirs –– the Arab propagandists who through their use of this false name sever the historic tie between the People and the Land of Israel .
Without doing that , it would be impossible to use the word " conquest " –– could a people be considered the conqueror of its own land ?
The question Israel faces is this :
Will the Jews forego the name and the identity of their Biblical land ?
Will the Christian world agree to concede on the identity of the cradle of western civilization , the holy land , Eretz Yisrael ?
It 's the twist of fate that for all this to happen , the Jews had to vanquish Hadrian completely , return to their land , establish sovereignty , resurrect the Hebrew language , establish a mighty army , industry , the best agriculture on earth , hi-tech , culture , song , dance , reestablish a nation , rebuild Jerusalem as their capital and settle every town and village that Hadrian destroyed .
Could we have possibly come full circle ?
Will Hadrian 's curse , which did n't succeed for 1800 year , precisely when Israel was in exile from their land , succeed just now , with Israel 's return ?
Will it be precisely the Israeli government that will resurrect Hadrian 's curse , previously lost in the depths of forgetfulness ?
Today , 1800 years later , an Israeli Prime Minister is calling for fulfilling what Hadrian failed to do –– the erasure of Eretz Yisrael and the establishment of Palestine .
The Emperor Hadrian is smiling from the grave .

This is a time to condemn the bankers , not to embrace them .
They are the scoundrels who got us into the biggest economic mess since the Great Depression , lining their own pockets while destroying the life savings of those who trusted them .
Yet both of our leading presidential candidates are scrambling to enlist not only the big - dollar contributions but , more frighteningly , the “ expertise ” of the very folks who advocated the financial industry deregulations at the heart of this meltdown .
Republican candidate John McCain even appointed as his campaign co-chairman Phil Gramm , who went from being chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , where he sponsored disastrous legislation that empowered the banking bandits , to becoming one of them at UBS Warburg .
Gramm was forced to resign from McCain ’s campaign only after he went public with his contempt for the financial concerns of ordinary Americans , calling them “ whiners ” and perpetrators of a “ mental recession . ”
But Gramm and the Republicans could n’t have done it without the support of leading Democrats .
The most egregious of Gramm ’s legislative favors to the financiers took the form of legislation named in part after him — the Gramm - Leach - Bliley Act , which became law only after then - Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin prevailed upon President Clinton to sign the bill .
The bill ’s immediate major effect was to legitimize the long - sought merger between Citibank and insurance giant Travelers .
Rubin ’s critical support for the bill was rewarded with an appointment , within days of its passage , to a top job at Citibank ( later Citigroup ) paying more than $ 15 million a year .
That is the same Rubin with whom Democratic candidate Barack Obama met , along with other influential advisers , on Tuesday to figure out what to do about the sorry state of our economy .
But what in the world did he expect to learn from Rubin ?
And why did he appoint Rubin ’s protégé , Jason Furman , who ran the Rubin - funded Hamilton Project , to be the Obama campaign ’s economic director ?
Hopefully , during their encounter Tuesday , Rubin offered himself as a contrite model of everything that the candidate of change needs to change .
After all , Goldman Sachs , where Rubin spent 25 years of his business career before entering the Clinton administration , has been one of the prime corporate villains in the financial shenanigans that led to the subprime mortgage scandal .
As co-chairman of the firm , surely he had knowledge of the financial hanky - panky that would prove so disastrous down the road .
Indeed , as Treasury secretary , he favored an extension of the deregulation that enabled this explosion of banking avarice .
Not surprisingly , the current Treasury secretary , Henry Paulson , also previously headed Goldman .
When Rubin assumed a top position at Citibank after his stint at the Treasury , he was not above influencing his former employees in the government .
In one notorious instance during the fall of 2001 , when Enron was going down the tubes Rubin telephoned a Treasury undersecretary and asked him to consider intervening with credit - rating agencies to hold off downgrading Enron ’s ratings .
When the story was leaked , some media accounts noted the possibility of a conflict of interest because Enron owed Citibank $ 750 million , which it could not pay if bankrupt .
Despite his skills and his vaunted position as Citibank ’s chairman , Rubin was not spared the disastrous consequences of Citibank ’s own wild financial manipulations , which , if anything , exceeded those of Enron .
Tens of billions in bad mortgage and credit card debt placed the bank at the forefront of the current economic crisis , and so it is weird that Obama would now turn to Rubin for advice .
It ’s even weirder that the presumptive Democratic nominee would pick Rubin ’s man Furman as his campaign economic director at a time when cleaning up the mess left by the bankers is the highest priority .
Furman hardly distinguished himself four years ago in that role in John Kerry ’s failed presidential campaign , with its muffled economic message that could not be blamed on the candidate ’s stiff style alone .
The bigger problem is that folks such as Rubin and Furman , perhaps best known as an economist for his bold but woefully misguided defense of the Wal - Mart business model , clearly do not feel the pain of the voters who are losing their homes .
But then again , why should Rubin , or Gramm on the Republican side , be expected to care when he has made so many millions off the suffering of those voters ?
Not good at a time when we need a presidential candidate who sticks it to the bankers instead of sucking up to them .
Robert Scheer is author of a new book , “ The Pornography of Power : How Defense Hawks Hijacked 9/11 and Weakened America . ”
Imagine windows that not only provide a clear view and illuminate rooms , but also use sunlight to efficiently help power the building they are part of .
MIT engineers report a new approach to harnessing the sun 's energy that could allow just that .
The work , reported in the July 11 issue of Science , involves the creation of a novel " solar concentrator . "
" Light is collected over a large area [ like a window ] and gathered , or concentrated , at the edges , " explains Marc A. Baldo , leader of the work and the Esther and Harold E. Edgerton Career Development Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering .
As a result , rather than covering a roof with expensive solar cells ( the semiconductor devices that transform sunlight into electricity ) , the cells only need to be around the edges of a flat glass panel .
In addition , the focused light increases the electrical power obtained from each solar cell " by a factor of over 40 , " Baldo says .
Because the system is simple to manufacture , the team believes that it could be implemented within three years -- even added onto existing solar - panel systems to increase their efficiency by 50 percent for minimal additional cost .
That , in turn , would substantially reduce the cost of solar electricity .
In addition to Baldo , the researchers involved are Michael Currie , Jon Mapel , and Timothy Heidel , all graduate students in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science , and Shalom Goffri , a postdoctoral associate in MIT 's Research Laboratory of Electronics .
" Professor Baldo 's project utilizes innovative design to achieve superior solar conversion without optical tracking , " says Dr. Aravinda Kini , program manager in the Office of Basic Energy Sciences in the U.S. Department of Energy 's Office of Science , a sponsor of the work .
" This accomplishment demonstrates the critical importance of innovative basic research in bringing about revolutionary advances in solar energy utilization in a cost - effective manner . "
Solar concentrators in use today " track the sun to generate high optical intensities , often by using large mobile mirrors that are expensive to deploy and maintain , " Baldo and colleagues write in Science .
Further , " solar cells at the focal point of the mirrors must be cooled , and the entire assembly wastes space around the perimeter to avoid shadowing neighboring concentrators . "
The MIT solar concentrator involves a mixture of two or more dyes that is essentially painted onto a pane of glass or plastic .
The dyes work together to absorb light across a range of wavelengths , which is then re-emitted at a different wavelength and transported across the pane to waiting solar cells at the edges .
In the 1970s , similar solar concentrators were developed by impregnating dyes in plastic .
But the idea was abandoned because , among other things , not enough of the collected light could reach the edges of the concentrator .
Much of it was lost en route .
The MIT engineers , experts in optical techniques developed for lasers and organic light - emitting diodes , realized that perhaps those same advances could be applied to solar concentrators .
The result ?
A mixture of dyes in specific ratios , applied only to the surface of the glass , that allows some level of control over light absorption and emission .
" We made it so the light can travel a much longer distance , " Mapel says .
" We were able to substantially reduce light transport losses , resulting in a tenfold increase in the amount of power converted by the solar cells . "
This work was also supported by the National Science Foundation .
Baldo is also affiliated with MIT 's Research Laboratory of Electronics , Microsystems Technology Laboratories , and Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies .
Mapel , Currie and Goffri are starting a company , Covalent Solar , to develop and commercialize the new technology .
Earlier this year Covalent Solar won two prizes in the MIT $ 100K Entrepreneurship Competition .
The company placed first in the Energy category ( $ 20,000 ) and won the Audience Judging Award ( $ 10,000 ) , voted on by all who attended the awards .
WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that it was extending its emergency borrowing program to Wall Street firms and was taking other steps to ease a tight credit market that has hobbled the national economy .
The Fed said the program , in which investment houses can tap the central bank for a quick source of cash , will be available through Jan. 30 .
Originally the program , started on March 17 , was supposed to last until mid-September .
Another program , in which investment firms can temporarily swap more risky investments for safer Treasury securities , also will continue through Jan. 30 , the Fed said .
It also will let commercial banks , in a separate program , bid on cash loans that last longer  for 84 days  besides the 28 - day loans now available .
The Fed said it was taking these steps “ in light of continued fragile circumstances in financial markets . ”

OH MY GOD !
Watch what happens when McCain comes back from Colombia with the just released hostages on his new jet with his name painted on the side !!!
Was this the most obviously set - up photo - op in history , or what ?
I just watched Joe Scarborough and guests on MSNBC rail against McCain for taking his campaign to Bogota - mocking him for doing so .
It 's frickin obvious why he did now .
It was ALL prearranged .
How Effin disingenuous is this ?
If Obama does n't totally call him on it , he 's part of the machine that is enabling it .
McCain will counter that he 's a conspiracy theorist , but it 's time to give the conspiracy theorists their due .
THEY'VE BEEN RIGHT !
IT IS A CONSPIRACY .
UNBELIEVABLE !

Karl Rove set up this entire McCain / Colombia Made - For -CNN charade for McCain 's political benefit .
ONLY Karl Rove could have conceived of this stunt .
Count on the fact this is targeted at the Hispanic voters in America , who are watching on Spanish language TV .
Rove is absolutely running strategy for McCain , and Bush is 100 % complicit for his manipulation of world events for McCain 's political advantage .
A hostage release timed for political gain ?
Gee , which party perfected that ?
McCain just ran an ad on CNN at the conclusion of CNN's Live Coverage of the release of the hostages in Bogata .
Are you a coincidence theorist , or can you just admit that this entire government has been co-opted ?

This Colombia drama hits on the exact same day that his campaign announces a shake up ( thereby burying it under the bigger news ) ?
And now the hostages will be flown to San Antonio TEXAS ?

It would seem to me that FOX has set itself up for a huge defamation of character suit .
To picture someone in an intentionally altered and obviously distorted depiction HAS TO BE a crime .
( lawyers please comment )
The pictures use distorted features to express a faulted character or even deformed genetics and certainly a freakishness .
The dark circles under the eyes , simian nose etc etc .
An impartial jury would surely see the negative and vindictive intentions sought by FOX .
A great case with huge publicity potential further exposing this criminal network for its propaganda and lies .

The food that people eat is just as important as what kind of cars they drive when it comes to creating the greenhouse - gas emissions that many scientists have linked to global warming , according to a report accepted for publication in the journal Earth Interactions .
Both the burning of fossil fuels during food production and non-carbon dioxide emissions associated with livestock and animal waste contribute to the problem , the University of Chicago 's Gidon Eshel and Pamela Martin wrote in the report .
The average American diet requires the production of an extra ton and a half of carbon dioxide - equivalent , in the form of actual carbon dioxide as well as methane and other greenhouse gases compared to a strictly vegetarian diet , according to Eshel and Martin .
And with Earth Day approaching on April 22 , cutting down on just a few eggs or hamburgers each week is an easy way to reduce greenhouse - gas emissions , they said .
" We neither make a value judgment nor do we make a categorical statement , " said Eshel , an Assistant Professor in Geophysical Sciences .
" We say that however close you can be to a vegan diet and further from the mean American diet , the better you are for the planet .
It does n't have to be all the way to the extreme end of vegan .
If you simply cut down from two burgers a week to one , you 've already made a substantial difference . "
The average American drives 8,322 miles by car annually , emitting 1.9 to 4.7 tons of carbon dioxide , depending on the vehicle model and fuel efficiency .
Meanwhile , Americans also consume an average of 3,774 calories of food each day .
In 2002 , energy used for food production accounted for 17 percent of all fossil fuel use in the United States .
And the burning of these fossil fuels emitted three - quarters of a ton of carbon dioxide per person .
That alone amounts to approximately one - third the average greenhouse - gas emissions of personal transportation .
But livestock production and associated animal waste also emit greenhouse gases not associated with fossil - fuel combustion , primarily methane and nitrous oxide .
" An example would be manure lagoons that are associated with large - scale pork production , " Eshel said .
" Those emit a lot of nitrous oxide into the atmosphere . "

While methane and nitrous oxide are relatively rare compared with carbon dioxide , they are -- molecule for molecule - - far more powerful greenhouse gases than carbon dioxide .
A single pound of methane , for example , has the same greenhouse effect as approximately 50 pounds of carbon dioxide .
In their study , Eshel and Martin compared the energy consumption and greenhouse - gas emissions that underlie five diets : average American , red meat , fish , poultry and vegetarian ( including eggs and dairy ) , all equaling 3,774 calories per day .
The vegetarian diet turned out to be the most energy - efficient , followed by poultry and the average American diet .
Fish and red meat virtually tied as the least efficient .
The impact of producing fish came as the study 's biggest surprise to Martin , an Assistant Professor in Geophysical Sciences .
" Fish can be from one extreme to the other , " Martin said .
Sardines and anchovies flourish near coastal areas and can be harvested with minimal energy expenditure .
But swordfish and other large predatory species required energy - intensive long - distance voyages .
Martin and Eshel 's research indicated that plant - based diets are healthier for people as well as for the planet .
" The adverse effects of dietary animal fat intake on cardiovascular diseases is by now well established .
Similar effects are also seen when meat , rather than fat , intake is considered , " Martin and Eshel wrote .
" To our knowledge , there is currently no credible evidence that plant - based diets actually undermine health ; the balance of available evidence suggests that plant - based diets are at the very least just as safe as mixed ones , and most likely safer . "

In their next phase of research , Eshel and Martin will examine the energy expenditures associated with small organic farms , to see if they offer a healthier planetary alternative to large agribusiness companies .
Such farms typically provide the vegetables sufficient to support 200 to 300 families on plots of five to 10 acres .
" We 're starting to investigate whether you can downscale food production and be efficient that way , " Martin said .
Chinese activists say they also fought against apartheid The High Court in South Africa has ruled that Chinese South Africans are to be reclassified as black people .
It made the order so that ethnic Chinese can benefit from government policies aimed at ending white domination in the private sector .
The Chinese Association of South Africa took the government to court , saying its members had been discriminated against .
An estimated 200,000 ethnic Chinese live in South Africa .
The association said their members often failed to qualify for business contracts and job promotions because they were regarded as whites .
The association said Chinese South Africans had faced widespread discrimination during the years of apartheid when they had been classified as people of mixed race .
The BBC's Mpho Lakaje in Johannesburg says the Broad - Based Economic Empowerment and the Employment Equity Acts were designed to eradicate the legacy of apartheid which left many black people impoverished .
The laws give people classed as blacks , Indians and coloureds ( mixed - race ) employment and other economic benefits over other racial groups .
The Black Economic Employment concept was initiated by the governing ANC to help previously disadvantaged individuals - to start their own businesses or become part of existing companies - thus redressing the country 's historic inequalities .
Whites still on top
Our correspondent says the ruling provides clarity for corporations in South Africa on the rights of their Chinese staff - who were declared " coloured " under apartheid but are generally regarded as white today .
An example cited in court papers includes an oil company that disqualified Chinese citizens from getting a slice of its biggest empowerment transaction to date .
The company says the group is not catered for in the Black Economic Empowerment codes .
Another example includes a Chinese national who was refused an opportunity to buy shares from the Johannesburg Stock Exchange two years ago .
None of the three government departments cited as respondents in the court case opposed the application .
A study released last month revealed that white South Africans still earn around 450 % more than their black counterparts , 14 years after the end of apartheid .

What are these ?
We know truth - seekers should not knowingly disagree about facts .
Many are eager to justify their disagreements , however , by noting that values infuse most common disputed topics , such as politics , morality , music , and so on .
And yes , there may be nothing irrational about you preferring chocolate while another prefers strawberry .
But while it may not be problematic to have differing opinions on values , it is problematic to argue about opinions due to values .
In arguments , people commonly offer reasons , such as evidence , analysis , and compelling examples , to support their opinions .
Furthermore , people think these reasons should have a good chance to be persuasive , to induce reasonable listeners to change their mind in the suggested direction .
We are often surprised and indignant to see others unpersuaded by what we consider strong arguments .
But if it were just a matter of each person having different values , why should arguments change our minds ?
If when you argue , you try to show people the bad consequences of the policies they endorse , then your dispute is on facts of those consequences .
If you try to show people that their values are at odds with other commonly accepted values , then your dispute is on facts of which values are at odds , or facts of whether these people embrace those other values .
More generally , if you think others are mistaken on their values , and that your reasons should help them see their true values , then your dispute is on facts of what are their actual values .
For the purposes of disagreement theory , a " fact " is any claim about which of many possibilities ( even " impossible " possibilities ) is the correct possibility .
And arguments provide info on possibilities , i.e. , on facts .
For example , the info most directly embodied in any argument you make is the fact that you actually made that argument .
This fact may also convince listeners to believe the facts that are the " content " of your argument , such as that certain observations have been made , or that certain claims are inconsistent with certain other claims .
All standard results about the irrationality of disagreement on facts apply to disagreements on any of these value meta - facts mentioned so far .
We expect truth - seekers to be unable to foresee how they disagree about any fact , and so our ability to foresee disagreements on value meta - facts , and our frustration at others ’ resistance to what we consider persuasive arguments , are clear signs that most if not all of us are not only truth - seekers .
In sum , it can make sense to have differing opinions due on differing values , but not to have arguments on differing values similar to our arguments on ordinary facts .
Such arguments indicate disagreement about facts , not just values .

Children of all ages should study philosophy in school to develop their critical thinking skills , education experts said today .
Academics suggest that , rather than start off with Socrates , teachers use common classroom disputes to help children learn about abstract philosophical principles such as fairness , morality and punishment .
They give the example of apportioning blame for spilling paint
The book Philosophy in Schools , edited by Dr Michael Hand of the Institute of Education and Dr Carrie Winstanley of Roehampton University , puts forward several arguments for including philosophy in the school curriculum .
" Critical thinkers are people who reason well , and who judge and act on the basis of their reasoning , " Hand says .
" To become critical thinkers , children must learn what constitutes good reasoning and why it 's important - and these are philosophical matters .
" Exposure to philosophy should be part of the basic educational entitlement of all children . "
In philosophy , the quality of arguments and the meanings of words are under constant scrutiny .
Winstanley said teachers could use popular books to initiate philosophical discussions .
For example , Where the Wild Things
Are could lead into debates on the existence of monsters , and why the main character 's mother sends him to his room without supper .
Winstanley said : " Better than any other subject , philosophy teaches children how to assess reasons , defend positions , define terms , evaluate sources of information and judge the value of arguments and evidence . "
Philosophy also allows younger children to engage in discussion and argument even before they know very much .
Children could grasp questions such as , ' Is it fair for a teacher to keep everyone in because someone has lost the scissors ? '
Winstanley said .
In one class , discussing heroism , eight - year - olds had raised the example of firefighters in the 9/11 attacks unprompted , she said .
Older pupils in secondary schools could look at the concepts in more depth and learn about the philosophers that had studied them .
" In knowledge - based subjects , discussion is dominated by the children with the most facts at their fingertips .
" Because philosophical questions cannot be settled by factual evidence , discussion does n't get derailed by missing knowledge or closed down by the introduction of new information . "
The book also includes essays on the role of philosophy in teaching controversial issues , such as abortion , conceptual analysis in the primary classroom , and the place of philosophical thinking in moral and religious education .
It also covers the idea of philosophical intelligence , philosophical themes in children 's literature , philosophy and the adolescent 's search for meaning , and the connection between philosophy and wisdom .

Creating Well - Behaved Decorators / " Decorator decorator "

Property Definition
These decorators provide a readable way to define properties :
1 import sys 2 3 def propget ( func ) : ) : 4 locals = sys .
_getframe ( 1 ) . f_locals ) . 5 name = func .
__name__ 6 prop = locals .
get ( name ) 7 if not isinstance ( prop , property ) : ) : 8 prop = property ( func , doc = func .
__doc__ ) 9 else : 10 doc = prop .
__doc__ or func .

Here 's a way that does n't require any new decorators :
1 class Example ( object ) : ) : 2 @apply 3 def myattr ( ) : ( ) : 4 doc = ' ''
This is the doc string .
''' 5 6 def fget ( self ) : ) : 7 return self .

Yet another property decorator :

Memoize
Here 's a memoizing class .
1 import collections 2 import functools 3 4 class memoized ( object ) : ) : 5 ''' Decorator .

Alternate memoize as nested functions
Here 's a memoizing function that works on functions , methods , or classes , and exposes the cache publicly .
1 2 def memoize ( obj ) : ) : 3 cache = obj .
cache = {} = {} 4 5 @functools .
wraps ( obj ) 6 def memoizer (* args , ** kwargs ) : ( * , **) : 7 if args not in cache : 8 cache [ args ] = obj (* args , ** kwargs ) ] =(* , ** 9 return cache [ args ] 10 return memoizer
Here 's a modified version that also respects kwargs .
1 def memoize ( obj ) : ) : 2 cache = obj .
cache = {} = {} 3 4 @functools .
wraps ( obj ) 5 def memoizer (* args , ** kwargs ) : ( * , **) : 6 key = str ( args ) + str ( kwargs ) ) + 7 if key not in cache : 8 cache [ key ] = obj (* args , ** kwargs ) ] =(* , ** 9 return cache [ key ] 10 return memoizer
Alternate memoize as dict subclass
This is an idea that interests me , but it only seems to work on functions :
1 class memoize ( dict ) : ) : 2 def __init__ ( self , func ) : ) : 3 self .
func = func 4 5 def __call__ ( self , * args ) : , *) : 6 return self [ args ] 7 8 def __missing__ ( self , key ) : ) : 9 result = self [ key ] = self .
func ( * key ) ] =(* 10 return result 11 12 13 14 15 16 >>> @memoize >>> 17 ... def foo ( a , b ) : ... ) : 18 ... return a * b ... 19 >>> foo ( 2 , 4 ) >>> 20 8 21 >>> foo >>> 22 {( 2 , 4 ) : 8 } {( ) : 23 >>> foo ( ' hi ' , 3 ) >>> 24 ' hihihi ' 25 >>> foo >>> 26 {( 2 , 4 ) : 8 , ( ' hi ' , 3 ) : ' hihihi ' } { ( ) : , ( ) :

Note :
There is only one drawback : wrapper checks its arguments for single function or class .
To avoid wrong behavior you can use keyword arguments instead of positional , e.g. :
1 @decorator 2 def my_property ( getter , * , setter = None , deleter = None , doc = None ) : , * , ) : 3 return property ( getter , setter , deleter , doc )

Pre-/Post - Conditions
1 ''' 2 Provide pre-/postconditions as function decorators .
3 4 Example usage : 5 6 >>> def in_ge20 ( inval ) : 7 ... assert inval >= 20 , ' Input value < 20 ' 8 ... 9 >>> def out_lt30 ( retval , inval ) : 10 ... assert retval < 30 , ' Return value >= 30 ' 11 ... 12 >>> @precondition(in_ge20 ) 13 ... @postcondition(out_lt30 ) 14 ... def inc( value ) : 15 ... return value + 1 16 ... 17 >>> inc(5 ) 18 Traceback ( most recent call last ) : 19 ... 20 AssertionError : Input value < 20 21 >>> in c( 29 ) 22 Traceback ( most recent call last ) : 23 ... 24 AssertionError : Return value >= 30 25 >>> in c( 20 ) 26 21 27 28
You can define as many pre-/postconditions for a function as you 29 like .
It is also possible to specify both types of conditions at once : 30 31 >>> @conditions ( in_ge20 , out_lt30 ) 32 ... def add1 ( value ) : 33 ... return value + 1 34 ... 35 >>> add 1(5 ) 36 Traceback ( most recent call last ) : 37 ... 38 AssertionError : Input value < 20 39 40
An interesting feature is the ability to prevent the creation of 41 pre-/postconditions at function definition time .
This makes it 42 possible to use conditions for debugging and then switch them off for 43 distribution .
44 45 >>> debug = False 46 >>> @precondition ( in_ge20 , debug ) 47 ... def dec( value ) : 48 ... return value - 1 49 ... 50 >>> dec(5 ) 51 4 52 ' '' 53 54 __all__ = [ ' precondition ' , ' postcondition ' , ' conditions ' ] = [ 55 56 DEFAULT_ON = True 57 58 def precondition ( precondition , use_conditions = DEFAULT_ON ) : ) : 59 return conditions ( precondition , None , use_conditions ) 60 61 def postcondition ( postcondition , use_conditions = DEFAULT_ON ) : ) : 62 return conditions ( None , postcondition , use_conditions ) 63 64 class conditions ( object ) : ) : 65 __slots__ = ( ' __precondition ' , ' __postcondition ' ) = ( 66 67 def __init__ ( self , pre , post , use_conditions = DEFAULT_ON ) : ) : 68 if not use_conditions : 69 pre , post = None , None 70 71 self .

Line Tracing Individual Functions
I cobbled this together from the trace module .
It allows you to decorate individual functions so their lines are traced .
I think it works out to be a slightly smaller hammer than running the trace module and trying to pare back what it traces using exclusions .

Type Enforcement ( accepts / returns )
Provides various degrees of type enforcement for function parameters and return values .
1 ''' 2
One of three degrees of enforcement may be specified by passing 3 the ' debug ' keyword argument to the decorator : 4 0 -- NONE : No type - checking .
Decorators disabled .
5 #! python 6 -- MEDIUM : Print warning message to stderr .
( Default ) 7 2 -- STRONG : Raise TypeError with message .
8
If ' debug ' is not passed to the decorator , the default level is used .
9 10 Example usage : 11 >>>
NONE , MEDIUM , STRONG = 0 , 1 , 2 12 >>> 13 >>> @accepts ( int , int , int ) 14 ... @returns ( float ) 15 ... def average( x , y , z ) : 16 ... return ( x + y + z ) / 2 17 ... 18 >>> average ( 5.5 , 10 , 15.0 ) 19 TypeWarning : ' average ' method accepts ( int , int , int ) , but was given 20 ( float , int , float ) 21 15.25 22 >>> average ( 5 , 10 , 15 ) 23 TypeWarning : ' average ' method returns ( float ) , but result is ( int ) 24 15 25 26 Needed to cast params as floats in function def ( or simply divide by 2.0 ) .

CGI method wrapper
Handles HTML boilerplate at top and bottom of pages returned from CGI methods .
Works with the cgi module .
Now your request handlers can just output the interesting HTML , and let the decorator deal with all the top and bottom clutter .
( Note : the exception handler eats all exceptions , which in CGI is no big loss , since the program runs in its separate subprocess .
At least here , the exception contents will be written to the output page . )

State Machine Implementaion
A much improved version of decorators for implementing state machines , too long to show here , is at State Machine via Decorators
This example uses Decorators to facilitate the implementation of a state machine in Python .
Decorators are used to specify which methods are the event handlers for the class .
In this example , actions are associated with the transitions , but it is possible with a little consideration to associate actions with states instead .
The example defines a class , MyMachine that is a state machine .
Multiple instances of the class may be instantiated with each maintaining its own state .
A class also may have multiple states .
Here I 've used gstate and tstate .
The code in the imported statedefn file gets a bit hairy , but you may not need to delve into it for your application .

This implementation replaces the descriptor by the actual decorated function ASAP to avoid overhead , but you could keep it to do even more ( counting calls , etc . .. )
Another Retrying Decorator
Here 's another decorator for causing a function to be retried a certain number of times .
This decorator is superior IMHO because it should work with any old function that raises an exception on failure .
Features :
Works with any function that signals failure by raising an exception ( I.E. just about any function )
Supports retry delay and backoff
User can specify which exceptions are caught for retrying .
E.g. networking code might be expected to raise SocketError in the event of communications difficulties , while any other exception likely indicates a bug in the code .
Hook for custom logging
GIST : https://gist.github.com/2570004
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 import sys 24 from time import sleep 25 26 27 def example_exc_handler ( tries_remaining , exception , delay ) : ) : 28 " " " Example exception handler ; prints a warning to stderr .
29 30 tries_remaining :
The number of tries remaining .
31 exception :
The exception instance which was raised .
32 " " " 33 print >> sys .
stderr , " Caught ' %s ' , %d tries remaining , sleeping for %s seconds " % ( exception , tries_remaining , delay ) >>% ( 34 35 36 def retries ( max_tries , delay = 1 , backoff = 2 , exceptions =( Exception , ) , hook = None ) : =( , ) , ) : 37 " " " Function decorator implementing retrying logic .
38 39 delay : Sleep this many seconds * backoff * try number after failure 40 backoff : Multiply delay by this factor after each failure 41 exceptions :
A tuple of exception classes ; default ( Exception , ) 42 hook : A function with the signature myhook ( tries_remaining , exception ) ; 43 default None 44 45
The decorator will call the function up to max_tries times if it raises 46 an exception .
47 48 By default it catches instances of the Exception class and subclasses .
49 This will recover after all but the most fatal errors .
You may specify a 50 custom tuple of exception classes with the ' exceptions ' argument ; the 51 function will only be retried if it raises one of the specified 52 exceptions .
53 54 Additionally you may specify a hook function which will be called prior 55 to retrying with the number of remaining tries and the exception instance ; 56 see given example .
This is primarily intended to give the opportunity to 57 log the failure .
Hook is not called after failure if no retries remain .
58 " " " 59 def dec ( func ) : ) : 60 def f2 (* args , ** kwargs ) : (* , **) : 61 mydelay = delay 62 tries = range ( max_tries ) 63 tries . reverse ( ) ( ) 64 for tries_remaining in tries : 65 try : 66 return func (* args , ** kwargs ) (* , ** 67 except exceptions as e : 68 if tries_remaining >
0 : 69 if hook is not None : 70 hook ( tries_remaining , e , mydelay ) 71 sleep ( mydelay ) 72 mydelay = mydelay * backoff 73 else : 74 raise 75 else : 76 break 77 return f2 78 return dec
Logging decorator with specified logger ( or default )
This decorator will log entry and exit points of your funtion using the specified logger or it defaults to your function 's module name logger .
In the current form it uses the logging .
INFO level , but I can easily customized to use what ever level .
Same for the entry and exit messages .
1 import functools , logging 2 3 4 log = logging .
getLogger ( __name__ ) 5 log .
setLevel ( logging .
DEBUG ) 6 7 class log_with ( object ) : ) : 8 ''' Logging decorator that allows you to log with a 9 specific logger .

Lazy Thunkify
This decorator will cause any function to , instead of running its code , start a thread to run the code , returning a thunk ( function with no args ) that wait for the function 's completion and returns the value ( or raises the exception ) .
Useful if you have Computation A that takes x seconds and then uses Computation B , which takes y seconds .
Instead of x+y seconds you only need max ( x , y ) seconds .
1 import threading , sys , functools , traceback 2 3 def lazy_thunkify ( f ) : ) : 4 " " " Make a function immediately return a function of no args which , when called , 5 waits for the result , which will start being processed in another thread . " " "
6 7 @functools .wraps ( f ) 8 def lazy_thunked (* args , ** kwargs ) : (* , **) : 9 wait_event = threading .
Event ( ) ( ) 10 11 result = [ None ] = [ 12 exc = [ False , None ] = [ 13 14 def worker_func ( ) : ( ) : 15 try : 16 func_result = f (* args , ** kwargs ) (* , ** 17 result [ 0 ] = func_result ] = 18 except Exception , e : 19 exc [ 0 ] = True ] = 20 exc [ 1 ] = sys . exc_info ( ) ] =( ) 21 print " Lazy thunk has thrown an exception ( will be raised on thunk ( ) ) :
%s " % ( % ( 22 traceback . format_exc ( ) ) ( ) ) 23 finally : 24 wait_event . set ( ) ( ) 25 26 def thunk ( ) : ( ) : 27 wait_event . wait ( ) ( ) 28 if exc [ 0 ] : ] : 29 raise exc [ 1 ] [ 0 ] , exc [ 1 ] [ 1 ] , exc [ 1 ] [ 2 ] ] [ ] , ] [ ] , ] [ 30 31 return result [ 0 ] 32 33 threading .
Thread ( target = worker_func ) . start ( ) ) . ( ) 34 35 return thunk 36 37 return lazy_thunked
Example :
1 @lazy_thunkify 2 def slow_double ( i ) : ) : 3 print " Multiplying ... " 4 time .
sleep ( 5 ) 5 print " Done multiplying ! " 6 return i * 2 7 8 9 def maybe_multiply ( x ) : ) : 10 double_thunk = slow_double ( x ) 11 print " Thinking ... " 12 time .
sleep ( 3 ) 13 time .
sleep ( 3 ) 14 time .
sleep ( 1 ) 15 if x == 3 : == 16 print " Using it ! " 17 res = double_thunk ( ) ( ) 18 else : 19 print " Not using it . " 20 res = None 21 return res 22 23 24 maybe_multiply ( 10 ) 25 maybe_multiply ( 3 )
Aggregative decorators for generator functions
This could be a whole family of decorators .
The aim is applying an aggregation function to the iterated outcome of a generator - functions .
Two interesting aggregators could be sum and average :
1 import functools as ft 2 import operator as op 3 4 def summed ( f ) : ) : 5 return lambda * xs : sum ( f (* xs ) ) ( * ) ) 6 7 def averaged ( f ) : ) : 8 def aux ( acc , x ) : ) : 9 return ( acc [ 0 ] + x , acc [ 1 ] + 1 ) ] + ] + 10 11 def out (* xs ) : ( * ) : 12 s , n = ft .
reduce ( aux , f (* xs ) , ( 0 , 0 ) ) ( * ) , ( ) ) 13 return s / n if n > 0 else 0 14 15 return out
Examples for the two proposed decorators :
1 @averaged 2 def producer2 ( ) : ( ) : 3 yield 10 4 yield 5 5 yield 2.5 6 yield 7.5 7 8 assert producer2 ( ) == ( 10 + 5 + 2.5 + 7.5 ) / 4 ( ) == ( ) / 9 10 @summed 11 def producer1 ( ) : ( ) : 12 yield 10 13 yield 5 14 yield 2.5 15 yield 7.5 16 17 assert producer1 ( ) == ( 10 + 5 + 2.5 + 7.5 ) ( ) == (
Function Timeout
Ever had a function take forever in weird edge cases ?
In one case , a function was extracting URIs from a long string using regular expressions , and sometimes it was running into a bug in the Python regexp engine and would take minutes rather than milliseconds .
The best solution was to install a timeout using an alarm signal and simply abort processing .
This can conveniently be wrapped in a decorator :
1 import signal 2 import functools 3 4 class TimeoutError ( Exception ) : pass ) : 5 6 def timeout ( seconds , error_message = ' Function call timed out ' ) : ) : 7 def decorated ( func ) : ) : 8 def _handle_timeout ( signum , frame ) : ) : 9 raise TimeoutError ( error_message ) 10 11 def wrapper (* args , ** kwargs ) : (* , **) : 12 signal .
signal ( signal .
SIGALRM , _handle_timeout ) 13 signal .
alarm ( seconds ) 14 try : 15 result = func (* args , ** kwargs ) (* , ** 16 finally : 17 signal .
alarm ( 0 ) 18 return result 19 20 return functools .
wraps ( func ) ( wrapper ) ) ( 21 22 return decorated
Example :
1 import time 2 3 @timeout ( 1 , ' Function slow ; aborted ' ) 4 def slow_function ( ) : ( ) : 5 time . sleep ( 5 )
Collect Data Difference Caused by Decorated Function
It calls a user function to collect some data before and after the decorated function runs .
To calculate difference it calls the difference calculator user function .
Example : checking page numbers of a print job : get the number of all printed pages from printer before and after the printing .
Then calculate difference to get the number of pages printed by the the decorated function
1 import inspect 2 3 4 5 import time 6 7 8 from functools import wraps 9 10 11 def collect_data_and_calculate_difference ( data_collector , difference_calculator ) : ) : 12 " " " Returns difference of data collected before and after the decorated function , 13 plus the original return value of the decorated function .
Return type : dict .
14 Keys : 15 - function name of the decorated function 16 - name of the difference calculator function 17 Values : 18 - the original return value of decorated function 19 - difference calculated by difference_calculator functions 20 Parameters : functions to collect data , and create difference from collected data 21 22 Created : 2017 23 Author : George Fischhof 24 " " " 25 26 current_decorator_function_name = inspect . currentframe ( ) . f_code .

IT WAS another of those frantic weeks that were never meant to happen in the world 's most advanced economy .
On July 13th Hank Paulson , America 's treasury secretary , stood on his department 's steps like some emerging - market finance minister , and unveiled an emergency plan to save Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , two mortgage giants that owe or guarantee $ 5.2 trillion .
Two days later , Ben Bernanke , chairman of the Federal Reserve , put the fear of God into the markets , warning Congress of a foul amalgam of inflation and economic distress .
The immediate lesson is that the financial crisis , nearly a year old , is far from over ( see our coverage , beginning with this article ) .
Gloomy investors are gunning for banks of all types .
In America the prices of houses and shares are falling , and the cost of food and energy has soared .
Consumers are almost certain to cut back .
The euro - area economy may have shrunk in the latest quarter .
Central banks around the world are having to raise interest rates to curb inflation , and the dollar looks vulnerable .
Even if the downturn proves less sharp than pessimists fear , it is likely to last longer than optimists hope .
Freddie and Fannie have changed that equation only slightly .
Their importance lies in what their rescue says about the financial system .
At Fannie and Freddie — and , shockingly , at the investment banks — the profits were privatised , but the risks were socialised .
One Republican senator complained that he thought he had “ woken up in France ” .
Mr Paulson was still right to intervene : the collapse of Fannie and Freddie would have been a catastrophe .
But by not formally nationalising them , he has let down taxpayers and made the same deeply uncapitalist mistake the British government initially made with Northern Rock , a failed mortgage bank it tried to prop up .
Mark to market , or market to Marx ?
The debt is what matters with Fannie and Freddie , but the shares were the trigger .
When investors realised they would eventually need more money to cover their looming losses , there was a run on the stock .
This rapidly became a test of a tacit government pledge to back their debt .
Had the government hinted that it wanted to wriggle free from its vague promises , the debt would have crashed ; the banking system would have been crippled by new losses ; foreign investors would have fled a country that broke its word ; and the housing market , a trifle short of lenders just now , would have lost its main backers .
Mr Paulson vowed to lend Fannie and Freddie money and buy their shares if necessary .
They could also borrow from the Fed .
The next day investors queued up to buy Freddie 's bonds .
That is plainly not the end of it for the taxpayer .
It seems quaint that critics once complained that finance was all about untrammelled markets and deregulation .
On July 11th regulators took over IndyMac Bancorp , a Californian thrift , after the second - biggest bank failure in American history .
After the rescue of Bear Stearns in March , the Fed agreed to back investment banks with its balance sheet .
Congress is chewing over a small subsidy to troubled mortgage owners .
If another large bank became vulnerable , more rescues would beckon .
Capitalism rests on a clear principle : those who get the profits should take the pain .
For the system to work , bankers sometimes need to lose their jobs and investors their shirts .
Yet were a collapsing Bear Stearns or Fannie Mae to sow destruction for the sake of a principle , it would impose a terrible price in lost jobs and output on everyone else .
The unpalatable truth is that by the time a financial crisis hits , the state often has to compromise — to impose as much pain as it can , of course , but to shoulder a large part of the losses nonetheless .
That formula comes at a heavy price .
Fannie and Freddie were supposed to help Americans buy their own homes , by making the mortgage market work better .
But it has been an awful deal for the taxpayer — a
Fed economist calculated the implicit debt - guarantee was worth a one - off sum of between $ 122 billion and $ 182 billion .
Because Fannie and Freddie barely lowered the cost of borrowing , little of this subsidy went towards boosting home ownership .
Instead , just over half — about $ 79 billion — went straight to their shareholders .
Normal financial - services firms should have been dealing in the safe , middle - of - the road mortgages that Fannie and Freddie specialise in .
Except that they were crowded out into subprime mortgages .
Fannie and Freddie should never have grown so large .
Except that they wanted to exploit the margin between the government - guaranteed borrowing costs and the commercial lending income .
They should have been stopped by Congress and their regulator .
Except that they spent some of their subsidy on a fierce lobbying machine .
Fannie must not
In the past , we have argued for privatising Fannie and Freddie completely .
But now that the guarantee is explicit , Mr Paulson should seek to secure the gains for taxpayers and treat Fannie and Freddie like one of their own mortgages , by nationalising them , breaking them up and selling them on .
That would almost double the public debt — but only in book - keeping terms .
The liability is already implicit ( as at Northern Rock ) , and , unlike Treasuries , it is ultimately backed by housing as collateral .
It is harder to know what to do about all those other implicit state guarantees — seemingly to any financial outfit .
The first instinct should be to make sure someone suffers ; shareholders and managers at the very least .
It was a valuable lesson when some of IndyMac 's depositors could not get hold of their money because they exceeded the government guarantee .
If you cannot let firms fail in a bust , then you must contain them in the boom .
That helps explain why the investment banks now need more supervision ; why financial firms should have to hold more capital as a boom gathers pace ; and why monetary policy should lean against rising asset prices .
Regulation is necessary , but beware the state being seduced into taking on duties it cannot possibly carry out well .
As Fannie and Freddie show , regulators are easily captured and outwitted .
The best controls are transparency and competition .
When possible the government needs to stand back .
Sadly , it failed to do so in the American mortgage market .
The Costanza Energy Policy : 25 Ways to Drive Oil to $ 150
On last night 's Kudlow & Co. , I discussed how absurd US energy policy is .
The United States is heavily dependent on fossil fuels ( > 80 % ) , most of which come from places we would rather not send our money to .
We consume 26 % of the world 's energy , with only 3 % of the world ’s known oil reserves .
It turns out that for the past 3 decades , we 've had a George Costanza Energy policy -- every decision we have made as a country has worked to drive energy prices higher .
Had we made the opposite decisions , Crude Oil prices would be much lower than they are today ( $ 130.17 as I type this ) .
What follows is a list of energy - related policies of the United States .
On many of these , I have no opinion -- but I wanted to list as many as I could to demonstrate why Oil is where it is
US Policies with an impact on Energy :
1. Limited areas available for offshore drilling ; 2 . Stopped the rise of CAFE standards for automobiles ; 3 . Restricted nuclear power generation of Electrical ; 4 . Federal Reserve policies since 2001 led to a very weak US dollar ( raising Oil prices ) ;
5. Energy conservation policies ?
None 6 . Iraq and Afghanistan wars contributing to Middle East tensions 7 .
No major United States funding for R&D on energy ; 8 . Kept CAFE standards for light trucks / SUVs much lower than autos ; 9 . Failed to raise efficiency standards for appliances for decades ;
10 .
Provided no tax incentives for consumer purchases of hybrid automobiles for decades ( in 2005 , provided a modest , now expired tax credit ) ; 11 . Suburban Sprawl : Americans , on average , live further from where they work than Europeans do ; 12 .
Mass transit system not a high priority ; 13 .
Allowed tax credits for residential solar power to expire ; 14 .
No special capital gains treatment for VC alt.energy investment 15 .
Ridiculous corn ethanol policy helped drive food prices higher also ; 16 .
Amongst the lowest gasoline taxes in the developed world ; 17 .
No special capital gains tax treatment for clean energy technology development ; 18 .
Created a tax incentive ( ADCS ) that encouraged purchases of large inefficient vehicles ; 19 .
Game changing breakthroughs over the past decades in solar , battery , or energy generation technologies ?
None 20 .
Exempted light trucks , SUVs , and pickups from gas - guzzler tax ; 21 .
Discouraged clean coal , including gas liquification from coal ; 22 .
Limited ( or non-existent ) state tax incentives for building energy efficient homes ;
23 . Failed to aggressively promote compact fluorescent light bulb ; 24 .
Limited hydro-electric power generation ; 25 .
Aggressive tax incentives for battery technology development ?
None 26 .
Failed to aggressively promote efficiency improvements for residential energy use , transmission of power , or consumption ; 27 .
No new oil refineries built in the USA over the past 25 years .
And that 's just off the top of my head .
Some of the above is being responded to by the private sector .
With Oil at $ 130 + , there are significant price incentives for these technologies .
However , markets develop solutions only AFTER the economics of it are feasible .
This means we are starting R&D with Oil at previously unthinkable levels .
Imagine if we had some form of energy leadership 10 or 20 years ago when Oil was $ 8 .
As I mentioned on the show last night , whoever is elected President in November should put together a blue ribbon panel , and develop a real energy policy .
Otherwise , we will revisit this post in a few years with Oil at $ 200 . . .
~~~
What other policies does the US have that has led to higher Oil prices ?

The Museum of Cinema in Buenos Aires recently found a full cut of Metropolis during a search of their archives , thanks to the decades - long effort of Argentinian film enthusiast Fernando Pena , who had heard tales of someone screening a copy of the film in the 1960s that ran far longer than any other known copy .
After years of persistent requests , the Museum finally undertook a search in April and located an original print that had been brought to Argentina by a collector in 1928 .
Researchers at the Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau Foundation in Germany viewed a DVD of the footage in June and confirmed that it is authentic .
Fritz Lang 's sci-fi classic Metropolis takes place in 2026 and tells the timeless tale of class struggle between workers toiling in the gloomy underground and the ruling class who inhabit the stunning futuristic city above .
The original three and a half hour film was hailed as a masterpiece , but only truncated versions went into wide circulation , while the original faded disappeared on the cutting room floor .
Kino International 's 2002 restored edition is currently the most comprehensive version on DVD , even though it 's missing almost an hour and a half of original footage .
The big question now is whether the film is in good enough shape to allow the release of an unabridged version .
This print would have been duplicated on Nitrocellulose stock which is prone to unpredictable chemical self - disintegration .
To compound the problem , the film is undoubtedly scratched and damaged from its early life as " just another copy . "
Fortunately , the technology now exists to digitally scan and restore extremely damaged prints to an extent that was unimaginable even a decade ago .

Iraq has been banned from competing at the Beijing Games because of government interference , the International Olympic Committee announced Thursday .
Iraq 's Olympic committee had been under suspension from the IOC since June after the country 's government dismissed officials in favour of its own appointees , who were n't recognized by the IOC .
The move ran afoul of the IOC charter , which requires national Olympic committees to be free of political influence .
The Iraqi government said the old committee was illegitimate after four of its 11 members were kidnapped in Baghdad in 2006 .
" This morning we were informed of the final decision of the International Olympic Committee to suspend the membership of the Iraqi Olympic Committee , " Hussein al - Amidi , the general secretary of the Iraqi Olympic Committee , said Thursday .
Iraq had planned to send a team of five athletes to Beijing , but missed a Wednesday deadline to submit a squad for the Aug.
8 - 24 Games amid its stalemate with the IOC .
Iraq 's places will be offered to athletes from other countries .
" The deadline for taking up places for Beijing for all sports except athletics has now passed , " IOC spokeswoman Giselle Davies said .
" The IOC very sadly has now to acknowledge that it is likely there will be no Iraqi presence at the Beijing Olympic Games , despite our best efforts . "
The IOC said the Iraqi government did not accept an invitation to come to its headquarters in Lausanne , Switzerland , to try to end the dispute .
" It 's a final decision , there is no way to appeal , " Amidi said .
" This means that Iraq will not take part in the coming Olympic Games .
It is a blow to Iraq and its international reputation , its athletes and its youth . "
" I swear those athletes who have been training … they phoned me today and they were crying and were very upset . "
Iraq 's government said after the June 4 suspension that it wanted to meet with the IOC " to make its legitimate case . "
It said the decision to dissolve the Olympic committee was based on " solid evidence of blatant corruption , lack of legitimate transparent electoral processes and accountability , and absence of ratified legislation . "
Iraq 's athletes are not the first to miss an Olympic Games because of government interference .
In the most recent case , Afghanistan was prevented from sending a team to the 2000 Sydney Games because of the Taliban regime 's intervention in sports administration .

The billboard also carries a link for Meehan 's website , TheRepublicanSong.com , at which he says , " I claim to be a man of God " and promotes his political song and video .
Meehan 's song , which appears to have racist overtones , begins , " The Democrat secular progressive move , political correctness is killing us too .
They want to take the money from the hard working man , and give it to the lazy folks that do n't give a damn . "
Even Republicans have found the billboard " inappropriate , " and many residents want it to come down .
" I 'm thinking about the Twin Towers , all the families that were killed there , " one woman told local TV affliate WFTV .
Another local was more accepting , saying , " They can have their opinion .
It 's a free country , you want to pay for the ad . "
However , the posters at right - wing site Lucianne.com were enthusiastic about the billboard .
" Why is n't Mike Meehan the Republican presidential candidate ? " asked one .
" Liberals get abjectly hysterical whenever the truth about them is pointed out , " wrote another .
" People who refer to the terrorist attack as a tragedy are morons , " added a third .
The company which owns the billboard says it 's a free speech issue and has no plans to take Meehan 's ad down before the election .

For the past two months or so , I ’ve been slowly migrating my scientific workflow ( that ’s a fancy way of saying “ my chaotic data hacking ” ) from Matlab ( ( R ) ( TM ) ( C ) ) to Python .
The results are overwhelmingly positive , so I ’d like to rant about it a bit .
First , some background .
My work typically involves the analysis of tons of remote sensing observations contained in files of various formats ( netCDF if I ’m very lucky , HDF if I ’m lucky , some weird non-standard binary thing if I ’m not ) ; all these files span terabytes and terabytes of hard drive space stored in racks in a big temperature - controlled room somewhere high in the sky .
I ssh to a central server on which all these drives are mounted ; I then usually run there code in whatever language is the most convenient to analyze the data .
Why Matlab
After a few years of this , Matlab emerged as the best solution for several reasons :
interactive sessions let you play with the data and make the analysis algorithms “ evolve ” ( the analysis procedure is often not cast in stone and writes itself as I go along and understand the data better ) ;
the syntax is well - suited to work with numerical arrays ( ie vectorized code , something also present in f90 but where it sometimes gives buggy results ) ;
powerful input / output facilities , reading netCDF and HDF is as easy as ncload file.nc or hdfread ( ‘ file.hdf ’ , ‘ some_variable ’ ) , without all the administrative overhead of compiled languages ( memory management , static typing , etc ) .
This is an important point , in Fortran it often takes me as long to get the I/O right than the actual algorithm ;
powerful plotting capabilities give you immediate visual feedback following your choices .
For me , this means I usually get results quicker with an interpreted language like Matlab ’s , even taking into account the higher speed of compiled code like Fortran .
A nice side - effect is that working suddenly becomes a lot more enjoyable when I do n’t have to spend so much time remembering all the Fortran idiosyncrasies , the differences between compilers ( will this code work with ifort / gfortran / g95 / pghpf /etc ? ) and which libraries to link to , fixing messy mixes of f77 and f90 syntax to give a predictable output , etc .
Once I run the actual program , I know it would have been faster using a compiled language , but it would have taken me longer to get right and the coding would have been a lot less fun .
Why !
Matlab
Now , the problems .
Matlab is not free as in speech , meaning you often ca n’t see the code .
Matlab is not free as in beer , meaning our institution owns a limited number of licenses , meaning that during student rush hours you often can’t even launch Matlab at all .
The initial goal of Matlab was the analysis of matrices ( hence the “ mat ” ) , not general arrays , which makes the code look weird in places and explains the FUCKING SEMICOLON you have to append to every instruction to prevent millions of numbers no human will ever be able to read to flash in front of your eyes .
The fact that you cannot launch standalone Matlab scripts without fishy syntax like “ matlab - nodisplay < script.m ” .
Because of this ( mostly because of the non- free ) , for some time now I have been looking for a replacement .
I ’ve tried R , Scilab , Octave , and tons of other stuff , but every time I ’ve found the language and the plotting capabilities to be worse when I was hoping for , at least , similar ( I guess I was also somewhat reluctant to learn another closed - system language ) .
But somewhere I always hid a secret wish … to use Python .
I love its syntax , focus on simplicity and readability , but it lacked by default any capability for serious number crunching , so I had been patiently waiting from the sidelines for the maturation of Python packages for scientific work .
Well , the stars are now aligning .
A year ago or so I took another look at Python ’s scientific stack .
I liked what I saw : everything good in Matlab ( see above ) , without the annoyances , and free .
But trying to get things running I got lost in the mess of version numbers and a never - ending chain of interdependent packages , which is even more fun when you have no root access and the machine you ’re using comes with Python 1.5.2 and that ’s it , no chocolate for you .
Basically , you have to recompile everything by hand , and make sure you do n’t forget that crucial compilation flag somewhere !
Unfortunately I had other things to do ( like actual work ) , so I reluctantly let go of the idea and stuck with Matlab .
Then came SAGE
Fast - forward to 2 or 3 months ago , when I stumble upon SAGE .
SAGE ( apart from being a RSS aggregator for Firefox and a satellite instrument ) is basically a wrapper around Python with tons of scientific packages added , all nicely pre-compiled into tasty binaries just for you by very nice people ( which involves tons of work , not as simple as it sounds ) .
These goodies come in gzipped tarballs that you dump into your $ HOME .
You can then launch the sage program , which handles regular Python just fine and includes all the modules I was longing for : NumPy ( easy , efficient handling of huge numerical array with slicing and dicing ) , SciPy ( input / output and scientific functions ) , Matplotlib ( lots of plotting tools with lickable , anti-aliased output and a syntax almost identical to Matlab ) !
Even IPython is there , meaning you get a comfortable interactive experience with tab completion on files , objects , dictionaries and tons of other niceties !
Since SAGE lets you install additional packages with a single command , it ’s a piece of cake to add wxPython to get direct - to - screen plotting within your interactive session .
Apotheose !
Great success !
Matlab without Matlab .
AND it ’s Python , meaning you ’re using an actual , REAL language with object - oriented programming , introspection , dictionaries , etc .
And since Python fits your brain , the first code you come up with is most likely the right one .
As a bonus , SAGE is available for linux ( 32/64 ) , Mac OS X and even Windows ( I think ) so your code will work everywhere !
Bliss .
The best part was when I realized , a few hours later , that I actually did n’t need to use the SAGE program itself … inside the SAGE directory lies a local / folder containing all the binaries , libraries and Python packages it used .
It even contains its own Python 2.5 !
Set the PATH , LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PYTHONPATH environment variables right and suddenly you have a perfectly consistent installation of everything that ’s needed to do scientific work in Python !
Other users on the same machine just need to change the same variables , and they can play too !
Apotheose² !
So in addition to its primary goals of providing a replacement for Mathematica / Maple / etc , SAGE , as a side - effect , provides the whole Python scientific shebang compiled and wrapped up in a nice package , for your pleasure .
Since Python is pretty smart , new Python modules will then install themselves in the right place with python setup.py install .
So go ahead : install Basemap , netcdf4 - python , PyHDF , scipy - cluster , PyNGL , whatever you need .
( Sidenote : Other “ integrated ” Python distributions with a similar focus on scientific analysis are starting to pop up , like Python ( x , y ) or the Enthought Python Distribution .
Travis Oliphant , one of the major architect of the recent NumPy restructuration , is now president of Enthought .
They also hosts the SciPy website ; you ca n’t get more central than that .
Interesting stuff should happen there soon .
They are a little too window - centric , though . )
Success
Migrating my last work project from Matlab to Python has been a success : all the figures in my last paper were generated in Python , they look almost exactly the same as the ones generated in Matlab ( just as good or better — fonts are noticeably nicer thanks to anti-aliasing ) , and the code is as small and feels better .
It seems like the only thing you could miss from Matlab are its numerous toolboxes , something which is slowly getting fixed within SciPy ( I do n’t actively use them so I do n’t care ) .
Adieu point - virgule !
Of course now that I ’ve been bitten by the Python bug , I ’m starting to follow the NumPy , SciPy and Matplotlib mailing lists .
Some great things are afoot , like the imminent NumPy 1.1 ( previously 1.0.5 , including shiny masked arrays , histograms and I/O ) , the release of Travis Oliphant ’s Guide to NumPy in august 2008 , lots of integration and standardization efforts between the various components , etc .
I guess the best thing is that it made me excited again about the idea of hacking stuff …
The Origin of “ Hacker ” April 1 , 2008
Posted by Imran Ghory in Computer Security
Everytime the media carries a sensationalist story about “ hackers ” committing cybercrimes there ’s always an uproar among geeks about the misappropriation of the word “ hacker ” .
Sadly it ’s the geeks who are mistaken and not for once the media .
A few years ago Fred Shapiro tracked down the earliest known reference to computer hackers :
1963 The Tech ( MIT student newspaper ) 20 Nov. 1
Many telephone services have been curtailed because of so - called hackers , according to Prof.
Carlton Tucker , administrator of the Institute phone system . …
The hackers have accomplished such things as tying up all the tie - lines between Harvard and MIT , or making long - distance calls by charging them to a local radar installation .
One method involved connecting the PDP - 1 computer to the phone system to search the lines until a dial tone , indicating an outside line , was found .
…
Because of the “ hacking , ” the majority of the MIT phones are “ trapped . ”
This is the earliest know usage of hacker in the modern sense , the TMRC Dictionary has it a few years earlier but not in the computer sense .
The earliest computer related uses of the term ( through anecdotal evidence ) were also malicious ( although the term was n’t originally intended maliciously – in practice it was ) in the sense that they involved gaining unauthorized access to computers to play on .
The modern “ geek ” definition of the term hacker to reflect a skilled programmer did n’t originate until the late seventies when the term ended up in the later famous Jargon File .
That does n’t mean to say we should all stop using the word “ hacker ” in it ’s positive sense , but as evidence advocating geeks we should at least stop claiming a false history to support our cause .
As we all know where that ends up .
In response to those who disagree with me :
If you think I ’m wrong then show me the evidence , if you can find earlier records showing hack ( er ) s being used in a computer context in a non -“ black hat ” manner I ’d be happy to retract my post and put the evidence up here .
Mythbuster 's Episode 93 - " Confederate Steam Gun "
Features Winans Steam Gun
by John Lamb
An episode of the popular Discovery Channel show Mythbusters [ Episode 93 - Confederate Steam Gun ] that first aired December 5 , 2007 put the principles behind the legendary Winans Steam Gun to a practical test .
The gun rocketed to national prominence after the April 19 , 1861 clash between secessionists and Federal troops in Baltimore , Maryland .
Readers of newspapers across the United States learned of a strange , and allegedly powerful steam powered weapon brought forth to fend off more Union troops seeking to pass through the town by rail to Washington .
Though it was invented and built elsewhere , the gun quickly became associated with Ross Winans , a pioneering locomotive builder , and inventor of an unorthodox class of steamships - the Winans Cigar ships .
Since then the gun has become a familiar part of the story of the riot ’s aftermath .
It has been counted as his invention ever since , though his connection to it has been greatly exaggerated .
The gun in fact grew out of work by Ohio inventors William Joslin and Charles S. Dickinson .
After the two had a falling out , Dickinson promoted the device under his name , and found funding to build a steam powered gun in Boston in 1860 .
He brought the device to Baltimore where it was publicly exhibited .
After April 19 , 1861 , the gun was taken from Dickinson and / or his associates by city police to be put in readiness for use if needed .
Available evidence suggests that the gun was take to foundry / machine shop of Ross Winans and his son Thomas who had been engaged by city ’s Board of Police to make pikes , shot and other munitions items .
Shortly after , the gun was taken from the Winans ’ facility and publicly displayed with other weapons being gathered by city authorities .
In the excitement of the times , Ross Winans ' public involvement in state ’s right politics in Maryland , his great fortune , word of the munitions work being done at his factory for the city , and city defense appropriations became mixed in the press , and were carried in papers across the country .
After calm returned , the gun was taken again to Winans shop for repair at city expense , then returned to Dickinson , who then attempted to take it to Harper ’s Ferry to sell to Confederate forces .
Union forces captured the gun , intact , in mid journey and took it to their camp at Relay , Maryland .
His association with the gun , his politics and rumors of his munitions making led to Ross Winan ’s arrest and a brief detention by Federal forces .
He was released after 48 hours , after agreeing that he would not take up arms against the government .
The gun was eventually sent to Annapolis , then to Fortress Monroe , and eventually to Massachusett ’s .
It would be exhibited at various events long after the war but would eventually be scrapped at the end of the 19th century .
Even though the original steam gun fell to scrappers long ago , the question has always been , what could it really do ?
Was it a deadly death dealing machine , or a useless curiosity ?
Ever on the lookout for myths to put to the test , the Mythbusters team took on the challenge of the Winans Steam Gun .
Find Mythbusters episode 93 - Confederate Steam Gun on You Tube or Video to see what happened when the team put 's the gun 's design to the test .
The Gun's Key Part
The image above is a period engraving of the barrel assembly of the Steam Gun .
Steel shot , approximately the sixe of a 2 ounce ball bearing were fed into a chute that dropped them into the vertical tube ( B ) in the illustration above .
They rolled down into the barrel and were stopped by the spring loaded gate lettered I above .
As the barrel assembly rotated horizontally , the gate would remain closed until the barrel had revolved to the firing position .
At that point the rod lettered D would rise momentarily , pushing up on the gate assembly allowing a shot to pass out .
This barrel assembly was located in the tub shaped struture in the image at the top of this page .
An operator {in the image at the top of the page }dropping shot into the chute leading to the barrel .
The tub shaped assembly was a shield to protect the operator from the machinery of the gun .
A slit in the shield lined up with the slit in armored , snow - plow shaped cover that gave the gun its fearsome appearance .
Unfortunately , the details of the drive train of the gun were not detailed in period sources because they were not considered to be unique !
Coming Soon - A History of the Winans Steam Gun by John Lamb
This book will feature the most complete account of the weapon often known as the Winans Steam Gun .
Includes never before reported information about the gun 's origin , its story prior to the Spring of 1861 , its eventual fate , and the existance of a second gun .
Will also include information about other Centrifugal guns .
Author John Lamb has a background in community journalism and non-profit administration , He has published two articles on the 2nd Maryland Infantry , US in America 's Civil War magazine , has a book in progress on the 2nd Maryland Infantry , US. , and has produced six field recordings of shapenote singing .

SO FAR , so presidential .
The spin doctors who organised Barack Obama 's world tour must be content with the public - relations success achieved by their man to date .
The Democratic candidate visited Afghanistan over the weekend .
Then , on Monday July 21st , he appeared in Iraq .
He has enjoyed the sort of high - level reception generally reserved for heads of state ; the accompanying press coverage will have his PR advisers salivating .
Later this week he will visit Germany 's capital , Berlin , where he may draw the size of crowd usually reserved for rock stars .
The Democratic campaign must be delighted , not least by the neglect of his Republican rival , John McCain .
Yet , beyond public relations and an effort to make Mr Obama look more convincing as a potential commander - in - chief , the more substantial foreign policy news seems to be coming , if rather quietly , from Mr Obama 's rivals .
Over Iran 's efforts to develop a nuclear programme , for example , George Bush had suggested that talking to America 's enemies would be tantamount to appeasement .
In contrast Mr Obama has long espoused direct talks with Iran .
Although he has waffled a bit , saying that he would make appropriate “ preparations ” , his point has been that Iran should not be required to suspend its efforts to enrich uranium as a condition for holding talks .
Then came the news , this weekend , that William Burns , a high - ranking diplomat , sat down with Iranian envoys in Geneva to discuss Iran 's nuclear programme .
The meeting on Saturday did not produce spectacular results .
Iran rejected Western demands that it stop enriching uranium , although it was given two more weeks to deliver a formal answer .
But the meeting itself was news : it was the highest - level American contact with Iran during the Bush administration and it happened while Iran 's centrifuges were spinning along , undermining the suggestion that holding talks with opponents in such circumstances is irresponsible .
Mr McCain , however , continues to stress the need for a coercive approach to Iran with stringent preconditions necessary for any talks .
On Iraq , arguably , a shift has also taken place in the White House .
Late last week news broke that Mr Bush and Iraq 's prime minister , Nuri al - Maliki , had agreed to a “ time horizon ” for American troop withdrawals from the country .
Precisely what this will mean is not yet clear .
Mr Bush 's officials were quick to talk about “ aspirational goals ” and to stress that any talk of withdrawal would continue to depend on a range of conditions : the facts on the ground would still determine any outcome , says the White House .
Mr McCain , too , remains committed to leaving Iraq based on conditions , not calendars .
But Mr Maliki last week suggested in an interview with a German magazine that a timetable for American withdrawal would be welcome , even praising Mr Obama 's timeframe of a phased exit over 16 months ( without offering an endorsement of the candidate ) .
He was quoted as saying “ [ He ]
Who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in Iraq . ”
His statement was later revised , perhaps under pressure from America , but it allowed Mr Obama 's campaign to claim that his talk of timetables is justified .
In contrast Mr McCain suggests that the Maliki - Bush agreement on “ time horizons ” was only possible because of the success of the surge of troops , begun in 2007 , which he strongly advocated even when many others ( including Mr Obama ) thought it would be hopeless .
Mr Obama has now removed his harshest criticism of the surge strategy from his campaign website .
Finally , on Afghanistan , although Mr McCain and Mr Bush admit no change of course , it has become clear that , along with Mr Obama , there is now general agreement on the need to renew the military effort with the provision of extra troops .
Mr Obama is hoping to frame discussion of Afghanistan in his terms , and thereby to persuade voters that he is offering leadership on this particular issue : it helps that the Democrat can make the more plausible claim to beefing up in Afghanistan , if one assumes that he would be able redeploy troops from Iraq .
Italian and French do not come from Latin
Unlike what is taught in all the universities , it appears that Italian does not come from Latin , any more than any other Romance language such as Spanish , French or Rumanian comes from Latin .
Just as we thought for centuries that the sun rotated around the earth , based on our daily observations , common sense leads us naturally to think that Latin evolved into the different Romance languages .
However linguists , who are aware of substantial divergences between Latin and the Romance languages both in terms of syntax and glossary , have taken a first step towards supporting a different theory .
They had to appeal to the concept of “ Vulgar Latin ” , which is supposed to be the spoken language resulting from Classical Latin .
It is the former that is purported to have given rise to the Romance languages .
I agree with these linguists on one single point , namely that Classical Latin could not have evolved into the Romance languages , but I disagree on the rest :
- What we wrongly call “ Vulgar Latin ” is none other than Italian
- This Italian did not develop from Latin , but is a distinct Indo - European language
- So the Romans were bilingual , speaking Italian and writing Latin
- The Romans gave their Empire two languages : a spoken language which was Italian and a written one , Latin
Of course , to reach such conclusions I have carried out in - depth research that I summarised in my book entitled “ Le français ne vient pas du latin ” ( Edition L’Harmattan , Paris 2007 ) .
Some people block up their ears , when I state my conclusions , but those who take the time to read my book , do not remain indifferent .
What I have written is not a pamphlet , but a thorough demonstration .
So I wish you enjoyable reading and look forward to discussing the issues with you .
From the tomorrow ’s Times on the Rudy ’s sub - prime campaign …
A half - dozen senior officials of the Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee conferred this week on how to wind down their affairs , and at least one piece of their correspondence painted what appeared to be a bleak picture of the dormant campaignâs financial situation .
â We are deeper in the hole than I thought we would be , â John Gross , the campaignâs treasurer , wrote in an e-mail message to several senior campaign aides that was obtained by The New York Times .
â Windown is likely to be less than projected , but travel expenses are higher , â  Mr. Gross continued .
â We cannot prefer any one creditor .
We probably could make a 10 % payment to all qualified creditors at this point , but probably not much more .â 
Carbon producers would have been able to trade emissions allowances
A US attempt to establish a system of caps and tax relief to cut carbon emissions has been blocked in Congress .
The bill was backed by most senators , but did not get the 60 votes needed to stop a delaying tactic - a filibuster - used by the bill 's opponents .
Even if it had succeeded in passing Congress , President George W Bush had pledged to veto the bill .
Lawmakers will now wait until next year - when there will be a new president - before attempting to pass a new bill .
Tax relief
The bill - sponsored by Republican John Warner and Independent Joe Lieberman - would have introduced caps on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants , oil refineries and factories .
Carbon producers would have been granted emissions allowances , which they would have been able to trade with one another , providing them with an incentive to cut their emissions .
" It 's a huge tax increase , " said Mitch McConnell , leader of the Senate Republicans , most of whom opposed the bill .
Supporters of the new system said that tax relief would be provided to help people pay energy costs .
Neither John McCain nor Barack Obama were present for the vote , but both presidential candidates said that they would have supported the bill if they had been able to attend .
It is my hope that the Guide will be a “ living document ” which can be updated and enhanced as time goes on by knowledgeable experts such as those on TOD , and I welcome their input .
I 'd like it to be as short and to the point as possible , but also as bulletproof as possible in presenting solid information .
Recent media coverage of peak oil , and the energy options for the future , has been fraught with misinformation .
In such an environment , the average person has little chance of knowing whether oil from ANWR or the Arctic can save the day , or whether there are 1.2 or 12 trillion barrels of recoverable oil out there .
But confusion breeds apathy , and that 's not something we can afford anymore .
I believe that the impending energy crisis is too urgent to allow misinformation about peak oil to go unanswered .
We need to bring the public up to speed on the realities of energy before we can have any sort of intelligent conversation about reforming energy policy .
This is a guest post by Chris Nelder , author of Profit from the Peak : The End of Oil and the Greatest Investment Event of the Century .
Chris will have another book ( with Jeff Siegel ) coming out soon , Investing in Renewable Energy : Making Money on Green Chip Stocks , but it does n't come out until October .
This is a media guide that Chris has been putting together that he wants feedback on , so help him out .
Also , this document goes well in tandem with Gail 's Peak Oil Overview that can always be found in the top guidebar that goes a bit further in depth .
Gail 's is meant to be extensive , this one is meant to be " short but bulletproof . "
This is a short summary of important concepts about peak oil and world oil production , prepared for the benefit of the media .
Last revised : July 9 , 2008
1 . It ’s not the size of the tank which matters , but the size of the tap .
Peak oil is not about “ running out of oil , ” it ’s about the peak rate of oil production .
It ’s not the size of the tank which matters , but the size of the tap .
When the production rate of oil reaches its geological limit and begins to decline , the world ’s economies will be forced to live within a shrinking , not expanding , energy budget .
The economic impact of peaking oil production is what concerns us , not the amount of oil yet to produce , because all economies depend on continuous growth .
We wo n’t “ run out of oil ” for another 100 years or more , but it will be produced at ever - declining rates .
This is an essential concept .
Talking only about the number of barrels of oil that might exist somewhere , without also talking about the rate at which that oil can be produced , and when , entirely misses the target .
Oil production rates generally follow an irregular bell - curve shape .
It is simply the nature of petroleum extraction that it gradually ramps up , reaches a peak or short plateau ( sometimes with a secondary peak ) when roughly half of the recoverable oil has been produced , and then declines ..
This observation has been made in thousands of oil fields ( and oil producing nations ) worldwide , and is named “ Hubbert ’s Peak ” in honor of the geologist who first described it , Dr. M. King Hubbert .
For the world , ASPO - Ireland ’s working model of past and future oil production looks like this :
Figure 1 ASPO - Ireland World Oil Production Model
Source : Colin Campbell , ASPO - Ireland Newsletter No. 90 – June 2008
This model is based upon a detailed study of all the world ’s major oil fields , with all forms of petroleum taken into account .
According to the June 2008 revision of this model , the peak of all petroleum liquids — including heavy oil from Venezuela , deepwater oil from the Gulf of Mexico , oil from the Arctic and Alaska , and natural gas liquids — is this year , 2008 .
But the exact date of the peak is almost irrelevant when considering the implications of peak oil .
2 . We are now at , or “ close enough ” to the peak .
Right now , the world is producing between 86 and 87 million barrels per day ( mbpd ) of “ all liquids , ” and that rate has changed little since 2005 .
Crude oil production has been stalled at roughly 74 mbpd .
The rest of the “ oil ” counted in the “ all liquids ” numbers includes natural gas liquids , tar sand production , biofuels , and refining gains , and it is these alternative liquids that have been responsible for nearly all of the growth in world oil production for the last several years .
The world has reached a bumpy production plateau , as shown in the following chart .
Figure 2 World Liquids Fuel Production January 2002 - May 2008
Source : Oilwatch Monthly , June 2008 .
After a serious review of the flow rates of the world ’s oil producers , we conclude that world production is unlikely to ever exceed 90 mbpd , and in fact , might not increase more than 1 or 2 million barrels above where it now stands .
It appears we are now on the peak oil plateau , or close enough to it that the date of the technical , absolute peak does n’t matter .
As ASPO founder Colin Campbell has said , “ Arguing endlessly over the precise date of the peak also rather misses the point , when what matters is the vision of the long slope that comes into sight on the other side of it . ”
Within the next three to six years , the world will likely reach the end of the peak oil plateau and go into terminal oil production decline .
At that point a growing world population will be forced to live with an ever - decreasing supply of oil .
Many of the adaptation strategies we are counting on , like increasing the share of renewable energy and replacing the vehicle fleet with more efficient vehicles , will require decades and enormous investment to make much difference .
Unfortunately the world no longer has decades to make the necessary changes .
Not only are we “ close enough ” to the peak , we ’re far too close to it .
3 . Oil production in the U.S. is well past its peak and is in long - term decline
The U.S. uses about 20 mbpd of petroleum and other liquid fuels , and produces about 7 of that ( only 5 of which is actual crude oil ) .
The other two - thirds is imported .
There is no possible way that we could produce another 13 million barrels per day domestically , no matter where or how quickly we drilled .
The potential flow rates of the remaining U.S. deposits are formally unknown ( we ’ll get to that in a moment ) , but their contribution cannot fundamentally change the basic trend line of our petroleum production .
Here is a chart of historical U.S. oil production :
Figure 3 - US Oil Production 1900 - 2005
Source : Jean Laherrère
The 38 - year decline in U.S. oil production was not the result of politics .
It is simply the nature of petroleum extraction .
In spite of major technological advances since the U.S. peaked in 1970 ( 3 - D seismic , horizontal drilling , CO2 flooding , computer processing power , etc ) , our oil production is still declining .
Indeed , despite the discovery of the largest oil field ever found in the U.S. ( Prudhoe Bay ) , we were unable to get back to the production level at the peak in 1970 .
4 . Oil shale : the fuel of the future … and it always will be .
After four decades of fully authorized , commercial , even subsidized attempts to develop oil shale into a usable liquid fuel , no one has ever been able to make it economically feasible .
Part of the reason for that is that it ’s not even really oil — it ’s kerogen , an immature precursor to oil .
Kerogen is a solid , like a low - grade , high - ash coal .
The most ambitious oil shale project in the country is a pilot project in northwest Colorado operated by Shell .
Their plan is to drill several hundred holes into a football - sized plot of land , into which heating elements are inserted .
They will heat up the “ pay zone ” of hydrocarbons , which is often buried 2000 - 4000 feet deep , to temperatures up to 700 degrees F , and keep it there for three to four years in order to cook the kerogen into a liquid ..
That takes a great deal of energy input .
In order to keep the heated zone from leaking oil into the surrounding water table , a “ freeze wall ” is built around it , which will use even more energy to freeze the ground with giant chillers .
The net energy of this process is n’t yet known , but it ’s so energy - intensive that we ’re willing to bet this technology is unlikely to ever produce more than a modest flow ( though perhaps a very long - lived one ) of extremely expensive synthetic oil .
ASPO ’s Randy Udall puts it this way : “ Suppose you owned $ 100 million dollars , but the bank would only allow you to withdraw $ 100,000 / year .
You would be rich … sort of . ”
5. ANWR and the continental shelf are no panacea .
The potential flow rates of the conventional sources of hydrocarbons locked up in ANWR and the continental shelf cannot be known until they are produced .
But we can make ballpark estimates .
All of these areas have been well explored , and we have an idea of what they might produce : a slight bump in the bell curve of U.S. oil production , like this :
Figure 4 –US Oil Production 1860 - 2100
Historical data ( 1860 -2006 , red symbols ) and model predictions for US oil production rates in billion barrels per year .
- Dashed line : Base case with 231 billion barrels ultimate cumulative US oil production .
- Solid line : Production curve with 42 billion barrels of new oil resources ( 273 billion barrels of ultimate cumulative production ) .
Source : Dr. Kyriacos Zygourakis , Rice University , “ Commentary : On Quenching Our “ Big Thirst ” for Oil , ” Peak Oil Review , May 5 , 2008 .
That model is a best - case scenario of US oil production if all off - limits federal lands were opened to drilling .
There are limits on all of the remaining U.S. oil reserves , for numerous technical reasons that would be beyond the scope of this summary .
To cite just one example , let ’s look at the capacity of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ( ANWR ) .
There is only one pipeline that could transport oil from ANWR : the 800 - mile Trans Alaskan Pipeline System ( TAPS ) , which serves the Prudhoe Bay field .
No other oil pipeline from Alaska ’s north slope would ever be built , due to the cost and logistical issues .
TAPS can transport a little over 2 mbpd , and carried about 740,000 bpd last year .
Therefore , if we brought ANWR online today , it could at maximum deliver about 1.25 mbpd .
But in reality , it would take 8 - 10 years after approval to begin producing the first of that oil .
Furthermore , preliminary estimates by the USGS indicated that ANWR would likely only produce around 750,000 barrels per day at peak .
If we are currently on the peak / plateau of global oil production , and production starts to fall within the next five years , then 10 years from now , at a reasonable average 2.0 % rate of net depletion , world oil production will be down 11 mbpd — about 12 % — from where it stands today .
In total , we believe that if all limits on domestic drilling were removed , it could only increase US oil production by a maximum of 2 - 3 mbpd .
Once it came online bit by bit , given the loss in global oil production by that time , the additional oil from ANWR and all other undeveloped federal lands will be underwhelming ..
The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that drilling in ANWR would only reduce the price of gasoline by less than four pennies per gallon — 20 years from now !
Although every barrel we can produce domestically will be welcome and would slightly reduce our dependency on imports , the idea that we can somehow drill our way to independence from imported oil is misleading in the extreme .
At the rate that the U.S. currently uses oil , the chance of producing all of our own needs domestically is zero .
The only way we can truly become energy independent is by severely curtailing our oil demand , and switching loads over to renewables .
Indeed , we should recognize , as the Saudis have , that the oil that remains will only become more valuable as time goes on , and it makes sense to save some for future generations .
Burning every last bit of it as quickly as we can makes no sense at all .
6 . Oil prices are n’t all about us .
It ’s an all - too - common belief that if only we had authorized more domestic development of oil , our gasoline prices would be lower .
Even though we are the proverbial 8,000 pound gorilla , consuming about one - quarter of the world ’s energy , oil prices are not all about us .
The increasing consumption of countries in Asia , South America , Russia , and the Middle East have more than made up for the slight declines in petroleum consumption we have experienced this year .
Global consumption is expected to increase another 1 mbpd this year , even as consumption declines in the U.S .
The fact is that oil is a globally traded commodity .
Since the U.S. imports two - thirds of the oil it consumes , the price of domestic oil will always maintain parity with global prices .
Therefore , no matter how much we drill up the remaining resources , it will not significantly change the price of fuel .
With the global supply and demand balance as tight as it is for oil , natural gas , and coal , it is highly unlikely that a slight increase in U.S. production could make any noticeable difference in our gasoline prices .
Once we take into account the decades it will take to bring new domestic resources online , any additional production we can manage will only slightly nudge the decline curve in global oil production , and only slightly depress domestic prices for gasoline , for a short while .
Congress can do little to change that .
7. Depletion is relentless .
Depletion is another frequently misunderstood issue .
As discussed above , all oil fields peak and go into decline .
The depletion rates after the peak can vary widely , from about 2 % per year for a well - managed onshore field , to 20 % or more per year for deepwater fields like Mexico ’s Cantarell field , and other deepwater fields in the Gulf of Mexico .
Of the top 21 oil producers in the world , 11 are past their peaks .
For a summary table of the world ’s top oil producers and their depletion rates , see “ Commentary – The Oil Production Story : Pre - and Post - Peak Nations , ” Peak Oil Review , June 16 , 2008 ..
The concept is simple : Oil production first must make up for the depletion of mature fields before any net additional oil can be counted .
It ’s like pouring water into a bucket with a hole in it .
Anyone familiar with a balance sheet should understand this concept , but many observers routinely miss it .
World oil production must first struggle against a background decline rate of about 4.5 % from mature fields before it can manage any increases .
Currently , the net increase in global oil production is about 1 % per year .
8. Expectations for the future are shrinking .
Peak oil deniers often like to point to the International Energy Agency ’s estimate of last year , which projected that world oil production will rise from 85 mbpd today to 110 mbpd by 2015 , and to 116 mpbd by 2030 .
Others still quote the IEA ’s previous estimate , that world oil production would eventually rise to 130 mbpd .
What they do n’t realize is that the IEA ’s estimates , along with those of the Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) and other analysts , have been continually shrinking for the last several years .
After a long history of predicting that oil supply would meet whatever the demand was projected to be , the IEA started to reduce their targets about two years ago , when it became clear that net oil production had stopped growing .
Reality is setting in .
In May 2008 , the Wall Street Journal previewed the IEA ’s upcoming report on the world 's top 400 oil fields , including for the first time a detailed study of their individual depletion rates .
The IEA concluded that the depletion of aging oil wells , combined with the dampening effect of skyrocketing costs on new field development , means that the world will have a hard time reaching 100 mbpd within the next two decades .
Their projected supply curves are now sharply reduced , while their global demand projections continue to show about a 1.5 % annual rate of growth .
Fatih Birol , the IEA 's chief economist , said : " One of our findings will be that the oil investments required may be much , much higher than what people assume .
This is a dangerous situation . "
9 . Improved technology cannot move the peak .
The potential of enhanced oil recovery ( EOR ) techniques is well known , after over four decades of experience in the field .
What that experience has shown is that ( with a few minor exceptions ) improved technology cannot move the peak .
What it does is increase , over time , the overall amount of oil that can be produced .
On the bell curve , it thickens and lengthens the tail .
But it does not change the time at which production peaked .
Deepwater drilling , another relatively new oil field technology , has been similarly oversold .
What we have found is that deepwater fields tend to “ crash ” at up to 20 % rates of depletion once they pass the peak .
Some oil analysts , such as Peter Jackson and Daniel Yergin of CERA , have routinely overstated the potential of improved technology as a way of denying the reality of peak oil .
ASPO - USA ’s direct challenge to their estimates remains unanswered .

News in Brief
Moniem El - Ganayni is an outspoken critic of the US government .
K. SRAKOCIC /AP
An Egyptian - born nuclear physicist is suing the US Department of Energy over the revocation of his security clearance .
Moniem El - Ganayni worked from 1990 as a scientist at the Bettis Laboratory , a contract lab for the energy department near Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , that works on nuclear propulsion .
El - Ganayni , a US citizen since 1988 , is an active member of the local Islamic community .
He has been an outspoken critic of the Iraq war and the US government 's treatment of Muslims , and was particularly critical of government efforts to recruit informants , according to his lawyer Keith Whitson , a partner at Schnader Harrison Segal and Lewis in Pittsburgh .
In May , the energy department revoked El - Ganayni 's security clearance , in part because he was suspected of “ conflicting allegiances ” .
Shortly thereafter , he was fired from the laboratory .
El - Ganayni's suit , filed with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union , claims that the Department of Energy has violated his rights of free speech and freedom from discrimination .
The Next Big Thing
See what the guys in white coats have coming in the next few years .
July 21 , 2008  --
Let 's face it :
We spend an awful lot of our time waiting .
Waiting in bathroom lines .
Waiting for that hot Kenneth Cole leather clutch to go on sale at the end of the season .
Waiting for a decent Dane Cook movie .
Usually , our patience pays off , the forever unfunny Mr. Cook notwithstanding .
But when it comes to some of those promising medical breakthroughs we 've been hearing about for the past decade -- uh , birth control for men , anyone ? -- we have to wonder :
Are we ever gonna see this stuff ?
To get some answers , we dished with researchers and other experts to find out what 's really going on behind lab doors -- and more important , when we might be able to see some payoff .
Male Birth Control
Here 's the scoop :
Our ultimate fantasy is to see him pregnant and squeezing out a pumpkin - headed 10 - pounder .
But for now , we 'll settle for shrugging off the burden of daily Pill popping .
European pharmaceutical companies have already created a chemical that suppresses the hormone responsible for sperm production .
When frisky male rats were given the drug , they started shooting blanks ; when they stopped nibbling their contraceptive - laced cheese , sperm production came back .
More good news : EU researchers have developed a kind of temporary vasectomy .
Instead of snipping the tubes that carry sperm to the penis , a doctor implants a clip that pinches them shut .
" Think of it as an IUD for men , " says Dr. Manny Alvarez , adjunct professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the New York University School of Medicine .
ETA : Five years for the Male Pill .
Scientists are working on a human formula , which will go through trials before being submitted for FDA approval .
As for the clip in the U.S. , look for it in one year :
It 's currently in human trials to make sure sperm flow returns after the clip is removed .
HIV Vaccine
Here 's the scoop : Scientists have been trying to find a cure for HIV / AIDS for more than 25 years , but it 's tricky : " Every time the virus is transmitted , it undergoes small changes , " says Patricia Fast , chief medical officer at the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative ( IAVI ) .
This means that no two people are infected with exactly the same strain of HIV , making it nearly impossible to create a universal antidote .
But what if we could prevent people from getting infected altogether ?
That 's the goal of more than 30 human trials being conducted around the world by universities , private labs , governments , and the IAVI .
Because it 's not safe to use a vaccine made from a killed or weakened strain of HIV ( as scientists do with the flu virus ) , " study participants are injected with a small , basic component of the virus that is present in every strain , " Fast says .
That way , your body can learn how to fight it off without your getting sick .
Then , if you were exposed to the real thing , your immune system would recognize the virus and knock the crap out of it .
ETA : Unclear .
Once a vaccine enters late - stage testing , it takes about five years to determine whether it 's likely to succeed .
After that , more testing is required before it can be licensed for global use .
Condomless STD Prevention
Here 's the scoop : Ribbed or not , condoms do n't really exist for anyone 's pleasure .
But what if you could protect against both rug rats and STDs without a spontaneity - sucking latex barrier ?
A new gel ( brand name : Amphora ) coats your vaginal walls , killing STDs on contact but leaving your body 's natural bacteria alone .
Inserted up to 12 hours before sex with a device that covers the cervix , it does double duty as a contraceptive .
Amphora 's release will be a banner moment for women worldwide whose partners wo n't roll on a Trojan : " It will finally put the power to protect against STDs into the woman 's hands , " says Dr. Alfred Shihata , chief medical officer of Instead , the company testing Amphora .
ETA : Three years .
Clinical trials are expected to take up to two more years .
If they 're successful , an OTC product could get the FDA greenlight by 2011 .
Female Viagra
Here 's the scoop :
For 10 years , men have been able to pop a pill and go from limp to lusty .
Soon -- fingers crossed -- women may be able to get their own boost from a prescription bottle .
The German company Boehringer Ingelheim has developed flibanserin , which works by reducing serotonin at the receptor in the brain responsible for sexual desire .
" Serotonin suppresses dopamine , which in turn stimulates arousal , " says Dr. Anita Clayton , a professor of psychiatry and neurobehavioral sciences at the University of Virginia .
" By decreasing serotonin at that receptor , we 'll allow dopamine to emerge and do its thing . "
So you can do your thing .
ETA : Less than two years .
Clinical trials for the pill are slated to be completed by the end of this year , which means it could be reviewed by the FDA in late 2009 .
Needle - Free Blood Sugar Test
Here 's the scoop :
If you 're one of the 21 million Americans with diabetes , checking your blood sugar as often as you check your e-mail can be a pain -- literally .
A new contact lens could soon replace the finger prick .
The lens -- which will also correct poor vision -- contains a photonic crystal that changes color when the glucose level of your tears increases or decreases .
One glance in the mirror and you 'll know your blood sugar status .
" This technology does n't draw blood , it does n't cause pain , and it allows you to continually monitor your glucose level , " says Sanford Asher , a chemistry professor at the University of Pittsburgh , who is involved in testing the lens .
ETA : Up to four years .
" We 're gearing up for clinical trials , which could last up to two years , " Asher says .
FDA approval is expected to take another one to two years .
An Easier Cancer Treatment
Here 's the scoop :
Though a cure for the Big C is still out of reach , scientists are on track to render the nasty side effects of treatment -- fatigue , nausea , hair loss - - a thing of the past .
" All of the current therapies [ chemotherapy , radiation , and surgery ] destroy healthy cells along with the cancer cells , which is what causes the side effects , " says Dr. Marek Malecki , a professor in South Dakota State University 's department of pharmaceutical sciences .
" We 're genetically engineering antibodies [ proteins that the immune system uses to identify and destroy germs and other foreign objects ] to seek out and go after tumors while leaving healthy cells untouched . "
The antibodies -- which are specific to each type of cancer -- would be administered through a series of injections .
Malecki recently tested the breast and ovarian cancer antibodies on mice , and " so far , it 's been successful , " he says .
ETA : Three to five years Malecki and his team are preparing to scale up production of the breast and ovarian cancer antibodies for human trials .
If results are good , it should be submitted for FDA approval within two years .
Worth the Wait
Medical breakthroughs typically take years -- sometimes decades -- before they 're available to the public .
Get a load of the backstory on these historic innovations
Viagra : 7 years
British researchers originally patented the little blue pill in 1991 -- as a heart disease drug .
They realized something was up by 1994 , when patients started talking about the medicine 's surprising perk .
The FDA approved it to treat erectile dysfunction on March 27 , 1998 , also known as the happiest day in Bob Dole 's life .
Polio vaccine : 21 years
In 1934 , scientists were trying unsuccessfully to make vaccines from the ground - up spinal cords of monkeys .
In 1952 , after several more failed trials , Jonas Salk tested a vaccine that used a dead form of the virus .
It got the greenlight for public use in 1955 -- in time to help combat a huge U.S. outbreak .
The Pill : 24 years
In 1941 , chemistry professor Russell Marker made synthetic progesterone using a compound found in Mexican wild yams .
His innovation paved the way for creation of the Pill , approved by the FDA in 1960 .
Yet it took five years and a Supreme Court ruling before American women got the right to take it .
Thanks , Margaret Sanger !
HPV Vaccine : 26 years
German scientist Harald zur Hausen nailed down the cause of most cervical cancers -- certain strains of human papilloma virus ( HPV ) -- in the early 1980s .
Still , it took scientists two decades to figure out how to prevent the infection .
In 2006 the FDA approved the vaccine for girls between the ages of 9 and 26 .
Lasik : 40 years
In 1950 , Colombia - based ophthalmologist Jose Barraquer began cutting thin flaps in patients ' corneas to refine their shape and help correct lousy vision .
But it was n't until lasers went mainstream that the procedure could be perfected .
Forty years later , U.S. scientists created Lasik , quickly making contacts so 1989 .

Am I Normal ?
“ Stop waiting , ” he said , and “ buy the next dip because I think it might be the last big one . ”
Cramer pointed to five specific clues that proved to him the market was about to turn up .
One is that the negativity is so bad we might be at the point of total capitulation .
The Investors Intelligence Survey reported a 30 % bull - 50 % bear ratio .
Fifty percent bearish !
Who ’s left to sell ?
That kind of despair and disbelief has historically been a sign , Cramer said , that the darkest part of night was ending and dawn was near .
Then there were the power moves yesterday by Merrill Lynch , whose newly issued stock is up more than 10 % from its offering price .
Merrill showed the rest of the banks that they , too , can unload all that bad paper , the CDOs , and cut a deal with the bond issuers to repair a much - damaged , and very important , business relationship .
Now Lehman Brothers , Citigroup and Wachovia can follow suit .
Also , plenty of companies have proved through recent earnings reports that they ’ve been able to handle the commodity inflation that plagued the market for so long .
Just look at the rails , Colgate - Palmolive , Cummins , Avon and U.S. Steel .
How ’d they do it ?
Price increases .
And now that raw costs have come down , Cramer ’s expecting a load of upside surprises because those price increases will stay put .
( Cramer said the decline in gold just serves to verify the commodities crash . )
The Securities and Exchange Commission announced it will continue to protect 19 banks in danger of having massive hedge funds short sell them into the ground .
This is key because , as Cramer said , it ’s this protection that allowed for the Merrill deals to happen .
Now other banks are safe to proceed with their own deals , and the market rally can continue .
The last piece of the puzzle is the housing bailout President Bush signed into law this morning .
Bank of America , Wells Fargo and all the other major banks can now sell their bad mortgages to the Federal Housing Authority for 80 cents on the dollar .
And despite what you think , that ’s actually a mark up , not a mark down , compared to what they ’d be worth if the FHA did n’t step in .
Cramer ’s predicting the rally continues Thursday thanks to great after - the - bell earnings from The Walt Disney Co. and First Solar .
And who knows what could happen after Mastercard reports in the morning .
“ My bottom call is n’t gutsy , ” Cramer said .
“ I think it ’s just a smart call that all the evidence points toward . ”
“ Bye , bye , bear market , ” he said .
“ Say hello to the bull , and do n’t let the door hit you on the way out . ”

The Cheney tag team is in the ring at the same time versus Iran .
In recent days we 've seen headlines from Bush 's European farewell tour like this from the London Times : " President George Bush starts talking language of a dove . "
Also , in an apparent admission that his beef with Iran might not be settled during his presidency , Bush , as reported by Agence France Press , said : " I 'll leave behind a multilateral framework to work this issue . "
Speaking of multilateral , Steven Lee Myers and Nazila Fathi write in their recent New York Times article , " European Leaders Back Bush on Iran " that , " President Bush won European support .
. . to consider additional punitive sanctions against Iran , including restrictions on its banks . "
In response , Iran has begun " transferring billions of dollars from European banks to Iranian and Asian banks .
. . apparently to protect its windfall oil revenue from any new sanctions . "
Yet that very oil revenue is already protected , reports Nuclear Threat Initiative , thanks to " Record high oil prices [ that ] have insulated Iran from U.N. and U.S. economic sanctions . "
An Iranian banker claimed that , " So long as we are selling the oil nothing [ such as sanctions -- Ed. ] will work . "
But , Bush 's conciliatory tone aside , just two weeks ago Elaine Sciolino reported in the New York Times that , " in an unusually blunt and detailed report [ the International Atomic Energy Agency said ] that Iran 's suspected research into the development of nuclear weapons remained ' a matter of serious concern ' and that Iran continued to owe the agency ' substantial explanations . ' "
At Asia Times Online , erstwhile Iran commentator Kaveh Afrasiabi felt compelled to ask , " What magic was pulled on the IAEA to bestow sudden legitimacy on [ what it previously termed ] ' unreliable ' and ' dubious ' information ( other than the heat of US pressure ) ? "
The information to which he referred is that downloaded from the Laptop of Mass Destruction smuggled out of Iran .
It was chock full of nuclear designs that Tehran maintains had been uploaded by the West .
" Is this now the end of the IAEA 's hitherto heroic standing up to [ the US ] ? " he asked .
As for Europe 's motive for backing heightened sanctions , in their Times article , Myers and Fathi quote analyst Julianne Smith : " I think this was a European attempt to show the Bush administration that Europe takes the threat seriously and to [ keep ] Israel or the United States " from a military strike .
To put a kind face on it , perhaps the IAEA 's firmer stance , like Europe 's , is also an attempt to preempt Bush & Co. 's preemptive tendencies .
Instead it may just be adding fuel to the fire .
Dion Nissenbaum reports for McClatchy on June 12 in " Strike on Iran nuclear sites under discussion again " : " Now , thanks [ in part to ] newly stated concerns by the International Atomic Energy Agency , the idea of a targeted strike meant to cripple Iran 's nuclear program is getting a new hearing . "
Also , " In public threats and private briefings with American decision - makers , Israeli officials have been making the case [ for ] a military strike . "
Aside from the " decider " himself , our number one " decision - maker " is Vice President Cheney .
Wait , is n't he yesterday 's news ?
In " Pentagon blocked Cheney 's attack on Iran " at Asia Times Online and other sites , Gareth Porter reported on Cheney 's proposal last August to launch air strikes at suspected training camps for Iraqi fighters in Iran .
" Pentagon officials argued that no decision should be made .
. . without a thorough discussion of .
. . Iranian retaliation for such an attack . "
In other words , by shifting the focus of the discussion to escalation , the Pentagon was able to push Cheney 's pot o'war to the back burner , where it continued to simmer .
But its chances of being turned up to a full boil are increasing .
In " Hawks still circling on Iran , " Inter Press Service 's Jim Lobe reports on Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert 's recent visit to the US .
He appeared to " have left the White House after meeting with President George W Bush and an earlier dinner with Vice President Dick Cheney quite satisfied .
. . that the administration plans to carry out a ' massive ' attack in the window between the November elections and Bush 's departure from office . "
Worse , Cheney 's aide - de- nepotism -- daughter , Elizabeth -- despite leaving her job as deputy assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern Affairs two years ago after the birth of her fifth child , has once again rallied to his cause .
At the recent AIPAC conference , " Deferment Baby " * attacked her former boss , Condoleezza Rice , and her policies , such as seeking a peace accord between Israel and the Palestinian Authority before Bush leaves office .
Lobe quoted fille Cheney : " When we focus on [ Israeli - Palestinian peace talks ] , we do n't have time to focus on Iran . "
If Iran does n't heed UN Security Council demands to halt enrichment , it " will face military action " she said .
The Weekly Standard 's Stephen Hayes ( Cheney 's favorite writer according to Lobe ) chimed in by accusing Rice of betraying the Bush Doctrine .
Lobe concludes that Hayes and Elizabeth 's closeness to the vice president and " views [ which ] are so harsh and so public suggests to me that Cheney feels more confident than he has felt for some time . "
Worse , " Bush and Olmert reportedly spent much more time during their meeting on Iran than on [ Israel - Palestine ] , " Lobe writes , " suggesting that the president .
. . accepted Liz 's notion [ that ]
Iran should take precedence . "
" That does not mean they will prevail , " he concludes .
But it 's apparent that " the Cheneys have gained some ground . "
Deciphering the Bush administration 's signals has become a cottage industry in Washington .
But , while nobody keeps a secret better than the vice president , it 's no secret that attacking Iran has long been his heart 's desire .
With Bush , however , it is n't secrecy that makes reading his tea leaves a challenge .
It 's that when he's not the Decider , as with Iraq , he 's the Undecided , as with Iran .
If a political cartoonist has n't yet , he or she should consider portraying Bush with a devil -- Cheney -- squatting on one shoulder muttering , " Attack . "
On the other perches an angel -- Rice ( okay , fallen angel ) -- murmuring , " Palestinian peace process . "
By definition , foreign policy is swaddled in secrecy .
Will FDR or wo n't he join England in the war with Germany ?
Is JFK really going to play chicken with Russia over the Cuban missiles ?
Thus we fail to notice how submitting to this incessant -- with Iran , at least since 2005 -- guessing game demeans us .
Bush & Co. make wild swings back and forth from sanctions to negotiations to preparing for an attack .
Iran , on the other hand , exhibits behavior typical of a state subservient to another more powerful :
Test the waters , push the envelope , two steps forward one step back .
Divining the administration 's intentions for Iran on any given day is hard enough .
But we 're also tasked with staring down the two larger issues into which it folds -- first , a foreign policy that 's at best peremptory , at worst preemptive , and , second , said secrecy .
Reforming the State Secrets Privilege , as John Conyers and the House Judiciary Committee has been trying to do , as well as abolishing warrantless surveillance , would be a start .
* The title of an article on Slate four years ago by Timothy Noah , who wrote that her " birth date falls precisely nine months and two days after the Selective Service publicly revoked its policy of not drafting childless husbands . "
That is , pere Cheney , needed a child to continue to evade the draft .

An exchange with an ex-Maoist booster for Obama
15 July 2008
The following letter was sent to the World Socialist Web Site by Carl Davidson in response to the article “ Obama ’s swing to right sparks warnings from ‘ left ’ backers ” posted on the WSWS July 9 .
It is followed by a reply by the article ’s author , Bill Van Auken .
Maoist shill for Democrats ?
That ’s a hoot ; I ’ll add it to my collection .
The pro-war Dem officeholders around here would raise an eyebrow or two , seeing how they ’ve tried to get me to ‘ shill ’ for them to no avail .
No , I ’ve spent the last forty years of my life trying to figure out effective ways to supplant the Dems with something that serves the working class .
I ’m still plugging away at it — although in ways I ’m sure are not to your liking .
Call me a ‘ post Maoist , neo- Bukharinite revisionist , ’ if you like .
It ’d be a little more accurate , although I prefer cyber -Marxist for the 21st Century , a version of what the ‘ Old Mole ’ might favor , where he still around .
See http://carldavidson.blogspot.com for more .
But some of your analysis is amusing .
It ’s not required for me to take the antiwar movement to the Democrats .
They ’ve been in it from day one , before the war broke out even .
In Chicago , local Dems as well as those to their left , planned the first big antiwar rallies ;
Dem officials were on the platform with others to their left as well , and large numbers , if not a majority , of the marchers were people who were Democrats or voted for them , too .
We got the Chicago city council , almost entirely Democrats , to vote twice against the war .
With many Dem signatures , we got ‘ Out Now ’ on the ballot in Cook County in 2006 , winning by 81 to 19 , without over 800,000 votes for it , mostly Democrats .
Does this mean these Democrats are in conflict with many top leaders and the ‘ DLC Blue Dogs ’ of their party ?
It certain does .
That ’s why it ’s silly to ignore it .
But where would you suggest that we start purging Dems from the ranks of those opposed to the war in order to make it more to your liking ?
Shall we exclude the ‘ Out Now ’ bloc of four left - progressive aldermen in Chicago ?
They were the ones there with us on day one .
This war will end when a president , either a Dem or GOP , gives the order and / or a Democratic Congress cuts off the money .
They wo n’t be the engine driving the decisions , but it does n’t require the overthrow of the two - party system to do it .
If you think it does , make your case .
I ’d love to see it .
Meanwhile , to end this war sooner rather than later , which is our internationalist duty , our task is figuring out the strategy and tactics of getting from here to there .
And believe me , ending this war will require tactical alliances with forces even to the right of some liberal Dems .
As for Obama , his position on the war is not the same as ours , and never has been , a point we ’ve always made .
But an Obama White House is a far better target than a McCain White House for mobilizing against this war and bringing it to an earlier end .
That ’s what makes him our ‘ best option , ’ but you ’re too much a prisoner of old ideas to take advantage of it .
Carl Davidson
* * *
Mr. Davidson ’s letter fully confirms the brief characterization of him contained in my article dealing with the “ left ” apologists of Barack Obama and their varied reactions to his lurch to the right in the wake of his victory in the Democratic primaries .
I mentioned him in relation to the group “ Progressives for Obama ” headed Tom Hayden , the former Vietnam War protester who served as a longtime Democratic state legislator in California .
Davidson is the webmaster for the group ’s site .
I was frankly concerned that the significance of his involvement would escape many WSWS readers , particular those of the younger generation .
Frankly , his views on the Democratic Party — which are not all that different from those of the “ progressive aldermen ” of Chicago whom he extols in his letter — would be of little or no interest outside of his political history in the 1960s and 1970s .
The arguments he makes are crude , the political conceptions utterly banal and there is not a hint of principle in anything he has to say .
The style in this case is truly the man .
But Davidson ’s political biography is emblematic of the political trajectory of a whole socio-political layer known as the “ New Left ” of the 1960s .
He began his political career as a leader of the Students for a Democratic Society in the 1960s , campaigning on university campuses for student power and delivering lectures with titles like “ the naysayer in happyland , ” which expressed the influence of writers like Herbert Marcuse and his own myopic view of American society .
From there , Davidson turned to Maoism , authoring in 1973 a scurrilous attack on Trotskyism entitled “ Left in Form , Right in Essence : A Critique of Contemporary Trotskyism , ” which regurgitated the speeches of Stalin and the political arguments of the Stalinist secret police , the GPU .
Now , in his latest incarnation , following the Stalinist bureaucracy ’s liquidation of the Soviet Union and the Maoist bureaucracy ’s embrace of global capitalism , Davidson has dedicated himself to making “ left ” pragmatic arguments for why voting Democratic is the most effective means of ending war .
There is a clear line of continuity that runs through all of these stages of Davidson ’s political career — a rejection of the revolutionary role of the working class and hostility to those who fight for its political independence .
Davidson appears to be repeating arguments that he has made previously against antiwar protesters who have criticized his orientation to the Democratic Party .
The WSWS never had any confusion about the role of the Democratic Party in these protests and the work done by Davidson and others in the leadership of United for Peace and Justice and other organizations to subordinate the protest movement to the Democrats ’ electoral campaigns .
It is largely this bankrupt political orientation that explains the apparent contradiction of dwindling numbers participating in these protests under conditions of widening opposition to the war .
Even within this political setup , Davidson has distinguished himself with his right - wing views , functioning precisely as a “ shill for the Democrats . ”
In the last presidential election , he was the co-author of a document entitled “ Moving from Protest to Politics : Dumping Bush ’s Regime in 2004 , ” which made the case for turning the antiwar movement into a vote - catching appendage of the Democratic Party on the platform of anybody but Bush .
He went on to back John Kerry , even as the Democratic candidate indicated that , if elected , he would carry out his own “ surge , ” sending more troops into Iraq .
Davidson has boasted of endorsing Obama when he began climbing the ladder of the Chicago Democratic Party machine with a run for the state legislature in 1996 .
“ I ’ve been in his home , ” he bragged on one radical list serve , also noting that he helped organize a fundraiser for him in the run-up to his 2004 US Senate campaign .
Summing up his outlook — one of abject prostration before the two - party system — Davidson writes to the WSWS : “ This war will end when a president , either a Dem or GOP , gives the order ... but it does n’t require the overthrow of the two - party system to do it .
If you think it does , make your case .
I ’d love to see it . ”
We ’ve made the case many times .
The fundamental source of war lies not in the right - wing ideology of the Bush administration , but in the insoluble contradictions of US and world capitalism .
To the extent that the two - party system and capitalism remain , new wars are inevitable .
The only means of fighting this threat lies in the struggle to politically separate the working class from the domination of bourgeois politics and the Democratic Party in particular .
But , in any case , Obama is making the argument for us .
He has already made it clear that the “ order ” he will give when he enters the White House is to draw down US combat forces in Iraq in order to escalate the war against the people of Afghanistan , while leaving behind a “ residual force ” that will continue the occupation and killing in Iraq itself .
If this is what Davidson means by ending war , then we may well see the former Maoist making his “ left ” arguments for why the “ good war ” against the Afghans deserves the support of “ progressives , ” thereby assisting America ’s political establishment in effecting a tactical change that it clearly becoming a consensus policy within both big business parties .
This is already a well - worn path by others veteran of the “ New Left ” in many countries .
As for the absurd reference to the “ old mole , ” Marx would have no trouble discerning the content of Davidson ’s politics , and would find no need for a meaningless title like “ cyber revolutionary . ”
He described those of his own day who sought to subordinate the nascent workers movement to the parties of the bourgeoisie as “ philistines , ” “ quacks ” and “ scoundrels . ”
If anything , these descriptions are mild for those supposed “ lefts ” and ex-radicals who seek to foment illusions in the Democratic Party today .
Davidson ’s evolution from Maoist ideologue to Obama booster truly places him in the category of those who learn nothing and forget nothing .

History books teem with six - word phrases , from the comforting ( “ Nothing to fear but fear itself ” ) to the inspiring ( “ Mr. Gorbachev , tear down this wall ” ) to the embarrassing ( “ Read my lips : no new taxes ” ) .
But the six words “ on the basis of union membership ” could be more momentous than any of those .
Though hardly Roosevelt ’s rhetoric , Reagan ’s bluster or Bush ’s clumsiness , the clause could solve America ’s wage crisis .
Of course , when Tom Geoghegan told me this in a Chicago park two weeks ago , I almost snarfed my coffee through my nose .
Solving major social problems typically demands more than six words .
But as the longtime labor lawyer and author explained his idea to me on a muggy afternoon , it started making sense .
Geoghegan reminded me that data show the more union members in an economy , the better workers ’ pay .
The problem , he said , is that weakened labor laws are allowing companies to bully and fire union - sympathetic workers , thus driving down union membership and wages .
Enter Geoghegan ’s six words .
If the Civil Rights Act was amended to prevent discrimination “ on the basis of union membership , ” it would curtail corporations ’ anti-labor assault by making the right to join a union an official civil right .
“ Hang on , ” I interrupted .
“ Joining a union is n’t a civil right ? ”
Correct .
Under current law , if you are fired for union activity , you can only take your grievance to the National Labor Relations Board — a byzantine agency deliberately made more Kafkaesque by right - wing appointees and budget cuts .
Today , the NLRB takes years to rule on labor law violations , often granting victims only their back pay .
Union leaders are now focused on reforming the NLRB — an admirable goal — but Geoghegan ’s plan implies that workers are harmed by being legally leashed to Washington in the first place .
His proposal says rather than being forced to rely on an unreliable bureaucracy for protection , workers should be empowered to defend themselves .
The six words would do just that .
Regardless of whether the NLRB is strengthened or further weakened , persecuted workers would be able to haul union - busting thugs into court .
There , unlike at the NLRB , plaintiffs can subpoena company records and win costly punitive damages .
Bolstering his argument , Geoghegan told me to consider variations in corporate behavior .
For example , because the Civil Rights
Act bars racial discrimination , businesses are motivated to try to prevent bigotry — they want to avoid being sued .
But when it comes to unions , there is no such deterrent .
The lack of civil rights protection effectively encourages businesses to punish pro-union employees — and publicize the abuse to intimidate their workforce .
By making the six words law , the dynamic would shift .
Companies would have a reason — fear of litigation — to respect workers ’ rights .
When Geoghegan and I finished chatting , I remembered why I believe he is America ’s most talented writer and thinker on labor issues .
His relative anonymity is a tragicomic commentary on the media and the American left .
The Milton Friedmans are celebrated by pundits and cast in bronze by conservative think tanks , while the Geoghegans are dismissed by the chattering class and ignored by a progressive movement that regularly venerates Hollywood celebrities as its heroes .
Perhaps , though , this proposal will change things .
In developing a way to shift incentives , Geoghegan has discovered a solution that both unionists and economists can love .
It cribs the best from liberals ’ pro-union sympathies and conservatives ’ distrust of Big Government , and should make him famous ( or at least a cabinet secretary ) .
After all , anyone who can bring such disparate ideologies and adversaries together is worthy of serious consideration — as is his six - word stroke of genius .

TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iranian police have launched a more extensive crackdown on “ social corruption ” such as women flouting Islamic dress codes , the Farhang-e Ashti newspaper reported on Monday .

“ In its wider crackdown which has started from Saturday , police will confront those who appear in public in an indecent way and will also seal off shops selling un -Islamic dress , ” the newspaper said , quoting an unnamed police official .
The dress code imposed after Iran ’s 1979 Islamic revolution requires women to cover all their hair and wear long , loose - fitting clothes to disguise the shape of their bodies .
Violators can receive lashes , fines or imprisonment .
The authorities usually launch crackdowns before the hot summer months when women like to wear lighter clothing such as calf - length pants and brightly colored scarves pushed back to expose plenty of hair .
But enforcement of strict moral codes governing women ’s dress became more strict since President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad swept to power in 2005 with the backing of conservative clerics and the Basij religious forces who condemn such “ un - Islamic ” practices .
“ Police will seize women with tight coats and cropped trousers and also men with Western - style hair cut will be arrested , ” the newspaper said .
Especially in the urban areas , many women ignore traditional head - to - toe black chadors .
The Islamic dress code is less commonly challenged in poor suburbs and rural regions .
“ Men with Western - style haircuts were confronted by police and also barber shops that gave them such haircuts were sealed off on Sunday , ” said the daily .
Some women , testing the boundaries of the law by wearing tight clothes were also confronted by morality police , located mainly at the affluent northern Tehran squares .
“ Police also swept through popular shopping centers , where such outfits are sold and some of those shops were sealed off , ” the daily said .
There comes a point in every new relationship when your girlfriend wants to share a secret .
Usually it's to do with sex – how many other partners she 's had ( with a few conveniently erased ) – that sort of thing .
Often , the secret changes the basis of the relationship ; honesty comes with consequences .
But what happens if your new girlfriend has a much darker and more sinister secret than having slept around a bit ?
Sitting naked on the edge of the bed in a cheap , sweltering hotel room in the heart of a war - torn , drug - producing region of Colombia , I lit a cigarette and listened as the girl I had just made love with told me a secret dark enough to shake anyone from their postcoital bliss .
I had been in Colombia for a few months to learn how to become a photojournalist .
Not by attending some theoretical university course , or taking portraits in a cosy studio , but by pitching myself in at the deep end .

Times of peace have been rare in the country 's history .
For the past 40 years or so , a Marxist - inspired rebel group known as the Farc ( Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ) have been at war with the government , funding their growing army by kidnapping and extortion , and taxing the illegal cocaine trade .
Right - wing death squads known as " self - defence forces " have sprung up as a response to the Farc 's kidnapping of wealthy landowners and drug - lords .
Under the umbrella of an organisation called the AUC ( Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia ) these private militias , or paramilitaries ( known locally as " paras " ) , are secretly supported by those high in the government and military , who back their dirty war against the Farc rebels .
This triangular conflict has exacted , and continues to exact , a hefty price from the Colombian people .
During the past four decades , over 200,000 have lost their lives and more than three million have been forced from their homes by violence or intimidation .
This week , following an incursion by government forces to kill Farc rebels in Ecuador , the conflict was at the centre of a diplomatic crisis involving both nations , together with Hugo Chavez 's Venezuela .
To dismiss all this brutality as a simple war over drugs does the Colombian people a gross injustice .
Its roots are buried in the economic and social imbalance that permeates the country , a huge working class living in poverty , lining the pockets of a tiny , wealthy upper class who own more than 90 per cent of the land , industry and business .
My goal , therefore , was to meet and photograph members of each of the groups involved , and to attempt explain Latin America 's 40 - year conflict .
I began by travelling to a part of the country with a strong Farc presence , and , after much perseverance , persuaded the rebels to let me live in one of their camps .
After documenting their daily lives and being alongside them in a firefight against government troops , it was time to go off in search of their sworn enemies , the paras .
I headed towards the Putumayo , one of the narco - trafficking centres and scene of ongoing skirmishes between Farc and the paras in southern Colombia on the border with Ecuador .
It took a couple of days travelling on a local bus to get to the capital , Puerto Asis .
En route , I began talking with a fellow passenger , a beautiful Colombian girl called Marylin who told me she was returning from a clothes - buying trip in one of the big cities .
I explained my purpose in visiting the region , and Marylin told me she had friends in both the paramilitaries and the military , so would be able to help .
She invited me to stay with her family , who had a roadside store and bar on the outskirts of town .
I was attracted to Marylin , but had no idea how close we would become and how our future would unfold .
I spent the next few weeks living with her family , making trips out into the countryside to photograph the coca fields and to meet the paramilitaries .
Marylin and I spent long afternoons lying together in a hammock .
We held hands and kissed occasionally , but it went no further .
Eventually , my time and funds ran out and I had to return to England .
As I said goodbye , I promised to do my best to return and Marylin told me I was now " part of the family " .

Six months later , I was back , determined to explore this conflict fully , learn as much as I could and maybe publish a book .
I made my way back to Puerto Asis with the intention of spending some time with Marylin and her family .
But I was in for some surprises : Marylin told me that she had joined the AUC and had been active in combat in the nearby village of El Tigre .
Another female friend who had been fighting at her side had been killed , along with 25 other paramilitary fighters and at least 15 rebels .
When the combat ceased , the entire population of the village fled .
Marylin 's brother was now working on a coca plantation and carried a pistol that he slept with under his pillow .
I did n't find it particularly shocking .
This was , after all , a country torn apart by every type of violence .
Only luck , or lack of it , dictated which side you were on .
Months passed .
I travelled around the country developing my project .
The results received positive attention , including a prize in an international competition , and it was suggested that I go to Iraq to document the war there .
And so I did .
But , after six months living with the daily car bombings and rocket attacks in Baghdad , I was hankering to return to Colombia .
A year after our first meeting , I arrived back at Marylin 's home in a battered taxi .
I sat and drank an ice - cold beer with her father while waiting for her to return from an " errand " .
I then walked hand - in - hand with her and her four - year - old daughter , Natalie , down the rutted cart track to a tree - shaded river behind her house .
With her daughter splashing around near the bank we waded , arm in arm , into the deeper , cooler water .
I felt there was a change in the atmosphere , but I could n't exactly put my finger on what I was sensing .
I asked Marylin if things would be different between us if I stayed at a hotel in the town rather than with her family .
She agreed that it might make it easier for us to be together , so I found myself a room .
That evening , she came for dinner .
We ate on the balcony and , as we shared a bottle of wine and listened to the chorus of insects , I began to think that the year of groundwork I had put in was about to pay off .
Marylin stayed the night .
Puerto Asis , Marylin 's home town sits a degree or two above the equator .
Air - conditioning was an expensive extra and I was broke .
The tiny hotel room was stifling , and , as we lay curled in the sweat - soaked sheets , with the shouts of street vendors and the rumble of early morning traffic drifting in though the balcony window , Marylin said she had something to tell me .
She then hit me with a confession that would both thrill and confuse me .
She explained that in the months that I had been away in Iraq her role within the AUC had changed ; she had joined the urban militia and become an assassin .
Her job was now to eliminate informers and traitors .
So far , she told me , she had killed at least 10 people in the area .
I lit a cigarette and inhaled deeply , Marylin looked at me through the smoke as I exhaled , waiting to see how I would respond to what she had just told me .
Strangely , her confession did not have the impact one would expect ; I did not recoil in horror .
The months I had spent in Colombia and in Iraq surrounded by violence had altered my perspective .
I do n't think that I had become immune to death or suffering but I had certainly become less easily shocked .
The difference between victim and victor , rebel and refugee , often felt like only a matter of perspective .
I had always enjoyed the company of the " doers " , the rebels and the soldiers who were out risking their lives for causes I supposed they believed in .
I was left cold by the wealthy , well - dressed beauty queens who inhabited the upmarket clubs of Bogota .
Although I would later feel very differently , my initial reaction to Marylin 's words were an acceptance that may even have bordered on approval .
I guess I felt that as war - zone lovers go , she was pretty " cool " .
In the beginning , her visits to my hotel room – usually armed with a pistol – did not disturb me greatly .
At first , I do n't think the real implications of what Marylin was doing had filtered through the surreal haze .
I was young and living out a great adventure .
This was surely the closest I would ever get to someone who was truly and totally involved and immersed in this conflict .
The woman I had only recently begun sleeping with was a hired killer and there was a gun on my bedside table .
Watching her take the pistol from her belt , unbutton her jeans and slip into bed I somehow could n't quite equate the woman in my arms with the bodies I had seen in the local morgue , their heads shattered by gunshots at close range , murders she confessed to having committed .
High on a combination of the heady tropical climate , local rum , grade A cocaine and in the arms of nubile 22 - year - old , fantasy and reality became blurred .
It felt like I was living in a Quentin Tarantino movie .
One morning , Marylin told me that the previous night she had persuaded a friend to help her decapitate and dismember a woman she had been contracted to kill .
This was no informer , but , rather , a friend of hers who paid her to kill her boyfriend 's other girlfriend .
She described so graphically what had happened , with so little feeling , that at last reality kicked in .
I found my feelings about her changing .
The romantic light started to fade fast .
She no longer seemed to be a legitimate part of a civil conflict but had evolved into a freelance killer , taking life in exchange for money – no more , no less .
Although I still found her sexually attractive and wanted to be with her , something else was ricocheting around in my brain .
Some of the thoughts that would have occurred to anyone else much earlier were , now , at last , beginning to filter through .
Over the past year , I had photographed her swimming in the river with her daughter and reading bedtime stories .
Now , the images I was recording concentrated almost entirely on the other side of her life .
I was , with thoughts of self - preservation in mind , reducing her to " subject " .
I asked Marylin if she would be prepared to let me interview her about her life and what she had become involved in .
Wearing a balaclava and brandishing a pistol , she permitted me to video our conversation .
I began by asking her how she had first become involved with the paramilitaries and why she decided to join them .
How she had been persuaded to kill her first victim and how she felt about it .
She started hesitantly , but gathered confidence as her story unfolded .
" When I killed the first person , I was afraid , I was scared .
I killed the first person just to see if I could .
But there is an obligation to kill .
If you do n't , they kill you .
That 's why the first was very hard , because the person I killed was kneeling down begging , crying and saying , ' Do n't kill me .
I have children . '
That 's why it was difficult and sad .
But if you do n't kill that person , someone else from the AUC will kill you .
After the killing , you keep trembling .
You can't eat or talk to anyone .
I was at home , but I kept imagining the person begging not to be killed .
I shut myself inside , but with time I forgot everything .
The superiors always say , ' Do n't worry , that was just the first time .
When you kill the second one , it will all be OK . '
But you keep trembling .
" The second time is only a bit easier , but as they say here , ' If you can kill one , you can kill many more . '
" You have to lose the fear .
Now I am still killing and nothing happens .
I feel normal .
Before , I had an obligation to kill , I was sent to kill .
But once I left the organisation , I was not obligated .
I now only do the job for money .
" Yes [ I killed one of my friends ] , because they were going to kill me .
They told me to take care because they worked for the other side and had connections with the guerrillas .
And so it was my life or theirs .
So I asked permission to do it , which [ the AUC ] gave me .
[ The AUC ] investigated and it came out positive that [ my friends ] worked for the guerrillas , so I killed them .
It was very painful for me .
I was at the burial and at the vigil .
It hurt me to see his mother crying , knowing I was the one guilty of having caused that .
But it 's your life and you 're taught in the [ AUC ] school :
First you , then the others .
In total , I have killed 23 people . "
An incredible sadness washed over me as I listened to this intelligent young woman , who I had become so close to , talk of her life .
Marylin was an extreme victim of circumstance .
Her boredom and quest for excitement had brought her into contact with the paramilitaries , who had brainwashed her and left her with no respect for human life .
Not her own , not even her family's .
But her excuses , or lack of them , riled me and I told her she represented everything that was wrong with the country .
From my privileged and ultimately unqualified position as an outsider I found it impossible to identify with her , only to be angry , upset and judgemental .
Reducing her to a " subject " had not worked , I did not seem able to be detached and objective or able to put my own feelings aside .
I had travelled too far beyond that point .
While on one level I relished the intensity of what I was experiencing , there was a price to be paid for getting in so deep and it was high .
I realised that the things I had seen and heard in the last couple of months were incredible .
Through them , my passion for Colombia had grown and my understanding of what was happening in this much misunderstood country had broadened .
But I felt that I had lost something and been damaged by them , too .
I returned to Iraq and then moved on to covering the war in Afghanistan .
Over the course of a year , Marylin and I exchanged emails periodically .
They mainly involved her asking me where I was and asking me not to forget her .
She told me that the things I had said to her after her interview had had a big impact .
No one had spoken to her like that , really questioned her about what she was doing with her life .
She told me that she did want to make a new beginning , but that she knew the AUC do not let their members leave , at least not alive .
After a long period of silence , I began to fear something had happened .
So I decided that I would return to Puerto Asis to learn the truth .
It took me some time to pluck up the courage to drive out to her home to see if she and her family were still around .
I wondered if she had perhaps made the break and left to begin a new life or whether , more likely , her past had caught up with her .
Given the dreadful things that I already knew she had been involved in , I was at least somewhat prepared for bad news .
What I was not ready for was how confusing it was going to be to hear it .
Her family showed their normal surprise at finding me at their front door .
All my fears were confirmed as her father , his eyes welling with tears , told me that Marylin was dead .
She was 25 years and two months old when she was kidnapped from her home and stoned to death .
Her abductors crushed her head with rocks and then shot her .
The next morning , her now six - year - old daughter , Natalie , awoke as an orphan , Marylin 's parents had lost a third daughter and her brother so overcome with grief that he was unable to walk , talk , or even feed himself .
Marylin was not killed by some local seeking revenge for one of the many deaths that had occurred at her hands during her time as an assassin .
She was murdered by her own group in a symbolic stoning for being a sapo ( " frog " ) , which is what Colombians call informers .
Her most recent boyfriend was a government soldier , convenient enough when the paramilitaries and the military were working side - by - side in their war to wrest control of the coca fields of Putumayo from the Farc , but enough to get her killed when that relationship soured and her pillow talk continued .
Marylin 's death had a special significance for me , because I , too , had shared some of that pillow talk .
We had been friends and then lovers .
Our lives never had much in common ; except that Colombia 's dirty little war had both of us locked into its fatal grip .
I found it difficult to speak ; I was n't actually sure what I was feeling .
Was I feeling sorry that a young woman , who had deliberately taken the lives of other human beings , had received the same kind of street - corner justice she had been responsible for handing out ?
Was I reliving the conversations we had about changing her life and the emails I received from her thanking me and saying she needed to talk more about how she could get out of the mess she was in ?
Was I wishing I had done more to help her ?
Was I feeling sorry for her parents and her beautiful daughter , who one day would want an explanation as to why her mother was killed and , maybe , discover the horrors that occurred while she was a sleeping baby ?
Was I remembering what it was like to kiss her in those days before I had any clue she was an assassin ?
Was I trying to imagine , or perhaps trying not to imagine , what she looked like after her head had been destroyed with stones and rocks ?
In truth , I was thinking , feeling and imagining all of these things .
At the same time , though , I knew that whatever pain her family was feeling , she had caused this same pain to others many times over .
Back in my hotel room I let out the longest of breaths , lit a cigarette and stared at the ceiling fan .
The whirling blades churned together my memories of the wars I 'd been in , my ex-girlfriend and my current situation .
Early next morning , together with Marylin 's mother and Natalie , both wearing their best dresses and carrying flowers , I went to see where Marylin body had been laid to rest .
Her coffin was in a concrete box , resting on top of the tomb of her sister , who had also been killed by the conflict .
The number of bodies demanding burial had long ago outstripped the space available .
Alongside lay a much smaller tomb ; the remains of another of her sisters , who 'd died of natural causes aged three months .
I could not imagine how Marylin 's mother felt holding the hand of her granddaughter , looking over the graves of all three of her daughters .
My plan for travelling deeper into Putumayo to photograph the paramilitaries no longer seemed such a good idea .
Marylin had always pointed me in the right direction and warned me when pushing further was not a good idea .
I wanted to learn more about her life and death , but did n't want to get killed for asking the wrong questions of the wrong people .
That night , eating dinner against a background of revving motorbikes and honking trucks , another local told me more of what had happened to Marylin .
Between mouthfuls of soup , the woman told me that Marylin had been involved with the AUC a lot longer than she had admitted to me , and that it was commonly believed in the town that she was involved in the massacre of 26 villagers in El Tigre .
Many of the victims were decapitated and disembowelled before being thrown into a river .
I booked a seat on the next available flight out .
As I watched Puerto Asis disappear below me , the plane was enveloped by cloud .
On my iPod , someone was singing " this city 's made us crazy and we must get out " .
As I sit typing this , nearly 9,000 miles away in a freezing , dark hotel room in Kabul , Afghanistan , covering yet another never - ending conflict , I wonder whether it could have ever ended any differently .
Was Marylin really killed because she was an informer or because , as she indicated in her emails , she did really want to leave the AUC and start a new life ?
This is what I want to believe .
I want to believe that she had a change of heart .
I want to believe that she was n't the cold , heartless , evil killer she appeared to be .
But who am I trying to fool ?

( Natural News ) Comments by China that it intends to move away from its reliance on the dollar triggered a sharp drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and heightened worldwide fears about the U.S. currency 's stability .
Chinese Central Bank Vice Director Xiu Jian said that his country is planning to shift much of its $ 1.4 trillion national currency reserve from dollars to more stable currencies , such as the euro or Canadian dollar .
After these comments , the dollar fell to record lows relative to other currencies -- the lowest ever against the euro , the lowest in a generation against the British pound , and the lowest in 57 years against the Canadian dollar .
"
The big issue on any currency is if its rate of depreciation is so fast that it scares away all capital , and the announcement that we heard from China sort of feeds those fears , " said Larry Smith , chief investment officer at Third Wave Global Investors .
China is the world 's largest investor in U.S. Treasury bonds and securities , holding more U.S. debt than any country but Japan .
Because China 's currency is linked to the dollar , the country also maintains a massive reserve of the currency .
But this policy had already begun to shift at the time of Xiu's comments .
China has divested approximately 5 percent of its $ 400 billion holdings in the U.S. Treasury and established a $ 200 billion fund to help diversify its investments in equities and stocks around the world .
" We will favor stronger currencies over weaker ones , and will readjust accordingly , " said Cheng Siwei , vice chairman of China 's National People 's Congress .
It is not just U.S. investors who are concerned .
Because the dollar 's fluctuations have driven up the euro , exports in Europe have fallen and sparked fears for the stability of that continent 's economy .
In a recent speech , French president Nicolas Sarkozy added his voice to those calling for the Bush administration to act to stabilize the currency " The dollar cannot remain ' someone else 's problem , ' " Sarkozy said .
" If we are not careful , monetary disarray could morph into economic war .
We would all be its victims . "
There 's nothing sadder than a tiny dog in a purse .
That really has to be the lowest possible point in evolution .
After all , if these yipping purse dogs were meant for anything else , we 'd see wild packs of them taking down antelope during Discovery Channel 's menacing " Chihuahua Week . "
Right ?
Well , there 's more to the story .
It turns out a lot of these ridiculous breeds were once designed for all manners of badassery .

Imagine it as a hairy canister of mace that did n't stop chewing on the eyes until commanded to do so .
They were employed by kings and courtiers alike .
They were known as Fu Lin , or the Lion Dog of China .
Unfortunately for them , their size and cuteness factor were just too undeniable , even back then .
They became known as an extravagant fashion accessory , matching their coats to specific wardrobes .
At least that time around they were purses with a taste for blood .

PARIS  Amazon , the online retailing giant with a fast - rising share of the consumer book market , has adopted the literary equivalent of a nuclear option for rebellious publishers who balk at its demands .
In the latest in a series of disputes over the division of revenue from online sales , Amazon has disabled the “ buy now with 1 click ” icon on its British Web site for hundreds of books published by the British unit of Hachette Livre , from back - list Stephen King novels to , naturally , “ The Hachette Guide to French Wine . ”
The button allows registered users to purchase titles instantly , with free shipping .
Customers can still buy the affected books , but they have to navigate to an open marketplace that links them to third - party sellers of new or used books .
And they have to pay for shipping .
The struggle comes at a time that Amazon ’s power as a bookseller is increasing , with sales growing online in an otherwise tepid global book market .
Some publishers fear that with the introduction of Amazon ’s Kindle electronic reader , the company will rise into a position to be able to demand more concessions .

So disconnected from reality is the average Faux News watcher , the government can kill al - Qaeda terrorists over and over and he does not notice .
The supposed elimination of al - Masri was perfectly timed to coincide with a meeting between Bush and Pakistani prime minister Yousaf Raza Gillani .
Abu Khabab al - Masri , aka Midhat Mursi al - Sayid Umar , described as al - Qaeda ’s chemical and biological weapons expert , was reportedly killed on July 29 by a CIA drone on the Afghan border .
He was said to have a $ 5 million bounty on his head .
“ Western diplomats said it would be a boost to morale in the Bush administration , struggling with mounting troop casualties in Afghanistan and a revival of militant attacks in Iraq , ” reports the Financial Times .
It ’s all about “ morale , ” or rather propaganda , and has nothing to do with reality .
It ’s about sending a message to Pakistan ’s new government .
The supposed elimination of al - Masri was perfectly timed to coincide with a meeting between Bush and Pakistani prime minister Yousaf Raza Gillani .
In fact , al - Masri ’s death is a recycled bit of propaganda .
On January 18 , 2006 , ABC News reported “ that Pakistani officials now believe that al Qaeda ’s master bomb maker and chemical weapons expert was one of the men killed in last week ’s U.S. missile attack in eastern Pakistan … .
Midhat Mursi , 52 , also known as Abu Khabab al - Masri , was identified by Pakistani authorities as one of four known major al Qaeda leaders present at an apparent terror summit in the village of Damadola early last Friday morning . ”
At the time , it was said the attack missed its target , Ayman al - Zawahri , a recipient of CIA largess , a fact reported by the Guardian in 1999 , before everything changed .
It is said al - Masri ran the “ infamous Derunta training camp in Afghanistan , where he used dogs and other animals as subjects for experiments with poison and chemicals . ”
As it turns out , Derunta was a Hezbi Islami camp , that is to say a CIA camp .
Hezbi Islami was created in Pakistan by the ISI and the CIA , influenced by the long time intelligence asset , the Muslim Brotherhood , and was tasked with fighting the Soviet occupation , or more accurately the Soviet response to CIA meddling in Afghanistan , as Zbigniew Brzezinski admitted to Le Nouvel Observateur .
The Derunta camp was one of the many non-al Qaeda camps that Taliban shut down at al Qaeda ’s request , according to Gitmo detainee Abdul Bin Mohammed Bin Abess Ourgy .
Or maybe that should be at the CIA ’s request , as both al - Qaeda and the Taliban are CIA - ISI contrivances .
As usual , things are not as they appear — or rather , they are not as ABC and CBS News tell us they are .
The supposed killing of Abu Khabab al - Masri , however , has it rewards .
“ There is increasing pressure from the West on the four - month - old Pakistan government to act against Taliban and al - Qaeda strongholds in its frontier region with Afghanistan amid concern that peace deals have given militants more freedom to operate , ” reports Time .
In other words , the “ West , ” that is to say the neocons , want a blank check to attack South Waziristan , long an incubator of intelligence spawned terrorist groups .
Pakistan is increasingly described by the script reading corporate media as the new front in the war on terror .
Both Obama and McCain are in favor of attacking Pakistan and not a day passes they do n’t verbalize some nonsense about violating the national sovereignty of that country .
Re-killing Abu Khabab al - Masri , however , pales when compared to other recent propagandistic hogwash fed to a complaisant corporate media by the neocons in their ongoing effort to kill Muslims and reduce their countries to smoldering ruins .
Earlier this week , the corporate media went ga - ga over a preposterous story claiming Iran may have the capability to launch an EMP attack against the United States , a ridiculous scenario painted by William R. Graham before the House Armed Services Committee on July 10 .
It should be noted that Graham has worked for the missile defense lobby for the past two decades and is a member of the State Department ’s Arms Control and Nonproliferation Advisory Board , an outfit rife with neocons and insiders .
Graham is associated with Muslim haters over at Frank Gaffney ’s Center for Security Policy .
Gaffney helped set - up the Project for the New American Century , the neocon “ think - tank ” responsible for formulating “ U.S. global dominance , ” that is to say invading small and defenseless countries and killing countless numbers of people .
“ Think ‘ being Amish ’ for six months or more , ” writes Diane Sayre for the Hartford Sentinel in response to Graham ’s EMP nonsense .
Going Amish might not be a bad idea , though .
Not having Faux , ABC , CNN , CBS , et al for six months might awaken the average American from his slumber .

The Emergency Election Sale is now live !
Get 30 % to 60 % off our most popular products today !
After an inexcusable standoff in Congress , the nation finally has a working Federal Election Commission  the agency that lacked a quorum all these months when it should have been policing the fund - raising tricks of the presidential campaigns .
We hope that the panel now seizes this moment of renewal to rise above the party hackdom that has been its signature flaw .
The presidential campaign has already become a money miasma , a runaway race to break all fund - raising records .
All manner of dodgy election initiatives have been concocted .
But one stands out as especially in need of the commission ’s urgent attention : the announced plan by the Republican Governors Association to raise large amounts of unregulated soft money in the name of Senator John McCain .
Yes , the same Senator McCain who spent so many years fighting against soft money abuses .
On its face , using a fund designed to elect governors to boost a national candidacy would seem to cross legal restrictions against federal electioneering .
The F.E.C. should aggressively examine this latest wrinkle and not let the issue drift , as usual , until well after the election .
( Just to make us all feel better about the state of the campaign , The Wall Street Journal reports that operatives who bankrolled the shameless Swift Boat attack ads against Senator John Kerry four years ago are investing in the governors ’ kitty . )
It 's about time Congress stood up to the most unpopular President in American history .
Unfortunately they can't do the same on some more pressing matters .
CNN :
Congress voted to halt planned cuts in Medicare payments to doctors Tuesday , overriding President Bush 's veto in a battle that pitted health insurers against physicians .
The new law stops a 10.6 percent cut in Medicare payments to doctors , part of a scheduled cost - saving formula that went into effect July 1 .
The money for the doctors will be taken from the government - subsidized Medicare Advantage program , which the Bush administration strongly supports .
Bush spiked the bill Tuesday , telling lawmakers they would be " taking choices away from seniors to pay physicians . "
" I urge the Congress to send me a bill that reduces the growth in Medicare spending , increases competition and efficiency , implements principles of value - driven health care and appropriately offsets increases in physician spending , " he said in his veto message .
The Senate voted 70 - 26 to enact the law over Bush 's objections , the third time in his presidency that Congress has overridden his veto .
The margin in the House of Representatives was a lopsided 383 - 41 , well beyond the two - thirds majority needed .
Where 's Bernanke 's Inner Volcker ?
On the day after an unusually important Fed policy meeting both gold and stocks severely rebuked the central bank 's decision to take no action in support of the weak dollar or to curb rapidly growing inflation .
Gold spiked $ 30 , a clear message that Bernanke & Co. wo n't stop inflation .
Stocks plunged over 200 points , an equally clear message that the Fed 's cheap - dollar inflation is damaging economic growth .
These market warnings are two sides of the same coin .
Inflation , which is caused by excess dollar creation , is the cruelest tax of all .
It is a tax on consumer and family purchasing power .
It is a tax on corporate profits .
It is a tax on the value of stocks , homes , and other assets .
Crucially , the capital - gains tax -- the most important levy on all wealth - creating assets -- is un-indexed for inflation .
Hence , long before Barack Obama or Congress can legislatively raise the capital - gains tax rate , rising inflation is increasing the effective tax rate on real capital gains .
That 's an economy - wide problem .
By doing nothing at the June 25 meeting the Fed turned its back on the very inflation - tax problem it helped create .
The spanking it received from the markets was well deserved .
Former Fed chairman Paul Volcker , who is advising Sen .
Obama 's presidential campaign , issued a stern warning at the New York Economics Club a few months back .
He said inflation is real and the dollar is in crisis .
Soon after , Fed head Ben Bernanke changed his tune in public speeches , pledging greater vigilance on inflation and hinting at a defense of the dollar .
Treasury man Henry Paulson and President Bush also stepped up their rhetoric regarding a stronger greenback .
But words were no substitute for actions this week .
It is an interesting historical footnote that Paul Volcker is still highly regarded as the greatest inflation fighter of our time .
Working with Ronald Reagan , it was Volcker who slew the inflation dragon in the 1980s .
Indeed , the combination of tighter monetary control from the Fed and abundant new tax incentives from Reagan launched an unprecedented twenty - five - year prosperity boom characterized by strong growth and rock - bottom inflation .
At the center of the boom was a remarkable 12 - fold rise in stock market values , a symbol of the renaissance of American capitalism .
But that was then and this is now .
Talk of major new tax hikes is in the air today , while the inflationary decline of the American dollar is plain fact .
It 's as though our economic memory is being erased , both in tax and monetary terms .
Staunchly optimistic supply - siders Arthur Laffer and Steve Moore are even finishing a book on the subject .
Called The Gathering Economic Storm , its concluding chapter is titled : " The Death of Economic Sanity . "
The Volcker anti-inflation model presumably handed down to Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke always argued that price stability is the cornerstone of economic growth .
Yet it appears that today 's Fed has reverted to a 1970s - style Phillips - curve mentality that argues for a trade - off between unemployment and inflation , rather than the primacy of price stability .
History teaches us otherwise .
It states that since rising inflation corrodes economic growth , inflation and unemployment move together -- not inversely .
Even in the last 18 months this is proving true .
Inflation bottomed around 1 percent in late 2006 .
Unemployment bottomed at 4.4 percent about 6 months later .
Today , the CPI inflation rate has climbed to over 4 percent , wholesale prices have jumped to 7 percent , and import prices have spiked to 18 percent .
Unemployment , meanwhile , has moved up to 5.5 percent .
Over the past five years the greenback has lost 40 percent of its value .
Oil is close to $ 140 a barrel .
And gold , now trading above $ 900 an ounce , is warning that if the Fed fails to stop creating excess dollars , inflation could rise to 6 or 7 percent .
I had hoped Ben Bernanke would reveal his inner Volcker at Wednesday 's meeting .
He did n't .
While the Fed acknowledged that " the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased , " it took no action taken to raise the fed funds target rate , which now stands at 2 percent and is actually minus - 2 percent adjusted for inflation .
Even a quarter - point rate hike -- merely taking back the last easing move in April -- would have been a shot heard ' round the world in defense of the beleaguered dollar .
It did n't happen .
Only Richard Fisher , president of the regional Dallas Fed , dissented in favor of a higher target rate .
That leaves the hard - money Fisher as the lone remaining protégé of Paul Volcker .
Of course , if Fed policymakers reconvene immediately to right their wrongheaded mistake , the value of our money could be quickly restored .
The next scheduled Open Market meeting is August 5 , but they need n't wait that long .
Let 's hope they come to their senses .
A letter in today ’s New Scientist noted that artist Scott McCloud ’s comments on how we infer the narrative from comic strips might also explain how consciousness works .
It reminded me of this panel from McCloud ’s book Understanding Comics .
Understanding Comics is about the visual language of comic books and is written as a comic .
It ’s fantastically put together but is also fascinating if you ’re interested in psychology because it largely discusses how we construct rich and complex meanings from very basic visual input .
One of the crucial points is that the comic itself is not the story , our mind builds it as we go and fills in the gaps with perception , cultural associations and our experience of how the world works .
The New Scientist letter reads :
David Bainbridge ’s description of consciousness ( 26 January , p 40 ) , including , for example , the fact that we do not know where in the brain consciousness happens , was evocative .
Scott McCloud , in his book Understanding Comics , describes a comic ’s story as whatever is happening in the blank spaces between the panels .
What if our minds function like a comic : they snap pictures , and our consciousness is simply the story the mind constructs around those pictures ?
– Saskia Latendresse , Montreal , Quebec , Canada
This is a lovely analogy and captures a well - argued approach in cognitive science that suggests that consciousness functions as a ‘ narrative maker ’ to make sense of the output from the disparate functions of the brain into a coherent sense of self .

Snapshot for June 4 , 2008 .
Bush Budget Spends 100 Times More to Regulate Unions
By Ross Eisenbrey
President Bush ’s Fiscal Year 2009 budget request for the Department of Labor is dramatically out of balance .
President Bush requested $ 58 million for Office of Labor Management Standards ( OLMS ) , which oversees 23,000 unions and union locals with 13 million members .
He requested only $ 193 million for the Wage and Hour Division , which oversees 7.4 million employers and protects 150 million employees by enforcing a host of labor standards , including child labor laws , overtime rules , and the Family and Medical Leave Act , among others .
In terms of dollars per regulated entity , the OLMS budget is $ 2,500 per union and union local .
The Wage and Hour Division budget is only $ 26.08 per employer ( see Chart ) .
President Bush wants to spend almost 100 times more per union to make sure they comply with the law than to make sure employers comply with the law .
This enormous imbalance is especially difficult to defend because unions make data collection cheap and easy for the government by reporting their financial information directly to the OLMS , whereas employers do not report anything to the Wage and Hour Division , which has to visit each employer individually to enforce the laws it administers .
Over the whole Bush presidency , the contrast in funding is even more striking .
Staff at OLMS has been increased 9 % , from 290 positions to 317 , while the Wage and Hour Division staff has been cut 21 % , from 1,528 positions to 1,208 , continuing a 30 - year downsizing trend .

I am an unemployed single female seeking a fun guy for friendship and maybe more .
I do n't want to feel like a leech , desperately clinging to a guy with a fancy schmancy office job ( complete with health insurance ! ) because he can pay for things .
I want an equal .
A true partner .
Being unemployed and broke together as opposed to apart will probably help to boost our self - esteem .
Do n't worry about taking me anywhere fancy on our first date .
I completely understand that the best you can do is inviting me to your studio apartment for some Ramen .
I wo n't mind at all that we sit on orange crates and that an empty cable spool is our table .
I will gladly stand on one foot with one foil wrapped hand tightly gripping your television antenna as my other arm reaches towards the window so that we can watch a very scratchy Simpsons rerun .
I totally understand that you can't afford cable right now .
Do n't worry , I can't either !
If things go well , perhaps we 'll have a second date .
This time , you can come over to my place .
Do n't get any ideas though .
Remember , niether one of us can afford condoms .
I 'll make you Ramen and after we 're done eating we can search under my couch cushions for change .
Maybe we 'll come up with enough to buy a piece of gum from the gas station across the street .
We 'll have to split it though , because I 'm not sure that there is enough change for two double bubbles in my couch .
Do n't worry about running out of activities just because we 're both broke and unemployed .
There are plenty of things that we can do together that do n't cost any money at all : - Use my neighbor 's internet connection to cruise craiglist 's " free stuff " for items that we might be able to sell on ebay . -
Steal toilet paper from public restrooms when we can't afford to buy any . -
Go for walks .-
Go for more walks .-
Have competitions to see who lost the most weight last week when they could n't afford any food . -
Offer to clean people 's windshield 's at gas stations for the tip . -
I 'm sure you can think of even more !!!
About two weeks before the end of every month I will expect you to sit on street corners with me as I pathetically attempt to make up rent money buy " playing " the guitar .
( If you actually know how to play the guitar , I 'll definitely write you back ! )
If you happen to get a job while I am still unemployed , do n't worry .
It will be quick and painless to break up with me .
I 'll feel really crappy about no longer being equal to you and in order to cheer me up you can take me out for a few drinks .
Due to the lack of food in my stomach , it will only take about two beers for me to get completely shit - faced and start crying about how I do n't want to lose you to your co-workers and asking " who will sit with me on street corners now ! ? "
While I am in this dependent and pathetic state you can take me back to my apartment and finally sleep with me ( using the condoms you just bought with your first paycheck ) .
Slip out the door after I pass out and never call me again .
I wo n't try to call you back .
After all , by then my phone will have been completely shut off due to lack of payment .
All I ask is that if you ever see me on the street corner , still trying to figure out how to play my guitar , leave a dollar in my hat .
I am eager and excited to find my new ( albeit temporary ) partner !
Your pic gets mine !
CR at Calculated Risk yesterday pointed to an important sign of improving conditions in the credit markets .
The fever chart of the so - called third wave of the liquidity crunch , the TED spread , showed signs of improvement .
The TED is difference between the interest on three month Treasuries and Libor ; the earlier acute episodes were August - September and November - December .
The Financial Times today , in “ Hoarding by banks stokes fears on credit crisis , reads the tea leaves differently , finding evidence that banks are still hoarding cash .
The two views are n’t necessarily incompatible ; we could be past the most acute phase of the current liquidity squeeze , but not see as rapid or even as much improvement as in past episodes .
And , as Paul Krugman pointed out , the fact that more central bank firepower aimed at the problem each time is producing less in the way of results is worrisome .
From the Financial Times :
Central banks ’ efforts to ease strains in the money markets are failing to stop financial institutions from hoarding cash , stoking fears that the recent respite in equity markets may not signal the end of the credit crisis .
Banks ’ borrowing costs – a sign of their willingness to lend to each other – in the US , eurozone and the UK rose again even after the Federal Reserve ’s unprecedented activity in lending to retail and investment banks against weaker than usual collateral and similar action in Europe … .
In London , where the Bank of England has faced criticism for not being as proactive as other central banks , the three - month Libor rate was set on Tuesday at 5.995 per cent , its highest of the year .
This is nearly 0.9 percentage points above the level investors demand for risk - free money , a spread nearly as high as that which led to central bank interventions in September and December .
The European Central Bank allocated € 216bn ( $ 337bn ) in seven - day funds in its regular weekly operation on Tuesday – some € 50bn higher than the amount it estimated would have normally been needed – at an average rate of 4.28 per cent , which was the highest since late September .
The Fed ’s latest lending to banks under its Term Auction Facility was also in heavy demand , receiving bids for $ 88.9 bn compared with the $ 50bn on offer , an excess of demand almost as great as the previous auction two weeks ago , before the collapse of Bear Stearns .
Accrued Interest gives an explanation of why the credit markets are n’t getting better : it ’s the balance sheet damage , which has put the kibosh on normal bottom fishing and speculation .
Like CR , however , he thinks recent improvements have the potential to become self - reinforcing , leading more investors back into the pool :
Right now we have two major themes in the credit markets .
The first is a real economy recession , with a very weak housing market at its epicenter .
The second is a battered financial sector , where strained capital and fear of spiraling contagion has caused a dearth of liquidity .
A real economy recession should legitimately cause the price of taking risk to rise .
In the case of mortgage - related credit risk , for instance the ABX index , prices should obviously be drastically lower .
This is the kind of risk pricing that capital markets can handle .
In fact , that kind of risk pricing is exactly why capital markets are an important part of our free - market system .
We need a market where various risks are correctly priced , as this helps to channel capital to areas where it is most needed .
But the second major theme is interfering with the market ’s ability to properly price risks .
Potential buyers of risk , from hedge funds to banks to broker / dealers , became overextended during the credit bull market and now need to repair their their own balance sheets … .
As a result , classic investment analysis , pouring over 10 K ’s and analyzing cash flows , has not been a winning strategy .
Until very recently , investors who dabbled in anything that looked fundamentally “ cheap ” got burned .
Sector after sector suffered historic spread widening amidst persistent forced selling .
This created a negative feedback loop , as real money investors sit on the sidelines waiting for some semblance of calm before putting their cash to work .
The never few weeks will test whether that negative feedback loop has broken .
Municipal yields have been falling .
10 - year Fannie
Mae debt spreads have dropped about 35 bps since Friday , and are now as tight as they ’ve been since early February .
Agency MBS spreads are about where they were at the beginning of March .
Brokerage CDS are actually tighter month - to - date .
This is important because it means that there are investors who bought good bonds on recent dips and enjoyed good results .
This is what it will take to break the negative feedback loop in the bond market .
I wish I could be so optimistic .
I look at the ability to pay of the underlying borrowers , and the prospects are pretty poor independent of a recession .
We have a large number of subprime ARM resets this year , followed by a not - quite - so - high but still pretty impressive level of Alt - A and option ARM resets through 2011 .
Many of these borrowers simply cannot afford the payments once the mortgages reset , and marginal borrowers are far more willing to walk than in the past if they have little or negative equity in the house .
So the credit markets face a continuing deterioration of the underlying paper .
The housing market will look like a slow - draining bathtub for at least the next couple of years , with defaults and foreclosures likely to exceed new purchases .
The unsold inventory will take a long time to recede to normal levels .
And until the bottom in housing is visible , no one can be certain how bad the credit losses will be .
We are so far outside any historical patterns that forecasts have become exercises in creative writing .
Reader Jeff sent along this cheery view from Ken Murray of Blue Planet Investing ( the whole post is worth reading ) :
The current situation in the US banking market is without precedent .
Never before in a time of near full employment and record corporate profitability have we seen such huge levels of bad debts .
By our own estimates bad debts in the US banking market are likely to rise to somewhere in the order of $ 300 bn to $ 450 bn .
Other estimates set the figure much higher .
This is important because the bad debts that have been incurred so far are entirely due to poor underwriting as opposed to a downturn in economic activity .
However , a downturn in economic activity is now occurring and , if the US economy is heading for recession as we forecast in 2007 , it will give rise to a huge layer of additional bad debts .
One that it simply cannot shoulder .
It is perfectly conceivable that bad debts may rise to somewhere in the order of $ 500bn .
To put the scale of these losses into perspective the total equity of the US ’s top 100 banks stood at $ 800bn at the end of the third quarter 2007 .
Losses of $ 500bn would wipe out 63 % of their capital bases and leave many of them insolvent .
To put it mildly , that does n’t exactly point to a lasting recovery in the credit markets .
The Tampa Tribune writes that male teachers who choose to work with younger children are coming
under increasing suspicion
:
Negative comments and raised eyebrows also have affected aspiring male kindergarten teachers in recent years , said Pam Fleege , associate professor of early childhood education at the University of South Florida .
" It 's very sad .
Male students have come to me after they 've been challenged by their own families and friends , " Fleege said .
" Some are accused of being pedophiles .
But they mostly get a lot of , ' What are you going to say when a parent confronts you ? ' "
Confrontations with suspicious parents are rare , teachers say .
That could be because parents who are uncomfortable with a man teaching their children often request a female teacher .
Those requests are honored every year by Carol Hughes , principal of Leila G. Davis Elementary in Clearwater .
She leads the only Pinellas County or Hillsborough County public school with two male kindergarten teachers .
Tamara Lowe , whose son was in Goldstein 's kindergarten class years ago , said that when her son was assigned to Goldstein she contacted Berkley Prep officials to " express concern about the wisdom of having a young man teach kindergarten . "
If a male teacher encounters fearful parents , the key is to involve them in the class as much as possible , said Brian Esparza , who teaches at Leila G. Davis .
" You just have to get to know them , let them get to know you , and win them over , " Esparza said .
" You get those kinds of parents , but I hear a lot more of the flip side , people happy that their child has a male role model in kindergarten . "
Principals take many requests to place children with male kindergarten teachers .
That opportunity , though , is available at a small percentage of schools .
In Pinellas , eight of 418 kindergarten teachers , or almost 2 percent , are men .
In Hillsborough , there are 13 men and 764 women , again almost 2 percent
In Pasco County , the numbers are higher than the 9 percent national average .
That nationwide number , though , is at a 40 - year low , the National Education Association says .
Of the 884 Pasco kindergarten teachers , 105 are men , almost 12 percent .
In Pasco , kindergarten , first - and second - grade students are educated together , based on their achievement levels .
There 's much more to read in
the whole story
.
I think that there are a great number of effective male teachers out there who would really like to work with younger children but do n't because they fear that their motivations will be suspect .
And it 's a shame , as so many kids could use a few good male role - models in their young lives .

( CNN ) -- Federal officers charged with keeping terrorists off planes are now searching their own ranks for staff who told CNN that few flights were protected by air marshals .
Iraq war veteran Jeff Denning says a TSA investigator called him trying to find out if he spoke to CNN .
The Transportation Security Administration rejected as a " myth " CNN 's report that less than 1 percent of the nation 's daily flights carry armed federal air marshals .
Now the agency is conducting an investigation into who talked to CNN and who encouraged other agents to do the same .
A spokesman for the TSA confirmed the investigation .
Spokesman Christopher
White said a TSA investigator is looking into the " possible unauthorized release of sensitive and classified information to the news media by covered parties . "
" As part of this ongoing investigation , several individuals , both current and former employees , have been contacted as is typical in any investigation , " he said in an e-mail to CNN .
CNN spoke to more than a dozen current and former air marshals , pilots and federal law enforcement officials for the report , which aired in March on " Anderson Cooper 360º . "
Repeatedly , the sources told CNN that as few as 280 of an estimated 28,000 daily flights had armed federal air marshals aboard .
That amounts to less than 1 percent .
" That number is absolutely wrong , " said Kip Hawley , the head of the agency .
He was speaking earlier this year before Congress , which held hearings into the Federal Air Marshal Service ( FAMS ) in the wake of CNN 's reporting .
CNN learned of the TSA investigation from a former federal air marshal and Iraq war veteran , Jeff Denning .
He was not connected to the original story .
Denning said he was called by TSA investigator Greg Neiderer a few days after he came back from the front lines of Iraq .
Denning said Neiderer grilled him on an e-mail he received on his personal account while he was in Iraq .
The e-mail discussed plans to expose corruption in the air marshal service .
The e-mail encouraged recipients to contact CNN correspondent Drew Griffin if they had information about the hiring of airport screeners as air marshals , the elimination of mandatory psychiatric tests for new hires and managers lying to Congress .
Read the e-mail »
CNN only recently received a copy of the e-mail .
CNN did not have it when the report aired in March .
Denning said he forwarded the e-mail to current and former air marshals .
Denning said Neiderer wanted to know who sent him the e-mail .
Nothing in the e-mail contained sensitive security information , Denning said , nor did it encourage anyone to disclose information that could endanger the public .
" I was petrified , " Denning said of Neiderer 's phone call , explaining how he contacted CNN full of dismay that the TSA was harassing him and his family to find out which of his former colleagues had talked to the media .
" In Iraq , there were a lot of dangerous things , but never have I been so scared [ as ] when the federal government called me on my home phone and said I want to know about your personal e-mail account and what you have been sending . "
TSA 's Hawley refused repeated requests to be interviewed by CNN .
Neiderer did not return repeated calls or e-mails .
In an e-mail , TSA spokesman
White confirmed Neiderer 's involvement , but denied that the TSA or the Federal Air Marshal Service had accessed anyone 's private e-mail accounts , via subpoena or otherwise .
However , he added that " all e-mails sent to government employees on a government system are always eligible to be read and reviewed as is outlined on every computer in TSA , including the FAMS . "
White did not say how much the investigation is costing taxpayers or how long it would last .
With a few phone calls , CNN was able to find the author of the original e-mail .
The author is an air marshal who asked that his identity be concealed for fear of retribution by the TSA .
The marshal said he sent the e-mail because for six years , his colleagues have been trying to alert Congress about continuing problems in the air marshal service .
Many have left , he said , because of low morale and complaints about management .
A May 2008 report from the Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General said that the agency " currently experiences a 17 % voluntary attrition rate and low employee morale . "
" Congress does n't want to hear it , " the marshal said .
" They stick their heads in the sand .
We tell them about the corruption .
We give them examples and proof and I think they are scared of what they see .
And they do n't want to deal with it . "
The marshal said he had done nothing wrong by sending an e-mail .
" The only thing in my e-mail was my telling these other air marshals that CNN was willing to expose the corruption in the federal air marshal services and Mr. Griffin 's e-mail address , " he said .
" That 's not sensitive security information .
That 's freedom of speech . "
He said he sent another e-mail urging air marshals to contact members of Congress investigating the air marshal service .
Meanwhile , the air marshal service is undergoing a management change .
Shortly after CNN aired its first report , director Dana Brown announced plans to retire .
He has since decided to stay with the air marshals in a newly created position of Integrity Officer .
His successor is Robert Bray , current deputy director , who , like Brown and Neiderer , is a former Secret Service employee .
According to the TSA , Brown 's job is to ensure that " disciplinary measures and other personnel actions are administered uniformly throughout the organization . "
Former air marshal Denning said he thinks the TSA should spend its time tracking down terrorists instead of former employees ' e-mails .
" If they want to tap into someone 's personal e-mail because they were going to destroy the Pentagon or kill the president , I could see reasons for contacting someone , " Denning said .
" But they 're contacting me on my personal e-mail that I apparently forwarded to someone else 's personal e-mail account .
It 's outlandish . "

オープンソースの Firefox とプロプライエタリ ー のOperaは最大級の人気を持 つLinux向けブラウザーだ。その最新版が、今月、相次いで登場した。Firefox 3は世界記録に挑戦しようという喧騒の中でのダウンロード開始だったが、その1週間前に提供を開始した
Opera 9.5 は従来と変わらなかった。しかし、Opera 9.5もFirefox 3に劣らず革新的で、セキュリティー関連の強化から多言語テキストのレンダリング改善に至るまでFirefoxと 互角の機能 を備えている。
Opera 9.5
Opera 9.5を起動してまず気づくのは、デスクトップに占める面積がFirefox
3より小さいことだ。ツールバーやボーダーが小さいためページを表示する部分が広い。また、気の利いた機能は多機能なパネルの中にしまい込まれている。Firefoxのパネルにあるのはブックマークと履歴だけだが、Operaのパネルには内蔵のダウンロード・マネージャー、メモ、ウィジェット（デスクトップ・アプレットのWebブラウザー版）などもある。ブックマークしたサイトを表示したり、Webパネルをダウンロードしてニュース・サイトを閲覧したりゲームを楽しんだりすることもできる。
複数のタブを開いた状態で起動したいなら「スピード・ダイヤル」と名付けられたデフォルトのスタート・ページが便利だ。設定可能なボタンが9つあり、クリックするとそれぞれのサイトが開く。たとえば、電子メール、ニュース2種（技術ニュースと一般ニュース）、漫画2種を開いておくなどといったことができる。タブ関連機能は豊富で操作法も多彩だ。たとえば、Ctrl-Tabでタブを順次切り替えたり、タブを復元したり、タブに開いているページをプレビューしたり、タブの大きさを変更して1つのウィンドウに複数のページを表示したりすることもできる。
パスワードなどを自動入力してくれるワンド機能も便利だ。Firefox 3と同じように閲覧とは独立に動作し、サイトのロード中でもバックグラウンドでユーザー名とパスワードを保存することができる。Operaのワンド機能はアドレスバーの隣にある「認証管理」ボタンをクリックすることで保存してある情報を入力する方式だ。クリック1回でユーザー名とパスワードを入力でき、別のユーザー名を使いたいときはそのまま手入力することができるので、Firefoxの「パスワードを保存」オプションより便利だ。しかも、「認証管理」ボタンをクリックするとログインまでしてくれる。
フィッシング防止機能が組み込まれており、オンライン詐欺から身を守ることもできる。訪れようとしているサイトをOperaがモニターし、NetcraftやPhishTankにあるフィッシング情報とHaute Secureにあるマルウェア情報に基づいて検査してくれるのだ。パネルにあるページ情報を見れば、サイトとそのセキュリティー証明書（あれば）についての詳細を知ることもできる。Firefox 3にも同様のフィッシング防止機能とマルウェア阻止機能がある。
デスクトップ・アプリケーションに相当するオンライン・アプリケーションを搭載している点でも、両ブラウザーは似ている。たとえば、どちらのブラウザーでも、Webベースの電子メール・アカウントを設定しておけばmailto:プロトコルのリクエストに対応することができる。Opera 9.5には完全な電子メール・クライアントも組み込まれており、POPサーバーやIMAPサーバーと同期することができる。つまり、Operaの中でメールを書いて送信することができるのだ。この電子メール・クライアントはブラウザーとの整合性がよく、パネルからタブの中に起動することができる。
電子メール・クライアントだけではない 。Operaには、Firefoxではアドオンで実現されている機能が種々搭載されている。たとえば、複数のメモが取れるメモ帳アプリケーション。ページ上で選択したテキストをメモにしたり、フォルダーを作ってメモを整理したり、メール・クライアントが設定されていればメモを電子メールで送ることもできる。また、ダウンロード・マネージャーはダウンロードを中断・再開できるだけでなく、フル装備のBitTorrentクライアントにもなっている。さらには、IRCクライアントも用意されている。
逆に 、Firefox 3にはある がOpera 9.5にはない機能もある。たとえば、複数のテキスト範囲をコピーする機能はない。しかし、選択した単語を辞書引きしたり、Yahoo!のBabel Fishオンライン・サービスで翻訳したりすることができる。ブックマークにタグを付ける機能もない。その代わり、訪問した各ページのコンテンツを保存しておき高速検索する機能がある。ブックマークをしておかなかった難しい名前のサイト（たとえばzedropratodretua.co.za）でもコンテンツの一部を覚えていれば履歴の中から検索することができる。
ウィンドウの下端にある3つのボタンも便利だ。その一つ「ウィンドウ幅で表示」ボタンはページの幅がウィンドウをはみ出しているときに使うもので、横スクロールが不要な程度に縮小してくれる。画面サイズが1280×1024より小さい場合に便利だ。ただし、いくつかのサイトで試してみたところ、Gmailでは機能しなかった。その横にあるプルダウン・メニューのボタンはズームだ。メニューには20％～1000％のズーム率が並んでおり、そのいずれかを選ぶ。フォント・サイズを簡単に2倍あるいは3倍にできるのは便利だ。Firefoxでは何度も「ズームイン」ボタンを押さなければならない。ただし、Firefox 3ではサイトごとにズームを設定・保存できるが、Operaではできない。
3つめのボタンは、ページ上にある全画像の表示・非表示を切り替えるためのもの。右クリックで開くコンテキスト・メニューを利用すると、オンライン広告など、そのほかのコンテンツをブロックすることもできる。
インポートとエクスポートの機能も充実している。ブックマークはFirefox、Konqueror、Internet Explorerから、電子メールは旧版のOperaとThunderbirdやEudoraなどの専用クライアントのほかmboxファイルからもインポートすることができる。さらに、Operaの無償Opera Link Webサービスを使えば、職場、自宅、携帯電話のOpera間でブックマークとスピード・ダイヤルの設定を合わせることができる。このほかにも機能はいろいろある。Opera 9.5の機能とその使い方についてはKnowledge Baseに詳しく説明されている。また、Online Helpページ やPremium Support ( 29 ドル ) もある 。
そのほか 、Web開発者向けに 、OperaのDragonflyツールアルファ版が搭載されている。アプリケーションをOpera上で動かしながら、JavaScriptのデバッグ、CSSとDOMの調査、エラーの表示が可能だ。FirefoxではFirebugツールがよく知られているが、これに相当するものだ。
内部機能の性 能
改善されたのは、利用者に直接見える部分だけではない。Opera 9.5には新しいブラウザー・エンジンが搭載されており、「
Web標準への準拠性に優れた世界最速ブラウザー」と自称している。確かに、国際化スクリプトのレンダリングではFirefox 3より優れている。それでは速度はどうか。Intel Core 2 Duo E4400 2.0GHzプロセッサーとRAM
1GBを搭載したマシンを使い 、Ubuntu 8.04 とWindows XP（SP2）の2つのプラットフォームで2種類のオンライン・ベンチマークを用いて性能を比較してみた。
まず、CSSベンチマークを見てみよう。確かにLinux版Opera 9.5が最速だった。このテストでは、約2500のDIVタグを含むローカルに保存されたページをレンダリングする。グラフは5回行ったテストの平均値をプロットしたもの。Opera 9.5はACID
2テストにも合格した。しかし、ACID
3ベンチマークでは、グラフに示したように最高スコアを記録したものの、不合格だった。
次に、JavaScriptのレンダリングを見てみよう。SunSpider JavaScript Benchmarkでは 、Firefox 3 がOpera 9.5を上回った。ただし、このテストには誤差が±0.8％～±11.3％ある。また、JavScript
Engine speed testでは、エラー処理 、DOM 、AJAX で 、Opera 9.5がほかのブラウザーを上回った。同様に、大量コンテンツの生成に最適のメソッドを調べるためのW3C DOM vs. InnerHTMLテストでも 、Opera 9.5 がFirefox 3を上回った。ただし、最速はWindows版Safariだった。
まとめ
Opera 9.5は機能が豊富でさまざまな点で改善が施され、カスタマイズの自由度が高い。メール・クライアントやIRCチャット・アプリケーションなども搭載され、しかもブラウザーによく整合している。Opera 9.5は、Firefox 3への挑戦者にふさわしいブラウザーだ。そして、確実に、その性能と機能により選ばれるブラウザーである。これでオープンソースであったなら！

The stairs going up to the attic room of a Victorian row house in London have been fitted with books that line each riser and wrap around the edges .
As someone who lives in small places with lots of books ( and no matter what I do , no matter how ruthless I am , I always seem to have lots more books than I have room for ) this kind of thing is sheer aspirational porn for me .
The flat occupies part of the shared top floor of an existing Victorian mansion block .
Our proposal extended the flat into the unused loft space above , creating a new bedroom level and increasing the floor area of the flat by approximately one third .
We created a ' secret ' staircase , hidden from the main reception room , to access a new loft bedroom lit by roof lights .
Limited by space , we melded the idea of a staircase with our client 's desire for a library to form a ' library staircase ' in which English oak stair treads and shelves are both completely lined with books .
With a skylight above lighting the staircase , it becomes the perfect place to stop and browse a tome .
The stair structure was designed as an upside down ' sedan chair ' structure ( with Rodrigues Associates , Structural Engineers , London ) that carries the whole weight of the stair and books back to the main structural walls of the building .
It dangles from the upper floor thereby avoiding any complicated neighbour issues with the floors below .

The Church of Scientology said the group were cyber terrorists
The group , called Anonymous , said they wanted to highlight the organisation 's " inherent flaws " and " fight for freedom of knowledge and information " .
The City of London Police said about 200 people took part in the peaceful protest in Queen Victoria Street .
After about two hours the protestors moved to the Scientology Recruitment Centre in Tottenham Court Road .
Similar gatherings took place outside Scientology Centres across the UK and in countries including Australia , Canada and the US .
In a video statement broadcast online , the organisers said : " The idea of Anonymous is to systematically dismantle the Church of Scientology in its present form . "
' Religious bigotry '
They said they were campaigning against " toxic ideals " and a " corrupt leadership " , not the beliefs of members .
Anonymous posted a Scientology video of Tom Cruise on the internet last month , which was taken down after complaints about copyright infringement .
Janet Laveau , from the Church of Scientology , said the protest group were " cyber- terrorists " motivated by " religious bigotry " .
She said : " The actions of Anonymous will not interrupt the church 's normal activities serving its parishioners and the community , and the church is working in co-ordination with local authorities to minimize the negative impact of this mask - wearing , cyber - terrorist group . "
The protests were held on 10 February to mark the birthday of Lisa McPherson , an American scientologist who died in 1995 while under the care of the organisation .

A few weeks have passed since my solar power installation went live .
More importantly , the monitoring system has been in place for about a month now .
Before I dive into the details of power generation numbers and the impact on my electric bill , it ’s worth discussing a few key points about this particular installation .
The entire array consists of 27 panels .
Each panel has a peak rating of 225W ( nominal rating 207W ) .
Nine panels face south , 18 face west .
Total peak output of the array at the panel is 6.1KW .
It ’s summer here in California , so it ’s the peak season for solar power generation .
On the other hand , you may have read about all the fires that have been burning in Northern California .
I ’ve had to go up about once a week to rinse the ash off the panels .
I have a minor tree problem .
After about 7:30 PM , a large tree several hundred yards away effectively blocks the sun .
Since it ’s late in the day , it ’s well past the peak generating time , but it ’s still worth noting .
Additionally , I ’ve received my first electric bill since the installation , although it ’s only for 19 days , not the usual 29 or 30 .
So what was my electricity bill for 19 days ?
$ 11.34 .

SAN FRANCISCO  Window Snyder is n't your average security czar .
As chief of security at Mozilla Foundation , the unconventional non-profit whose popular Web browser Firefox underwent a major facelift this week , Snyder cuts an unconventional swath .
RELATED : Pimp my Firefox 3 RELATED : Firefox 3 : A record in the making ?
For starters , her title is " chief security something - or - other " ( yeah , that 's on her business card ) .
It befits her wide - ranging role at Mozilla , the Web browser developer that relies on the contributions of thousands of programmers worldwide .
The programmers generally work for free , but Snyder 's salary is paid with revenue Mozilla generates through business partnerships with Google , Amazon.com and others .
Organized cybercrime gangs are more highly focused than ever on taking control of your computer through browser - based hacks .
They 've already turned some 40 % of the world 's 800 million Internet - connected PCs into obedient " bots " used to spread spam , harvest your sensitive data and commit fraud .
The bad guys are highly motivated to expand their bot empires .
And their favorite tactic to wrest control of your machine is by corrupting browser - run applications that enable all of the Web 's coolest functions , like watching videos and social networking .
Because Mozilla 's Firefox browser is based on open - source code that is continually refined by volunteers , it is widely considered by tech security experts to be the most secure , though by no means impregnable , browser .
Into the virulent dark side of Web 2.0 strolls Snyder , leader of some 20,000 independent programmers committed to shoring up Firefox 's first line of defenses .
In setting out to elevate Firefox 's basic security , Snyder is also compelling Microsoft and Apple , maker of the Safari browser , to follow her lead — or get out of the way .
Snyder 's rising star is sure to ascend even more this week , with the release of Version 3.0 of Firefox on Tuesday .
The release is packed with new features , most notably stiffer security , faster speed and improved ease of use .
" The fun is in deconstructing where the security holes are , " Snyder , 32 , says with a wry smile and knowing laugh .
But do n't let her youthful facade fool you .
Snyder 's career path includes co-founding a security company and consultant work at At Stake , which was sold to Symantec for $ 49 million in 2004 .
And , yes , she once worked at Microsoft , managing the security process for a couple versions of the Windows operating system .
During her three - year stint there , Snyder pioneered the Blue Hat program , which opened communications between Microsoft developers and outside security researchers .
Previously , Microsoft was loath to share technical information with those outside of its Redmond , Wash . , headquarters .
Now she must summon all her collaboration skills in reaching out to the open - source community , where Firefox has thrived .
In her spare time — insert deep breath here — she managed to co-write Threat Modeling , an online security guide that 's used by software engineers .
Dave Goldsmith , who as president of Matasano Security has worked with Snyder in various capacities , calls her an " online security rock star . "
Adds Eva Chen , CEO and co-founder of security company Trend Micro : " It 's gratifying to see other women in prominent roles in tech security .
For so long , men have dominated the field .
Women did n't have an old boy 's network . "
' Geek girl ' : Programming at 5 A self - avowed " geek girl " and daughter of software engineers , Snyder says her mom taught her to program Basic , an early computer programming language , on a Texas Instruments PC when she was 5 years old .
" She has a natural sparkle and joy , " says her Kenyan - born mother , Wayua ( Eastern African dialect for " Born during famine " ) Muasa , who embarked on a software engineering career in her early 40s after stints in teaching and promoting tourism for Kenya at the United Nations .
Still , Snyder 's whipsaw - fast mind and inquisitive nature can be hard to keep up with .
" I tell her to slow down so people can digest what she is saying , " Muasa says .
No kidding .
In between sips of tea at a local Starbucks , Snyder offers a dizzying discourse on abstract algebra , the concept of parallel lines intersecting in space , and the presidential aspirations of Barack Obama , whom she volunteered for in Texas .
But she is downright Pixar - like animated about Mozilla .
" The strength of Mozilla is absolutely the community ( of tens of thousands of volunteers ) .
We have to make sure they know they 're being heard , " says Snyder , who joined Mozilla last year .
The challenge is to get the public — so aware of security for their homes and cars — to be as vigilant with their PCs .
That 's where the articulate Snyder and fortified Firefox come in .
She is a bright new face in the computer - security field .
By most accounts , she is succeeding swimmingly .
" She is effective and respected among several constituencies : nitty - gritty geeks , customers and the general public , " says Mitchell Baker , Mozilla 's longtime chairman .
" She has learned to walk the fine line of making complex concepts understandable and accurate . "
Breaking frontiers
It 's been a steady climb for Firefox , whose roots stretch back to the now - defunct Netscape Communications .
It has accumulated 170 million users in more than 200 countries and an 18 % share of the browser market , according to market researcher Net Applications .
( Microsoft Internet Explorer commands 75 % of the market , or more than 700 million users . )
Now , after several years of development and public testing , version 3.0 is out .
Leading the evangelistic effort is Snyder , whose middle name is Window .
Her first name , Mwende — which means " beloved " and is the name of her maternal grandmother — by custom is used only by family members .
Such is part of her Kenya heritage , a legacy for her that stretches back to age 9 when she first traveled there .
In preparation for that trip , Window learned key phrases in Swahili on her own .
She and her mom return every few years .
" She has an easygoing , calming demeanor , " says Muasa , a retiree who lives in Seattle .
" When I moved in 2004 , I accidentally threw away baby pictures and Window 's drawings .
I was devastated .
She said , ' That 's OK , Mom .
Let it go . ' " Snyder is among the youngest of 30 board members at Choate Rosemary Hall , the private school in Connecticut she attended in the early 1990s .
Snyder is illustrative of the Choate way that has guided fellow alumni President John F. Kennedy and actress Glenn Close — intelligence , dedication in " the pursuit of breaking frontiers " and confidence , says Herb Kohler , CEO of manufacturing giant Kohler Co. and chairman of the school 's board of trustees .
This week , Firefox 3.0 joins Snyder 's growing résumé .
" My gosh , she talks about things I have no concept about , " Kohler says .

The panellists had strong views about Zionism After a week or so of travelling the length and breadth of Israel , from the tranquil slopes of the Upper Galilee to the rocket shelters of beleaguered Sderot , we gathered three Israelis together , in Tel Aviv , to discuss the past 60 years .
" Has Zionism worked ? " was the question we put to the former Knesset member and Ambassador , Zalman Shoval , magazine editor Bambi Sheleg and novelist Alon Hilu .
And to put everyone in the mood , we met in the modest , book - lined study of Israel 's first Prime Minister , David Ben Gurion , a couple of blocks from the beach .
With his glasses on the table in the corner and the simple , utilitarian house pretty much unchanged , it was as if the grand old man of Israeli politics had just stepped out of the room , leaving us to talk .
Zalman Shoval was the only panellist who actually knew Ben Gurion , taking his Knesset seat when he resigned from politics in 1970 .
Mr Shoval highlighted what he called " a certain ambivalence " in Ben Gurion 's vision of Israel .
Zionism tried to solve the Jewish problem , " he said , " but created a very big problem , which is the Palestinian problem
Alon Hilu
Novelist " He said : ' On the one hand I want the Jewish state to be a normal state , like all the others . '
But he also said , later : ' I want Israel to be a light upon the nations . ' "
It 's an ambivalence one still encounters today .
Bambi Sheleg said this was hardly surprising .
Israel , in her view , has only just begun .
" We are a people in a state of recovery , " she remarked , referring to the Holocaust , " and it will take centuries . "
Alon Hilu - at 35 the youngest of our panellists - said Israelis needed to re-examine their national narrative .
" Zionism tried to solve the Jewish problem , " he said , " but created a very big problem , which is the Palestinian problem . "
Using power
Having talked to people over the past week about their attitudes to one of Israel 's central institutions - the military - I asked our guests whether they felt that Israel , having discovered power after 2,000 years without it , had used it well .
Bambi Sheleg was emphatic .
" If the Jews want to last , they need an army . "
Alon Hilu was more critical , suggesting that Israel had simply become too powerful .
" Sometimes if you 're too successful , it can be a disaster , " he argued .
" This is what happened here .
Our identity is too much associated with militarism . "
They are hostages to Palestinian extremists [ who ] want Israeli Arabs to be a fifth column inside Israel
Zalman Shoval
Former ambassador
And what of Israel 's relationship with its own Arab citizens , now more than 20 % of the population ?
After all , Israel 's first President , Chaim Weizman , had written of his certainty that " the world will judge the Jewish state by how it will treat the Arabs " .
' Racist ' Israelis Zalman Shoval said Israel had nothing to be ashamed about .
Arabs were much better off in the Jewish state than anywhere else in the Middle East .
But he sounded a warning .
" They are hostages to Palestinian extremists [ who ] want Israeli Arabs to be a fifth column inside Israel . "
But Alon Hilu , whose historical novel The House of Dajani tells of Jews and Arabs struggling for land and power in late 19th - Century Jaffa , said this was a relationship Jewish Israelis needed to re-examine .
" We were the minority all the time , " he said , " and here is the first time we are the majority , with a minority .
How do we treat them ?
Hilu went further .
" Jewish Israelis are racist , " he said , arguing that in order to guarantee a workable long term relationship with its Arab minority , Israel should consider abandoning its " Jewish - oriented " flag and national anthem , the Hatikva .
The views expressed during our hour - long debate were passionately held and eloquently delivered .
The ghost of Ben Gurion might have been sitting at his desk , listening in .
You can hear Paul Adams in discussion with Zalman Shoval , Bambi Sheleg and Alon Hilu at 1800 GMT on Saturday , 10 May , on the BBC World Service .

Iglesias : Ashcroft forced out for not signing off on illegal wiretaps David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday July 18 , 2008
Print This Email This David Iglesias , one of the US Attorneys fired by the Bush administration as part of what he himself describes as " an attempt to politicize the Justice Department , " believes that his former boss , Attorney General John Ashcroft , was also forced out for political reasons .
When Iglesias appeared on MSNBC's Morning Joe on Friday to discuss his new book about the firings ,
In Justice , commentator Mike Barnacle reminded him that he had recently been asked by a member of the public whether he thought Ashcroft had been forced out of office .
" I answered ' Yes , ' " Iglesias replied .
" In fact , I think he was , for not signing off on the clearly unconstitutional wiretap program .
He 's the first person who 's ever asked me that question .
Ashcroft did the right thing , and I think he paid the price for it . "
" That 's a pretty significant story and a pretty substantial claim you 've made , " Barnacle noted .
" If you remember the follow - up story , " Iglesias continued , " when he was very sick in the hospital and he was visited by Andy Card and Alberto Gonzales and they tried to get him to sign off on it even though he was heavily sedated -- I mean , that 's an incredibly chilling story , and it 's something that I hope the media follows up on . "
In testimony before the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday , Ashcroft himself insisted he was merely " grouchy " at the time of the hospital visit and defended the administration 's actions , saying , " You had a situation where there 's people who have differing legal opinions .
And eventually somebody has to decide .
And the president comes down on the side of the Department of Justice .
What 's wrong with that picture ? . . .
Eventually you get to the right decision being made .
That 's something I would expect a free society to do , involve vigorous debate . "
Iglesias 's book is based not only on his own experiences but also on conversations with other fired US Attorneys .
Barnacle asked him , " Did the name Karl Rove ever come up in the course of these conversations ? "
" Many , many times , " Iglesias replied , " which I believe is a reason why he 's refusing to testify in front of the Congress .
He has information that I believe would show illegal activity , interfering with ongoing federal criminal investigations .
So Rove is not testifying , I think , basically to keep himself from being indicted . "
Iglesias also agreed that Rove " absolutely " was connected with his own dismissal .
" The evidence is clear that he took a call from Pete Domenici about me , that he talked to the state party chairman here , he was very involved in something he had no business being involved in . "
US Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald recently confirmed to the House Judiciary Committee that Rove had also attempted to have him fired in 2004 , primarily in an attempt to forestall a corruption investigation in Illinois , at the same time that Fitzgerald was investigating Rove in the outing of Valerie Plame .

The EU treaty must be ratified by each of the 27 member countries The UK has officially ratified the European Union 's Lisbon Treaty .
The documents were deposited with the Italian foreign affairs ministry in Rome on Wednesday .
The move came despite doubts over its future after the " no " vote in the Irish referendum .
All EU states must ratify the treaty for it to come into force .
The EU treaty has proved controversial with unsuccessful attempts in Parliament and the courts to force a referendum to be held on it .
Conservative MP Bill Cash sought a judicial review of the ratification process after the rejection from Ireland .
And two High Court judges dismissed a claim by millionaire businessman Stuart Wheeler that there was a " legitimate expectation " of a public vote .
A total breach of trust with the British people
William Hague
Shadow foreign secretary Mr Cash branded the ratification a " gross impertinence " , while Mr Wheeler described the ratification as " absolutely atrocious behaviour " .
On Friday he will seek permission from a Court of Appeal judge to appeal against that decision .
He said he believed although the " instrument of ratification " has been deposited in Rome , the government still had the right to withdraw it and reverse its decision .
Shadow Foreign Secretary William
Hague said the prime minister had " no democratic or moral authority to sign Britain up to the renamed EU constitution " .
It was " a total breach of trust with the British people and a flagrant breach of his solemn election promise to the British people " , Mr Hague added .
The Tories are playing games and engaging in political stunts as usual
Jim Murphy
Europe minister
He branded the government " arrogant and out of touch " , and accused it of " joining in the ugly bullying of the Irish people , who have clearly rejected this treaty " .
But Commons leader Harriet Harman insisted it was " in Britain 's interest to be at the heart of Europe and it's in Europe 's interest that Britain should play a leading part " .
And Europe minister Jim Murphy said it was right to ratify the treaty " since both Houses of Parliament voted by substantial majorities in favour of it " and because it was " a good treaty " for Britain .
" The Tories are playing games and engaging in political stunts as usual .
The fact is that the Tories cannot be trusted to safeguard Britain 's interests in Europe , " he added .
Royal approval
The " instruments of ratification " were signed by the Queen and Foreign Secretary David Miliband before being deposited in Rome .
These documents are on chlorine - free paper , designed not to deteriorate over time .
They were then sealed and bound in blue leather before being lodged in Rome .
The treaty sets out a way forward for the 27 - member and replaces the EU constitution which was abandoned after " no " votes in French and Dutch referendums .
Opponents argue it is so similar to the constitution that promises to hold a referendum on the constitution should apply to the treaty .
But ministers say the two differ and a referendum is not needed as the treaty does not have constitutional implications .

First it was Citibank .
Now it 's Barclay 's and New York City 's Chrysler Building skyscraper .
Muslim Arabs are buying out collapsing Western banks and businesses and gaining growing international power , but some Arab investors are worried their investments may go down the drain with the American economy .
The current financial crisis in the United States has spread to other countries because of a massive debt that was not backed by enough real and liquid collateral .
Banks and businesses gasping for financial breath are up for sale at basement prices , but no one is certain if the basement is the bottom .
" The possibility remains that more Arab white knights will be sought to rescue ailing financial institutions , " wrote Dr. Mohammed Ramady , a former banker and Visiting Associate Professor at the King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals in the Financial Adviser magazine .
He said he fears that Arab investors will end up chasing their investments with more money to keep them from going under .
The Abu Dhabi Investment Council of the oil - rich United Arab Emirates kingdom of Abu Dhabi last November announced it was bailing out the mammoth Citibank financial institution , formerly headed by Bank of Israel Governor Prof.
Stanley Fischer , with $ 7.5 billion .
Next in line was Britain 's Barclay 's Bank , which raised $ 9 billion from investors in the oil - rich kingdom of Qatar and in Asian countries .
The Abu Dhabi Investment Council last month forked out approximately $ 800 million for a 75 percent stake in New York City 's 1,046 - foot - tall Chrysler Building , which was the world 's tallest building for a year until the Empire State Building surpassed it in the 1930's .
The purchase of American banks by foreigners has been blocked in the past by security and political considerations , but the barriers have come down , wrote Dr. Ramady .
" How long this lasts is only a matter of guesswork , as once again , the specter of foreign takeovers of ' national ' symbols will be hard to accept , " he added .
The latest American symbol to go down the drain is the Anheuser - Busch beer brewer .
The Times of London wrote , " The weak dollar and weak economy mean the United States is up for sale .
Japs are conquering the car industry .
Arabs just bought part of the Chrysler Building .
Jeez , they even tried to buy the ports a while back .
Whatever next ?
A hijab on the Statue of Liberty ? "
In a more serious vein , The Australian editor - at - large Paul Kelly wrote earlier this month that the foreign investments , headed by Arabs , signal a major change in international power .
" The energy , financial and political woes that grip the U.S. signal a decisive shift in world power , mocking the liberal delusion that Barack Obama or John McCain can return American prestige and power to its pre-Bush year 2000 nirvana , " he wrote .
" There is no such nirvana .
There is instead a new reality : the greatest transfer of income in human history [ and ] the rise of a new breed of wealthy autocracies that cripple U.S. hopes of dominating the global system and demands on the U.S. to make fresh compromises in a world where power is rapidly being diversified . "
Flynt Leverett , former director of Middle East Affairs on the National Security Council , thinks that " the international economic position of the United States has deteriorated substantially since the new millennium . "
In the current issue of The American Interest , Gal Luft , from the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security , warned that OPEC's Arab countries could potentially " buy the Bank of America with two months ' worth of production and General Motors with six days ' worth . "
The growing Arab takeover of American businesses continues unhindered .
The giant Dow Chemical company and a Kuwaiti company have agreed to set up world headquarters for their joint petrochemical venture in Dearborn , Michigan , which has a high concentration of American Arabs .
The Abu Dubai Investment Council years ago entered the international media business , buying a nine percent stake in Reuters News Agency , which usually reports with an open anti-Israeli bias .
However , Abu Dhabi's ' director of international affairs , Yousef al Otaiba , has reassured American officials that its purchase of Citibank will not be used to exert political pressure on the U.S.
He wrote the Treasury Department , " It is important to be absolutely clear that the Abu Dhabi government has never and will never use its investment organizations or individual investments as a foreign policy tool . "
Many Nepalese are looking forward to becoming the world 's newest republic Nepal is due to become a republic and end 240 years of royal rule .
A newly - elected assembly is meeting in Kathmandu to discuss abolishing the monarchy .
Voting is under way , after being delayed for several hours .
Ahead of the meeting , at least three small bombs went off in the capital - one on Tuesday and two on Wednesday - injuring at least three people .
Meanwhile thousands gathered on the streets of the capital and near the assembly in support of " republic day " .
This is the people 's victory - with today 's declaration of a republic we have achieved what we fought for
Kamal Dahal
Former Maoist guerrilla
Head to head : Nepal 's monarchy
In pictures : End to royal rule " Let 's celebrate the dawn of a republic in a grand manner , " a voice blared from one loudspeaker , Reuters news agency says .
" This is the people 's victory , " former Maoist Kamal Dahal , 22 , told Reuters news agency .
Some 1,500 police , some with body armour and shields , ringed the conference centre where the assembly was meeting .
It has also been enclosed by a ring of razor wire .
Nepal stands on the brink of huge change , says the BBC's Charles Haviland in the capital Kathmandu .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Advertisement The Maoists , who emerged as the largest party in last month 's elections , are committed to removing the monarchy .
They entered the political arena after signing a peace deal in 2006 ending a decade - long insurgency .
Leave the palace
The assembly is huge and Tuesday 's ceremony , performed by an older member of the newly - elected body , saw 575 men and women being sworn in .
NEPAL'S MONARCHY
Has ruled for 238 years Monarchs seen as incarnations of the Hindu God Vishnu King Birendra killed in 2001 palace massacre by Crown Prince Dipendra , after which Birendra 's brother Gyanendra becomes king Oct 2002 : King Gyanendra dismisses elected government , then a year later declares state of emergency Feb 2005 : Assumes complete control April 2006 : Mass demonstrations lead to end of direct palace rule
Q&A : Nepal 's future Profile : King Gyanendra
Many wore traditional clothing and used their mother tongues for the occasion in this ethnically mixed country .
The assembly has been given the initial task of rubber - stamping the abolition of the monarchy .
But the vote was delayed while the Maoists and the other main parties settled differences about distribution of power between the president and the prime minister in an interim period .
The assembly then has two years to come up with permanent arrangements for a new constitution .
Hindu militants Reports said King Gyanendra and Queen Komal were seen driving out of the royal palace on Tuesday afternoon , but it was not clear where they were going or for how long they would be gone .
Nepal 's progress towards becoming the world 's newest republic has been marred by bombs being planted in the capital for three days running this week .
One person was injured when a bomb exploded at an open - air theatre in Kathmandu on Wednesday evening .
Another went off outside the assembly venue but no - one was hurt .
HAVE YOUR SAY
I do n't know what is going to happen but I do n't see a smooth road Anu , Kathmandu On Tuesday , two explosive devices were left in a city centre park , but police said only one exploded , slightly injuring two people .
As before , pamphlets were found in the name of a little - known hardline Hindu group .
Some militant pro-Hindu and pro-royal factions are campaigning violently against Nepal 's shedding of its royal - and its officially Hindu - status .

What are these ?
Which country is the rogue nation ?
Iraq ?
Iran ?
Or the United States ?
Syndicated columnist Charley Reese asks this question in a recently published article .
Reese notes that it is the US that routinely commits " acts of aggression around the globe . "
The US government has no qualms about dropping bombs on civilians whether they be in Serbia , the Middle East , or Africa .
It is all in a good cause - - our cause .
This slaughtering of foreigners does n't seem to bother the American public .
Americans take it for granted that Americans are superior and that American purposes , whatever they be , take precedence over the rights of other people to life and to a political existence independent of American hegemony .
The Bush regime has come up with a preemption doctrine that justifies attacking a country in order to prevent the country from possibly becoming a future threat to the US .
" Threat " is broadly defined .
It appears to mean the ability to withstand the imposition of US hegemony .
This insane doctrine justifies attacking China and Russia , a direction in which the Republican presidential candidate John McCain seems to lean .
The callousness of Americans toward the lives of other peoples is stunning .
How many Christian churches ask God 's forgiveness for having been rushed into an error that has killed , maimed , and displaced a quarter of the Iraqi population ?
How many Christian churches ask God to give better guidance to our government so that it does not repeat the error and crime by attacking Iran ?
The indifference of Americans to others flows from " American exceptionalism , " the belief that Americans are graced with a special mission to impose their virtue on the rest of the world .
Like the French revolutionaries , Americans do n't seem to care how many people they kill in the process of spreading their exceptionalism .
American exceptionalism has swelled Americans ' heads , filling them with hubris and self - righteousness and making Americans believe that they are the salt of the earth .
Three recent books are good antidotes for this unjustified self - esteem .
One is Patrick J. Buchanan 's Churchill , Hitler , and the Unnecessary War .
Another is After the Reich : The Brutal History of the Allied Occupation by Giles MacDonogh , and a third is John Pilger 's Freedom Next Time .
Buchanan 's latest book is by far his best .
It is spell - binding from his opening sentence : " All about us we can see clearly now that the West is passing away . "
As the pages turn , the comfortable myths , produced by history written by the victors , are swept aside .
The veil is lifted to reveal the true faces of British and American exceptionalism : stupidity and deceit .
Buchanan 's strength is that he lets the story be told by Britain 's greatest 20th century historians and the memoirs of the participants in the events that destroyed the West 's dominance and moral character .
Buchanan 's contribution is to assemble the collective judgment of a hundred historians .
As I read the tale , it is a story of hubris destroying judgment and substituting in its place blunder and miscalculation .
Both world wars began when England , for no sound or sensible reason , declared war on Germany .
Winston Churchill was a prime instigator of both wars .
He seems to have been a person who needed a war stage in order to be a " great man . "
The American President Woodrow Wilson shares responsibility with Britain and France for the Versailles Treaty , which dismembered Germany , stripping her of territory and putting millions of Germans under foreign rule , and imposed reparations that Britain 's greatest economist , John Maynard Keynes , correctly predicted to be unrealistic .
All of this was done in violation of assurances given to Germany that there would be no reparations or boundary changes .
Once Germany surrendered , the assurances were withdrawn , and a starvation blockade forced German submission to the new harsh terms .
Hitler 's program was to put Germany back together .
He was succeeding without war until Churchill provoked Chamberlain into an insane act .
Danzig was 95 percent German .
It had been given to Poland by the Versailles Treaty .
Hitler was negotiating its return and offered in exchange a guarantee of Poland 's frontiers .
The Polish colonels , assessing the relative strengths of Poland and Germany , understood that a deal was better than a war .
But suddenly , the British Prime Minister issued Poland a guarantee of its existing territory , including Danzig , whose inhabitants wished to return to Germany .
Buchanan produces one historian after another to testify that British miscalculations and blunders , culminating in Chamberlain 's worthless and provocative " guarantee " to Poland , brought the West into a war that Hitler did not want , a war that destroyed the British Empire and left Britain a dependency of America , a war that delivered Poland , a chunk of Germany , all of Eastern Europe , and the Baltic states to Joseph Stalin , a war that left the Western allies with a 45 - year cold war against the nuclear - armed Soviet Union .
People resist the shattering of their illusions , and many are angry with Buchanan for assembling the facts of the case that distinguished historians have provided .
Churchill admirers are outraged that their hero is revealed as the first war criminal of World War II .
It was Churchill who initiated the policy of terror bombing civilians in non-combatant areas .
Buchanan quotes B.H. Liddell Hart : " When Mr. Churchill came into power , one of the first decisions of his government was to extend bombing to the non-combatant area . "
In holding Churchill to account , Buchanan makes no apologies for Hitler , but the ease with which Churchill set aside moral considerations is discomforting .
Buchanan documents that Churchill 's plan was to destroy 50 % of German homes .
Churchill also had plans for using chemical and biological warfare against German civilians .
In 2001 the Glasgow Sunday Herald reported Churchill 's plan to drop five million anthrax cakes onto German pastures in order to poison the cattle and through them the people .
Churchill instructed the RAF to consider drenching " the cities of the Ruhr and many other cities in Germany " with poison gas " in such a way that most of the population would be requiring constant medical attention . "
" It is absurd to consider morality on this topic , " the great man declared .
Paul Johnson , a favorite historian of conservatives , notes that Churchill 's policy of terror bombing civilians was " approved in cabinet , endorsed by parliament and , so far as can be judged , enthusiastically backed by the bulk of the British people . "
Thus , the terror bombing of civilians , which " marked a critical stage in the moral declension of humanity in our times , " fulfilled " all the conditions of the process of consent in a democracy under law . "
British historian F.J.P.
Veale concluded that Churchill 's policy of indiscriminate bombing of civilians caused an unprecedented " reversion to primary and total warfare " associated with " Sennacherib , Genghis Khan , and Tamerlane . "
The Americans were quick to follow Churchill 's lead .
General Curtis LeMay boasted of his raid on Tokyo : " We scorched and boiled and baked to death more people in Tokyo that night of March 9 - 10 than went up in vapor in Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined . "
MacDonogh 's book ,
After the Reich , dispels the comfortable myth of generous allied treatment of defeated Germany .
Having discarded all moral scruples , the allies fell upon the vanquished country with brutal occupation .
Hundreds of thousands of women raped ; hundreds of thousands of Germans died in deportations ; a million German prisoners of war died in captivity .
MacDonogh calculates that 2.5 million Germans died between the liberation of Vienna and the Berlin airlift .
Nigel Jones writes in the conservative London Sunday Telegraph : " MacDonogh has told a very inconvenient truth , " a story long " cloaked in silence since telling it suited no one . "
The hypocrisy of the Nuremberg trials is that the victors were also guilty of crimes for which the vanquished were punished .
The purpose of the trials was to demonize the defeated in order to divert attention from the allies ' own war crimes .
The trials had little to do with justice .
In Freedom Next Time , Pilger shows the complete self - absorption of American , British and Israeli governments whose policies are unimpeded by any moral principle .
Pilger documents the demise of the inhabitants of Diego Garcia .
The Americans wanted Diego Garcia for an air base , so the British packed up the 2,000 residents , people with British passports under British protection , and deported them to Mauritius , one thousand miles away .
To cover up its crime against humanity , the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office created the fiction that the inhabitants , which had been living in the archipelago for two or three centuries , were " a floating population . "
This fiction , wrote a legal adviser , bolsters " our arguments that the territory has no indigenous or settled population . "
Prime Minister Harold Wilson and Foreign Secretary Michael Stewart conspired to mislead the UN about the deported islanders by , in Stewart 's words , " presenting any move as a change of employment for contract workers -- rather than as a population resettlement . "
Pilger interviewed some of the displaced persons , but emotional blocs will shield patriotic Americans and British from the uncomfortable facts .
Rational skeptics can find a second documented account of the Anglo - American rape of Diego Garcia online at http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/timeline.jsp?timeline=diego_garcia
An entire people were swept away .
Two thousand people were in the way of an American purpose -- an air base -- so we had our British dependency deport them .
Several million Palestinians are in Israel 's way .
Pilger 's documented account of Israel 's crushing of the Palestinians shows that our " democratic ally " in the Middle East is capable of any evil and has no remorse or mercy .
Israel is an apt student of the British and American empires ' attitudes toward lesser beings .
They simply do n't count .
Those who are the salt of the earth take precedence over everything .
LOS ANGELES – Henry Nicholas III had the makings of a real - life “ Iron Man . ”
He was a 6 - foot - 6 genius billionaire with a chiseled frame , physical endurance and a taste for fast cars and gadgets .
He even had a secret cave .
And like the best - drawn comic - book heroes , the founder of chip - making firm Broadcom was haunted by demons :
His sister was brutally murdered in 1984 , and his father abandoned the family when Nicholas was 4 .
But the Southern California tech whiz ’s larger - than - life pedigree did n’t lead to a crime - fighting alter ego .
Rather , it allegedly spurred marathon drug - fueled orgies inside his very own Xanadu , a suite in a warehouse in Laguna Niguel , Calif .
In an Oriental - themed , tricked - out parlor , Nicholas , his friends and a bevy of prostitutes would party and have sex for days – abusing cocaine , laughing gas and other drugs , as music from such chart - toppers as Led Zeppelin and Phil Collins played , according to court papers and a former employee .
The worker said the parlor had six couches .
The main room was fashioned in a Far East motif and adorned in rugs and statues , including a four - foot stone figure of Medusa .
There was a Jacuzzi for six .
A bedroom in the back was used for sex and sleeping , the worker said .
“ The Ponderosa , ” or “ The Pond , ” was also fitted with an $ 18,000 wooden bar .
The parties always had a bartender , including one who was a former construction worker at Nicholas ’ estate .
The billionaire paid for him to attend bartending school to learn how to make cocktails , including Nicholas ’ favorite , the grasshopper , a sweetly potent mix of creme de menthe and cocoa .
A black box filled with cocaine and a grinder for crushing nearly pure coke rocks into powder would be on top of the bar , the former worker said .
There would also be “ whippets ” – small metal canisters of nitrous oxide that , when inhaled through the mouth , produce an intense but short - lived high .
But the party guests complained of how cold the cylinders were , so they were replaced by a tank of laughing gas , the worker said .
“ The parties would last for 24 hours straight , sometimes longer , ” the worker told The Post last week .
But the high times came crashing down for Nicholas , 48 , during the past year as court documents filed by former employees seeking back pay painted the billionaire as prone to making death threats against workers .
In another suit seeking unpaid wages , Kenji Kato , a former personal assistant , said he was forced to act as a drug courier , conceal Nicholas ’ illegal activities from family members and entertain clients with prostitutes .
But the feds fired off the most serious accusations , charging him with securities and wire fraud , filing false statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission and conspiracy to distribute illegal drugs , according to indictments unsealed on June 4 .
The government alleges that Nicholas handed out cocaine , ecstasy and nitrous oxide .
It also said he spiked the drinks of high - tech execs and representatives of Broadcom customers with ecstasy .
While he is out on $ 3.3 million bail , Nicholas is being electronically monitored and has been holed up since April at a $ 66,000 - a- month rehab facility in Malibu .
His lawyers have denied the charges and declined to be interviewed for this story .
As recently as last summer , however , Nicholas was making light of the allegations that he provided prostitutes to clients .
“ We started out as Broads.com , but there was a typo , ” he joked to The Orange County Register .
The wanton wunderkind ’s meteoric rise to wealth and fame began during the frenzied days of the dot - com boom in the 1990s , when he founded Broadcom with friend and business associate Henry Samueli .
Armed with a Ph.D. in engineering , an encyclopedic mind and a legendary work ethic , Nicholas , as CEO , helped his company develop computer chips that made communication between machines faster .
Wired like the Energizer Bunny , the boy wonder of Orange County regularly worked 20 - hour days , often subsisting on MET - Rx nutrition bars .
Shortly after dawn , he would already be overseeing research , making business deals and adhering to an exercise regimen that would make a Navy SEAL buckle .
Family was an afterthought to work .
His wife , Stacey , would reportedly have to come to Broadcom ’s offices in Irvine to see her husband during the day .
In 1998 , pregnant with their third child , Stacey reportedly scheduled childbirth around her husband ’s business schedule .
She filed for divorce in 2002 .
Known as a bellicose boss , Nicholas exacted the same dedication from his employees , who often bore the brunt of expletive - riddled tirades when projects fell behind schedule or problems arose , according to newspaper accounts .
Meanwhile , hundreds of employees became millionaires when the company went public in April 1998 .
Nicholas and Samueli ’s wealth ballooned as the stock price doubled to $ 53 per share .
By 2000 , Forbes estimated the partners ’ net worth at $ 10 billion each .
That number has dropped significantly as the company ’s stock has depreciated .
Nicholas is now estimated to have $ 2 billion .
With his spoils , Nicholas went on lavish spending sprees and donated millions to philanthropies and causes close to his heart .
He donated $ 2.5 million to build a crime - victims memorial in Sacramento last year .
And in 2004 , he spent $ 3.5 million to defeat an initiative that would weaken the “ three strikes ” law in California .
The reasons were personal .
Nicholas ’ younger sister , Marsalee , was killed by a drug - dealing ex-boyfriend when she was 22 .
“ I ’d say I have a moral vendetta against drug dealers because one killed my sister , ” Nicholas told The Register .
Most of his newfound fortune went to a vast array of homes , vehicles and gadgets .
He owns a fleet of sports cars , including Lamborghinis and Ferraris .
He also purchased a charter - airline company , whose fleet included three private jets and a helicopter .
Then there ’s his Laguna Hills estate , offering a panoramic view of sun-drenched Orange County .
The 15,000 - square - foot castle is wired with more than $ 1 million worth of computers .
Its most peculiar claim to fame is secret passages that lead to an expansive tunnel system and an underground sports bar , gym and recording studio .
The underground bunker also showed his penchant for wild sex parties and his manic side .
In August 2000 , he hired contractors to build a second secret underground lair to which he could bring prostitutes and illegal drugs , according to a draft complaint in another lawsuit filed by the former contractors .
Nicholas demanded work be completed in a week while he whisked his wife to Hawaii for a vacation .
He even threatened to kill a contractor after he complained to the billionaire of past - due wages , the complaint says .
Reports say the lair was accessible by a door hidden on a paneled wall in the mansion ’s library and could be opened only by remote control .
According to court documents , the secrecy of the parties was shattered in May 2002 , when his wife found him at the sex den after she flew home from vacation and found him high on drugs and having sex with a prostitute .
“ When Stacey found out , she was very sad , ” the former worker said .
“ She did n’t want to see him anymore . ”
She filed for divorce in the fall of that year , and Nicholas stepped down as Broadcom ’s chief executive in January 2003 to make his family his first priority .
Nicholas is due to be arraigned on the federal charges tomorrow .

寝ぼけたプログラマーは、10進数と16進数を勘違いすることがある。例えば「
11 は素数」と書くべき場面で 「 0x11 は素数」と書くかもしれない。
0x11 = 17 なので、この場合、寝ぼけていても、結果的に言っていることは正しい。このように「16進数として解釈しても依然素数であるような、10以上の素数」を寝ぼけ素数と名付け、「寝ぼけ素数を16進数として解釈したときの値（素数）」を寝ぼけ素数のバグ値と呼ぶことにする。
0x17 = 23 なので、寝ぼけ素数 11 のバグ値 17 は、再び寝ぼけ素数。もし寝ぼけ素数
61 から始めると、次のように、寝ぼけ素数の長さ6の連鎖が得られる。
61 , 0x61 = 97 , 0x97 = 151 , 0x151 = 337 , 0x337 = 823 , 0x823 = 2083
長 さ7以上の寝ぼけ素数の連鎖は存在するか。存在するなら例を挙げ、存在しないならそのことを証明しなさい。

「 永久機関は可能」千葉電波大学が3モデルを公表
2007 年4月1 日
物理学的に不可能と信じられていた「永久機関」は実現可能。 驚くべき研究結果を一日、千葉電波大学の福島康夫（ふくしま・やすお）副学長（理論物理学）ら研究チームが発表した。
永久機関の不可能性は熱力学第二法則から従うが、
福島副学長はこの法則が統計力学に依拠していることを問題視、
統計的な結論では絶対とは言えないことから、
同大学のスーパーコンピュータ「ディープ・ホワイト」で「無視できる関数」のふるまいを無理やり解析するプレコックス解析を行った。
「無視できる関数」とは、引数が増加するときどんな多項式の逆数よりも急速に減少する関数で、
通常の計算機でいくら多項式的な多倍長精度演算を行ってもゼロと区別できないが、数学的にはゼロでない。
プレコックス解析は、このゼロ近傍の微妙な数字の息づかいを感じて、無限小の彼方にある可能性の気配を察知するアルゴリズム。
その結果、第二種永久機関には、少なくとも次の3つの解があることが明らかになった。
第一の解は統計力学の性質から自明な永久機関であり、ピコグラムオーダー以下の微小な系では、 かなりの確率で、長期に渡っ て
「たまたま」エントロピーが減少してしまうという。
例えば2粒子系では50%もの確率でエントロピー増大測が成り立たないことが明らかになった。
第二の解は宇宙論的永久機関。振動宇宙論によれば、宇宙は無限回、ビッグバンとビッグクランチを繰り返す。
これは理論的に可能な宇宙のモデルの一つであるが、エントロピーが一方的に増大するとすれば無限の振動はできないため、第二法則の反例となる。
千葉電波大学のシミュレーションによると、宇宙全体を考えなくても、日常的に考える「巨視的」よりかなり大きいレベルの超巨視的な系では、
宇宙空間のように全体としてほとんど真空である条件において、
非常に長い時間尺度で見たときエントロピーが増大せず一定値を保ったり、フェイズによっては減少してしまうことが分かった。
第三の解は物理定数が変化する場合。例えば重力定数が勝手にだんだん増大する場合、放っておいても閉じた系内で質点はだんだん接近する。
十分に接近したところで仮に重力がマイナスになると、今度は斥力になるため、閉じた系内で無限に運動を続けることができる。
第二法則は物理定数は変化しないという経験測に基づいているが、宇宙の時間的空間的規模に比べると人間の経験はあまりに微視的で、 不確実。「永久機関の実現は実は簡単。単に物理定数を人為的に変化させることができればいい」と副学長は突き止めた。
今回の発見について、 統計力学の創始者ボルツマン氏は、 「 まさかこんにゃくゼリーに割りばしが刺さっているとは思わなかった。当時の学問水準としては、
最善を尽くした」とのコメントをいたこを通して発表した。
一方、福島氏は、 「 わが国の法では、CTさえ撮っていれば死ぬ患者も死なないことが明らかになっている。
死のような複雑な散逸が不可逆でないなら、物理定数を変化させることくらい造作ない。統計的にたぶんそうだろう、というだけで、
いちかばちかで物理法則を作ってもらっては困る」と指摘したが、

大学教授、円周率を計算し過ぎて逮捕
2006 年4月1 日
従来のコンピュータの数千兆倍のものすごい勢いで円周率を計算する「仮想テラキュビット・グリッド」を開発した千葉電波大学の宍戸万芳（ししどかずよし）教授が、一日、著作権法違反（楽曲の無断送信）の現行犯で逮捕された。
宍戸教授は 、 「仮想テラキュビット・グリッド」という新しい方法を用い、
インターネットで処理を分散することにより円周率を効率的に計算するプログラムPnppy（ピンピー）を開発、
円周率を無限に二進数表記することに成功したが、
JASRAC が調べたところ、このプログラムでやりとりされている円周率の小数点以下「e↑↑↑（29↑↑3兆）」桁目付近（eは自然対数の底、↑はクヌースのタワー記法）からの数十メガバイトに、 市販CDに含まれる、クリスタルキング「大都会」のデジタルデータと完全に一致するバイナリー列を発見。
著作権者に無断で、各ノードのキャッシュから誰でも自由に取り出せる状態になっていた。
このプログラムの出力はさらに、JASRACのすべての管理楽曲の無断コピーを含んでいるとして、 被害届が出されていた。
京都府警特捜班では、コンピュータ技術に詳しいベテラン捜査員5人を投入し、
一年間をかけて、プリントアウトした円周率の該当桁目とクリスタルキングのCDのデータのダンプ、数千ページを1バイトずつ目で比較。
完全なコピーであることが確認されたことから、
著作物の無断送信の現行犯で、ユーザ数万人を一斉逮捕した。同教授は取り調べに対し、
「円周率はランダムビットだからどこまでも計算していけば、
どうせいつかは著作物と同じデジタルデータが出てくることは避けられない。
避けられないことなら、後押ししてしまってもいいかな、と思った」などと故意を認める発言もしているという。
宍戸教授のプログラムの基礎になっている「BBPアルゴリズム」を公開したサイモン・プラウフ氏も、
著作権法違反ほう助の疑いが持たれている。
千 葉電波大学によると 、 Pnppyは、インターネット経由で接続したコンピュータの空き時間を利用し、
各コンピュータに量子素子のふるまいを持たせ、数万台を並列化することで、
従来型コンピュータネット上に超巨大な「量子コンピュータ」を仮想構築する画期的な技術で、
「 P=NP?問題」という数学上の大問題や、人工知能の研究などで、重要な意味を持つという。
JASRAC の話 円周率はあらゆる著作権を侵害する極めて違法性の高いデータ。
教育上も問題があることから、学校の教科書でも小数点以下の公開を中止し「約3」とぼかすことで、
権利を保護しているというのに、大学教授が率先して侵害するとはあきれる。
「物理計算やベンチマークに役立つ」などと言い訳しているが、実際には、小数点以下何万桁もの数字が必要になることはありえず、
ほとんどすべて楽曲の無断複製のために使われているのが実情であることから、訴えに踏み切った。
宍戸教授のプログラムはインターネットを通して無料で配布され、
誰もが簡単に音楽を無断コピーできる状態にされており、回復不可能な被害をこうむった。
『ラピュタ』のシータさんが通う学校が原因不明の倒壊
2006 年4月1 日
『天空の城ラピュタ』で主役を演じたシータさんが通う滋賀県内の公立高校の建物が、一日、ごう音とともに崩れた。
事件を目撃した同級生らの話によると、シータさんは数学の成績が振るわず、補習を受けるために登校していたが、
「 順列・組み合わせ」の問題が解けずに、 いらいらしていたようだという。しょんぼりして「来年はもっと頑張る、数学」とつぶやいたところ、 突然、学校が崩壊した。
春休み中のため、崩壊した学校は無人に近く、 生徒たちは飛行石を使って難を逃れたが、
逃げ遅れた教員のムスカさんが、落ちてきたがれきに当たるなどして、目に軽い怪我をした。
警察では、テロの可能性もあると見て、 学校崩壊の経緯について詳しく調べることにしている。
ムスカさんは事情聴取に対し、 「 一般論として言えば、重要なパスワードは十分に長く、複雑にするべきだ。
『正露丸のせコーラかけご飯』程度でも安全でないことが分かっているというのに、
設定ミスではないか。国家の安全にかかわる機密なので、それ以上の詳しいことは言えない」とだけ答え、 後は黙秘を続けている。

「 オタク遺伝子」発見 : 「 ゲーム脳」理論否定され る
2005 年4月1 日
近年増加傾向にある2次元コンプレックスは、 遺伝子の突然変異による先天的なものであることが、
千葉電波大学の研究チームによって明らかになった。
同研究チームによると、 オタクは 、Y染色体（通常男性のみにある）のYq17と呼ばれる場所に生じる異常が原因であることが、ほぼ確実となった。
両親の遺伝子とは無関係に生じる突然変異であり、
宇宙線などの影響によるか、またはジハイドロゲン・モノキサイド（DHMO）などの遺伝かく乱物質の影響による外因性のものであると推定される。
Yq17は、5つのエキソンと呼ばれる構造を持っているが、
オタクでは、エキソン3の29番目と33番目のアミノ酸に不等交叉が置き、 正常ではC-T-G-Aという配列になるはずの部位がT-A-T-Aと転写されている。 この「 逆ATフィールド」と呼ばれる異常配置が生じると、メッセンジャーRNAが作られるとき、
μプリン・エルフィンアミン-1-ナデゲリオンという異常物質が発生、
言語中枢で対人関係を制御する脳内物質の一つであるクジアン・センセイ酸拮抗因子が通常の3倍の量も合成されてしまう。
この拮抗因子は、本来、会話が弾み脳内麻薬が多量に放出されているナチュラルハイなどの状況下で「調子に乗りすぎる」ことを抑制するネガティブ・フィードバックとして働くものだが、
オタクの場合、このフィードバック回路が正常に機能せず、
親しさと無関係に常に大量の抑制因子があることから、そもそも正常な対人関係を構築するのが難しくなるという。
その一方で、脳内麻薬の増加が拮抗因子放出のトリガーとして機能せず、
通常の3倍以上夢中になると、そこから先はブレーキなしの状態となるため、
狭い範囲の興味があることに限って、特異的に、無制限にのめり込んでしまう。
「オタクは、生育環境や、ゲームのやりすぎなど、後天的・心理的な原因によるものではないかとされていたが、
まったくの誤り。物理的な遺伝子異常であり、Yq17のエキソン3を検査することで確定診断ができる。
本人の意思ではどうにもならない生まれつきの障害であるのだから、オタクであることを理由に差別することは許されないし、 今後はオタクのQOLを高めるため、きちんと障害認定してオタク年金を支給するなどの福祉政策が必要」と、 同研究チームでは話している。
どうしようもない廃人ばかりでなく、 アインシュタイン、ゲーデル、フォン・ノイマンなどの偉大な科学者、
ゴッホ、パガニーニ、猫部ねこ、ニジンスキーなどの偉大な芸術家も「オタク遺伝子」保有者であるという。

P2P Revolution : Opera Announces Platform - Independent Real - Time Speech Technology
Oslo , Norway - April 1 , 2005
Opera Software の研究開発部門は
、1日、千葉電波大学と共同で、 リアルタイム・チャット型の新しいP2P音声通信技術「 Opera SoundWave 」について発表した。
この技術は、近・中距離のインターパーソナル・コミュニケーションで、プラットフォームに依存しないP2P方式の音声伝達ソリューションを与える。技術については特許出願中だが、規格自体はオープン・スタンダードとなる見通し。
「 Opera SoundWave」がこれまでのコンピューティング技術と大幅に異なるのは、
空気を媒体としてアナログ信号を伝達する点にある。
そのため、コンピュータや携帯電話がなくても、コミュニケーションが可能になる。
Opera は、キーボードなしで人間はコミュニケーションをとれるという新理論を首唱している。
この新しい SoundWave テクノロジーは、同社の研究開発部門が、 音声対応の Opera の電子メールクライアントについて試行錯誤しているとき、偶然発見された。 開発者の一人が同僚にメッセージを伝える必要があったとき、メールサーバがたまたまダウンしていた。 思わず声帯を激しく震わせたところ、それが瞬時に同僚に捕捉され、理解された。 電子メールなしに情報を伝達する新技術発見の瞬間だった。
「 たいていの人と同じように、わたしは何年もの間、 電子メールをコミュニケーション手段のメインとしてきました。
また、電子メールは100パーセント完全なものではないことも承知していました 」
SoundWave の開発主任 Trond Werner Hansen はテクニカル・プレビューの中でそう述べている。
「 Opera SoundWave は、まったく新しい時代を切り開きました。 以前より物事が高速に、効率的に行えるようになったのです。 しかも、この技術は使い方が驚くほど簡単です 」
単なるキーボード入力なしの効率的コミュニケーションというだけではない。
Opera の新しいP2P技術は、文脈独立コミュニケーションでありがちな誤解を防いでくれる。
Opera の開発チームは、この技術がダイナミック・エモティコン（生体認証型の顔文字シグナル）と併用できることを発見した。
ダイナミック・エモティコンはメールやメッセンジャーで使われる従来の顔文字より、
はるかに微妙で複雑なニュアンスを的確に伝えることができる。
プラットフォームを選ばないため、この P2P リアルタイム技術は、 デートやショッピングなどの巨大市場とシームレスに結合することが可能だ。
Opera Software によると、 音声技術はまだ開発初期段階にあり、解決すべき問題もあるという。 特に海外旅行中などには、プロトコルの互換性の問題が生じる可能性があるという。 さらに、現在の技術段階では、約300メートルが空気媒体通信の到達限界であり、 セキュリティやプライバシーの問題も解決していかなければならない。
「 スパムやフィッシング詐欺をどう防ぐかが今後の課題です」
Opera Software の最高技術責任者 Hakon Wium Lie はメールの中で書いている。 「 また、 クローズドの環境、例えば壁のある中庭では問題にならないかもしれませんが、 輻輳したネットワークでは自分宛以外のメッセージの海でどう対処するかが技術的課題となります。 メッセージの発信者を確認する方法がまったくないか、あるいは限定される可能性もあるでしょう」
「 当社のビジョンは、最良のユーザ体験を提供することです。
リアルタイム・スピーチ技術の採用は、効率的なインターパーソナル・コミュニケーションの進化における自然なステップだと考えています」Opera
Software の最高技術責任者 Jon S. von Tetzchner は言う。 「 当社のリサーチ結果によると、この種の技術には大きな需要があり、
潜在的に相当規模の市場となると見ています」

「 ゲームに熱中するほど犯罪を犯さない」調査結果判明
世界35か国で最近、死刑または無期懲役の判決を受けた凶悪犯3700人（政治犯を除く。）を対象に調査したところ、
犯行前一年間にエロゲームを毎日平均12時間以上プレイしていた者は一人もいないことが判明した。
調査を行った千葉電波大学では 「毎日12時間以上エロゲームをした場合、 凶悪犯罪を起こす可能性は統計上ゼロ。
一方、凶悪犯罪者の100%が、毎日12時間未満しかプレイしておらず、
中にはエロゲームをしたことがない人もかなりいる。
毎日12時間以上エロゲームをすると、凶悪犯罪を起こしにくくなり、
エロゲには犯罪抑止効果があることが分かった」と分析している。

London drivers say a fuel surcharge will help to protect their livelihood Steve McNamara , a cab driver for more than 20 years , winces each time he visits the pumps .
" Every day , virtually , fuel costs go up , " he says .
" If you think it is affecting the average family who fill up their car once a week .
I fill up that cab every two days .
It is making an enormous dent into my running costs . "
As one of London 's 24,000 licensed black cab drivers , fuel is the essence of his livelihood .
Being self - employed , he has no means of shelter from soaring diesel costs , which he says have risen 30 % this year alone .
Tank troubles
At current prices , his " cost of tank " - the amount spent on fuel - is likely to amount to a painful £ 2,500 this year .
" Our costs are very high anyway , " he adds .
" The vehicles are very expensive and the maintenance colossal and we are now facing sky - high fuel prices .
" It will come a point when the straw will break the camel 's back . "
Things have not reached crisis point yet , he stresses , although he is " fearful " about the future should prices continue to climb .
During a typical rush hour in London it would be hard to sense any such looming nightmare for the capital 's famous old " hackney carriages " .
The public understand there has been a vast increase in the cost of fuel and someone has to pay for it
Richard Massett , Licensed Taxi Drivers Association Cabs seem as ubiquitous as ever , treasured - by their various users - as a combination of congestion - buster , human satellite navigation device and , if need be , a shelter from the elements .
But as sole traders in a highly regulated industry , drivers are more vulnerable in the worsening economic climate than many other workers .
" Nobody has gone bankrupt as yet but it is having a big impact on drivers ' earnings , " Richard Massett , from the Licensed Taxi Driver Association ( LTDA ) , says of the rising fuel burden .
Drivers are in the unenviable position of seeing their costs escalate without being able to adjust their prices in response .
Unlike the capital 's 44,000 private hire taxi drivers , who can charge what they want , fare rises for metered cabs are capped by Transport for London .
Drivers argue that April 's annual 2.7 % rise - which bumped the average cab fare up to £ 10.85 - was insufficient to cover earlier fuel increases let alone the further sharp rise since then .
Transport for London , which calculates fare rises on the basis of changes to average national earnings and drivers ' costs , says it needs to strike a balance between protecting drivers ' income while also giving passengers value for money .
But with fuel costs far outstripping the headline rate of inflation , drivers argue they need more support if they are to maintain current levels of service and choice .
" You just ca n't go on with costs increasing the way they are , " says Richard Massett .
" If it continues to increase , people wo n't be able to afford to go to work . "
Trying to economise
Short of working fewer hours , there are few opportunities to economise , Steve McNamara says .
More drivers are going part time , he notes , or switching from night to day shifts to make journeys more cost - effective .
" People are always telling you you need more cabs in the evening but this is beginning to have the reverse effect , " he argues , explaining the financial risk of making the return leg of a long night time journey without a passenger .
AVERAGE CAB FARES : 2008 - 9 Weekdays : 6 am - 8 pm : £ 9.82
Weekdays : 8 pm-10 pm : £ 11.39 Weekends : 6 am - 10 pm £ 11.39 Overnight / holidays : £ 13.37 Source : Public Carriage Office " If I take a job 18 miles out of the centre , it is going to cost £ 6 [ in fuel ] to come back , " he says .
" It starts to lose its attraction . "
Many passengers will be sympathetic to the situation drivers find themselves in but the industry 's preferred solution to its financial challenges may be less palatable .
It is lobbying for an airline - style fuel surcharge to be added to all cab fares in London , irrespective of their length or cost .
" That is not something we have been able to do and that is what we want to do , " says the LTDA 's Richard Massett .
" I think it has to happen . "
As Steve McNamara explains , a flat - rate charge of 50 pence per journey would enable drivers - on the basis they do an average of 20 journeys a day - to take home an extra £ 10 a day .
" It would n't cover the increase in running costs but it certainly would go some way towards it . "
Confronted with such an increase , he accepts that some customers may take umbrage and choose other forms of transport but he hopes the impact will be limited .
" The public understand there has been a vast increase in the cost of fuel and someone has to pay for it , " Richard Massett adds .
" It ca n't continue to be the drivers . "
Policy options
For its part , Transport for London ( TfL ) - under the leadership of new London Mayor Boris Johnson - says it is looking at options for helping drivers , while stressing it has no firm plans in mind .
Being self - employed , fuel costs have a direct impact on drivers income " Drivers associations have expressed concerns about rising costs of fuel , " a TfL spokesman acknowledges .
" We are considering what action could be taken to support drivers if prices continue to rise . "
Passenger groups , not unsurprisingly , are rather ambivalent about such a prospect .
For many people , the idea of fuel surcharges has been discredited by the seemingly " only way is up " trend for airline charges as well as the high - profile price - fixing allegations in that industry .
" I think we would be wary of a changing the pricing mechanism , " a spokeswoman for London Travel Watch , which supports the current annual review of fares , says rather diplomatically .
In reality , it is worried about constant fare changes as prices fluctuate and whether charges will then be removed if the outlook improves .
Comparing eras Worries about the poisonous cocktail of rising prices and falling consumer confidence - hitting the number of people using cabs - are unlikely to abate for some time .
With the spectre of the 1990s recession hanging over the current slowdown , cab drivers are as well placed as anyone to gauge how fragile the economic mood in London really is .
" It is probably not as bad as 1991 , which was the worst period in living memory , " Richard Massett believes .
A small consolation for the time being , but the question is how long it will last and how much more cabbies will end up having to pay ?

Irish voters give their reasons for voting No or Yes for the Lisbon treaty
In pictures
Voters in the Irish Republic have rejected the European Union 's Lisbon treaty in a vote by 53.4 % to 46.6 % .
The poll is a major blow to leaders in the 27 - nation EU , which requires all its members to ratify the treaty .
Only Ireland has held a public vote .
The European Commission says nations should continue to ratify the treaty , designed to streamline decision - making .
Irish PM Brian Cowen said he respected the vote but it had caused a " difficult situation " that had " no quick fix " .
Leaders of the No campaign said the vote was a " great result for Ireland " .
An earlier , more wide - ranging EU draft constitution failed after French and Dutch voters rejected it in 2005 .
' Uncharted territory ' The Irish No campaign won by 862,415 votes to 752,451 .
Turnout was 53.1 % .
Mr Cowen said : " The government accepts and respects the verdict of the Irish people . "
He said he would work with other EU leaders to try to find an " agreed way forward " but that the bloc was in " uncharted territory " .
At the end of the day , for a myriad of reasons , the people have spoken
Dermot Ahern , Justice Minister
EU mulls options after No vote Mark Mardell 's Euroblog
In quotes : Referendum reaction " Ireland has no wish to halt the progress " of the EU , he said .
A referendum was mandatory in Ireland as the country would need to change its constitution to accommodate the treaty .
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said he had spoken to Mr Cowen and agreed with him that this was not a vote against the EU .
" Ireland remains committed to a strong Europe , " he said .
" Ratifications should continue to take their course . "
France and Germany quickly issued a joint statement expressing regret over the Irish result .
British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said the UK would press on with ratification , saying : " It 's right that we continue with our own process . "
Spain has said a solution will be found but Czech President Vaclav Klaus said ratification could not now continue .
Mr Barroso said EU leaders would have to decide at a summit next week how to proceed .
He called for the EU to continue focusing on issues of interest to people like jobs and inflation , energy security and climate change .
This is democracy in action ... and Europe needs to listen to the voice of the people
Declan Ganley , Libertas
Irish No vote : Voters ' reaction UK to press ahead Send us your comments But BBC Europe editor , Mark Mardell , says this is a multiple crisis for the EU - a crisis of rule change , of legitimacy and of morale .
In the end , he says , the Lisbon treaty could be declared dead : some parts of it would be implemented without a treaty , others abandoned , others put in a new treaty when Croatia joins the EU in a couple of years time .
Declan Ganley of the anti-treaty lobby group Libertas said : " It is a great day for Irish democracy . "
He added : " This is democracy in action ... and Europe needs to listen to the voice of the people . "
The No campaign was a broad coalition ranging from Libertas to Sinn Fein , the only party in parliament to oppose the treaty .
Gerry Adams , the president of Sinn Fein , said : " People feel secure at the heart of Europe , but they want to ensure there 's maximum democratic power . "
Confusion Correspondents say many voters did not understand the treaty despite a high - profile campaign led by Mr Cowen , which had the support of most of the country 's main parties .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Mr Cowen accused the No camp of " misrepresentation " , saying voters had voiced concern about " issues that clearly were n't in the treaty at all " , the Irish Times reported .
The treaty , which is designed to help the EU cope with its expansion into eastern Europe , provides for a streamlining of the European Commission , the removal of the national veto in more policy areas , a new president of the European Council and a strengthened foreign affairs post .
The treaty was due to come into force on 1 January 2009 .
Fourteen countries out of the 27 have completed ratification so far .
Just over three million Irish voters are registered - in a European Union of 490 million people .

What are these ?
For the last 55 million years , the pen-tailed shrew has survived on a diet consisting of beer .
How 's that for an evolutionary bender ?
The shrew lives in the forest of Malaysia and feeds on the flowers of the bertam palm .
Produced year - round and constantly fermenting , its nectar is about 3.8 percent alcohol – roughly equivalent to a Sam Adams light .
" Fine , " you say , " except that 's a light beer ! "
But cut the shrew some slack – it does n't eat anything else .
Let 's see you subsist on nothing but beer , light or not , and stay sober .
That 's the shrews ' most amazing quality : they do n't get drunk .
On any given night , said researchers in a study published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , one - third of the shrews have a blood - alcohol level that would leave us under the bar – but there 's no evidence of intoxication .
The findings suggest a highly - developed alcohol degradation mechanism ; perhaps the insights will lead to human hangover treatments .
And should the pen-tailed shrew ever be threatened by habitat destruction and climate change , the species can be saved by relocation American frat houses .

During the last couple of years , hundreds of people have received letters from lawyers demanding compensation for the alleged uploading of copyright works .
Their demands state that if you do n't pay up , you will be taken to court and dealt with severely .
However , when people refuse to pay - nothing happens .
Back in March 2007 it became apparent that it would now be the turn of UK citizens to receive threatening letters for claimed breach of copyright .
A team consisting of lawyers ‘ Davenport Lyons ’ , anti-piracy tracking company ‘ Logistep ’ and several games publishers such as Zuxxez / Topware and CodeMasters started sending letters to those it accused of unauthorized distribution of their products – otherwise known as ‘ uploading ’ .
The most persistent cases are those featuring the games Dream Pinball 3D , Colin McRae Dirt and Call of Juarez .
In their letters , Davenport Lyons adopt a very serious tone , as they threaten to take people ’s homes away , should they be unable to pay their ‘ fines ’ .
Of course , not many people like this tone , and they can get very indignant in the face of it .
Needless to say – guilty or not – some people are sufficiently annoyed and simply refuse to pay .
Others refuse to pay for different reasons – TorrentFreak is in touch with a few of them .
The reasons for non-payment vary , but some simply do n’t have the money .
‘ Tania ’ told us : “ I ’m a single mom and my son must ’ve done this but I do n’t have Â£ 600 ( $ 1200 ) .
I ca n’t pay it , I do n’t have that sort of money . ”
‘ Paul ’ , who works a 70 hour week on two jobs explained that he is massively in debt with credit cards and the demands for cash from Davenport just go “ on the pile with the others . ”
None of these people have been taken to court .
Others are refusing to pay because they are innocent .
Even though Davenport insist that its anti-piracy tracking partner ‘ Logistep ‘ is faultless in its data - gathering , it ’s generally accepted that anti-piracy companies are using systems which can produce bad data .
Only last week researchers managed to get infringement notices sent to printers , devices incapable of committing such an act .
Davenport insists – rather like BPI chief executive Geoff Taylor – that if the High Court thought the evidence was compelling enough to order the ISP to give up the personal details of the alleged sharer , then the data must be accurate .
If that is the case , how come Davenport have n’t taken anyone to court or asked Logistep to take up the offers they received to have their system independently audited ?
That would surely boost their credibility .
Or not .
TorrentFreak spoke with many people who are obviously wrongly accused for various reasons .
We ’re pretty sure that ‘ Lucy ’ , a 67 year old grandmother of 8 , had no interest in Colin McRae Dirt , and that ‘ Peter ’ , a 21 year old student who used to have a game - loving flat - mate , is completely innocent .
What about ‘ Jason ’ , a father of four who was in the Middle East at the time of the alleged infringement , or ‘ Joanne ’ who had probably been running a wide - open wireless router for the best part of two years – in a building of around 60 residents ?
As with the other group , none of these people have been taken to court .
One man , ‘ Stuart ’ , has been corresponding with Davenport Lyons for many months now over claims his uncle with whom he lives , infringed copyright on Colin McRae Dirt .
The Internet account is in his uncle ’s name , but his uncle never uses the computer , so the wrong person was accused immediately and Stuart vigorously denies all accusations too .
After many letters sent to Davenport last year , where Stuart ( on behalf of his uncle ) denied all allegations , with Davenport duly ignoring most points and reiterating that if he did n’t pay he’d be going to court ( each time giving only a few days to stop the court action ) , everything went dead .
Then a couple of months ago , dÃ©jÃ vue kicked in as a letter dropped through the door which seemed to start from the beginning again , essentially stating that if he did n’t pay , court papers would be prepared and he would be incurring huge costs , etc .
Stuart wrote back , re-iterated his total innocence , and reminded Davenport that endless correspondence was getting them nowhere while they insist he is guilty , and he insists he is not .
They wrote back and reminded him ( again ) that they were going to start court proceedings if he did n’t pay .
He has n’t paid and they have not taken him to court .
Again .
Stuart is not unique in receiving lots of letters , lots of threats and then – nothing .
TorrentFreak is in touch with nearly 40 people accused in these cases and not one of them has been taken to court , in some cases more than 15 months after these people apparently had 14 days to pay up or else .
It ’s not clear if Davenport Lyons has completely given up on taking anyone to court , they may still surprise us .
It ’s believed they did ‘ win ’ one case when someone they accused did n’t turn up in court but all the indications point to a stalemate on the outstanding cases , including those of Stuart , Lucy , Peter , Jason , Joanne and countless others .
It ’s thought that around 40 % to 50 % of people who received letters have paid up , and maybe that ’s enough for the operation to be profitable for Davenport .
Taking people to court in the UK for such a small infringement is definitely unprofitable .
Maybe this is the greatest indicator as to where these cases are going to end up when the defiant , penniless and innocent refuse to pay .
To - date , solar power is a marginal , boutique alternative to mainstream energy but MIT researchers say they have overcome a major barrier to large - scale , cost - effective solar power : efficiently storing energy for use when the sun does n't shine .
Solar power is currently a daytime - only energy source because storing extra solar energy for later use is prohibitively expensive and grossly inefficient .
MIT researchers say have hit upon a simple , inexpensive , highly efficient process for storing solar energy .
Inspired by the photosynthesis performed by plants , Daniel Nocera , the Henry Dreyfus Professor of Energy at MIT and Matthew Kanan , a postdoctoral fellow in Nocera 's lab , have developed an unprecedented process that will allow the sun 's energy to be used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen gases .
Later , the oxygen and hydrogen may be recombined inside a fuel cell , creating carbon - free electricity to power your house or your electric car , day or night .

This is the nirvana of what we 've been talking about for years , " said Nocera , senior author of the paper describing the work in the July 31 issue of Science .
" Solar power has always been a limited , far - off solution .
Now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon . "
The key component in Nocera and Kanan 's new process is a new catalyst that produces oxygen gas from water ; another catalyst produces valuable hydrogen gas .
The new catalyst consists of cobalt metal , phosphate and an electrode , placed in water .
When electricity — whether from a photovoltaic cell , a wind turbine or any other source — runs through the electrode , the cobalt and phosphate form a thin film on the electrode , and oxygen gas is produced .
Combined with another catalyst , such as platinum , that can produce hydrogen gas from water , the system can duplicate the water splitting reaction that occurs during photosynthesis .
The new catalyst works at room temperature , in neutral pH water , and it 's easy to set up , Nocera said .
" That 's why I know this is going to work .
It 's so easy to implement , " he said .
' GIANT LEAP ' FOR CLEAN ENERGY
Sunlight has the greatest potential of any power source to solve the world 's energy problems , said Nocera .
In one hour , enough sunlight strikes the Earth to provide the entire planet 's energy needs for one year .
James Barber , a leader in the study of photosynthesis who was not involved in this research , called the discovery by Nocera and Kanan a " giant leap " toward generating clean , carbon - free energy on a massive scale .
" This is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind , " said Barber , the Ernst Chain Professor of Biochemistry at Imperial College London .
" The importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem . "
' JUST THE BEGINNING '
Currently available electrolyzers , which split water with electricity and are often used industrially , are not suited for artificial photosynthesis because they are very expensive and require a highly basic ( non-benign ) environment that has little to do with the conditions under which photosynthesis operates .
More engineering work needs to be done to integrate the new scientific discovery into existing photovoltaic systems , but Nocera said he is confident that such systems will become a reality .
" This is just the beginning , " said Nocera , principal investigator for the Solar Revolution Project funded by the Chesonis Family Foundation and co-Director of the Eni-MIT Solar Frontiers Center .
" The scientific community is really going to run with this . "
Nocera hopes that within 10 years , homeowners will be able to power their homes in daylight through photovoltaic cells , while using excess solar energy to produce hydrogen and oxygen to power their own household fuel cell .
Electricity - by - wire from a central source could be a thing of the past .
The project is part of the MIT Energy Initiative , a program designed to help transform the global energy system to meet the needs of the future and to help build a bridge to that future by improving today 's energy systems .
MITEI Director Ernest Moniz , Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Physics and Engineering Systems , noted that " this discovery in the Nocera lab demonstrates that moving up the transformation of our energy supply system to one based on renewables will depend heavily on frontier basic science . "
The success of the Nocera lab shows the impact of a mixture of funding sources – governments , philanthropy , and industry .
This project was funded by the National Science Foundation and by the Chesonis Family Foundation , which gave MIT $ 10 million this spring to launch the Solar Revolution Project , with a goal to make the large scale deployment of solar energy within 10 years .

FEW people , other than scholars , will be familiar with the story of the Cambridge don whose study of China 's scientific history helped to change the West 's appraisal of a civilisation once thought hopelessly backward .
By the time Joseph Needham died in 1995 , he had published 17 volumes of his “ Science and Civilisation in China ” series , including several that he wrote entirely on his own .
The Chinese began printing 600 years before Johannes Gutenberg introduced the technique in Germany .
They built the first chain drive 700 years before the Europeans .
And they made use of a magnetic compass at least a century before the first reference to it appeared elsewhere .
So why , in the middle of the 15th century , did this advanced civilisation suddenly cease its spectacular progress ?
So powerful has Needham 's contribution been to the historiography of Chinese science that this conundrum is still known as “ The Needham Question ” .
Even the Chinese themselves use it : the phrase in Mandarin is Li Yuese nanti .
Simon Winchester 's lively biography ( see article ) focuses on what drove Needham to wrestle with this issue .
In 1936 three Chinese assistants came to work in his biochemistry laboratory .
One , Lu Gwei- djen , who came from Nanjing , began teaching him Chinese , which ignited Needham 's interest in the country 's technological and scientific past .
He retrained as a Sinologist and took a job in Chongqing as Britain 's scientific emissary .
Mr Winchester draws much from Needham 's diaries which describe an unconventional lifestyle , an open marriage and numerous extra-marital affairs , as well as exotic adventures travelling across China in search of its science .
Among Needham 's destinations in his Chevrolet truck was Dujiangyan , a city badly hit by the recent earthquake in Sichuan Province .
There he was able to study a huge irrigation project that was created 2,300 years ago and which still stands today , though now cracked by the earthquake .
At that time , only the Mesopotamians had made such strides in controlling their rivers , Mr Winchester says .
Needham 's focus on China 's achievements naturally won him praise there .
The Republican government granted him one of its highest honours shortly before it was overthrown by the Communist Party in 1949 .
But Needham also had strong ties with China 's new rulers .
This controversial relationship threatened to blight his career .
His participation in a Chinese - led inquiry into alleged American use of germ warfare during the Korean war , together with his failure to be more sceptical about what many believe to have been Soviet and Chinese fakery , prompted many of his peers in the West to shun him .
Needham 's Cambridge college , Gonville and Caius , however , retained its faith in his scholarship and gave him extraordinary freedom from normal academic duties to pursue his book - writing .
Needham never fully worked out why China 's inventiveness dried up .
Other academics have made their own suggestions : the stultifying pursuit of bureaucratic rank in the Middle Kingdom and the absence of a mercantile class to foster competition and self - improvement ; the sheer size of China compared with the smaller states of Europe whose fierce rivalries fostered technological competition ; its totalitarianism .
With its unreformed one - party system , its rote - learning in schools and state control of big businesses , “ new China ” is hardly a haven for innovative thinking .
Yet the Chinese continue to fret about the Needham question .
A Communist Party chief of a middle school in central China recently said that it deserved deep thought and that the answer lay in an education system that fails to emphasise improving “ character ” .
A former government minister also referred to Needham 's lament that China had produced no idea or invention of global impact for more than 500 years .
Its contribution henceforth , the official said , should be “ harmony ” .
Work on “ Science and Civilisation in China ” has pressed on since Needham 's death .
A variety of authors continue to contribute on topics that stretch from mining to agro-industries and forestry .
The latest , out this year , is part 11 of volume five .
Each part is a book , in this case a 512 - page tome on ferrous metallurgy by Donald B. Wagner , the 24th book in the series .
Whether we like it or not , life does n’t always go the way we planned it .
The same is true in business .
While most entrepreneurs accept the fact that the journey to success may be a bit bumpy along the way , that same acceptance is harder to maintain when the cause of the turbulence is a personal mistake .
Still , it ’s those very mistakes ( and our response to them ) that can make all the difference between the success and failure of even the most promising business venture .
Why Making Mistakes in Business Are a Good Thing
On the surface , it would seem that making mistakes is something to avoid at all costs .
But , the reality is most of the setbacks and failures that occur within a business are a goldmine of valuable information and experiences .
When they are handled properly ( more on this below ) , mistakes can help business owners and managers discover stopgaps , wastage , and wrong assumptions so they can refocus and realign their priorities and their resources , and ultimately streamline operations .
Failure also can lead to personal growth and learning , and it is a vital part of innovation and experimentation .
In short , it ’s all a matter of perspective .
Smart entrepreneurs expect that there will be some unavoidable failures ahead .
But instead of running away from them , they embrace them and turn them into valuable learning opportunities .
Here is an example :
In the late 1990s , Christopher Gergen , co-founded an online tutoring platform for high school and college students called Smarthinking.com .
Everything was looking good in the beginning of 2000 .
The company was experiencing rapid growth and had the backing of investors .
But then the dot com bubble burst .
Shaken investors pulled out their financing , leaving Gergen and his partner with practically no money to work with .
They had failed to foresee the impending collapse of the market and were cuaght unprepared .
Instead of ignoring the problem , the two founders brought their whole staff together and explained exactly what needed to happen to save the company .
They skimped and saved for a half a year and were eventually able to raise a $ 5 million round of financing .
That experience ultimately helped the business to take a much more disciplined approach to their cash flow management , and unlike many of the tech companies of that time , Smartthinking .com still exists today and has survived even the recent recession .
How to Turn Mistakes into Opportunities
In tech oriented circles these days , failure is actually embraced ; it ’s almost become a badge of honor and a sign that success will come later on .
The result is that entrepreneurs looking for outside investors assume that prior failures are a plus in their favor .
They make mistakes and just as quickly move on from them .
This attitude may sound more positive , but it is deceptively so .
Not all failures are created equal .
The kinds of failures that make an entrepreneur more likely to receive the support and backing of outside investors and the ones that will truly lead to future success are the ones that show smart decision - making , a rational approach to solving a problem , as well as real learning and growth .
These factors are themselves the indications that success may well be on its way .
But , how do you get to this place in your business - especially if you ’ve made some big blunders ?
Here are a few points to keep in mind :
Start with acceptance .
Being in the wrong does not mean you are weak or bad ; it just means you are human .
Once you can get that into your head , it becomes much easier to be transparent , honest , and to take personal responsibility for the error .
The worst thing you can do is to try to pin the blame others - even if there were other people involved .
Also , in situations where someone was hurt , make the effort to make amends .
Feedback is key .
Realize that by nature it will be hard to look objectively at your failure .
The urge to either gloss over the mistake or overreact to it is extremely difficult to overcome .
For that reason you need an outside perspective .
Do not ignore and actively seek out critical feedback - from mentors , customers , employees , peers , and partners .
Successful entrepreneurs assume some adaptation and change will be required , so they actively seek feedback , spot failures and fix them early .
They avoid the instinctive reaction of denial , or the stubbornness of charging straight ahead despite evidence that a strategy is not working .
But a caveat : not all feedback is created equal .
Even though it ’s important to seek out the advice of others , you at the same time need to sift out the golden nuggets of suggestions , advice , and even complaints while throwing out or just putting on the side , the ideas that are not currently applicable .
Look failure in the face .
Listen to feedback , and then have the courage to explore the root cause of the mistake .
What was in your control to change , and what factors were outside of it ?
Define the mistake in a non-defensive way so that everyone involved can better understand what happened and how to avoid it in the future .
By going through this process , you are more likely to end up fixing the real problem , and not just a symptom .
Look for the silver lining .
Now it ’s time to reframe the whole situation .
Determine not only what went wrong , but also what went right and how you can learn from the experience .
chart your own path .
New paths are the key to success for an entrepreneur , but unless you listen and do your homework , you will be unable to recognize the old proven paths to perdition .
Take action .
The last step to this process is to implement change based on what you learned from the experience .
Your goal is to not only try to rectify the problem , but to get things back on track .
Failures should result in better processes and better documentation , or they will become mistakes repeated .
Moreover , the process of change needs to be implemented quickly before negative and hard to change assumptions get in the way of progress .
The key take away to all of this is that failure is very much a matter of perspective .
Mistakes happen .
They ’re an unavoidable part of life , but failure is in the eye of the beholder .
To the extent that you can turn a blunder - even a major one - into a learning experience that forever changes the way you do things - both now and in the future - then the truth is there was no real failure after all .
Instead , it becomes just another opportunity for success down the road .
自分の理解が正しければ（先生はもう「長老」なんですか？）、池田さんのエントリーでそう呼ばれているのは自分が尊敬する大先輩の先生のことのようなので、ちょっと複雑な気持ちである。スルーしようかと思っていたが、やはり何か言っておこうかと思う。
池田さんが指摘されているのは、大学の、官僚構造の、そして日本の構造的問題だと思う。せっかく重要な問題を指摘されているのに、「御用学者」などとという呼び方をすると、それが大学教授個人の問題に矮小化されてとらえられてしまう。
まず、誤解を恐れずに言えば、「官僚の御用聞きをする」というのは、良くも悪くも東大の職務のひとつのようになっている。日本の官僚組織がうまく機能しているという前提の下に、官僚をサポートすることすなわち国家に貢献することと考えられているのだ。確かに、その前提に大きな疑問があると思う。そんな御用大学に勤めている学者を御用学者と呼んで何が悪い、というかもしれない。
でも、 「御用学者」などと言ってしまえば、池田さんのせっかくの問題提起が、「お上が悪い」「権威が悪い」というところで思考停止してしまうような人々の餌として消費されて、結局根本的な問題が議論されずに終わってしまう。バッシングが繰り返されるだけで何も変わらないという典型的パターンだ。それは池田さんの本意ではなかろう。
そもそも、彼は 「御用学者」という言葉でイメージされるような、お金がほしいとか、官僚にちやほやされたいとか、権威がほしいとか、そういった志の低い人物ではない。それに、情報大航海プロジェクトに協力したって、研究費が増えるわけでもなく、逆に研究の時間は奪われる一方である。あくまでも国家への貢献を志しているのだ。
だからこそ問題の根は深いのだといいたい。
日本の外に出てみれば、本当に世界で知られている優秀な人は誰かわかるが、彼はそういう人物だ。
GoogleのMapReduceが新しいなんていう奴は２５の年前の彼の論文を見ろよ、とデータベース界のグルである
M. Stonebraker 御大が言っているくらい重要な業績を残している。ドメスティックな「猿山のボス」とは違って、官僚に擦り寄らなくたってすでに名声は手にしているのだ。
ただ、申し上げにくいけれど、ここ数年に限っていえば、残念ながら海外から見たアクティビティは落ちているようにみえる。それと同時に日本語圏では「えらいひと」としてお名前を拝見することが多くなった。外に向けて輝いていた光は黒い雲に隠されてしまったのだ。*1
当然のことだが、偉大なデータベースの専門家であっても、経営の専門家でも行政の専門家でもないのだ。それを、全人格的に「えらいひと」に祭り上げ、「東大教授」として仕立て上げる。東大の教授が「東大教授」なのは社会がそれを望んでいるからではないのか。日本の組織は、ときに「リーダー」でなく「天皇」をおきたがる。結局、「えらい先生」を立てておけば組織内調整が円滑になるということなのだろう。でもそういうことに消費されるには彼はもったいなさすぎる。
彼のように優秀な専門家に、取りまとめ役のような仕事をさせるのは日本にとって大変な損失であると言いたい。正直、本当に残念でならない。
若い大学の研究者に対して、「官僚との付き合いを減らせ」と提言したのはこういった思いからである。もちろん、それも職務の一環であり、避けるのは難しいことは承知している。それに、本来ならば、官僚を媒介にした国家への貢献は意義のあることだとも思う。ただし、それが想定されているようにうまく機能すればの話だ。それが壊れていれば、どんなに官僚に貢献してもそれは国に貢献していることにならないし、しまいには「御用学者」と呼ばれてしまうのである。悲しいことである。
先に言ったように、これを「 御用学者」とか「税金泥棒」とかいって大学教授個人や官僚個人を責めても事態は変わらないであろう。もちろん、大学も今後のあり方を真剣に考えなければならないが、根本的には日本全体が大きな官僚組織になっていることが問題だろう。つまりこれは政治の問題であり、最終的には有権者である国民の問題なのだ。優秀な人材を構造的な問題に落としいれているのは自分たちなのだと自覚すべきと思う。例えば、経産省のプロジェクトの存在そのものがもう時代遅れでだめだというのならば、国会でその予算を可決させないでほしい。軍人はどう戦闘するかのプロであっても、どう戦争を「しない」かの政治のプロではない。官僚も学者も同じである。
優秀な専門性を持ち、公共心に溢れる人々が次々と浪費されていく。それを本人の自己責任として放置してよいものであろうか。日本の組織はもっと専門家をプロフェッショナルとしてうまく使ってもらいたい。
そう思うのは自分が専門バカの聖地シリコンバレーに住むバカだからだろうか。

Everyone fears something .
Whether it ’s a child fearing the boogey man ( bogyphobia ) or even fear of the number 13 ( triskadekaphobia ) .
These two seem potentially unfounded fears , though there are real people who are particularly afraid of them .
Certainly fears are crippling to the person with the phobia ; however , there are also some potentially crippling fears that could halt someone in their tracks on a daily basis .
To be included on this list , the reason for the phobia has to be something that a person can encounter every day .
Do n’t be afraid , read on .
And if you have any top 10 lists , please submit them to TopTenz.net
10 . Chronophobia
The fear of clocks might easily be overcome ; however , the alternate definition of chronophobia is the fear of time .
Time surrounds us , it binds us – sorry , Star Wars moment there .
If a person were to rid herself of all reminders of time such as clocks that would be one thing .
But fear has a way of creeping up on someone .
As soon as she thought about the fact that time is slipping away , perhaps their sanity might as well .
9. Stasibasiphobia
Most people might think that couch potatoes have this fear of standing up and walking .
It ’s not true ; most couch potatoes are just averse to the idea .
However , a person with stasibasiphobia could very well never get anything done in life , unless he was confined to a wheelchair .
But what happens if that person is afraid of someone else standing up and walking ?
Does that mean the phobic must live in isolation in a sitting position for the rest of his life ?
What a drag !
8. Domatophobia
Most Americans want four walls , three meals a day and a bed to sleep on .
Unfortunately , most of those things are on this list as crippling phobias including domatophobia , fear of houses or being in a house .
The only logical cure to this phobia would be to live in a cave or some other natural enclosure unless the fear does n’t extend to apartments or condos .
Either way , that ’s a portion of the American Dream dashed .
7. Decidophobia
You just did it !
You just made the decision to continue reading this list , which includes the phobia of making decisions , decidophobia .
A person who cannot make a decision is likely to be eternally stuck in a rut .
Unless something becomes second nature such as everyday routines , a person could be crippled by the simple decision of what to eat for breakfast .
6. Nyctophobia and Photophobia
For these two fears , they are sides of the same coins like a Yin - Yang symbol – literally .
Nyctophobia is the fear of night or darkness , while photophobia is the fear of light .
Perhaps the only way to handle these fears is sleeping through the night or through the day , then again turning on all your lights might help a phobic handle the fear of darkness , not necessarily the electricity bill .
On the flip side , a photophobic would have to live in the dark for the rest of his life – talk about being white as a sheet .
5. Anthropophobia and Lalophobia
Like No. 6 on our list , these fears could potentially isolate the phobic for life .
Anthropophobia is a fear of people while lalophobia is the fear of speaking .
Maybe the hermit with domatophobia should get together with the anthropophobic .
Nope , that would n’t work , because the hermit is still a person .
And do n’t forget that never being able to speak or be around another person certainly would n’t do well for social skills .
4. Urophobia
From here on out , this list becomes phobias of functions that humans must do to survive .
And that means that the phobias , such as urophobia or the fear of urination , would put a cramp on anyone ’s life style .
A catheter might be a stop gap measure as long as someone else would agree to change the phobic ’s bag .
Either way , everyone has to release bodily waste and this fear could make bathrooms a very unpleasant experience no matter where the phobic is .
3. Somniphobia and Clinophobia
While you do n’t necessarily have to be clinophobic to be somniphobic , it does n’t really matter once you realize that going to sleep is never an option anymore !
A person with somniphobia fears sleep while a person suffering from clinophobia fears beds .
I ’m sure a clinophobic could just sleep standing up .
However , humans need the REM cycles of sleep to help digest their everyday thoughts and activities .
Without sleep , a person could , potentially , slowly go insane due to fatigue and too many screws loose in the noggin .
We all have nightmares , but can you imagine having a waking nightmare about going to sleep ?
2. Phagophobia
And the final piece of our American Dream is having three square meals a day .
But what if you had phagophobia , the fear of eating ?
There are people – in hospitals – who live on liquid diets .
But to go without food must be torturous on a daily basis , unless of course , you ’re a phagophobic .
It must be hard for a phobic like this to go out on a date since he would obviously not ask his date out for dinner .
And the holidays must also get awful lonely without the company and great food !
1. Anemophobia
Catch your breath , especially if you have anemophobia , the fear of air .
A person could be scared every moment of her life .
Sure eating , sleeping and all the other fears on this list could cripple people on a daily basis , but not potentially for every moment of your waking life .
There are a number of methods to counter phobias , all of which seem like they would fail miserably contingent on how paralyzed a phobic is of air .
Outside of living in a bubble with a controlled atmosphere , nothing comes to mind to counter such a phobia .
Even a little fresh air to help cleanse the mind would n’t help in this case .

Package management ( by John Frey )
A few weeks ago on DistroWatch there was some debate about package managers .
I think you will agree that we can never know too much about package management .
I have done some research and would like to share some of what I have learned .
What is a package ?
The first thing we need to know is , what is a package ?
There are two ways to install software .
The first way is to get source code and compile it on your system .
#./configure
#make
# make install
The 2nd way is to get and install a package .
A package contains source code pre-compiled and packaged as a binary installation file ( executable ) .
It may include icons , libraries , configuration files , binaries , man pages , desktop shortcuts , header files , fonts , etc .
In addition , it may contain meta data , such as version information , package maintainer and software authors ' names and contact information , licensing , changelogs , READMEs and web location for the project and source code .
Each package format has a file structure for storing data and is compressed .
When the package is executed , it uncompresses the data and copies all the files from the package into the file system of the operating system , creating symbolic links where needed , putting start - up links in the menu and on the desktop , and sometimes giving configuration options to the user .
Packages are distribution and version - specific as the location for dependencies may vary between distributions and between versions of a distribution .
Sometimes it is possible to download and install software the Windows way by just clicking on the package , provided it is compatible with the operating system .
For instance , I downloaded and installed the Flash plugin RPM from Adobe on my Mandriva Linux system .
More on that later .
There are many package formats , with .tgz , .deb and .rpm being the most common .
Others like .pup , .pisi , . tazpkg and .mo are less common .
Source code is usually distributed as tar.gz or tar .
bz2 files , but some distributions distribute their binary packages this way as well .
Most of us probably use .deb or .rpm packages .

Package managers
OK , so we know what a package is , what is a package manager ?
In a nutshell , a package manager installs , removes and updates packages .
That is the simple definition but a modern package manager can do so much more .
It can automatically connect to a repository , automatically download software , check for and resolve dependencies , list packages , list dependencies , search the package list , sort the list , and add and remove repositories .
It can specify a repository for a specific package and block upgrades to specific packages , verify checksums and digital signatures to insure the integrity of the packages , allow automatic updates , and remove dependencies when uninstalling .
Not all package managers do all of those things , nor do they all perform equally well on all of those functions .
This has given rise to different package managers and , contrary to the perceived notion , they do not all perform the same function except as viewed on a very superficial level .
As you read about these package managers this will become clearer .
Repositories and package management system
Repositories are collections of packages typically on a remote server , but they can also reside on the local hard disk , a CD - ROM , DVD or other storage media .
The important thing to know about repositories is that they store data about packages in a particular format depending on the package manager .
As an example , Mandriva 's urpmi cannot read Fedora 's yum repository despite both containing .rpm packages , while Debian 's APT can't read Mandriva 's or Fedora 's repositories .
The package manager , package format and repository comprise the package management system .
pkgtool
Slackware and its derivatives use this system .
The package format is a tar.gz file given the .tgz extension .
That is , it is a tape archive ( tar ) that has been compressed with gzip ( gz ) .
This is not a package manager in the sense we normally think of it today .
It 's really just a package format and some command line tools to create , view , install , remove and upgrade .
The packaging system allows embedding of install scripts .
Those scripts are the only difference between installing a source tarball and a Slackware package .
There is no dependency checking , no automatic connection to a repository , no automatic updating the system or checksum verification .
Using pkgtool , one can access a list of installed software for removal , install packages or run install scripts .
Packages are manually downloaded from a repository .
This is the system that all package managers set out to improve in the days when Slackware Linux was a dominant Linux distribution .
Slackware provides a package browser on the Internet and RSS feeds are available too .
Both of those tools look to be recent additions .
SWareT , slapt - get , slackpkg and NetBSD 's pkgsrc are third - party tools that have been developed to aid package management in Slackware and / or its derivatives .
These tools all provide dependency resolution and may provide some more advanced functions .
Gslapt is a GTK + front - end to slapt - get , an APT - like package management system for Slackware Linux .
( full image size : 50 kB , screen resolution : 795x629 pixels )
Advanced Packaging Tool ( APT )
APT is used primarily in Debian and its derivatives .
APT is a library of routines in libapt that acts as a front - end for dpkg , which is a low - level package manager with utilities to install , uninstall and update .deb packages .
APT provides dpkg with more advanced functions , not the least of which is dependency resolution .
The APT of today has evolved a long way from its origins but has retained its relationship to dpkg .
All Debian derivatives use APT by default .
Development of new capabilities has kept pace with other package managers of more recent vintage .
There is little question that it is one of the best , most feature - rich package managers available .
APT has been ported to OpenSolaris and Mac OS X , and can be used with RPM - based distributions via apt4rpm or apt-rpm .
Synaptic - a popular graphical package management tool for ( not only ) Debian - based distributions .
( full image size : 83 kB , screen resolution : 856x598 pixels )
RPM Package Manager ( RPM )
RPM is both a package format and a package manager .
It is easily as popular as APT .
While RPM has some of the higher level functions built into it from the start , like dependency checking ( but not dependency resolving ) , it seems that adding all the features of a modern package management system to the RPM standard is not easily done .
This has given rise to new package management tools like YUM , urpmi , YaST , up2date and apt-rpm that offer dependency resolution and more advanced features while leaving the lower level routines to RPM .
These utilities are sometimes called Meta Package Managers because they manage RPM which is already a package manager .
RPM has been ported to IBM 's AIX architecture and is the default package format for the Linux Standard Base ( LSB ) .
urpmi
Mandriva is the only distribution using urpmi , just as openSUSE is the only distribution using their system .
The package format is .rpm .
The urpmi utility is one of the first , perhaps the first , package manager for RPM packages .
It actually consists of a number of different utilities to perform various functions : urpme uninstalls software , urpmq queries the database for a matching file name , urpmi installs packages , and so on .
One of the interesting functions of urpmi is that it will add the meta data for RPMs installed from a local directory .
If you remember way back , I mentioned downloading Adobe 's Flash plugin .
All I had to do was click on the RPM package , that brought up a dialog box asking me if I wanted to install , save or cancel .
I chose install and urpmi added the RPM to my list of installed software .
This means that I can use urpmi to uninstall or upgrade the plugin provided I remember to keep the original RPM file .

Yellow Dog Updater Modified ( YUM )
Derived from Yellow Dog Updater ( YUP ) , YUM is a Package manager for Red Hat / Fedora - based systems using the RPM package .
It has become the default package manager as of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and is used by most Red Hat / Fedora - based systems .
Modularity is a major feature for YUM .
Extra functions are added through plugins and with the yum - utils package .
Critics say the tool is not integrated enough and performance and maturity of modules can vary .
Nevertheless its wide adoption is evidence that it is a good package management system .
Red Hat has long offered a subscription service to provide updates and patches called Red Hat Networks ( RHN ) .
The subscription service is important to their business plan and as such they have not spent as much time on development of a non-subscription service package manager .
Third parties developed YUM before it was picked up by Red Hat .
RPM is the traditional Red Hat package manager superceded by up2date , now replaced by YUM .
Yum Extender ( YumEx ) is a powerful graphical package management tool for Fedora - based distributions .

ZYpp
SUSE Linux and openSUSE use a veritable dog's breakfast of utilities for package management .
Input is given through either rug ( a command - line front - end ) or zen - updater ( a GUI frontend ) to Zenworks Management Daemon ( ZMD ) .
ZMD listens for commands and passes them off to the libzypp ZMD helpers , which communicate with the software database , parse metadata , and pass data and commands to libzypp .
Libzypp does dependency resolution , installation , removal , and upgrades - using the RPM package management utility .
One can also use YaST or zypper ( command line ) to talk directly to libzypp .
This is the extreme other - end from pkgtool used by Slackware .
Three front - ends , two package management systems , two repositories .
The zen - updater system also adds a daemon and the helper layer ( that no other system has ) before it reaches the package manager for dependency resolution and installation routines .
I used this system when openSUSE first introduced it in version 10.0 .
It was very slow as many will remember , but recent reports say the speed has been improved markedly .
YaST2 is an openSUSE system administration utility that includes an advanced graphical package manager .

Source - based distributions and the BSDs
For these systems , a repository contains install scripts instead of pre-compiled binaries and compiling is done on the local machine .
Portage in Gentoo uses scripts called ebuilds that link to source code and contain instructions for the compiler and install routines .
This system does function like a package manager in many ways , including installing , removing , updating , tracking installed software , dependency resolving , etc .
This is generally the way BSD Ports work as well , with installation scripts instead of packages .
The appeal of this type of management should be obvious .
Install scripts are smaller than packages so the repository is lighter .
Original source means possibly cleaner code and less third - party " optimization " , though install scripts may contain patches .
Local compilation means no extra code to support hardware not on the system and optimizations can be made for the available hardware .
Other advantages exist but you can read Gentoo or BSD documentation for that .
DesktopBSD 's package manager ( dbsd- pkgmgr ) is an innovative graphical tool that allows installing both binary and source packages .

Summary
Those are some of the package managers out there .
I hope you can see the differences between them after reading this .
The early package managers were collections of simple install , remove and update routines .
While APT was eventually developed to be very feature - rich , third - party package managers for Slackware Linux are mostly simple programs that add dependency resolution and one or two other features .
RPM was an evolution of the package manager closer to a complete package management system .
It added features like dependency checking , tracking , automatic installation and checksum verification .
RPM has many more functions than dpkg but fewer functions than APT .
For whatever reasons , instead of adding functions to RPM , developers created " meta package managers " like YUM , urpmi , Smart and YaST .
Finally , we have script - based package management that uses original source code and compiles it at install time .
Script - based repositories are smaller than package repositories , and scripts possibly require fewer resources to maintain through minor variations of software updates .
However , they require close monitoring of the software sources to ensure that hyperlinks in the scripts remain valid .
There are many package managers not described here .
They range from extremely feature - rich , like Smart , to slim , like ( Arch Linux 's ) Pacman .
They are usually developed when no other package manager fits the bill for a distribution 's base and philosophy .
Smart and YUM , among others , are being developed to read several types of repositories .
We keep seeing new package managers and meta package managers .
Even Puppy has its own , undoubtedly optimized for size .
Then there are the many , many graphical front - ends .
They do n't add new functions but improve usability .
Personally , I prefer a graphical front - end for browsing packages in much the same way I prefer a graphical user interface for file browsing .

Depleted groundwater threatens food chain Scarcity threatens many countries , including U.S .

Just before dusk on the central plain of northern Punjab state , Naresh Kumar , 22 , crouches under a huge drill and sprinkles mustard oil , turmeric , raw sugar and various confections inside a 10 - inch circle traced in rich soil .
Hands clasped and head bowed , he offers a short prayer to a Sufi saint and asks for a bountiful supply of groundwater .
He then cranks up a wheezing diesel engine , lines up the drill over the offerings and releases a lever that brings an iron cylinder crashing into the earth .
" Business is growing each year , " said Kumar .
" But we 've placed about as many tube wells as we can in this area . "
On either side of Kumar 's drill , the calm beauty of emerald rice patties belies a quiet catastrophe brewing hundreds of feet beneath the surface .
As the water table in Punjab drops dangerously low , farmers across the state are investing - and often going into debt - to bore deeper wells with more powerful pumps .
Experts say the depletion of groundwater is a major threat to food security and economic stability in India , China , the United States , Mexico , Spain and North Africa .
In China , the agricultural use of groundwater has skyrocketed , causing water tables to drop in many places by a rate of 5 feet a year .
" The breadbasket of China - north of the Yellow River - has millions of people dependent on groundwater , " said David Molden , deputy director general at the International Water Management Institute in Colombo , Sri Lanka .
Water depletion is " sitting there like a time bomb . "
At 19,000 square miles , Punjab state is just 1.5 percent of India 's total territory , but its annual output of rice and wheat produces half of the grain distributed by the state to more than 400 million impoverished Indians , according to Gurdev Hira , an expert on soil and water quality at Punjab Agriculture University in Ludhiana .
And even though booming economic growth in recent years has placed India in the international limelight , more than 60 percent of the economy is directly or indirectly engaged in agriculture and 2 out of 3 Indians live in rural areas , experts say .
" We have depleted the groundwater to such an extent that it is devastating the country , " said Hira .
The problem is exacerbated because Indian farmers ' electricity bills are either free or heavily subsidized .
As a result , many run their pumps with abandon , further depleting water tables .
Hira estimates that the energy used in subsidizing rice production costs Punjab state $ 381 million a year .
Hira and other experts say that if left unchecked , the current system will bleed state budgets , parch aquifers and eventually run small farmers out of business .
" All these issues are interconnected : water , electricity and agriculture , " said Saurabh Kumar , who heads the government 's Bureau of Energy Efficiency in New Delhi .
Most analysts estimate that India spends $ 8 billion to $ 9 billion annually subsidizing farmers ' electric water pumps .
That 's half the amount spent on health care and twice what the state spends on education , according to government statistics .
In a country with child malnutrition rates worse than those of sub-Saharan Africa , some experts are questioning the wisdom of the current system .
" These subsidies hit very hard at health , education and other government programs , and they are being taken by a few select farmers , " said Bharat Sharma , with the International Water Management Institute in New Delhi .
" It 's one classic example of bad economic policies having very serious environmental consequences , " added Shreekant Gupta , a professor of economics at Delhi University .
Unlike many academics and policy wonks who say the answer to India 's groundwater problems and energy woes is to charge farmers the true cost of electricity , Kumar says that would only spark riots .
As a result , he is set to begin a $ 7.5 billion pilot program nationwide that will create more efficient groundwater pumps with meters and prepaid electricity credits , allowing farmers to draw roughly the same amount of water they use now .
But if they pump less , they can pocket the savings .
If they pump more , they pay more .
Utility companies will also upgrade transmission and distribution lines to improve service .
Meanwhile , Kumar and other farmers continue to dig 375 - foot wells and pump out remaining groundwater .
" People will always be able to arrange money from somewhere to deepen his aquifer , " Kumar said .
" But if you hit the end of the aquifer , it 's the end for everybody . "
Lieberman to Obama : ' Go for it '

Lieberman -- whom Obama endorsed in his heated 2006 primary -- is now , of course , hoping to ensure that Obama does n't win .
W.Va. man pleads guilty in torture of woman
Another defendant has pleaded guilty to charges stemming from the suspected torture of a young woman held captive in West Virginia last summer .
Bobby Brewster , 25 , pleaded guilty in Logan County Circuit Court on Tuesday to second - degree sexual assault , malicious assault and conspiracy to commit kidnapping or holding hostage .
He was sentenced to at least 13 and as many as 40 years in prison , said Logan County Assistant Prosecutor Robert Ilderton .
In exchange for the plea , charges of kidnapping and assault during the commission of a felony were dismissed , Ilderton said .
Brewster was arrested in September along with five others .
A seventh person was charged later .
Authorities say Charleston resident Megan Williams was held for days in a trailer where she was forced to eat animal feces , sexually assaulted and stabbed .
She was rescued Sept. 8 after an anonymous caller alerted authorities .
All the other defendants have pleaded guilty to various charges except Danny Combs , whose trial is scheduled to begin in early September .
Brewster agreed to testify against Combs as part of this week 's plea agreement , which was offered only after consulting with Williams and her family , Ilderton said .
Because Williams is black and her assailants white , prosecutors were pressured to charge the defendants with hate crimes , but only one faced such a charge .
The Associated Press generally does not identify suspected victims of sexual assault , but Williams and her mother , Carmen , agreed to release her name .
Carmen Williams has said she wanted people to know what her daughter , then 20 , endured .
A couple of months ago , there was a undersea cable cuts that affected much of the Middle East and Asia .
Today , there are press reports that two ships have been impounded for causing the problems off of Alexandria .
The article says that Reliance Globalcom , the owner of the FLAG cable , had identified those two ships after " studying satellite imagery of ship movements around the breakage area " .
That ’s a good way to do it — but why are there suitable satellite images ?
There are a number of satellites whose imagery is readily purchasable ; is near - realtime coverage that good without prearrangement ?
There are already conspiracy theories being discussed on the NANOG mailing list …
And the root cause ?
This might be it :
At the time of the cuts , a Flag spokesperson said that ships in Alexandria had been asked to anchor in a different place to normal , around 8.4 km off the beach .

Stephanie Lenz 's YouTube video of her tot dancing to an old Prince song was pulled down at the request of Universal last year after the music label said that the clip infringed on its copyright .
Not content with simply having Universal retract its claim , Lenz and the Electronic Frontier Foundation are out to put the squeeze on Universal for issuing a bad - faith DMCA takedown .
But Universal told a judge this week that , even though the clip may in fact be " fair use , " it was still " infringement " and therefore the initial takedown notice was made in good faith .
The two sides faced off in a San Francisco court before Judge Jeremy Fogel , with Universal arguing that it simply could n't be held liable for wrongly issuing a DMCA takedown notice ( if , in fact , it actually issued a DMCA takedown notice ... another point at issue in the case ) .
It did correctly identify the Prince song playing in the background , and the company does control the rights to song ; therefore the claim of " infringement " was correct .
QED .
According to Wired , which had a reporter at the hearing , the judge pushed Universal 's lawyer to take this position as far as it could logically go .
" Are you saying there can not be a misuse of a takedown notice if the material is copyrighted ? " he asked .
" I do n't think ' fair use ' qualifies , " Universal 's lawyer responded .
Takedown notices make me cry
This is n't a surprising position for the company to take .
In its reply to the charges against it , filed several weeks ago , Universal made clear its belief that the original takedown notice was accurate , since fair use is an " affirmative defense " that can overcome an infringement claim , not an assertion that the use did n't violate copyright .
" Plaintiff 's exclusive reliance on the affirmative defense of fair use necessarily establishes that Universal ’s statement that her use was infringing was true , " said Universal .
" For there to be a ' fair use , ' there first must be an infringing use .
Plaintiff ’s arguments that her use could be a ' fair use ' without infringing , or that Universal must be deemed to have impliedly represented that her use was not ' fair , ' are contrary to the Copyright Act and controlling case law . "
In one obvious sense , Universal has a good point to make on this issue .
It simply can't be correct that copyright holders can be found liable for bad faith takedown notices simply because the use in question turns out to be fair in the end ; as we have pointed out many times , no one knows if the use is fair until a judge actually rules .
On the other hand , decades of both common practice and case law have established some general parameters for fair use ( see the recent American University project on fair use in video work for an example ) .
No one wants rightsholders to sue over uses that are 99.5 percent likely to be found " fair " in a court , as this would clearly favor companies with deep pockets over everyone else ( and is the reason behind laws like California 's anti-SLAPP statute ) .
For these reasons , the judge 's ruling here will be a compelling read .
No doubt the whole case feels particularly satisfying for the EFF , which has a music label playing defense in court .
But Universal makes clear just how it feels about the whole ordeal : " Plaintiff ’s inability to state a claim is not surprising .
She has no claim , and never came close to alleging one ...
It is time for this case to be over . "
President George W. Bush salutes as he and first lady Laura Bush walk out from the Marine One helicopter on the South Lawn of the White House upon their return to Washington from Camp David July 13 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Yuri Gripas
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush planned to lift a ban on oil exploration in the Outer Continental Shelf on Monday as part of an effort to ease record high oil prices , the White House said .
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said Bush was acting because the Democratic - led Congress had failed to do so since he urged lawmakers last month to lift restrictions on offshore drilling , a move strongly opposed by environmentalists .
Bush was due to announce his decision and make a statement on energy needs at 1:30 p.m. EDT .
High gasoline prices increasingly have irked American consumers in a presidential election year , when Bush ’s Republicans are trying to keep control of the White House .
“ In his statement , the president will announce that he has decided to lift the executive ban on oil exploration in America ’s Outer Continental Shelf , ” Perino said .
“ He ’ll again call on Congress to lift its legislative ban .
“ It has been nearly a month since the president urged the Congress to act to expand environmentally friendly and responsible exploration for American energy .
Congress has not moved forward , despite calls from constituents and the continued pressure of record high energy prices , ” she said .
Perino said Bush originally had wanted to work in concert with Congress .
“ I think the way we described it was to turn both keys at the same time , ” she said .
“ The Democratic leaders in Congress have not shown a willingness to move forward ...
So we are going to move forward and , hopefully , that will spur action by the Congress .
The ball is squarely in their court now , ” she added .
“ States are going to be able to make decisions for themselves as to whether or not they want to do more offshore oil exploration off their shores , and how far out that would be , and what the revenue sharing would be when it comes to that , ” Perino said .
“ There ’s a lot of things that would need to be worked out .
And both the legislative ban and congressional ban need to be lifted in order for us to move forward to try to develop more sources here in our own country , ” she said .

Read the hype on every new web browser released or due out this year , and you 'll see claims that every one of them is " faster " than all the others .
You could compare super - specific tests and decipher all the code - brain terminology , and you 'd still be left wondering which browser starts quicker , uses less memory , and slides through dynamic interfaces like Gmail the fastest .
Since our squadron of independent analysts had the week off , we ran the latest editions of Firefox , Internet Explorer , Opera 9.5 , and Safari for Windows through some unscientific but highly geeky tests ourselves on a plain old Windows computer .
Take a look at the full ( and somewhat unexpected ) results after the jump .

The testing system
For the sake of rating all four of the latest new - and - improved browsers in the same environment , I tested the most current releases of Internet Explorer 7 , Opera 9.5 , Safari for Windows 3.1.1 , and the third Release Candidate of Firefox 3 ( which is pretty darned close to the final version dropping Tuesday ) on my Windows Vista laptop .
Each browser was installed completely fresh , and , in the case of Internet Explorer 7 , re-set to its new - install settings .

Here are the specs of my test system , for comparisons and curiosity :
OS : Windows Vista Home Premium ( 32 - bit )
Processor : 2 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor
Memory : 2 GB
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
I looked far and wide for free , easy - to - grasp benchmarking software that could cover all four of the browsers I wanted to test , which covered every major aspect , and came up short .
Instead , I tested the browsers the way most people experience them - click , wait , then watch each page load .
Using Rob Keir 's simple but millisecond - accurate timer , I launched every action with a dual tap of the enter and " \ " keys ( pictured at right ) to set the timer , then tapped the " \ " key again when what I wanted to load had arrived .
I re-ran tests when I thought I 'd been slow , and each score below is an average of three or more trials .
Scientific and precise ?
Heck no .
Easy to understand and free from selective prejudice ?
Very much so .
I did use two tests assembled by inquisitive programmers for the more technical stuff , and noted that below .
Now , onto the results !

Test 1 : Startup time — Winner : Opera !
Taking a page from Mark Wilton - Jones ' oft - linked tests , I timed each browser loading " cold " ( straight off a re-start , not having run already ) and " warm " ( having run at least once that session ) .
Vista can be very fickle at boot - up ( at least on my system ) and slow things down considerably , so I used each browsers ' best times from launching to loading a locally - saved Google home page ( which both cuts out network variations and explains the speedier boot times ) :

A pleasant surprise that Firefox 3 boots faster than 2 ( from deep - seated memory , at least ) , as well as how quick Opera moves in general , at least compared to Safari in this test .
Next , I opened each browser two times and headed to a random bookmark to jog it a little .
Here 's their speeds at their next " warm " boot - up :
Advertisement
Surprisingly consistent - note that Firefox 's seeming lapse is less than 0.2 seconds , which could certainly fall under margin of error .

Now for the real test .
I placed a folder of eight links - from the super - clean Google homepage to the image and Flash - heavy Gizmodo and YouTube sites , and a few familiar stops in - between - in each browser , ran to the Lifehacker page and back to " warm " it up , then timed each browser 's version of " open all in tabs " from first click until the last little circle stopped spinning .
Opera , unfortunately , uses a more subtle coloration change to indicate load speed , so I had to rely on the status bar as well .
The results :
Advertisement
You probably wo n't cry over a two - second delay when loading eight tabs , but Safari and Opera were surprisingly swift at multi-tasking in general ( and we 'll see why later ) .
Test 2 : JavaScript & CSS — Winner : Safari !
JavaScript loading times get a lot of attention from folks like , say , Steve Jobs these days .
That 's because with the increasing prominence of AJAX interfaces on sites like Gmail , Twitter , and other webapps , a browser 's ability to perform multiple quick computations can be far more important than a nanosecond advantage at text and table rendering .
Advertisement
You 'll never get every browser team agreeing on what 's a fair JavaScript test , as each platform has its own quirks and rules of working with it .
Sean Patrick Kane 's JavaScript speed tests has pulled attention from all over , however , not least because he 's worked to make it more fair to all comers .
Here 's the stats from Sean 's test ( in miliseconds ) :

I also tested each browser 's ability to render Cascading Style Sheets , the design templates of a page , using nontropp 's downloadable form :
Advertisement
I 'm thinking Safari 's big lead in CSS rendering is how it creates that everything - snaps - at - once feel when loading pages .
And , for a browser that somewhat auto - loads with my OS , Internet Explorer has yet to bring a worthwhile statistic to the table .
At this point , you might certainly wondering just where Firefox 3's vaunted speed / performance / stability improvements might actually , you know , matter .
Follow along , then , to the other side of speed .
Advertisement
Test 3 : Memory use — Winner : Firefox 3 !
Unless you 're rocking a workstation with more memory than you can spare , browsers should n't be using all your RAM and slowing other apps to a trickle .
Firefox 2 was notorious for bloating far beyond its fighting weight after steady use , but developers ' hard work seems to have paid off , at least by my tests :
Advertisement
The blue portion is each browsers ' memory use when first started , and the red extensions their size ( according to Windows Task Manager ) with those same eight tabs above opened .
Again , few people will have eight tabs open , but I scaled it to see where the differences lie .
I wanted to double - check Firefox 's night - and - day improvement , so I closed and launched it again .
This time , it was using 117 MB - not a slim amount , but a still marked improvement over its peers .
Of course , if you do have memory to spare , both Safari and Opera , as seen higher up , can put it to quick - footed use .
Advertisement
Conclusions
Let 's re-emphasize that this was far from a scientific study , and your mileage will certainly vary on different systems .
With Opera and Firefox especially , running a like - new version is somewhat of a cheat - almost any enthusiast is going to have a must - have extensions , features , and add - ons running , which throw off the speed and memory scales .
Still , it was gratifying to actually sit down and measure all the major browser options on a human level , just a timer , a spreadsheet , and a few cups of nerve - boosting coffee .

Guantanamo judge allows disputed interrogation
A U.S. military judge ruled Thursday that prosecutors can use a disputed interrogation to support their case against a former driver for Osama bin Laden in the first Guantanamo war crimes trial .
Lawyers for Salim Hamdan said the May 2003 interrogation , in which prosecutors say he swore allegiance to bin Laden , was not reliable and should not be admitted into evidence .
The judge , Navy Capt .
Keith Allred , did not immediately release his ruling and did not explain his reasoning in open court .
Allred 's ruling cleared the way for Robert McFadden , an agent with the Naval Criminal Investigative Service , to describe the interrogation to jurors as the final prosecution witness .
Hamdan , a Yemeni , faces up to life in prison if convicted of conspiracy and aiding terrorism .
McFadden , one of nearly a dozen interrogators to testify at the trial , said Hamdan swore an Islamic oath , or " bayat , " to bin Laden .
Although Hamdan supported the killing of Jews and Christians on the Arabian peninsula , he told bin Laden he would withdraw from the oath if " the jihad became Muslim on Muslim or political violence , " McFadden said .
" Mr. Hamdan said he was convinced by the need for seeking jihad , " he said .
In the nine - hour interrogation at Guantanamo , McFadden said Hamdan also provided extensive details about bin Laden 's security convoys in Afghanistan .
The reliability of the testimony was fiercely contested by defense lawyers , who say Hamdan was a low - level bin Laden employee who never joined his terrorist network .
Hamdan took the witness stand Wednesday and denied telling McFadden that he pledged allegiance to bin Laden .
Defense lawyers have said Hamdan made the statements to McFadden and other agents under the effects of abuse including sleep deprivation , solitary confinement and sexual humiliation .
Earlier in the trial , Allred dismissed other Hamdan statements that he determined were made under " coercive " conditions in Afghanistan .
He previously threatened to dismiss the Guantanamo interrogation as a penalty against prosecutors for failing to turn over hundreds of pages of documents to the defense until the start of the trial .
McFadden , who provided Hamdan tea , raisins and dates during the interrogation , said Hamdan never complained of abuse to him and appeared to enjoy their conversation .
The trial moved to a new , high - security courtroom Thursday as defense lawyers prepared to present witnesses .
ONTARIO - Nobody knows the exact population of Tent City , but the area has swelled beyond expectations .
The dusty , undeveloped city - owned parcel at Cucamonga Avenue and Jefferson Street is filled with tents , campers and makeshift shelters .
" It took on a life of its own , " Mayor Paul Leon said .
" It did n't occur to us it would grow to this size this fast , which reflects the need . "
The area , just west of L.A. / Ontario International Airport , was created in July as a haven for the city 's homeless .
It has grown to include 300 to 400 people from throughout the region .
" It 's growing and it 's growing , " said Carlos Villalobos , a Tent City resident the past four months .
" And I have n't seen nobody leave . "
Villalobos said the encampment is popular because police , for the most part , leave people there alone .
Police would typically harass homeless sleeping on the streets , he said .
The city also provides water and bathrooms , and picks up trash .
Churches regularly provide food , Villalobos said .
Ontario was lauded by some people for giving its homeless a place to stay , rather than chasing them out of town or ignoring them .
But some Ontario residents are upset about the arrangement .
" I understand something needs to be done for these people , but I do n't think the answer is Tent City , " said Antoinette Hernandez , a 30 - year resident .
" You 're just asking for sickness , violence or other problems . "
Even Kings and Queens are facing their own food crisis .
Kings and Queens Counties , that is .
A continuing decline in the number of neighborhood supermarkets has made it harder for millions of New Yorkers to find fresh and affordable food within walking distance of their homes , according to a recent city study .
The dearth of nearby supermarkets is most severe in minority and poor neighborhoods already beset by obesity , diabetes and heart disease .
According to the food workers union , only 550 decently sized supermarkets  each occupying at least 10,000 square feet  remain in the city .
In one corner of southeast Queens , four supermarkets have closed in the last two years .
Over a similar period in East Harlem , six small supermarkets have closed , and two more are on the brink , local officials said .
In some cases , the old storefronts have been converted to drug stores that stand to make money coming and going  first selling processed foods and sodas , then selling medicines for illnesses that could have been prevented by a better diet .
The supermarket closings  not confined to poor neighborhoods  result from rising rents and slim profit margins , among other causes .
They have forced residents to take buses or cabs to the closest supermarkets in some areas .
Those with cars can drive , but the price of gasoline is making some think twice about that option .
In many places , residents said the lack of competition has led to rising prices in the remaining stores .
" Whether you have 300 or 200 , " she added .
" There may be a decline , but the 200 has an impact on us just as much as the 300 would .
Those 200 families would not have a home . "
Like organic food , which corporate manufacturers embraced in the 1990s , before it , local food is quickly moving into the mainstream .
Last year , the New Oxford American Dictionary picked locavore as its word of the year .
A National Restaurant Association survey this year of more than 1,200 chefs , many of whom work for chain restaurants or large food companies , found locally grown produce to be the second - hottest American food trend , just behind bite - size desserts .
For a growing number of diners , a food ’s provenance is more important than its brand name , said Michelle Barry , who studies American eating patterns for the Hartman Group , a research firm in Bellevue , Wash .
As a result , grocery stores are looking to repackage products like milk and cheese to play up any local angle .
That will be a boon to people who find that shortcuts are necessary if they wish to eat locally .
“ If you live on East 80th 14 floors up and all you have is a potted plant , it ’s tough , ” said Lynne Rossetto Kasper , the host of the radio show “ The Splendid Table , ” who recruited 15 listeners for a study on the subject .
Researchers will record their struggles to make 80 percent of their meals from organic or local sources .
Spices are the only exemption .
Lazy locavores would never go to such extremes .
Rather , they might simply sign up with the FruitGuys .
The company , which has offices in San Francisco and Philadelphia , will deliver boxes of local , sustainably raised or organic fruit right to the cubicle .
In the mood for a meal that reeks of community but does not necessitate a communal activity ?
Three Stone Hearth in Berkeley , Calif. , which describes itself as a community supported kitchen , offers its customers the opportunity to make friends while making food from local , sustainable farms , but the worker - owned company also offers online shopping for people who do not have the time to pick up orders or participate in educational activities .
Customers 20 miles away in the affluent community of Mill Valley , for example , can pay $ 15 to have jars filled with Andalusian stew , made with pasture - raised pork , delivered to their door .
The jars , of course , are returnable .
“ It ’s a very savvy crowd that understands how all the pieces of sustainable farming and nutrition fit together , ” said Larry Wisch , one of five worker - owners at Three Stone Hearth .
“ But they do n’t want the headaches of getting here . ”
Is John McCain losing it ?
On Sunday , he said on national television that to solve Social Security " everything 's on the table , " which of course means raising payroll taxes .
On July 7 in Denver he said : " Senator Obama will raise your taxes .
I won't . "
This is n't a flip - flop .
It 's a sex - change operation .

VIEWER DISCRETION IS ADVISED , CONTAINS NUDITY AND DISTURBING IMAGES !!!!!!!!!!!
By Pallab Ghosh
Science correspondent , BBC News
Researchers want to keep campaigners away from trial sites Senior researchers have called for the location of small open - air trials of GM crops to be kept secret .
The researchers say that vandalism of GM crop trials is holding back research in the area .
Current legislation requires the exact location of GM crop trials to be publicly available .
But according to those engaged in active research , that information is invariably used by anti-GM protesters to disrupt experiments .
The Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) , which licenses open air trials commented : " EU legislation says that we must disclose GM trial locations to the public .
" We are awating a European Court of Justice ruling , likely later this year , on a French legal case that should clarify how the EU law in this area can be interpreted by Member States . "
We now have 24 - hour security , we have fences around materials
Wayne Powell , National Institute of Agricultural Botany Professor Howard Atkinson began a trial of GM potatoes earlier this year which he hoped would be resistant to disease .
The crops were pulled up three weeks after they were planted .
Professor Atkinson is due to meet with the environment minister Phil Woolas in early September and will ask him to consider making changes to the current legislation .
" We should follow the same approach as that followed in Canada for very small scale trials of say 400 plants or so - where the risks are looked at by a panel but the location of those sites is not revealed , " Professor Atkinson explained .
" The other possibility is to identify some national testing centre or centres where such trials could be run securely without the risk of zealots destroying them " .
Security issues Professor Atkinson said that open air trials were necessary to develop crops that could not only help farmers in the UK - but also help increase food production in Africa .
The disruption of trials , he said , has already led to companies moving away from the UK and academic research in the area has begun to decline .
" Academically , there has been a reduction in the attempt to do work of this type - they 've found other problems to look at - but these are not generating practical benefits immediately and certainly not facing up to the big issue of food security in Africa , " he said .
" As far as companies are concerned , they can do this sort of work elsewhere " Jim Dunwell of Reading University and a member of ACRE , the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment , said there had been a sharp drop in the number of GM crop trials in Britain over the last few years with just one application for this year , down from about 20 to 30 per year in the late 1990s .
Local communities Wayne Powell , who is the director of the National Institute of Agricultural Botany in Cambridge , was engaged in a trial of a crop that had the potential to benefit banana growers in Uganda .
It was disrupted by protesters last year .
As a result , he said : " We now have 24 - hour security , we have fences around materials . "
However , anti-GM campaigners , such as Claire Oxborough of Friends of the Earth , believe that the trials should be stopped altogether .
She commented : " Friends of the Earth would have deep concerns about making them secret because of the potential risks that they pose .
" They are at the very early stages of development - we do n't know the impact they 'll have on the environment and on health and very often these trials are not set up to look at that . "
She added : " What you do n't want to do is get into a situation where in rural communities you have an air of distrust - rumours , speculation going on because no one knows what their neighbours might be growing .
" We need transparency - we need to know where these field trials are taking place so that farmers and the public can be adequately protected . "

Judiciary Committee approves resolution holding Rove in contempt of Congress RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday July 30 , 2008
Print This Email This The House Judiciary Committee has voted 20 - 14 to approve a contempt of Congress resolution against former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove for his failure to appear after a Congressional subpoena .
Voting along party lines Wednesday morning , the committee said Rove broke the law by failing to appear at a July 10 hearing on allegations of White House influence over the Justice Department , including whether Rove encouraged prosecutions against Democrats .
" Todays vote was an important statement by this Committee that no person  not even Karl Rove  is above the law . "
Judiciary Chairman John Conyers said in a news release .
" This weeks Inspector General report on the pervasive politicization of the Department of Justice particularly underscores the urgent need for Mr. Rove to testify before Congress .
Any suggestion that the matters for which Mr. Rove was subpoenaed are not important , or that no Administration misconduct has been revealed , is just inconsistent with the facts .
Our investigation has revealed Mr. Rove to be a key figure in the firings of US Attorneys , and the questions about his role in the Siegelman case only continue to mount . "
Some activists , though , thought contempt was not a harsh enough rebuke to a Bush administration that has consistently flouted its obligation to comply with Congressional subpoenas .
" The House Judiciary Committee is taking the cowardly way out by going the contempt route at this time , " said Steve Fox , coordinator of the pro-impeachment American Freedom Campaign .
" It will not force Rove and others to provide the testimony the committee seeks .
Instead , it should launch impeachment hearings immediately , specifically focused on failure to comply with congressional subpoenas .
As former Reagan administration official Bruce Fein suggested in testimony last week , impeachment hearings on these grounds would be very quick .
There is only one question to consider : whether administration officials have failed to comply with duly issued subpoenas .
They clearly have and it is therefore the duty of Congress to impeach the president . "
The committee decision is a recommendation .
It remains unclear whether Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) will allow a final vote .
Rove has denied any involvement with Justice Department decisions , and the White House has said Congress has no authority to compel testimony from current and former advisers .
Yesterday afternoon , a coalition of groups including Brave New Films , CREDO Mobile , People For the American Way , Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , The Nation , Campaign for America 's Future , and Progress Now , delivered a petition calling for Rove 's contempt to Rep. Linda Sanchez ( D - CA ) .
" I think it 's ridiculous that Karl Rove thinks that he does n't have to follow the law , " Sanchez said in a release .
" Nobody in this country should be above the law . "
Excerpts from the markup memo of the resolution sent to reporters follows .
Rove was overseas at the time of the hearing and alleged that the trip had been planned in advance .

FROM : John Conyers , Jr.
Chairman
DATE : July 29 , 2008
RE : Full Committee Markup
The Committee on the Judiciary will meet to consider : A resolution and report finding Karl Rove in contempt for failure to appear pursuant to subpoena and recommending to the House of Representatives that Mr. Rove be cited for contempt of Congress ; and to markup H.R. 6577 , to express the consent and approval of Congress to an interstate compact regarding water resources in the Great Lakes - St. Lawrence River Basin ; H.R. 6126 , the  Fairness in Nursing Home Arbitration Act of 2008  ; H.R. 5950 , the  Detainee Basic Medical Care Act of 2008  ; H.R. 2575 , for the relief of Mikael Adrian Christopher Figueroa Alvarez ; H.R. 5243 , for the relief of Kim Iizuka - Barcena ; H.R. 6064 , the  National Silver Alert Act ; H.R. 6503 , the  Missing Alzheimer 's Disease Patient Alert Program Reauthorization of 2008  ; H.R. 6353 , the  Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2008  ; H.R. 5167 , the  Justice for Victims of Torture and Terrorism Act ; H.R. 2140 , the  Internet Gambling Study Act ; H.R. 6088 , the National Domestic Violence Volunteer Attorney Network Act  ; and H.R. 4779 , to enact certain laws relating to public contracts as title 41 , United States Code ,  Public Contracts  markup .
The markup will take place on Wednesday , July 30 , 2008 , at 10:15 a.m. in room 2141 of the Rayburn House Office Building .
I . A resolution and report finding Karl Rove in contempt for failure to appear pursuant to subpoena and recommending to the House of Representatives that Mr. Rove be cited for contempt of Congress A. Overview The Committee is scheduled to consider and vote on a report titled  Resolution Recommending That the House of Representatives Find Karl Rove in Contempt of Congress for Refusal to Comply With a Subpoena Duly Issued by the Committee on the Judiciary . 
A draft of the report , which includes a resolution to be recommended to the House of Representatives providing that Mr. Rove be cited for contempt of Congress and that the House pursue other legal remedies to enforce the outstanding subpoena as appropriate , has been provided to all Members .
This memorandum provides additional background to assist Committee Members in considering the report and resolution .
Despite extensive efforts to secure voluntary cooperation , and despite the issuance of a compulsory subpoena , Mr. Rove has refused to appear before and provide sworn testimony necessary for the Committees continuing investigation into the apparent politicization of the Department of Justice , including the termination of U.S. Attorneys in 2006 , allegations of selective prosecution , and related issues .
Mr. Rove has refused even to appear before the Committee and assert whatever privileges that he believes may apply to his testimony , relying on excessively broad and legally insufficient claims of absolute immunity   never recognized by any court  in declining to appear .
The accommodations  or compromises that he has offered are almost entirely illusory , and would substantially compromise the Committees ability to investigate these matters .
Todays vote is thus necessary to preserve the prerogatives of this Committee and the House and to ensure that our process remains a meaningful investigative tool in the future .
B. Factual Background Regarding Mr. Roves Alleged Role in the Politicization of the Department of Justice Since January 2007 , the Committee has investigated allegations regarding the politicization of the Department of Justice , including the firing of U.S. Attorneys , allegations of selective prosecution , and related matters .
New evidence continually surfaces in this investigation , such as a report this week from the Departments Offices of the Inspector General and Professional Responsibility that , among other things , indicates that Mr. Rove and other Administration personnel worked to have a childhood friend of Mr. Rove appointed as an immigration judge .
The harms of this alleged politicization are readily apparent .
Respected former Deputy Attorney General Jim Comey testified before the Commercial and Administrative Law Subcommittee last year about the fragility of the Departments reservoir of credibility , and the difficulty of earning back the trust of the American people once the Departments reputation for honesty and impartial justice has been tarnished .
Just last week , Attorney General Mukasey testified before the full Committee that he was well aware of the allegations that politics has played an inappropriate role at the Justice Department  and agreed that [t ] oo many of those allegations were borne out in a recent Department watchdog report .
Prior to that , Mr. Mukasey had acknowledged that , if true , the allegations regarding selective prosecution in the Siegelman case would be stunning .
The U.S. Attorney firings have raised particular alarm from commentators across the political spectrum .
Republican former Attorney General Thornburgh testified before a joint hearing of the Commercial and Administrative Law and Crime , Terrorism , and Homeland Security Subcommittees that , in his view , the investigation had shown that the Department fired U.S. Attorneys not for performance - based reasons , but for political ones . 
Similarly , the nonpartisan American Judicature Society wrote last year that on the basis of the facts as we know them today , the dismissals are indefensible .
And , as noted above , two recent joint Inspector General / Office of Professional Responsibility reports describe pervasive politicization of Department functions that violated federal law , civil service rules , and the Departments own policies .
As the investigation has continued , Mr. Rove has emerged as an important figure .
Forced Resignations of U.S. Attorneys
Last year , reports appeared in the news media that a group of U.S. Attorneys had been told to resign by the Justice Department .
Ultimately it was learned that seven U.S. Attorneys were forced to resign on December 7 , 2006 , an eighth U.S. Attorney had been asked to resign in June 2006 , and a ninth U.S. Attorney had been asked to resign in January 2006 .
The plan appears to have emerged at the outset of President Bushs second term in response to questions by Karl Rove and then - White House Counsel Harriet Miers as to whether sitting U.S. Attorneys would be allowed to retain their positions .
Mr. Rove himself appears to have asked if the Administration would consider replacing all 93 U.S. Attorneys or selectively replace at least some of them .
According to one report , Mr. Roves desire to fire all 93 U.S. Attorneys was seen as a way to get political cover for firing the small number of U.S. Attorneys the White House actually wanted to get rid of .
This targeted list reportedly included U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald , who at the time was investigating Mr. Roves role in the leaking of CIA agent Valerie Plames covert identity .
When Mr. Rove made the suggestion to fire all of the U.S. Attorneys , he had already been before the grand jury several times in the Plame case .
In addition , recent reports indicate that , just weeks earlier , an Illinois Republican political operative had told an associate he was working with Karl Rove to have Mr. Fitzgerald replaced .
Mr. Roves request was presented to Kyle Sampson , then a deputy Chief of Staff to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , who responded that most U.S. Attorneys are doing a great job , are loyal Bushies , etc.  and that even piecemeal replacement of U.S. Attorneys would cause political upheaval .
 That said ,  Mr. Sampson wrote , if Karl thinks there would be political will to do it , then so do I . 
The idea for a wholesale replacement was thus rejected as too disruptive , and because it would have meant the replacement of some U.S. Attorneys who were good performers or who were loyal Bushies . 
Instead , a narrower plan under which a subset of the U.S. Attorneys were to be replaced was put in motion .
Kyle Sampson ran the plan over a period of just under two years , during which he maintained and revised various lists of U.S. Attorneys to be fired or retained , and repeatedly circulated these drafts to the White House .
While the Committee has interviewed Mr. Sampson in detail , and has spoken with most of the significant players inside the Justice Department , the reasons why most of the fired U.S. Attorneys were selected for removal , and who identified them as candidates for Mr. Sampsons list , remain unclear .
However , in addition to his overall role , evidence suggests that Mr. Rove had a role in at least the following cases : a. David Iglesias ( D. N.M. )
A primary reason David Iglesias appears to have been targeted for replacement is because he had drawn the ire of New Mexico state Republicans for his vote fraud enforcement decisions and for failing to bring a particular matter that they wanted pursued .
New Mexico Republican party Chief Allen
Weh reportedly pressed Karl Rove through an aide to have Mr. Iglesias replaced in 2005 because he was dissatisfied by Mr. Iglesias charging decisions in vote fraud matters .
That issue was apparently important enough to Mr. Weh that he raised his complaints about Mr. Iglesias again directly with Mr. Rove in December 2006 and was told by Mr. Rove at that time , apparently just one day after the firing calls were made , that hes gone . "
Two other New Mexico Republicans , Mickey Barnett and Pat Rogers , came to Washington , D.C. , in the Summer of 2006 and met with an aide to Karl Rove , Scott Jennings , as well as Monica Goodling and Counselor to the Attorney General Matthew Friedrich .
Mr. Friedrich testified that Mr. Rogers and Mr. Barnett were concerned about Mr. Iglesias failing to bring a particular vote fraud case against the ACORN community organization  he stated that they were not happy with Dave Iglesias . 
Mr. Friedrich also testified that he met a second time with Mr. Barnett and Mr. Rogers over Thanksgiving 2006 , and they informed him that they were working towards  having Mr. Iglesias removed and that they had communicated with Karl Rove and Senator Domenici on that subject .
In failing to satisfy state Republican concerns about the need for vigorous enforcement of alleged vote fraud cases , David Iglesias appears to have run up against a powerful political force .
The evidence indicates that Karl Rove monitored this issue and heard complaints about some U.S. Attorneys on the subject , again including David Iglesias .
Mr. Roves interest in this subject was so acute that , in April 2006 , he spoke about the issue to the Republican National Lawyers Association and named a number of jurisdictions that supposedly posed heightened vote fraud risks , including New Mexico , Wisconsin , and Washington , as well as other politically important states such as Florida and Missouri , where U.S. Attorneys were at one point or another on the firing list .
b. Steven Biskupic ( E.D. Wisc. )
No Justice Department witness has explained why Milwaukee U.S. Attorney Steven Biskupic appeared on the March 2005 firing list .
Kyle Sampson recalled only that Mr. Biskupic was not a prominent  U.S. Attorney .
On the other hand , the Administration did produce documents describing vote fraud issues in Mr. Biskupics district during the 2004 elections that Karl Rove appears to have printed and viewed just weeks before Mr. Biskupic was placed on the firing list , and which contain the handwritten notation  Discuss w / Harriet . 
The record also contains a lengthy catalog of Republican complaints about Mr. Biskupics failure to bring more vote fraud cases during this time , some of which reached Mr. Rove , and some of which Mr. Rove may have passed on to Kyle Sampson .
c. Bud Cummins ( E.D. of Ark. )
Regarding Bud Cummins , the Administration has equivocated , sometimes suggesting that he was forced out for performance reasons and other times stating it was simply to make room for Karl Roves former aide Tim Griffin to serve as U.S. Attorney .
On February 23 , 2007 , the Justice Department sent a letter to several Senators on the Tim Griffin appointment , incorrectly stating that Karl Rove did not have any role in the decision to appoint Tim Griffin as interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas .
That inaccurate letter , which the Department was subsequently forced to disavow , was drafted by Kyle Sampson and apparently approved by Christopher Oprison in the White House Counsels office , despite the fact that each had extensive knowledge of the Tim Griffin situation at the time .
Mr. Sampson had previously written that getting [ Mr. Griffin ] appointed was important to Harriet , Karl , etc . 
And just a week before he signed off on this letter , Mr. Oprison had received an email from Tim Griffin discussing the appointment controversy that also was addressed to Karl Rove , suggesting Mr. Roves awareness of the matter .
Alleged Selective Prosecution of Former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman
Concerns that politics may have played a role in the investigation and prosecution of former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman have been widely aired in the press , culminating in a petition urging the Committee to open an inquiry that was signed by 44 former state Attorneys General , both Democrats and Republicans , and received by the Committee in July 2007 .
Republican former Attorney General of Arizona Grant Woods recently stated that he believes Mr. Siegelman was selected for prosecution to further the political interests of the Alabama Republican party :  I personally believe that what happened here is that they targeted Don Siegelman because they could not beat him fair and square .
This was a Republican state and he was the one Democrat they could never get rid of . a. Background Don Siegelman was governor of Alabama from 1998 to 2002 , and previously had held numerous state offices .
Mr. Siegelman lost his bid for re-election in 2002 to Republican Bob Riley by just several thousand votes , and was expected to run again in 2006 .
He was at the time a major political force in Alabama and early polls indicated that he would defeat Governor Riley in a rematch .
In May 2004 , Mr. Siegelman was indicted by the U. S. Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama , Alice Martin , on charges related to alleged bid rigging in state contracts .
Those charges were dismissed before trial , however , when the prosecution could not produce evidence connecting Mr. Siegelman to the alleged misconduct .
Several months later , a new indictment based on entirely different charges was brought under seal against Mr. Siegelman by the U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Alabama , Leura Canary .
That indictment was made public in October 2005 and , after a June 2006 trial , Mr. Siegelman was acquitted of 25 of the 32 filed charges , and was convicted on 7 counts of corruption or obstruction of justice related charges .
In June 2007 , Mr. Siegelman was sentenced to 7 years , 4 months in prison ( the prosecutors had requested 30 years ) .
On March 27 , 2008 , the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals granted Mr. Siegelmans motion for release on bond pending appeal , finding that Mr. Siegelman had met his burden of showing that his appeal raises substantial questions of law or fact that might ultimately lead to reversal of the conviction .
b. Allegations Regarding Political Interference and Karl Rove
In May 2007 , a Republican attorney from Northern Alabama named Jill Simpson wrote an affidavit stating that , in November 2002 , she heard a prominent Alabama Republican operative named Bill Canary say that Karl Rove had contacted the Justice Department about bringing a prosecution of Don Siegelman .
Mr. Canary is married to the U.S. Attorney in the Middle District of Alabama , Leura Canary , and Ms. Simpson states in the affidavit that Mr. Canary also said that my girls would take care of 
Mr. Siegelman .
Ms. Simpson asked Mr. Canary who his girls  were and Mr. Canary said they were his wife and Alice Martin , the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of the state .
On September 14 , 2007 , Committee staff conducted a sworn , on - the - record interview of Ms. Simpson in which she reaffirmed the statements in her affidavit and offered additional information .
Most significantly , Ms. Simpson described a conversation in early 2005 in which Governor Rileys son Rob , a colleague and friend of Ms. Simpson , told her that his father and Mr. Canary had again spoken to Karl Rove who had in turn communicated with the head of the Departments Public Integrity Section about bringing a second indictment against Don Siegelman since the first case in Birmingham had been dismissed .
According to Ms. Simpson , Mr. Riley also told her that Mr. Rove had asked the Department to mobilize additional resources to assist in the prosecution effort .
Mr. Riley also said that the case would be in the Middle District of Alabama and would be heard by Chief Judge Mark Fuller , a judge who Mr. Riley stated could be trusted to hang Don Siegelman . 
And Mr. Riley claimed that the prosecution would try Mr. Siegelman and Mr. Scrushy together , in the hopes that Mr. Scrushys unpopularity in the state would affect the proceedings against Mr. Siegelman .
Ms. Simpsons statements have been denied by Bill Canary , Rob Riley , and the other figures involved .
Mr. Rove himself made a brief , and limited , comment on the matter in June 2007 , stating  I know nothing about any phone call ,  but not addressing the underlying allegations .
( It has never been alleged that Mr. Rove was on the phone call described by Jill Simpson ; the question is whether Mr. Rove directly or indirectly discussed the possibility of prosecuting Don Siegelman with either the Justice Department or Alabama Republicans . )
More recently , appearing on Fox News in February 2008 , Mr. Rove denied knowing Jill Simpson and challenged ancillary assertions she had made , but again did not address the main charge that he had pressed the Justice Department to prosecute Mr. Siegelman .
More recently still , Mr. Rove has elaborated by asserting to a reporter for GQ Magazine that Ms. Simpson is a complete lunatic who cannot be trusted and by presenting a statement in some form to 60 Minutes ( though it is not clear whether he spoke directly to 60 Minutes or used a spokesman as Mr. Rove does not appear on camera ) declaring that he never never talked to the Department of Justice about Mr. Siegelman .
Finally , in recent answers provided by his lawyer to questions posed by Ranking Member Smith , Mr. Rove reiterated his denials that he attempted to influence the Siegelman prosecution .
Available evidence raises questions about these denials , however .
First , Mr. Roves written answers to the questions posed by ranking Member Smith do not appear to resolve the questions about his possible role in the matter .
For example , Mr. Rove was asked if he ever communicated with any Department of Justice officials , State of Alabama officials , or any individual about the investigation or prosecution of Governor Siegelman .
He answered only that he had not communicated with  Justice Department or Alabama officials  about the matter .
The failure to address whether he communicated with any other individual suggests that Mr. Rove may have communicated with political operatives such as Bill Canary , the Governors son Rob Riley , non-Department of Justice Executive Branch officials such as his White House colleagues , or even members of the federal Judicial branch .
While other aspects of the denial appear broader on their face , such as the assertion that Mr. Rove never attempted either directly or indirectly , to influence these matters ,  it is impossible to fully evaluate Mr. Roves statement without follow up questioning that would reveal exactly what he means by terms such as influence  and these matters  or whether there are any other ambiguities or gaps in his denials .
Without such questioning the Committee cannot know , for example , whether Mr. Rove took steps related to the prosecution of Governor Siegelman that he does not believe rise to the level of influencing  the case or whether members of his staff may have taken actions regarding this matter that Mr. Rove did not specifically direct them to take .
In addition , Mr. Rove never denies having any relevant knowledge about the Siegelman prosecution ; he only denies having taken certain actions himself .
The Committees subpoena demands that he testify as to any relevant knowledge that he may possess .
As to the strong denials by Rob Riley and others that there was a phone call with Ms. Simpson on November 18 , 2002 , as she testified , Ms. Simpson provided cell phone records to the Committee that reflect an eleven minute call to Mr. Riley s number on that very morning .
Those denials thus appear to be in at least some sense inaccurate .
Further evidence on the question whether Karl Rove or other senior figures played some role in the Siegelman prosecution was revealed at a joint hearing of the Crime , Terrorism , and Homeland Securtiy Subcommittee and the Commercial and Administrative Law Subcommittee on October 23 , 2007 .
At that hearing , former U.S. Attorney Doug Jones , who represented Mr. Siegelman from 2003 until early 2006 , described a number of troubling facts regarding the Siegelman prosecution  for example , the statement by investigators that they hoped  their work would implicate the Governor and that prosecutors engaged in discussions that Mr. Jones believes were not in good faith because the prosecutors had already obtained a sealed indictment against the Governor but did not disclose that key fact .
The heart of Mr. Jones testimony , however , involved a series of events in late 2004 indicating that high - level Washington officials were driving the prosecution effort .
Mr. Jones testified that , by mid 2004 , he and his team had been told by the federal prosecutors in Alabama that most of the issues under investigation had been written off  and were not expected to lead to charges .
While certain issues required some further investigation , including the donation to the lottery fund by Mr. Scrushy , the prosecutors acknowledged there were significant gaps in the relevant evidence .
Mr. Jones testified that , based on his discussions with the prosecutors at this time , he and his colleagues felt like [ the ] case was coming to a close . 
In late fall , however , the lead Alabama prosecutor substantially changed his message , telling Mr. Jones that there had been a meeting in Washington and that the lawyers in Washington had asked him to go back and look at the case , review the case top to bottom .
After this word came down from Washington , Mr. Jones explained that the case transformed into a much more focused and aggressive effort to find charges on which to indict Mr. Siegelman :
 What we saw beginning in early 2005 was much more than simply a top to bottom review .
Instead it was as if the investigation had new life from top to bottom and beyond .
Whereas in the past it had appeared that the investigation was being driven by investigators in the [ state ]
Attorney Generals office , the FBI and the feds now seemed to be taking control and they were casting a wider net than ever before .
The charges that we were told had been written off were obviously now back on the table and for the first time it appeared that agents were not investigating any allegations of a crime , but were fishing around for anything they could find against an individual .
This testimony is especially troubling when considered in light of Ms. Simpsons testimony regarding her conversations with Rob Riley .
Ms. Simpson testified that Rob Riley told her that , in the latter part of 2004 , Karl Rove had approached the head of the Public Integrity Section of the Department about bringing another case against Mr. Siegelman and giving more resources to the prosecution .
Thus , according to the sworn testimony of two different witnesses  who did not know each other and who were not aware of the others testimony when they spoke  at the same time that Karl Rove was allegedly pressing Justice Department leadership to indict Don Siegelman , Washington officials informed the line prosecutors working the case , who had just recently expressed real doubts about bringing charges , to go back over the entire matter .
And as a result of that direction from Washington , the prosecution did in fact launch an aggressive new effort to find indictable charges against Mr. Siegelman .
Lead Siegelman prosecutor Steve Feaga has made press statements denying that he ever told Doug Jones that Washington officials had directed his team to go back over the case .
Similarly , the Acting U.S. Attorney for this matter Louis Franklin has said that Mr. Jones statements are absolutely not true .
But other evidence strongly corroborates Mr. Jones testimony on this point .
For example , an Alabama attorney named Mark White , who represented several witnesses related to the Siegelman matter and is currently President - Elect of the Alabama State Bar , has stated that , like Mr. Jones , he had been advised by the prosecution in 2004 that the investigation was coming to a conclusion and that he was later told by Mr. Feaga that Washington had asked that another look be taken at the entire investigation .
Art Leach , a former federal prosecutor and counsel to Mr. Scrushy in this matter , has informed the Committee that , in 2004 , for a variety of reasons it was my opinion that the matter was closed . 
In mid-2005 , however ,  the case came back to life .
C. Prior Efforts to Obtain Mr. Roves testimony Because Mr. Rove is an important witness who could provide information that is unavailable through any other source , Chairman Conyers sought Mr. Roves voluntary compliance with the Committees investigation .
In response , White House Counsel Fred Fielding explained that he was prepared to make Mr. Rove and other White House officials available for interviews with the House and Senate Judiciary Committees on a joint basis , but his offer was conditioned on unreasonably limiting preconditions and scope restrictions .
Mr. Fieldings offer required that the interviews be confined to  the subject of ( a ) communications between the White House and persons outside the White House concerning the request for resignations of the U.S. Attorneys in question ; and ( b ) communications between the White House and members of Congress concerning those requests . 
Questioning on internal White House discussions of any kind and by personnel at any level would not be allowed .
In addition , Mr. Fielding required that the interviews be private and conducted without the need for an oath , transcript , subsequent testimony , or the subsequent issuance of subpoenas . 
In other words , no matter what was revealed , no other testimony or documents could be requested from the White House .
Given Mr. Fieldings unreasonably restrictive offer , on March 21 , 2007 , the Commercial and Administrative Law Subcommittee authorized Chairman Conyers to issue subpoenas to Karl Rove and other White House personnel with relevant knowledge or documents .
Both before and after March 21 , letters were exchanged between the Committee and the White House to seek to resolve voluntarily the Committees requests for information from the White House , but those efforts were not successful .
Committee letters ( some of which were sent by Chairman Conyers and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Leahy ) included letters of March 9 , March 22 , March 28 , and May 21 , 2007 .
On July 26 , 2007 , Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy issued a subpoena for Mr. Rove to testify on August 2 and produce documents related to the U.S. Attorneys investigation .
Mr. Fielding sent an August 1 letter to Senators Leahy and Specter informing them that the President would invoke executive privilege to direct Mr. Rove not to produce responsive documents or testify about the firings .
In addition , the letter cited attached documents from the Department of Justice to assert that Mr. Rove was immune from compelled congressional testimony  as an immediate presidential advisor and would not even appear in response to the Senate Judiciary Committees subpoena .
On November 29 , 2007 , Senator Leahy issued a ruling that the White Houses claims of executive privilege and immunity were not legally valid .
On December 13 , 2007 , the Senate Judiciary Committee approved a contempt citation for Mr. Rove on a 12 to 7 vote , rejecting the White House positions on executive privilege and immunity .
As the Committees investigation proceeded and as additional allegations and information emerged regarding Mr. Rove , Chairman Conyers , Commercial and Administrative Law Subcommittee Chair Sánchez , and Committee members Artur Davis and Tammy Baldwin wrote directly to Mr. Rove , requesting that he voluntarily testify regarding the politicization of the Justice Department , including the termination of U.S. Attorneys , the Siegelman matter , and related issues .
On April 29 , 2008 , Robert Luskin , who represents Karl Rove , offered to make Mr. Rove available for an interview only regarding the Siegelman matter and that would be neither under oath nor transcribed .
Committee members responded on May 1 by rejecting Mr. Luskins offer on the grounds that such an informal procedure would not generate a useable record and would only confuse matters further , and in particular pointing out that artificially limiting the inquiry to the Siegelman matter would frustrate the Committees ability to get needed information on the entire subject of politicization .
On May 9 , Mr. Luskin offered that Mr. Rove respond to written questions , but again only with respect to the Siegelman prosecution .
Committee members responded in a May 14 letter rejecting that offer as obviously unacceptable both because of the subject matter limitation and because a written exchange would not allow for the give and take and follow up questioning that is crucial to getting to the truth .
In an effort to avoid the need for a subpoena , Committee members did suggest further accommodations to Mr. Rove , such as offering to provide a written initial list of questions that would be posed to him at a hearing .
But on May 21 , Mr. Luskin responded by merely restating his prior offers and declining to accept the offers accommodations .
Because of Mr. Roves refusal to testify voluntarily , Chairman Conyers on May 22 , 2008 , issued a subpoena calling for Mr. Rove to appear before the Subcommittee on July 10 .
Subsequently , Committee staff had several discussions with Mr. Luskin whereby Mr. Luskin offered to have Mr. Rove interviewed without a transcript or oath , but at least without prejudice to the Committees right to pursue its subpoena for sworn testimony .
However , Mr. Luskin again insisted that such an interview be limited only to questions concerning the Siegelman prosecution .
Chairman Conyers and Subcommittee Chair Sánchez wrote to Mr. Luskin to express their encouragement about the offer to be interviewed without prejudice , but reiterated that Mr. Rove must answer questions about the entire subject of politicization , including the U.S. Attorney firings and the Siegelman case , and was expected to appear on July 10 to do so .
On July 1 , Mr. Luskin indicated that Mr. Rove would decline to appear .
On July 3 , Chairman Conyers and Subcommittee Chair Sánchez wrote to Mr. Luskin urging Mr. Rove to reconsider his position and to appear pursuant to his legal obligations .
On July 9 , Mr. Luskin again stated that Mr. Rove would not appear and attached a July 9 letter from White House Counsel Fred Fielding , and two Office of Legal Counsel letters - one regarding Mr. Rove dated August 1 , 2007 , and another regarding Ms. Miers dated July 10 , 2007 .
No more recent DOJ analysis of Mr. Roves right to ignore the Committee subpoena was offered .
Mr. Fielding asserted that Mr. Rove had constitutional immunity . . . because Mr. Rove was an immediate presidential adviser and because the Committee seeks to question him regarding matters that arose during his tenure and relate to his official duties in that capacity .
Mr. Fielding did not explain what aspects of the U.S. Attorney firings or the Siegelman prosecution relate to Mr. Roves official duties as a White House aide .
On July 10 , 2008 , the Commercial and Administrative Law Subcommittee met as scheduled but Mr. Rove failed to appear .
Ms. Sánchez ruled that Mr. Roves claims of Executive Privilege - based immunity from Congressional subpoena were not valid .
That ruling was upheld by a 7 - 1 vote of the Subcommittee .
A copy of the ruling was mailed to Mr. Roves attorney on July 10 , along with a warning about the possibility of contempt and a request for a response by July 16 , 2008 , as to whether Mr. Rove would comply with the subpoena .
No response was received until July 29 , 2008 , when Mr. Roves attorney again indicated that Mr. Rove would not comply with the subpoena but urged the Committee not to recommend contempt against Mr. Rove .
D. Testimony From Mr. Rove Is Essential For the Committee to Conduct Meaningful Oversight and to Consider Possible Legislation
The Committee clearly has authority under the Constitution , as reflected in Supreme Court decisions and Rules of the House of Representatives , to investigate and expose possible violations of law and abuses of executive power .
As the Supreme Court ruled in the Watkins case fifty years ago , Congress has broad power to investigate  the administration of existing laws  and to expose corruption , inefficiency or waste ,  or similar problems in the Executive Branch .
The Committee also needs more complete information on the issue of the politicization of the Department of Justice to consider whether to modify or enact federal laws and to obtain support for any such necessary legislation within the Congress , the Executive , and the public at large .
This is a well - recognized basis for authorizing Congress to conduct investigations and obtain executive branch information , as the Supreme Court stated in McGrain v. Daugherty .
E. Mr. Roves Claim of Executive Privilege Based Immunity From Subpoena
Is Not Legally Valid According to the letters received from Mr. Roves counsel , particularly his letters of July 1 and July 9 , 2008 , Mr. Roves refusal to appear and testify before the Subcommittee on July 10 as required by subpoena was based on claims that  Executive Privilege confers upon him immunity  from even appearing to testify , and that as a [ former ] close advisor to the President , whose testimony is sought in connection with his official duties in that capacity , he is immune from compelled Congressional testimony . 
These claim were rejected by Subcommittee Chair Sánchez in a ruling that was upheld by a 7 - 1 vote of the Subcommittee on July 10 , 2008 .
For several reasons , as explained in Chair Sánchez ruling and below , those claims are legally invalid .
First , the claims were not properly asserted .
The Subcommittee did not receive a written statement directly from the President , let alone anyone at the White House on the Presidents behalf , asserting Executive Privilege , or claiming that Mr. Rove is immune in this instance from testifying before us .
Nor did any member of the White House attend the July 10 , 2008 , hearing to raise those claims on behalf of the President .
The most recent letter from Mr. Roves lawyer simply relies on a July 9 , 2008 , letter to him from the current White House counsel directing that Mr. Rove should disobey the subpoena and refuse to appear at the Subcommittee hearing .
The July 9 , 2008 , letter from White House Counsel Fred Fielding claims that Mr. Rove is constitutionally immune from compelled congressional testimony about matters that arose during his or her tenure as a presidential aide and that relate to his or her official duties .
As discussed in greater detail below , no general freestanding immunity exists for former presidential advisers and thus the proper course is to recognize claims of privilege only when properly asserted in response to specific questions during a particular hearing .
The courts have stated that a personal assertion of Executive Privilege by the President is legally required for the privilege claim to be valid .
For instance , the District Court of the District of Columbia made clear in the Shultz case that even a statement from a White House counsel that he is authorized to invoke executive privilege is wholly insufficient to activate a formal claim of executive privilege ,  and that such a claim must be made by the  President , as head of the agency ,  the White House . 
It should also be noted that even a formal claim of privilege , by itself , is not enough to prevent a private party from complying with a Congressional subpoena .
In cases where a Congressional committee rules that asserted claims of Executive Privilege are invalid , the Executive Branchs only recourse beyond further negotiation is to seek a court order to prevent the private party from testifying ( or producing documents ) .
This is because neither the Constitution nor any federal statute confers authority upon the President to order private citizens not to comply with Congressional subpoenas .
The Executive Branch recognized this in United States v. AT&T , where the Ford Administration sued to enjoin AT&T , a private party , from complying with a subpoena from a House committee .
AT&T recognized that despite the White Houses adamant requests that it not comply with its subpoena , it nevertheless was obligated to disregard those instructions and to comply with the subpoena .
The President had no freestanding authority to prevent AT&T from complying .
The same is true here .
Second , there is no proper legal basis for Mr. Roves refusal even to appear before the Subcommittee as required by subpoena .
No court has ever held that presidential advisers are immune from compulsory process  in any setting .
In fact , the Supreme Court has expressly recognized that presidential advisers , and even members of the Presidents cabinet , do not enjoy the same protections as the President himself .
Moreover , since 1974 , when the Supreme Court rejected President Nixons claim of absolute presidential privilege in United States v. Nixon , it has been clear that Executive Privilege is merely qualified , and not absolute .
Neither Mr. Roves lawyer nor Mr. Fielding nor the Office of Legal Counsel ( OLC ) at the Justice Department has cited a single court decision to undermine these well - settled principles .
Therefore , the proper course of action for Mr. Rove is to attend the hearing pursuant to subpoena , at which time he may , if expressly authorized by the President , assert Executive Privilege in response to specific questions posed by the Subcommittee .
Assuming that Mr. Fieldings July 9 , 2008 letter to Mr. Luskin  and its attached materials from the Justice Departments OLC  sets out the case for Mr. Roves claim for immunity before this Subcommittee , the arguments presented therein are wholly without merit .
Most notably , both the letter and its accompanying materials from OLC fail to cite a single court decision nor could they , in support of Mr. Roves contention that a former White House employee or other witness under federal subpoena may simply refuse to show up to a congressional hearing .
To the contrary , the courts have made clear that no present or former government official is so above the law that he or she may completely disregard a legal directive such as the Committees subpoena .
As the Supreme Court explained more than a century ago ,  [ n ] o man in this country is so high that he is above the law ,  and  [ a ]ll the officers of the government , from the highest to the lowest , are creatures of the law and are bound to obey it .
Even beyond the case law , the reasoning utilized in the OLC materials , authored by Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Steven G. Bradbury , has no application to former presidential advisers .
Each of the prior OLC opinions on which Mr. Bradbury relies , including the 1999 Opinion issued by Attorney General Janet Reno , covers only current White House advisers , not former advisers like Mr. Rove .
This distinction is crucial , as all of the arguments purportedly supporting absolute immunity for current presidential advisers simply do not apply to former advisers .
For example , the primary OLC memorandum from which all subsequent adviser - immunity opinions have been derived , authored by Chief Justice and then - OLC head William H. Rehnquist , reaches only the tentative and sketchy  conclusion that current advisers are absolutely immune from testimonial compulsion by congressional committee [s ]  because they must be presumptively available to the President 24 hours a day , and the necessity of [ appearing before Congress or a court ] could impair that ability .
The same rationale on its face does not apply to former advisers , and thus there is no support for Mr. Bradburys claim that former advisers are immune from Congressional process .
And even Mr. Rehnquist himself acknowledged that when White House advisers wish to assert executive privilege , they must first appear before Congress and then assert the privilege .
The 1999 Reno Opinion also reflects doubt about the matter , expressly noting that a court might not agree with the arguments for immunity and suggesting that the matter might in fact be resolved through some sort of balancing .
Those doubts are most obviously demonstrated by the fact that , in the end , the Clinton White House did not stand upon the immunity argument made in this opinion but instead , on several occasions , allowed its current and former White House Counsel to testify .
Moreover , the fact that OLC has opined that former advisers are absolutely immune from testimonial compulsion by Congress , is not entitled to any deference .
Such an opinion , unlike that issued by a court , is not an authoritative formulation of the law .
Rather , it is only the Executive Branchs view of the law , and is entitled only to the weight that its inherent merit warrants .
In this instance , it is clear that Mr. Bradbury s memorandum was ill - conceived and its conclusions were properly rejected by the Subcommittee .
The White Houses argument in favor of absolute immunity for Mr. Rove on these matters is remarkable for an additional reason .
According to Mr. Fieldings July 9 , 2008 , letter , the White House believes that the matters covered by the subpoena relate to Mr. Roves official duties .
If that assertion is to be credited , then apparently this Administration believes that Mr. Roves official duties included the alleged pressuring of the Justice Department to criminally prosecute a political opponent of the Presidents party and also included ensuring the political loyalty of the U.S. Attorney corps and forcing politically unhelpful U.S. Attorneys to resign .
While it is true that Mr. Rove denies at least some of these allegations , the White House claim that these alleged actions would fall within his official duties  is disturbing .
On the other hand , if the White House does not believe that such interference in the Department of Justices prosecution function was an official duty of Mr. Rove , then either the claim of immunity fails on the Administrations own terms ( because they claim the immunity applies only where official duties are involved ) or they are actually asserting a total immunity from compelled testimony for Presidential aides on any subject and regardless of any nexus to the individuals White House responsibilities .
That form of immunity , of course , would be even greater than that held by the President , as the Clinton v. Jones case makes clear , and should be rejected as legally unsupportable .
Third , the claims of absolute immunity directly contradict the conduct of this and past Administrations with respect to White House officials appearing before Congress .
Only recently , current Vice - Presidential chief of staff David Addington appeared and testified before the House Judiciary Committee pursuant to subpoena , and former White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan appeared and testified without even receiving a subpoena .
In 2007 , former White House officials Sara Taylor and Scott Jennings testified concerning the U.S. Attorney firings before the Senate Judiciary Committee pursuant to subpoena .
Prior to this Administration , both present and former White House officials have testified before Congress numerous times ; a Congressional Research Service study documents some 74 instances where White House advisers have testified before Congress since World War II , many of them pursuant to a subpoena .
This White Houses asserted right to secrecy goes beyond even the claims of Richard Nixon , who initially refused to allow his White House Counsel , John Dean , to testify before Congress , on almost exactly the same grounds being asserted now , but then agreed that Mr. Dean and other White House officials could testify .
Fourth , the claims of absolute immunity and the refusal to appear pursuant to subpoena and to answer questions from the Subcommittee directly contradict the behavior of Mr. Rove and his attorney themselves .
When Mr. Roves attorney was asked earlier this year by a media representative whether Mr. Rove would testify before Congress in response to a subpoena on the Siegelman matter , he responded sure by e-mail .
In addition , unlike Harriet Miers , Mr. Rove has spoken extensively in the media on the very subject the Subcommittee seeks to question him about : allegations regarding his role in the alleged politicization of the Justice Department during this Administration , including the prosecution of prominent Democrats like former Governor Don Siegelman and the unprecedented forced resignations of nine U.S. Attorneys in 2006 .
In addition , if Mr. Rove and his attorney are willing to submit written answers to questions , as they have when asked by Representative Smith , Mr. Rove should also be willing to answer oral questions with a transcript .
It is inappropriate for former White House personnel to speak publicly about matters and answer written questions as they choose but then to refuse to testify before Congress under oath and subject to cross-examination on the very same matters , relying on claims of alleged confidentiality .
Fifth , and finally , especially to the extent that Executive Privilege is the basis for the claim of immunity as to Mr. Rove , the White House has failed to demonstrate that the information the Committee seeks from him under the subpoena is covered by that privilege .
There is no expectation that Mr. Rove would reveal any communications to or from the President himself , which is at the heart of the presidential communications privilege .
In fact , on June 28 , 2007 , a senior White House official at an authorized background briefing specifically stated that the President had no personal involvement in receiving advice about the forced resignations of the U.S. Attorneys or in approving or adjusting the list containing their names .
The Committee seeks information from Mr. Rove about his own communications and his own involvement in the process of the forced resignations of U.S. Attorneys and related aspects of the politicization of the Justice Department .
Mr. Rove nevertheless apparently claims that Executive Privilege applies or confers immunity upon him , asserting that the privilege also covers testimony by White House staff who advise the President , apparently based on the Espy decision .
The Espy court , however , made clear that while the presidential communications privilege may cover communications made by presidential advisers ,  such communications are only within the realm of Executive Privilege when they are undertaken in the course of preparing advice for the President . 
But the White House has maintained that the President never received any advice on , and was not himself involved in , the forced resignations of the U.S. Attorneys .
And there has been no suggestion that the President was personally involved in the Siegelman matter .
Thus , the presidential communications privilege would not seem to apply here .
Moreover , whether such communications would even fall under the presidential communications privilege in the context of a Congressional inquiry is far from certain .
The Supreme Court in Nixon and the Court of Appeals in Espy both expressly noted that different balancing considerations would apply when the communications at issue were sought by Congress on behalf of the American people .
It seems odd that these courts would rule that a congressional investigation , authorized under the Constitution , carries less weight than a civil or criminal trial .
More appropriately , such an investigation should be entitled to the greatest deference by the courts , as Congress is tasked specifically with overseeing and legislating on matters concerning the workings of the Executive Branch , and specifically the Justice Department .
For all the foregoing reasons , Mr. Roves claims of immunity are not legally valid and his refusal to comply with the subpoena and appear at this hearing to answer questions cannot be properly justified .
F. Conclusion
The Committee should approve the Report on the refusal of Karl Rove to comply with a subpoena by the House Judiciary Committee , which includes a resolution to be recommended to the House of Representatives providing that Mr. Rove be cited for contempt of Congress and that the House pursue other legal remedies to enforce the outstanding subpoena as appropriate .
With wire reports
The picture was printed alongside an interview with the photographer A tabloid newspaper was withdrawn from newsstands in China after running a photograph from the 1989 crackdown on Tiananmen Square protesters .
The photo - of two wounded young men being taken away on a rickshaw - was carried in Thursday 's Beijing News .
The picture was simply captioned " The Wounded " , and no mention of the protests was made in the text .
But observers suggest newspaper staff could face further punishment for broaching what remains a taboo subject .
China 's ruling Communist Party initially tolerated the student - led pro-democracy protests , but finally sent in soldiers to put them down on the night of 3 - 4 June 1989 .
Hundreds of people are thought to have been killed , though there has been no public disclosure of the death toll or investigation into what happened .
Repercussions
The photograph was printed alongside an interview with the Hong Kong - born American photographer Liu Xiangcheng as an example of his work .
As soon as Chinese officials noticed , they ordered the removal of the paper from the news - stands and part of its website was blocked .
The newspaper has made no comment on how the picture came to be published .
However , given China 's tight controls on what is written about politically sensitive subjects , it seems most likely to have been a mistake by staff who did not realise the significance of the photo , rather than a deliberate act , says the BBC's East Asia reporter Stephen Jackson .
Either way , there are likely to be repercussions for senior staff at the paper , he adds .
Last year the authorities sacked three editors on a provincial newspaper for printing an advert praising the mothers of the Tiananmen victims for their campaign for justice .

What are these ?
These are n’t the guns you ’re used to seeing in movies .
The Punt Gun and Gustav Gun are some of the largest you ’ll ever see .
Continue reading for more .
Click here for first picture in gallery .
Punt Gun
The world ’s largest shotgun aka Punt Gun measures 10 - feet long and has a 2 - inch barrel .
Due to its size and recoil , this gun has to be mounted directly on the punts .
Just a single blast could wipe out 50 - 100 ducks resting on the water ’s surface .
Gustav Gun
The “ Gustav Gun ” was built by Germany - based Friedrich Krupp , A.G. in 1941 .
It weighed a massive 1344 tons and required a 500 man crew to operate .
During its operational period , the gun fired approximately 367 shells , with very few hitting their desired targets — mainly because shells required a 400 - pound powder charge , causing violent shocks .

Impossible Dinosaurs
The giant dinosaurs are fascinating .
How did they get so big ?
Why are there none alive today ?
Their size rivals that of modern whales , which cannot survive without the buoyancy of water .
So early paleontologists postulated that the biggest dinosaurs must have spent most of their lives wading in the shallow seas of the Mesozoic Era .
Then dinosaur footprints were discovered .
Not just a few , but thousands of footprints .
Somehow , even the largest of dinosaurs were walking around on land , not even dragging their enormous tails behind them .
So wading in shallow seas was replaced by grazing in herds and the original reason for the wading -- that a dinosaur on land would have been a beached whale -- was forgotten .
Catastrophist Ted Holden has resurrected the controversy by examining the relationship of size , weight , and strength in animals .
( His analysis was the basis for a documentary televised in Japan in Feb , 2004 .
See photo above . )
The strength of muscle tissue is fairly constant among all species .
Strength is proportional to the cross section of the muscle :
If one muscle is two times the diameter of another , the first will be four times ( the square of two ) as strong .
But weight increases with the volume : A muscle that 's twice as big will weigh eight times ( the cube of two ) as much .
Holden computed the weight / strength ratio of a well - trained human weightlifter and scaled it up to the size of a dinosaur .
The weightlifter soon became too big to lift his own weight .
Strength , in its relationship with weight , imposes a limit on size .
Holden 's calculations indicate that the heaviest elephants of today approach that limit .
The largest dinosaurs are many times the size of an elephant .
And dinosaur skeletons are n't as well - designed for bearing weight as elephant skeletons .
Dinosaurs are impossibly large for planet Earth , but their bones are proof that they must have existed .
How could that be ?
The limit on size depends on weight , and weight depends on the force of gravity .
Most conventional theories assume that gravity throughout the universe has always been and will always be a constant property of matter .
But that 's only an assumption , and it must be verified empirically .
The Electric Universe offers a different point of view .
Gravity is not a constant .
It 's a variable that depends on the plasma environment .
So Earth in the Mesozoic Era may have had less gravity than it has today .
Holden calculates that in order for the largest dinosaurs to function , gravity must have been at least 1/3 ( and possibly as low as 1/4 ) what it is today .
He also postulates that gravity increased suddenly at the close of the age of dinosaurs but not to the present value .
Lower - than - present gravity continued into the following ages of giant mammals and possibly even to the days when early humans were building giant monuments like Stonehenge .
Linux overcame most of its former driver woes years ago except for one noticeable exception : Wi -Fi drivers .
While many Wi-Fi cards and chipsets were Linux friendly , two major Wi-Fi chipset vendors , Atheros and Broadcom , kept their drivers proprietary .
Now , things are changing .
Atheros has released a true open - source driver for its latest 802.11n chipsets .
Madwifi.org , an open - source developer group that has long worked on open - source drivers for Atheros WI - Ffi chipsets , announced that Atheros released the new driver , ath9 k , underneath the liberal ISC license .
Moreover , according to the Madwifi programmers , “ This driver is aimed at inclusion to the Linux kernel and supports all Atheros IEEE 802.11n devices .
This represents a major shift in terms of support from Atheros with respect to Linux . ”
While Atheros had long offered some support for Linux , it has always insisted on keeping its HAL ( Hardware Abstraction Layer ) code proprietary .
Last year , an open - source alternative , OpenHAL , became available , but it was n’t completely compatible with the newer chipsets .
This change by Atheros is n’t too much of a surprise because the company just hired two of Madwifi ’s top developers : Luis Rodriguez and Jouni Malinen .
According to Madwifi , Atheros also plans to add Linux access point support to ath9 k with the aid of its two new open - source engineers .
There are many Wi-Fi devices already on the market using the ath9k - supported chipsets .
These include Belkin ’s N1 Wireless Notebook Card ; D - Link ’s RangerBooster N and Extreme N lines ; Linksys ’ WPC and WMP N lines ; NEC ’s WL300NC ; and Netgear ’s WNHDE111 Video Bridge and WN711 .

During their segment , they Below is a screenshot of Fox & Friends featuring the photo it used of Steinberg , with the original photo on its left .
Comparing the two photos , it appears that the following changes have been made : Steinberg 's teeth have been yellowed , his nose and chin widened , and his ears made to protrude further .
Similarly , a comparison of the photo of Reddicliffe used by Fox News and the original photo suggests that Reddicliffe 's teeth have been yellowed , dark circles have been added under his eyes , and his hairline has been moved back .
Now , my opinion of Fox News is not very high .
But even I did n't think they 'd stoop to the photoshop equivalent of drawing little mustaches on their perceived enemies .
Is it a coincidence , as jgische
Oh , and they did n't even do it well .
Check out the modified hairline on Reddicliffe , with the blurry top of his forehead , as if the top of his head just is n't in focus .
C'mon , guys , I suck at photoshop and even I could do better than that .

Check out the modified hairline on Reddicliffe , with the blurry top of his forehead , as if the top of his head just is n't in focus .
C'mon , guys , I suck at photoshop and even I could do better than that .

What is Sudoku ?
Have you ever played Sudoku ?
A few months ago my dad raved about a new game in the newspaper that he liked solving better than the daily crossword , and so I picked up one of the five hundred or so Sudoku books at the bookstore .
I was quickly hooked .
The rules of Sudoku are simple : finish filling in the squares of a 9x9 grid so that the digits 1 - 9 appear exactly once in each of the nine rows , columns , and 3x3 blocks .
Puzzles are designed so that there is only one correct way to fill in the 81 squares , and they tend to be just hard enough to be satisfying : not too easy , not impossible .
Ways to Play
Sudoku is a good solo game ; if you are having trouble getting into it , you can read about various solution strategies on the web .
But , like crosswords , it can be even more fun to work Sudoku puzzles together with somebody else .
Heidi and I sometimes race each other on adjacent puzzles in a Sudoku book - it can be nerve - wracking to try to catch up when you 're behind , while the other person is rapidly filling in squares .
Either player always has a chance to win a race , because backtracking in Sudoku is hard .
You can be dealt a blow at the finish line when you encounter a contradiction and then realize you made a mistake long ago .
( The best strategy in Sudoku is not to guess , yet it 's still good to play with an erasable pencil . )
It can also be fun to cooperate on a Sudoku puzzle - the entertainment there is to be stymied together , and then question the other person 's clever move to get out of a logjam .
There are many Sudoku variants , for example versions of the game where the 9 - square blocks come in different shapes , or smaller versions of the game that are designed for children .
I realized Sudoku was a major phenomenon when I saw the Dora Sudoku books for preschoolers .
Since they are for the preliterate set , you fill in simplified 4x4 puzzles using stickers instead of letters or numbers .
The amazing thing is that my pre-K daughter Piper was completely enthralled by the books .
We brought a Dora Sudoku book on our trip to Taiwan , and solving Sudokus became the most reliably fun activity for Piper whenever she was waiting around , remarkably beating out her Nintendo DS .
I guess it 's no wonder that they recently came out with Sudoku for the Nintendo DS too .
Counting Sudoku Boards
But if you read the advertisements for Sudoku Gridmaster for DS , you will notice that it is said to come with " over 400 " Sudoku puzzles .
With crosswords , I can understand why your software might have only a few hundred puzzles , since each hint needs to be done by a human editor .
But with Sudokus , I wonder why they do n't just let the software generate millions of puzzles ?
Imagine how many millions of puzzles " included " they could claim .
Solved Sudokus are a special kind of Latin square , which were studied by Euler .
Euler discovered that there did not seem to be very many Latin squares of a certain type , and in 1782 he proposed that the 36 Officers Problem had no solution for 6x6 , 10x10 , 14x14 squares , and so on .
His conjecture stood until the 20th century .
But in 1959 , a set of 10x10 " Euler 's Spoiler " squares were discovered by Parker , Bose , and Shrikhande ( in work popularized by Martin Gardner ) disproving Euler 's famous conjecture .
Mathematicians continue to play with and theorize about Latin squares today .
How many different ways are there to completely fill in the 81 squares of a Sudoku board ?
In May 2005 , Felgenhauer and Jarvis counted the Sudoku boards carefully and concluded that there are exactly 6,670,903,752,021,072,936,960 solved boards .
These thousands of billions of billions are so large that there would really be no hope of using a supercomputer to enumerate all the boards : the only way to count them all is to understand the symmetries of the game .
If you have one solved board , you can get another equivalent one by relabeling digits , swapping rows within a 3 - row - band , swapping bands , swapping columns within a 3 - column - stack , swapping stacks , or by rotating the whole board .
How many " really different " boards are there which cannot be created from each other by just swapping things around this way ?
Jarvis and Russell concluded that the kernel of really distinct boards is still pretty large , numbering 5,472,730,538 .
Yet this number is small enough for a computer , and it is possible ( although tricky ) to write a program to enumerate all these boards quickly .
Counting Sudoku Hints
For puzzlers , a solved board is not as interesting as an unsolved one !
And among unsolved puzzles , the interesting ones are the minimal ones : the puzzles which uniquely determine a single solution , and for which you cannot erase any hint without permitting extra solutions .
How many minimal Sudoku puzzles are there ?
Certainly the number must be far more than the number of solved Sudoku boards , but the total count is unknown .
In fact , it is not even known for sure how small a minimal puzzle can be !
My simple program for generating minimal puzzles typically generates Sudoku puzzles with 24 or more hints .
I have never seen it generate a puzzle with fewer than 22 hints .
But there are some puzzles that are much smaller .
Gordon Royle mainains a list of ( currently ) 36628 nontrivially distinct and fully constrained Sudoku puzzles with 17 hints .
Some mathematicians suspect that the smallest number of hints you can give in a Sudoku puzzle that uniquely determines a fully solved board is 17 , because concerted searches for a fully constrained puzzle with only 16 hints have come up dry .
In fact , it is hard to find 17 - hint puzzles too , and Gordon 's list of 17 - hint puzzles might be nearly complete .
If this could be proved , it would also prove that there are no 16 - hint puzzles .
So if you find a 17 - hint puzzle , you should check to see if Gordon already has it .
And remember that there is no proof that fully determined 16 - hint puzzles do n't exist .
If you get a 16 - hint puzzle out of the automatic puzzle generator , do n't throw it out .
It would be publication - worthy .
Sudoku Generation Algorithm
How can you generate Sudoku puzzles ?
I do not know what the ' best ' algorithm is , but here is what I have done in my simple little python program .
First , we need a Sudoku solver .
My solver uses three simple strategies to solve a board ; they are simple to implement and seem fast enough .
If only one number fits in a square without row , column , and box conflicts , we fill it in .
If a number needed by a row , column , or box can only go in one square in that row , column , or box , we fill it in .
If we can't fill in anything using rules 1 or 2 , then we find a most - constrained place or number where we can guess ( for example , two choices is better than three ) , and we try all the guesses .
The last bit about trying all the guesses will require some backtracking .
When we are selecting a place to guess , we choose one randomly among the most - constrained places , and we shuffle the choices to try them in a random order .
The result is if we tell the solver to solve an empty board , we get a nice random fully - solved Sudoku board .
To generate Sudoku puzzles , we start with a solved board , and we choose some minimal hints to reveal as follows .
Going through the squares in shuffled order , reveal each square only if it is not deduced by the other revealed squares ( using the solver without guessing ) .
This produces a list of about 30 to 40 hints which together dermine the 81 squares of the board .
Going through the chosen hints in shuffled order , attempt dropping each one , and fully solve the board far enough to find two solutions if there are two .
Replace the hint unless the solution is still unique with the hint removed .
Notice that generating a minimal puzzle this way requires us to do the work of solving a Sudoku board about twenty times , so it takes a lot more work to generate a minimal Sudoku puzzle than it does to solve one .
If there are ways of generating Sudoku puzzles more quickly , I 'd love to know .
Rating Puzzles
Any Sudoku fan will tell you that there are hard puzzles and easy puzzles .
The newspapers like to save the really diabolical ones for the Friday edition , so you can stew over them all weekend .
The hardest puzzles require you to look several moves ahead , or make lots of good guesses to find a solution .
Unfortunately , the algorithm here does not always create hard puzzles - I do n't know how to create a more difficult puzzle on purpose .
So in the links below , you may get a hard or an easy puzzle , randomly .
The best we can do is tell you what kind of puzzle you 've got .
The ratings that go along with the puzzles estimate the amount of guessing ( or thinking ahead more than one move ) that you might need to do to solve a puzzle .
This is done by counting the depth of the search stack when the computer finds a solution .
Since , depending on order of the guesses , the search might be deeper or shallower , we try a few different paths and average the search depth to get the rating .
A rating of zero means that you can completely solve the puzzle without any looking ahead or guessing .
Ratings of three or more tend to be pretty hard .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - California on Thursday took a major step forward on its global warming fight by unveiling an ambitious plan for clean cars , renewable energy and stringent caps on big polluting industries .
The plan , which aims to reduce pollutants by 10 percent from current levels by 2020 while driving investment in energy technologies regulators said will benefit the state ’s economy , is the most comprehensive yet by any U.S. state .
It could serve as a blueprint not only for the rest of the United States , but also for other big polluting nations like China and India , planners and environmental groups said .
“ This is of tremendous importance , not only for California , ” Mary Nichols , chairman of the influential California Air Resources Board ( CARB ) , said on a conference call with reporters on Wednesday .
“ By taking action here ... we will be able to help motivate other states in our nation . ”
Skeptics , however , said the plan would be costly to implement and only inflate energy prices further .
“ California has always paid more for power and gasoline because they ’ve wanted cleaner fuels .
It ’s certainly something they are used to , ” said Frank Maisano , a spokesman at energy company advocate Bracewell and Giuliani .
“ But the larger question is , ‘ Does the rest of the country want to take its cues from California ’s energy policy ? ’
The simple answer in these days of higher energy costs is pretty much ‘ no ’ . ”
At a meeting in Sacramento on Thursday , CARB staff presented a series of proposals that would become law in 2012 , with some measures going into effect two years earlier .
The initiatives include implementing a cap - and - trade program on carbon dioxide emissions that will require buildings and appliances to use less energy , oil companies to make cleaner fuels and utilities to provide a third of their energy from renewable sources like wind and solar power .
The program will also encourage development of walkable cities with shorter commutes , high - speed rail as an alternative to air travel and require more hybrid and hydrogen - fueled vehicles to transport both goods and people , CARB said .
WHAT WILL IT COST ?
California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , whose landmark 2006 law aimed at reducing the state ’s greenhouse gas emissions prompted CARB ’s plan , supports the program , Nichols said .
CARB said the measures will benefit residents of the most populous U.S. state by reducing pollution - related illnesses including as asthma and bronchitis and stimulating investment in new energy technologies that will create jobs .
But not everyone was as confident .
California Assemblyman Chuck DeVore said the high price of renewable energy sources would pressure Californians ’ wallets and drive manufacturing industries out of the state .
“ All the studies suggest that nuclear has the lowest emissions , and you also get energy that would be affordable to working class Californians , ” he said .
Nichols declined to speculate on what the program will cost for individual business sectors such as the utility industry , but said the initiatives overall should benefit the state ’s economy by about 1 percent starting in 2020 .

“ I just do n’t accept the premise that this is going to be more expensive , ” Nichols said at a press briefing on Thursday .
“ There is a fear factor about change . ”
CARB estimated that more efficient appliances and homes would save households , on average , about $ 200 a year .
Meanwhile cleaner cars , while more expensive to buy , are expected to save drivers about $ 30 a month in fuel .
Environmental advocates , most of whom work closely with CARB , applauded the plan .
Erin Rogers , a California coordinator for environmental group the Union of Concerned Scientists , called the program “ ambitious , visionary and far - reaching . ”
California has long been a leader in the United States on matters of climate change , and CARB said the state ’s emissions will be about 30 percent below what they would have been without the plan .

At a Tuesday White House press conference that focused mostly on the current economic downturn , President Bush indicated that he has no intention of calling on Americans to conserve gasoline , according to a report at Politico .
President Bush said , “ They ’re smart enough to figure out whether they ’re going to drive less or not …the consumer ’s plenty bright . ”
The President explained the justification for his position by saying , “ It ’s a little presumptuous on my part to dictate how consumers live their own lives . ”
But past examples show that President Bush has had no problem dictating how “ consumers live their own lives , ” at least when it syncs with his own political agenda .
Surely you remember December of 2006 , when teetering on the brink of a national economic recession , the President implored Americans to shop more :
“ As we work with Congress in the coming year to chart a new course in Iraq and strengthen our military to meet the challenges of the 21st century , we must also work together to achieve important goals for the American people here at home .
This work begins with keeping our economy growing .
…
And I encourage you all to go shopping more . ”
Of course , there was also the notorious Bush call to go shopping in the time after the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , when President Bush insisted :
“ Americans must get back to work , to go shopping , going to the theatre [ sic ] , to help get the country back on a sounder financial footing . ”
I am not arguing that it is necessarily the President ’s job to recommend that consumers drive less , nor urge us to find other ways to conserve gasoline ( though that would be nice ) .
I am not looking for my government to become a so - called “ nanny state ” that micromanages all the details of my daily economic life .
I am arguing that the President of the United States is supposed to be a leader – sort of a ‘ first citizen , ’ if you will – that has the ability to send signals ( both subtle and overt ) that can have an appreciable impact on what we do and how we do it .
Even a Lame Duck President with a 28 percent public approval rating has the ability to influence someone , right ?
Yes , the American people are smart , but economically determined aggregations of individual rational choices do not always work out to be the “ best ” ones at the collective level .
The problem is that President Bush cannot reconcile our need to cut carbon emissions with his belief that we cannot do so without “ crippling the economy . ”
And remember we are talking about a ( former ) Texas oilman .
Perhaps President Bush ’s affinity for “ product , ” as he sometimes refers to it , creates an internal conflict that prevents him from suggesting that we somehow use less of it , when all he wants to do is drill for more of it .
The fact that Mr. Bush ca n’t recognize Americans may need some political leadership to help stabilize energy consumption and rein - in carbon emissions has stood in the way of any substantive action on climate change in the seven and a half years President Bush ’s tenure .

In his first interview since it emerged that Josef Fritzl imprisoned his daughter Elisabeth in a cellar beneath his home in August 1984 and forced to her to suffer a nightmare of incest , multiple rape and untreated births that lasted 24 years , the 73 - year - old explained from his prison cell that , after the kidnapping , he saw no way out because he had become caught up in a " vicious circle " from which he could not escape .
He confessed to the lies he told police to keep his daughter hidden and spoke of the fears he had about being arrested , and of the hundreds of kilometres he drove each week to buy food for his cellar family to avoid detection .
But he also revealed the grim details of the life his daughter and three of their children – now aged five , 18 and 19 – were forced to endure in a windowless cellar without daylight or proper medical attention for so long .
He recalled how his daughter , now 42 , coped with losing all her teeth after more than two decades without dental care .

" I grew up in Nazi times and that meant respect for authority and the need to control .
I suppose I took on some of these old values , " Fritzl said in the interview , published in the Austrian media .
He recalled being brought up by his mother in a tiny flat .
She had kicked his father out because he was a " waster " .
" I was totally in awe of her .
Completely and totally in awe , " he insisted .
Rudolf Mayer , Fritzl 's lawyer , who has defended neo - Nazis during his career , conducted the interview which he said his client had given to counter what Fritzl had called the media 's one - sided portrayal of him as a " monster " .
He believes Fritzl should be committed to a closed psychiatric unit for his crimes and not go to prison .
Fritzl was arrested 10 days ago and confessed to keeping his daughter incarcerated in a windowless cellar bunker beneath his home in the Austrian provincial town of Amstetten for 24 years .
In his interview , Fritzl denied allegations that he had threatened to gas his cellar family if they tried to escape , but he added : " I am sorry to say that I told them they would never get past the door because they would be electrocuted and die if they tried . "
Elisabeth Fritzl is reported to have told police her father began sexually abusing her at an early age and that she was raped for the first time at 11 .
However , Fritzl claimed in his interview yesterday : " That is not true .
I am not a man who has sex with little children .
I only had sex with her much later , when she had been in the cellar for a long time . "
He insisted his initial aim had been to " rescue " his daughter .
" Ever since she started puberty , Elisabeth stopped doing what she was told , she just did not obey my rules any more .
She would spend all night in bars and come back stinking of alcohol and smoke , " he said .
" I tried to rescue her from this swamp .
I organised her a job as a waitress , but sometimes there were days when she would not go to work . "
Fritzl said his daughter had tried to run away from home twice and hung around with " persons of questionable moral standards " .
He insisted : " That is why I had to arrange a place where I gave her the chance – by force – to keep away from the bad influences outside . "

The former electrical engineer , who was convicted of rape in the 1960s , incarcerated his daughter on 28 August , 1984 .
Her underground ordeal was to last 8,516 days .
" I guess it must have been around 1981 or 1982 when I began to build a room in my cellar as the cell for her , " he said yesterday , adding that he equipped it with a heavy concrete and steel , electrically operated door with a remote - control combination lock .
" I then plastered the walls , added a washbasin and a small toilet , a bed and an electric ring , a fridge , electricity and lights , " he said .
Fritzl said his desire to have sex with his daughter increased to a point where he was no longer able to control himself .
He claimed that he raped her for the first time some eight months after her incarceration but denied that he had ever handcuffed her or tied her to a leash as has been reported .
" This was unnecessary .
My daughter had no chance of escape anyway , " he said .
" At some stage at some time in the night , I went into the cellar and laid her on the bed and had sex with her .
I knew that Elisabeth did n't want what I did with her but the pressure to do the forbidden thing was just too big to withstand .
It was an obsession with me . "
Fritzl admitted forcing his daughter to write letters to his wife Rosemarie which pretended that she had run away to join a religious sect .
" With every week that I kept my daughter prisoner , my situation became more crazy .
I often thought about telling a friend , but I was scared of being arrested .
I got myself into a vicious circle from which there was no escape , " he said .
" I just kept putting off a decision . "
In 1988 , Elisabeth fell pregnant for the first time with their daughter Kerstin .
Fritzl explained how he tried to calm his daughter down by giving her medical books about childbirth and providing her with towels and nappies .
" It was great for me to have a second proper family in the cellar , with a wife and a few children , " Fritzl said .
Indeed , a photograph of the family looks like that of any normal group of relatives .
A teenaged girl in a checked blouse sits on the steps of her parent 's rooftop swimming pool on a balmy summer evening in 1984 .
The sun has caught her bobbed red hair and a smile is starting to emerge on her lips .
Yet the photograph , published in the German newspaper Bild , is no ordinary picture .
It is the last image taken of Elisabeth before she was imprisoned .
Elisabeth bore seven children as a result of her incestuous relationship with her father , all without medical assistance .
Yesterday , " Sissi's " last photo emerged together with a batch of letters written in teenage schoolgirl handwriting to a penpal , showing that only weeks before she disappeared , she had not only acquired a boyfriend but had well developed plans to leave home for good .
They coincided with the publication of an extraordinary interview with her father Josef , in which he attempted to justify the crimes to which he has confessed , claiming that his urge to rape his daughter had turned into an " obsession " which became too powerful for him to control .
Elisabeth 's letters , sent to her penfriend , showed that she planned to leave home and move in with her sister as soon as possible .
At the time , Sissi was training to be a caterer and had already started work as a trainee at a motorway restaurant .
In the summer of 1984 , she wrote : " After I have done my tests , I am going to move in with my sister and her boyfriend .
They can't afford the flat by themselves .
It 's a bargain for me and I 've got two rooms just for myself . "
The letter explains that Sissi has a steady boyfriend who is doing training with her , but has joined another course to learn about cooking and being a waiter .
She complains that he lives far away in another town .
" That 's why I am so sad . "
Her letters paint a picture of a happy young woman who plays tennis , goes swimming and even plays football on her two free days a week .
But the letters also give dark hints that she is already being abused by her father .
" Sometimes I get pains and I feel sick again , " she writes .
" I am supposed to be off sick at the moment , but I am completely stressed out .
My nerves are not in good shape either . "
The photograph is signed in Elisabeth 's own handwriting with the words " Think of me !!! - Sissi " .
Their son Stefan was born in 1990 .
But as the other children were born from their incestuous relationship , Fritzl hatched plans to move them upstairs when they were still babies .
Again , he forced his daughter to write letters begging her mother to adopt the children because she could not cope .
Fritzl 's Jekyll and Hyde double life went on for more than 20 years .
Upstairs , he and Rosemarie kept their official family .
She apparently never suspected anything and never complained about his sex holidays in Thailand .
In the cellar below his home , Fritzl kept his " second wife " as he called his daughter , bringing her flowers and their children books and cuddly toys .
In 1993 , he extended the bunker and installed a television , video recorder and radio in the cellar .
He added : " I even gave Elisabeth a washing machine in 2002 , so that she would n't have to wash all the clothes by hand .
" It just became a matter of course that I lived my second life in the cellar .
We celebrated birthdays and Christmas down there .
I even smuggled a Christmas tree into the cellar with cakes and presents . "
But Fritzl also admitted that decades underground without daylight , or medical and dental care , severely affected his cellar prisoners .
" Elisabeth stayed strong , she never complained , even when her teeth slowly went rotten and fell out of her mouth one by one .
She suffered day and night with unbearable pain and could not sleep , " he said .
In an attempt to cure his cellar family 's illnesses , which included flu , coughing attacks and strange fits suffered by Kerstin and her five year - old brother Felix , Fritzl gave them aspirins .
However the two children appeared to have inherited an allergy to the drug from their grandmother .
The boy suffered fits of shaking and Kerstin would scream uncontrollably .
Fritzl said his daughter finally arranged a plan of action with him , and wrote a letter that was designed to accompany Kerstin , who , by that time , had lapsed into a coma and urgently needed hospital treatment .
The letter eventually became the second family 's passport to freedom .
Kerstin was taken to hospital , Elisabeth was allowed to join her and contacted the police .
However , Fritzl maintained that it had been his intention all along to free his cellar prisoners and " bring them back home " as he put it .
" I was getting older and I knew that , in future , I would no longer be able to care for my second family in the cellar .
The plan was that Elisabeth and the children would explain that they were kept in a secret place by a sect .
They betrayed me rather sooner than I expected as the problem with Kerstin escalated , " he said .
Fritzl is to appear in court today and judges will almost certainly rule that he remain in prison until his trial .
Fritzl said in his interview that he understood the " anger " people outside felt about his crimes and said inmates in his prison in the Austrian city of St Pölten banged on the walls of his cell and shouted : " Satan we are going to kill you " at night .
" I only want one thing now , " he insisted , " and that is to pay for what I did " .
“ In recent years I have become increasingly concerned about vitriolic attacks by some members of Congress and some members of state legislatures and various private interest groups on judges , ” she said in her speech .
“ We hear a great deal about judges who are activists , godless secular humanists trying to impose their will on the rest of us .
I always thought an activist judge was one who got up in the morning and went to work . ”
She said she embarked on this campaign after a conference she and Justice Stephen G. Breyer convened in 2006 on the state of the judiciary .
“ The overwhelming consensus coming out of that conference was that public education is the only long - term solution to preserving an independent judiciary and , more importantly , to preserving a robust constitutional democracy , ” she said .
“ The better educated our citizens are , the better equipped they will be to preserve the system of government we have .
And we have to start with the education of our nation ’s young people .
Knowledge about our government is not handed down through the gene pool .
Every generation has to learn it , and we have some work to do . ”
Justice O’Connor said that most citizens know very little about their government .
“ Two - thirds of Americans know at least one of the judges on the Fox TV show ‘ American Idol , ’ but less than 1 in 10 can name the chief justice of the United States Supreme Court , ” she said .
And for that she did not lay responsibility solely at the feet of popular culture .
“ One unintended effect of the No Child Left Behind Act , which is intended to help fund teaching of science and math to young people , is that it has effectively squeezed out civics education because there is no testing for that anymore and no funding for that , ” she said .
“ And at least half of the states no longer make the teaching of civics and government a requirement for high school graduation .
This leaves a huge gap , and we ca n’t forget that the primary purpose of public schools in America has always been to help produce citizens who have the knowledge and the skills and the values to sustain our republic as a nation , our democratic form of government . ”
Here is the op - ed piece written by Sen. John McCain that the New York Times declined to run .

Today , 18 months later , violence has fallen by up to 80 % to the lowest levels in four years , and Sunni and Shiite terrorists are reeling from a string of defeats .
The situation now is full of hope , but considerable hard work remains to consolidate our fragile gains .
Progress has been due primarily to an increase in the number of troops and a change in their strategy .
I was an early advocate of the surge at a time when it had few supporters in Washington .
Senator Barack Obama was an equally vocal opponent .
" I am not persuaded that 20,000 additional troops in Iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there , " he said on January 10 , 2007 .
" In fact , I think it will do the reverse . "
Now Senator Obama has been forced to acknowledge that " our troops have performed brilliantly in lowering the level of violence . "
But he still denies that any political progress has resulted .
Perhaps he is unaware that the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad has recently certified that , as one news article put it , " Iraq has met all but three of 18 original benchmarks set by Congress last year to measure security , political and economic progress . "
Even more heartening has been progress that 's not measured by the benchmarks .
More than 90,000 Iraqis , many of them Sunnis who once fought against the government , have signed up as Sons of Iraq to fight against the terrorists .
Nor do they measure Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki 's new - found willingness to crack down on Shiite extremists in Basra and Sadr City? actions that have done much to dispel suspicions of sectarianism .
The success of the surge has not changed Senator Obama 's determination to pull out all of our combat troops .
All that has changed is his rationale .
In a New York Times op - ed and a speech this week , he offered his " plan for Iraq " in advance of his first " fact finding " trip to that country in more than three years .
It consisted of the same old proposal to pull all of our troops out within 16 months .
In 2007 he wanted to withdraw because he thought the war was lost .
If we had taken his advice , it would have been .
Now he wants to withdraw because he thinks Iraqis no longer need our assistance .
To make this point , he mangles the evidence .
He makes it sound as if Prime Minister Maliki has endorsed the Obama timetable , when all he has said is that he would like a plan for the eventual withdrawal of U.S. troops at some unspecified point in the future .
Senator Obama is also misleading on the Iraqi military 's readiness .
The Iraqi Army will be equipped and trained by the middle of next year , but this does not , as Senator Obama suggests , mean that they will then be ready to secure their country without a good deal of help .
The Iraqi Air Force , for one , still lags behind , and no modern army can operate without air cover .
The Iraqis are also still learning how to conduct planning , logistics , command and control , communications , and other complicated functions needed to support frontline troops .
No one favors a permanent U.S. presence , as Senator Obama charges .
A partial withdrawal has already occurred with the departure of five " surge " brigades , and more withdrawals can take place as the security situation improves .
As we draw down in Iraq , we can beef up our presence on other battlefields , such as Afghanistan , without fear of leaving a failed state behind .
I have said that I expect to welcome home most of our troops from Iraq by the end of my first term in office , in 2013 .
But I have also said that any draw - downs must be based on a realistic assessment of conditions on the ground , not on an artificial timetable crafted for domestic political reasons .
This is the crux of my disagreement with Senator Obama .
Senator Obama has said that he would consult our commanders on the ground and Iraqi leaders , but he did no such thing before releasing his " plan for Iraq . "
Perhaps that 's because he does n't want to hear what they have to say .
During the course of eight visits to Iraq , I have heard many times from our troops what Major General Jeffrey Hammond , commander of coalition forces in Baghdad , recently said : that leaving based on a timetable would be " very dangerous . "
The danger is that extremists supported by Al Qaeda and Iran could stage a comeback , as they have in the past when we 've had too few troops in Iraq .
Senator Obama seems to have learned nothing from recent history .
I find it ironic that he is emulating the worst mistake of the Bush administration by waving the " Mission Accomplished " banner prematurely .
I am also dismayed that he never talks about winning the war ? only of ending it .
But if we do n't win the war , our enemies will .
A triumph for the terrorists would be a disaster for us .
That is something I will not allow to happen as president .
Instead I will continue implementing a proven counterinsurgency strategy not only in Iraq but also in Afghanistan with the goal of creating stable , secure , self - sustaining democratic allies .
This week I ’ve been busy working on implementing a test suite for the Selectors API specification .
I picked up a new microphone recently so I decided to do a quick walkthrough of the work that I ’ve been doing and how I ’ve been going about it .
You can view the the video below :
Implementing a Selectors API Test Suite
You can run the test suite for yourself here ( it ’s still very much in flux – there are various parts that may still be wrong ) :
https://johnresig.com/apps/selectortest/
Here ’s a quick break down of a test run that was done earlier :
– Special Firefox 3.1 Build ( 73.8 % – More details )
– Safari 3.1 ( 49.3 % – No Fragment or Namespace support )
– WebKit Nightly ( 51 % – No Fragment or Namespace support )
– Opera Gogi – “ ACID3 Build ” ( 76.7 % – No Fragment support )
– IE 8 ( Ca n’t run – the file is proper XHTML so it tries to download it . )
– Firefox 3 , Opera 9.5 , IE 7 ( 0 % )
The work that is being done to implement the specification in Firefox can be seen on its associated Bugzilla bug .
I ’m shooting very hard to make sure that everything is in place so that this makes it in to the upcoming Firefox 3.1 release ( the first alpha of which is due out in a couple weeks ) .
The benefits that this will have for both JavaScript libraries and their users will be tremendous .
Good news !
The massive 65 - minute season finale of time - travel drama Doctor Who , " Journey 's End , " will not be edited when it appears on the Sci Fi Channel in August .
Sci Fi Channel reps tell io9 that the episode will appear as a 90 - minute special instead , which means that whatever happens to make you bawl like a baby ( according to writer Russell T. Davies ) will have its full impact .
Yay for Sci Fi !

Viguerie : McCain campaign depresses conservatives
The McCain campaign has not only failed to enthuse Republicans , but left many conservatives depressed and ready for a November defeat , said Richard A. Viguerie , Chairman of ConservativeHQ.com .
" Senator McCain has never been a conservative , is not one now , and will not govern as one .
From McCain - Feingold to cap - and - trade , he is a supporter of one Big Government scheme after another .
History shows that , in the Oval Office , where almost all the political pressure comes from supporters of Big Government , he would only get worse . "
In a speech at Freedom Fest , a gatherigng of free market advocates , Viguerie harshly criticized Senator McCain 's past history and said he would not represent conservative values if elected president , reported Christian News Wire .
" You even have some conservatives who are considering voting for Barack Obama , because they fear McCain as president would destroy what 's left of the Republican brand and would finish off the conservative movement , " Viguerie said .
" Their mood is that of the fatally ill patient who says ' Let 's get this over with ' . "
The Washington Post called Viguerie the " conservatives ' Voice of America , " according to PBS ' NOW with Bill Moyers .
McCain faced opposition from the far right long before he clinched the Republican nomination .
In a speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington , D.C. , McCain was booed by the crowd when he attempted to explain his position on immigration .
He went on to acknowledge that conservatives were concerned over his Senate voting record .
" Surely , I have held ... positions that have not met with widespread agreement from conservatives .
I wo n't pretend otherwise , nor would you permit me to forget it . "
In July 2006 , a conservative site launched an aggressive attack on McCain for his ' explosive ' temper , Raw Story reported .
Former Senate staff members told the site that McCain cursed at congressmen who proclaimed support for Bush and not McCain during the 2000 presidential election .
The full story of Viguerie 's criticisms of John McCain can be found here .
California gov. says he might take an offer from a potential President Obama to be energy czar .
Arnold may consider Obama energy post
California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said in an interview aired Sunday that he would be open to the idea of serving as energy czar in a Barack Obama administration .
Regardless of whether he takes that particular job , Schwarzenegger , a Republican , added on ABC ’s “ This Week ” that he ’s now committed to continuing public service even after he leaves Sacramento .

Schwarzenegger endorsed John McCain at the end of January , and McCain has appeared with “ the Governator ” to praise his efforts to deal with climate change .
A Schwarzenegger appointment would add even more star power to a hypothetical Obama administration , and would allow Obama to make an appointment from across the aisle that would not upset his core supporters .
When George Stephanopoulous asked Schwarzenegger about the idea on “ This Week , ” the governor replied that he does n’t " think about taking on a national role . ”
“ It ’s hypothetical , ” he added .
“ I ’m always ready to help in any way I can , the United States .
I 've committed myself to be a public servant .
I said to myself , ‘ This country has given me everything .
It 's my time , now — I ’m through with the acting and all of those things that I 've done , body building .
“ Even though I love all of those things still , for me , it 's important to give something back , do my work without getting paid and give something back , no matter what I do .
If I have this position or not , I will be traveling around the world and I will be promoting [ energy independence ] , renewables , solar , windmills , … protecting the environment , protecting the oceans . ”
Stephanopoulos followed up about Obama : “ If he were president and he called , you would at least take that call ? ”
Schwarzenegger replied : “ I would take his call now , I will take his call when he 's president — any time .
Remember , no matter who is president , I do n't see this as a political thing , I see this as we always have to help , no matter what the administration is . ”
Stephanopoulos said his question was prompted by a news report that he attributed to Newsweek .

Meet the pistol that fits in your pocket - and packs a hell of a punch .
The SwissMiniGun is the size of a key fob but fires tiny 270 mph bullets powerful enough to kill at close range .
Officially the world 's smallest working revolver , the gun is being marketed as a collector 's item and measures just 2.16 inches long ( 5.5 cm ) .
It can fire real 4.53 bullets up to a range of 367ft ( 112 m ) .
The stainless steel gun costs £ 3,000 although the manufacturers also produce extravagant , made - to - order versions made out of 18 - carat gold with customised diamond studs which sell for up to £ 30,000 .
Scroll down for more ...
At just over two inches long it is the world 's smallest gun - but the 300 mph bullets it fires mean it is still deadly
It can not be imported into the UK , and buyers in Switzerland and Europe must produce an import permit from police to obtain one .
The gun is banned from being imported into the US - because it 's barrel is less than three inches , meaning it is deemed too small to qualify for sporting purposes .
Jonathan Spencer , consultant forensic scientist and firearms expert , said that although the gun , which fires bullets at a speed of 399 feet a second , was tiny , it could still prove fatal and in the eyes of the law was as dangerous as a machine gun .
He said : " The general threshold for perforating the skin is about 330 feet a second .
" Apart from bone , skin offers the greatest resistance to penetration .
If it can pass through the skin it is potentially lethal , even if the bullets are small .
" If you shoved something 3 mm across into someone 's chest you could kill them .
It 's the same with these bullets , they could penetrate the heart .
" It is capable of killing someone .
Under section 5 of the Firearms
Act it would be a prohibited weapon .
It would be on the same scale as a machine gun . "
The gun shoots 2.34 mm calibre rim fire ammunition especially developed for it as the smallest rim fire ammunition in the world .

The Swiss Minigun , which is being marketed as a collector 's item , is just 5.5 cm long , and fires 4.53 mm bullets up to 112 metres
It weighs in at just 0.7oz ( 19.8 grams ) and fires live and blank ammunition .
The gun is the first product of the SwissMiniGun company , a gunsmiths based at La Chaux - de - Fonds , Switzerland .
Owner Paul Erard said that since the product 's launch three years ago , the firm had sold around 300 of the guns , mainly to collectors in the Middle and Far East .
He said : " We are producing in very small quantities - perhaps 25 gold guns and 100 steel guns a year , and there is a six month waiting list to get one .
" We will make whatever the customer wishes for .
The most expensive version we have sold cost £ 30,000 and was covered in diamonds and came with a gold chain . "
Other bespoke finishes available include ebony grips , hand engraved grips , gold grips with diamonds or collared precious stones .
Mr Erard said that although the double action revolver is similar in appearance to a Colt Python full - size weapon , it was actually based on a Swiss - made revolver .
In September 2006 the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives ( ATF ) in New York issued a warning about the gun after being alerted by a police officer who spotted it on a website .
Special Agent William McMahon said the gun was so small it could pass for a key fob , and warned it made the perfect stealth weapon for serious criminals .
But Mr Erard denied the gun was deadly and said it was only a tenth as powerful as some air guns .
" Since September 11 there has been a lot of paranoia in America " , he said .
" It is ridiculous .
Why would criminals want my gun when you can go out and buy a Kalashnikov there already ? "
A Guinness World Records spokesman confirmed the gun held the record as the word 's smallest working revolver .
Bottled water
From CopperWiki
edit ]
Why should I be aware of it ?
Bottled water is usually spring water or mineral water and even distilled water , sold in a sealed , portable bottles .
The bottled drinking water promises purer , healthier product and appears a safer option to those who do not trust tap water .
It is found everywhere , in homes , offices , stores , airplanes , and restaurants .
In 2006 , over eight billion gallons of bottled water was consumed across the globe .
By 2007 , the consumption in the US alone amounted to 8.8 billion gallons or 29 gallons per person .
Bottled water was the second most consumed beverage in the US after carbonated soft drinks .
Over the past two decades , people have increasingly been shifting to bottled water because they consider it safe , find it refreshing , calorie - free , convenient to carry around , tastier than some tap water and healthier than soft drinks .
But more and more people are questioning whether the water , and the package it comes in , is safe , or at least safer than tap water .
The UK version of Coca - Cola 's Dasani brand bottled water was found to have originated from the London public supply .
Following a four - year study the National Resources Defense Council in which researchers tested more than 1,000 samples of 103 brands of bottled water , found that an estimated 25 percent or more of bottled water to be just tap water in a bottle .
Some of these were further treated some were not .
An independent beverage research company Canadean found at least two out of every five bottles of water sold around the world are , like Dasani , " purified " waters , rather than " source " waters which originate from a spring .
The plastic used in both single - use and reusable bottles can be more of a contamination threat than the water .
A safe plastic made of # 1 polyethylene terephthalate ( PET or PETE ) is supposed to be used only once .
However , it is often reused and chemicals such as DEHA , a known carcinogen , and benzyl butyl phthalate ( BBP ) , a potential hormone disrupter .

Adverse impact on health
Bottled water is stored for longer periods and at higher temperatures than water distributed in piped distribution systems .
As a result , some micro-organisms , which are normally of little or no public health significance , may grow to higher levels in bottled waters .
These organisms appear to have little or no growth in tap water and in water bottled in glass containers as against stagnant water and water bottled in plastic containers .
Chances are ordinary tap water has been added to used mineral water bottles and sold as the original article .
The excessive use of bottled water ( which often does not have added Flouride unlike tap water ) may mean users wo n't get enough fluoride to build strong teeth and prevent decay . [ 1 ]

Health problems from plastic containers
A recent study shows for the first time that a common chemical - bisphenol A , or BPA used in plastic drink containers and baby bottles is linked to health problems , especially heart disease and diabetes .
BPA is used to make polycarbonate plastic , a material found in numerous product ranges - from baby and water bottles , to plastic eating utensils .
It is also used in coatings for most food and beverage cans .
People risk consuming BPA when it leaches out of plastic into liquid such as water , food or baby formula inside a container .
British researchers , who published their findings in the Journal of the American Medical Association , used government health data , analyzing blood and urine samples from 1,455 US adults aged 18 to 74 to come to their conclusions .
They found that 25 % of people with the highest levels of bisphenol A in their bodies were more than twice as likely to have heart disease and , or diabetes compared to the 25 % of with the lowest levels .
Bodies like the American Chemistry Council have responded by saying that the results are not conclusive and further research would be required to make the findings " statistically " significant .
A US FDA panel of experts are preparing to hear testimony on health effects of BPA , as it reviews a recent draft report calling BPA safe .

Health benefits
In European countries , many consumers believe that natural mineral waters have medicinal properties or offer other health benefits .
Such waters are typically of high mineral content and , in some cases , significantly above the concentrations normally accepted in drinking - water .
Such waters have a long tradition of use and are often accepted on the basis that they are considered foods rather than drinking - water per se .
Although certain mineral waters may be useful in providing essential micro-nutrients , such as calcium , the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) is unaware of any convincing evidence to support the beneficial effects of consuming such mineral waters .
It should be noted that neither the CAC nor WHO offer certification of any bottled or mineral water .
edit ] Bottled Water and the environment
Here ’s what it takes to produce and transport a bottle of imported water -- 26.88 kilograms of water , 0.849 kg of fossil fuel and 562 grams of greenhouse gas emissions ! [ 2 ]
Bottled water has hidden environmental costs that consumers need to be aware of --
In 2006 , the equivalent of 2 billion half - litre bottles of water were shipped to U.S. ports .
In New York City alone , the transportation of bottled water from western Europe released an estimated 3,800 tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere .
In California , 18 million gallons of bottled water were shipped in from Fiji in 2006 , producing about 2,500 tons of global warming pollution . [ 3 ]
And while the bottles come from far away , most of them end up close to home -- in a landfill .
Most bottled water comes in recyclable PET plastic bottles , but only about 13 percent of the bottles we use get recycled .
Plastics travel through our sewage system and land up in the oceans .
This poses a huge threat to marine life .
To a sea turtle , a floating plastic bag looks like a jellyfish .
And plastic pellets , the small hard pieces of plastic from which plastic products are made , look like fish eggs to seabirds .
Drifting nets entangle birds , fish and mammals , making it difficult , if not impossible to move or eat .
As our consumption of plastic mounts , so too does the danger to marine life .

All about bottled water
While this may be true in some of the developing countries , in developed countries such as the US , municipal water supplies tend to be better regulated than tap water .
In these countries bottled water too goes through rigorous safety and quality control , with multiple layers of regulations and standards .
In the US bottled water is regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and is recognized as a packaged food product and there are stringent standards for safety , quality , production , labeling etc .

Types of bottled water
There are two types of bottled water : spring water and mineral water .
Spring water --
This is collected directly at the source spring .
The bottling facilities are in the vicinity of the spring .
In a few countries certain hygiene standards have to be maintained and the spring water has to be treated to meet the limits set on pollution .
Mineral water --
After emerging from under the ground , sometimes ground water flows over the rocks resulting in a higher content of various minerals .
It is then collected and the dirt is removed .
Mineral water is not treated .
Different brands of spring and mineral waters have differing amounts of minerals depending on their source .
By late 1990s , most countries introduced labeling requirements for bottled waters whereby the levels of all minerals in natural mineral water have to be listed to help consumers make informed choices about the products they buy .

What can I do ?
Check the bottle labels --
To determine bottled water is really just tap water , check if the bottle label or the cap says " from a municipal source " or " from a community water system " .
--
To determine bottled water is really just tap water , check if the bottle label or the cap says " from a municipal source " or " from a community water system " .
Avoid reusing the bottles --
If you do use plastic bottles made from # 1 or # 2 plastic try not to reuse them as they are intended only for single use .
If you are using a # 1 plastic water bottle , try to consume the contents as soon as possible because leaching of antimony increases with time .
You can know the grade of plastic used by checking the labels .
Labeling laws of several countries require them to mention this .
Know the health risks -- During the survey NRDC found most bottled water relatively free of contaminants .
The survey opined that the the " spotty " quality of products of some brands might " pose a health risk , primarily for people with weakened immune systems ( such as the frail elderly , some infants , transplant and cancer patients , or people with HIV / AIDS ) . "
About 22 percent of the brands they tested contained , in at least one sample , chemical contaminants at levels above strict state health limits .
If consumed over a long period of time , some of these contaminants could cause cancer or other health problems .

Problems of plastics --
Recent research conducted by NRDC revealed the presence of chemicals called phthalates , which are known to disrupt testosterone and other hormones , and can leach into bottled water over time .
One study found that water that had been stored for 10 weeks in plastic and in glass bottles contained phthalates , suggesting that the chemicals could be coming from the plastic cap or liner .
Incidentally , there are regulatory standards limiting phthalates in tap water and there are no legal limits for phthalates in bottled water .
The US bottled water industry waged a successful campaign opposing the FDA proposal to set a legal limit for these chemicals .

To improve safety of bottled water
Initiatives should be taken by citizens to urge their concerned governments to adopt strict requirements for bottled water safety , labeling , and public disclosure .
Citizens should specifically request for --
Setting of strict limits for contaminants of concern in bottled water , including arsenic , heterotrophic - plate - count bacteria , E. coli and other parasites and pathogens , and synthetic organic chemicals such as " phthalates " .
Ensuring the application of rules to all types of bottled water -- including carbonated water and those sold intrastate or interstate
Setting regulations that require bottlers to display information on their labels about the levels of contaminants of concern found in the water , the water 's exact source , how it has been treated , and whether it meets health criteria set by the concerned environmental protection agency and the disease control agency for killing parasites like cryptosporidium .

The bottled water you purchase is often in PET or PETE bottles ( polyethylene terephthalate ) , which may leach DEHA , a known carcinogen , if used more than once .
Like all plastic , these bottles will be with us forever since plastic does not biodegrade ; rather , it breaks down into smaller and smaller toxic bits that contaminate our soil and waterways . [ 4 ]
It ’s estimated that 30 billion single - serving bottles of water are gulped down each year in the United States .
More than 1 billion plastic water bottles end up in California ’s landfills each year , taking 1,000 years to biodegrade and leaking toxic additives such as phthalates into the groundwater . ”
1.5 million barrels of petroleum are used to produce plastic water bottles in the United States each year .
That ’s enough to supply 250,000 homes with electricity for a year or 100,000 cars with gasoline for a year .
Only about 14 percent of single - serving plastic water bottles are recycled . "
Jennifer Gitlitz , research director for Container Recycling Institute ( CRI ) told Scholastic News Online .
" Therefore , about 86 percent of the water bottles sold are wasted : landfilled , incinerated , or littered . ”
Gallon for gallon , bottled water costs more than gasoline - and at least 25 percent of bottled water is just processed tap water .
$ 11 Billion - Amount Americans spend on bottled water annually .
2.5 Million - Number of plastic water bottles Americans discard hourly .
Worldwide bottled water sales total over $ 35 billion annually and are growing faster than any other type of beverage ( Howard , 2003 ) .
In a study of 103 brands of bottled water , one third contained some levels of contamination , including traces of arsenic and E. coli ( NRDC , 1999 ) .
San Francisco spent nearly $ 500,000 a year on bottled water , paper cups , and dispenser rentals prior to banning the purchase of bottled water ( Vega , 2007 ) .
The Green Ghost adds Poison in drinking water !
Research has discovered that poison is being released into bottled water from the plastic of which they are made .
The longer the water is stored , the higher the content of the poison .
The toxin is Antimony of the arsenic group and causes tiredness , depression and sickness with higher levels leading to blindness and death .
The problem is the reliance on polyethylene terephtholate ( PET ) to produce the bottles .

A Bit About Bottled Water : Francesca Cassini looks at the Changing Times
The Bush administration faced Congressional criticism yesterday for diverting funds from Pakistan 's faltering fight against the Taliban and al - Qaida to pay instead for upgrades of its US - built F - 16 combat planes .
With increased fighting in Afghanistan , much originating with forces based in Pakistan 's north - west , members of Congress questioned how the switch to the planes , intended mainly as a counter to the Indian air force , would contribute to quelling the insurgency .
The White House spokeswoman , Dana Perino , yesterday insisted : " The F - 16s are used in counter - terrorism operations .
We made them available to the Pakistanis , and they need to be maintained . "
There is no record of the F - 16s being much used in the tribal areas , mainly because Pakistan fears civilian deaths would increase hostility to its forces .
Nita Lowey , the Democrat who heads the House state and foreign operations committee , said : " Congress provided these funds specifically for counter - terrorism and law enforcement .
It is incumbent on the state department and Pakistan to demonstrate clearly how these F - 16s would be used to fight al - Qaida and the Taliban in order to get congressional support . "
Almost $ 230 m ( £ 115 m ) in aid earmarked for counter - terrorism has been shifted to modernise the F - 16s , built by Lockheed Martin , out of a total $ 300 m budget the US gives Pakistan for military purposes .
The move puts George Bush at odds with Congress , which last year passed legislation specifying the money be used for counter - terrorism or law - enforcement .
Both the Pentagon and Democratic members of Congress , as well as the Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama , would like to see Pakistan 's new government pursue a more aggressive strategy along the border , and argue fighting on the ground , supported by good intelligence , is more effective than air attacks .
Democrats have hinted that , if Pakistan does not act , US forces will cross from Afghanistan .
The switch comes ahead of a visit by Pakistan 's prime minister , Yousaf Raza Gilani , to Washington next week .
President Bush phoned India 's prime minister , Manmohan Singh , from his ranch in Crawford , Texas , to explain the decision , Perino said .
Singh expressed disappointment , an Indian government spokesman said .
Speculation in Washington varied on the White House 's motive , ranging from an incentive for Pakistan to pursue insurgents , to helping Lockheed .
A state department official said the timing was dictated by a need to pay Lockheed by the end of July .
" This shift comes about as a result of a request from the Pakistan government , partly because of their cash - flow problems and partly because they are re-evaluating the equipment they need to fight the war on terror .
Nato forces use F - 16s right across the border ... in Afghanistan for similar purposes ; and frankly , Pakistan has already used its F - 16s in sorties against terrorist targets , " an official said .
" So it 's a legitimate use , and it supports a democratic government . "
Are we witnessing the beginning of a real - life satire , at once amusing and terrifying ?
Its theme is the smothering of the nuclear power risk by catastrophic climate change and the oil crisis .
At the G8 meeting in Hokkaido last week the US president , George Bush , reiterated his plea for the construction of new nuclear energy plants .
At the start of this week , Gordon Brown , announced the fast - tracking of eight new reactors and called for " a renaissance of nuclear power " in a " post- oil economy " .
It is as if a world that wishes to save the climate must learn to appreciate the beauty of nuclear energy - or " green energy " , as Germany 's Christian Democratic Union general secretary Ronald Pofalla has rechristened it .
Given this new turn in the politics of language , we should remind ourselves of the following .
A couple of years ago the US Congress established an expert commission to develop a language or symbolism capable of warning against the threats posed by American nuclear waste dumps 10,000 years from now .
The problem to be solved was : how must concepts and symbols be designed in order to convey a message to future generations , millennia from now ?
The commission included physicists , anthropologists , linguists , neuroscientists , psychologists , molecular biologists , classical scholars , artists , and so on .
The experts looked for models among the oldest symbols of humanity .
They studied the construction of Stonehenge and the pyramids and examined the historical reception of Homer and the Bible .
But these reached back at most a couple of thousand years , not 10,000 .
The anthropologists recommended the symbol of the skull and crossbones .
However , a historian reminded the commission that the skull and crossbones symbolised resurrection for the alchemists , and a psychologist conducted an experiment with three - year - olds : if the symbol was affixed to a bottle they anxiously shouted " poison ! " , but if it was placed on a wall they enthusiastically yelled " pirates ! " .
Even our language fails , then , when faced with the challenge of alerting future generations to the dangers we have introduced into the world through the use of nuclear power .
Seen in this light , the actors who are supposed to be the guarantors of security and rationality - the state , science and industry - are engaged in a highly ambivalent game .
They are no longer trustees but suspects , no longer managers of risks but also sources of risks .
For they are urging the population to climb into an aircraft for which a landing strip has not yet been built .
The " existential concern " being awakened across the world by global risks has led to a contest to suppress large - scale risks in political discussion .
The incalculable dangers to which climate change is giving rise are supposed to be " combated " with the incalculable dangers associated with nuclear power plants .
Many decisions over large - scale risks are not a matter of choosing between safe and risky alternatives , but between different risky alternatives , and often between alternatives whose risks are too qualitatively different to easily compare .
Existing forms of scientific and public discourse are no match for such considerations .
Here governments adopt the strategy of deliberate simplification .
They present each specific decision as one between safe and risky alternatives , while playing down the uncertainties of nuclear energy and focusing attention on the oil crisis and climate change .
The striking fact is that the lines of conflict within world - risk society are cultural ones .
The more global risks escape the usual methods of scientific calculation and turn out to be a domain of relative non-knowledge , the more important becomes the cultural perception of specific global risks - that is , the belief in their reality or unreality .
In the case of nuclear power , we are witnessing a clash of risk cultures .
Thus the Chernobyl experience is perceived differently in Germany and France , Britain , Spain or Ukraine and Russia .
For many Europeans the threats posed by climate change now loom much more largely than nuclear power or terrorism .
Now that climate change is regarded as man-made , and its catastrophic impacts viewed as inevitable , the cards are being reshuffled in society and politics .
But it is completely mistaken to represent climate change as an unavoidable path to human destruction .
For climate change opens up unexpected opportunities to rewrite the priorities and rules of politics .
Although the rise in the price of oil benefits the climate , it comes with the threat of mass decline .
The explosion in energy costs is gnawing away at the standard of living and is giving rise to a risk of poverty at the heart of society .
As a consequence , the priority which was still accorded energy security 20 years after Chernobyl is being undermined by the question of how long consumers can maintain their standards of living in the face of the steady increase in energy prices .
Yet to disregard the " vestigial risk " of nuclear energy is to misunderstand the cultural and political dynamic of the " residual - risk - society " .
The most tenacious , convincing and effective critics of nuclear energy are not the greens - the most influential opponent of the nuclear industry is the nuclear industry itself .
Even if politicians were successful in the semantic reinvention of nuclear power as green electricity , and even if the opposing social movements were to dissipate their energy through fragmentation , this is all nullified by the real opposing force of the threat .
It is constant , permanent and remains present even when exhausted demonstrators have long since given up .
The probability of improbable accidents increases with the number of " green " nuclear plants ; each " occurrence " awakens memories of all the others , across the world .
For risk is not synonymous with catastrophe .
Risk means the anticipation of catastrophe , not just in a specific place but everywhere .
It does n't even have to come to a mini-Chernobyl in Europe .
The global public need only get wind of negligence and " human error " somewhere in the world and suddenly the governments advocating " green " nuclear energy will find themselves accused of gambling recklessly and against their better judgment with the security interests of the population .
What will become of " responsible citizens " who cannot sense these threats produced by civilisation , and hence are robbed of their sovereign judgment ?
Consider the following thought experiment .
What would happen if radioactivity caused itchiness ?
Realists , also known as cynics , will answer : people would invent something , for example an ointment , to " suppress " the itching .
A profitable business with a good future .
Of course , persuasive explanations would immediately be offered explaining that the itching was unimportant , that it could be traced back to other factors .
Presumably such attempts to explain things away would have a poor chance of survival if everyone ran around with skin rashes scratching themselves and fashion shoots and business meetings were accompanied by incessant scratching .
Then the social and political ways of dealing with modern large - scale hazards would face a completely different situation because the issue under dispute and negotiation would be culturally visible .

Scientists develop tobacco plant which turns red when it detects landmines
A plant that can detect landmines has been developed by scientists .
The genetically - modified tobacco plant has a gene that triggers a red plant pigment found in tomatoes and apples .
When the roots detect nitrogen oxide which leaks from landmines , the green leaves turn red about ten weeks .
Dangerous :
The genetically - modified tobacco plants will make it easier to detect and clear lethal landmines
Researcher Estelle Kempen , of Stellenbosch University , South Africa , said : ' It will be obvious if an area has mines because these plants will be red .
' The plants will also be able to tell if an area has been successfully cleared .
' They use this big mechanical de-mining equipment but they do n't pick them all up . '
The plants have already been successfully tested in laboratories and greenhouses and are now undergoing field trials in Serbia and South Africa .
Biotechnology firm Aresa , which is carrying out the tests , had previously trialled its ' RedDetect ' technology in a common weed called Thales cress , but scientists said it was too small to be seen from a distance .
The tobacco plants has been chosen because it is hardy , easy to grow and has wider leaves .
UN and landmine clearance groups are watching the tests with interest .
Aresa chief executive Steen Thaarup said : ' This could be an efficient and economic way of clearing mines .
' There is irony in using tobacco for this - it could end up saving lives for once . '
Becky Maynard at the No More Landmines charity in London , which raises funds to clear mines , said the plants would be a useful tool but communities would still rely on engineers to physically remove them .
There an estimated 80 million landmines buried worldwide , covering 120,000 square miles .
Eighty four countries are plagued by them , with third world countries such as Angola , Afghanistan , Bosnia and Mozambique the worst affected .
Landmines kill or injure 18,000 people a year , with 80 per cent of victims being civilians .
I attended a seminar last week in Orlando entitled Practicing with Professionalism .
Michael Cohen , Executive Director of Florida Lawyers Assistance , presented the first session , entitled “ Chemical Dependency / Stress . ”
He opened with his own story of substance abuse and recovery — instant credibility , a spellbinding tale of breakdown and recovery .
I suspect that most of us who attend mandatory CLE presentations tend to zone out ( especially at 8:30 AM on a beautiful Friday morning , as this program was ) , but the entire room stopped to listen to Mr. Cohen ’s story and its lesson for us .
Mr. Cohen presented some startling statistics about attorney substance abuse , depression , and suicide rates .
I have n’t been able to track down links to the surveys he cited yet , but here are the figures he presented :
15 - 18 % of attorneys will have substance abuse problem vs. 10 % of general population .
Over 1/3 of attorneys say they are dissatisfied and would choose another profession if they could .
Attorneys have the highest rates of depression and suicide of any profession .
He also cited a study of Canadian lawyers that showed suicide to be the third leading cause of death for attorneys , behind only cancer and heart disease .
Evan Schaeffer ’s blog includes a fascinating March 2005 post on this subject , with a lively discussion in the comments .
And , last but not least , studies show that 51 % of lawyers experience stress at higher levels than the “ normal ” population .
These studies — if valid — reveal a crisis point for practicing lawyers .
They indicate that the way many of us approach practice just is n’t working .
Perhaps the law attracts people who are intrinsically more susceptible to substance abuse or emotional issues because lawyers tend to be pessimists .
But I ’m inclined to believe that lifestyle and the pressures of today ’s practice has a lot to do with these findings , a theory that is perhaps borne out by this article , which discusses a study finding higher rates of stress among junior associates .
I am certainly not suggesting that most lawyers are headed for depression , drug or alcohol addiction , or suicide .
But I do submit that many lawyers are stressed out .
And , more importantly , I suggest that there are enough pressures on lawyers , especially lawyers who are fairly new to the practice , that it ’s critical to be aware of the danger signals for these disorders .
And what can a stressed lawyer do to relieve that stress ?
I believe that there are certain “ best practices ” for life and for conducting a legal practice that can reduce stress .
They can increase productivity and efficiency .
These “ best practices ” can keep us attuned to our own values and the way we express those values in practice .
They provide guideposts that can help lawyers reach their goals — professional and personal .
Stay tuned .
The next entry will describe these “ best practices ” and why they ’re so beneficial .
PLEASE NOTE : Depression , substance abuse , and any suicidal thoughts are best addressed with the help of counselors who are trained and certified .
Coaching is not therapy , and those issues are not appropriate topics for a coaching relationship .
If you need help , please visit this page , which has good information on overcoming these challenges , as well as a directory of local lawyer assistance programs .

Please call them if you are in crisis .

Disappearing Economic Indicators
First M3 , now . . .
Sometimes , when the data is ( how shall we say this ) less than delightful , politicians pressure bureaucracies to modify their models .
This attempt to misrepresent reality goes back at least to JFK , and probably much further .
It is not party specific , but is a characteristic of the all too common creature , Politico Disinguousi .
Yesterday , we discussed the unprecedented seasonal changes to CPI ( Pre-Revision CPI : 9 % ) that managed to all but eliminate inflation reporting .
And the absurdity that is the birth death adjustment has all but completely bastardized the Non-Farm Payroll ( NFP ) data series .
Of course , the cowardly scam that was the Boskin Commission was the most outrageous change in modeling over recent decades .
More brazen politicos do n't even bother gunking up the models -- they simply press to stop reporting the data .
The most egregious example of this in the recent past was M3 reporting .
We noted as it happened that once the Fed decided to save a few pennies stopping M3 reporting , you knew that M3 was going to skyrocket .
And so it has .
Recently , there was an attempt to close Economicindicators.gov ;
That was a warning the economy was about to worsen .
Thanks to readers and NY Senator Schumer , it was successfully beat back .
The latest such attempt at reducing economic information is brought to our attention by the WSJ's Real Time Economics .
They note that :
" A statement from the chair of the NABE ’s statistics committee , Haver Analytics President Maurine Haver , asserted that “ just when reliable and timely indicators are needed most , resources devoted to their production at our federal statistical agencies have been cut , requiring the termination of data series or a reduction in sample sizes used to produce the data . ”
Ms. Haver catalogs the casualties of budgetary tightening , writing that “ the Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) has been forced to terminate all hours and earnings data reported for local areas as well as payroll employment for 65 small metro areas .
The BLS International Price Program has also eliminated a number of series including prices of transportation services such as passenger air fares , air freight , and crude oil tanker freight .
The Census Bureau will discontinue its Survey of Alterations and Repairs in May .
The Bureau of Economic Analysis will reduce the level of industry detail in its county data and will eliminate the benchmark capital flow tables that provide baseline data on industry - by - industry investment by type of investment .
This may only be the beginning . ”
Let 's draw the appropriate conclusion from this :
First M3 reporting stopped , and shortly thereafter , M3 skyrocketed .
Next was the attempt to stop aggregating general economic information , and then we learned that GDP fell off the cliff .
Now comes the attempt to reduce the reporting of hours and earnings data .
Gee , can you guess what coincidence is about to happen ?
Let me end your suspense : Workers Get Fewer Hours , Deepening the Downturn .
" Throughout the country , businesses grappling with declining fortunes are cutting hours for those on their payrolls .
Self - employed people are suffering a drop in demand for their services , like music lessons , catering and management consulting .
Growing numbers of people are settling for part - time work out of a failure to secure a full - time position .
The gradual erosion of the paycheck has become a stealth force driving the American economic downturn .
Most of the attention has focused on the loss of jobs and the risk of layoffs .
But the less - noticeable shrinking of hours and pay for millions of workers around the country appears to be a bigger contributor to the decline , which has already spread from housing and finance to other important areas of the economy .
While official unemployment has risen only modestly , to 5.1 percent , the reduction of wages and working hours for those still employed has become a primary cause of distress , pushing many more Americans into a downward spiral , economists say .
Moreover , this slippage is a critical indicator that the nation may well be on the verge of a recession , if not already in one .
Last month , the hours worked by those on American payrolls dropped , compared with six months earlier , according to an index maintained by the Labor Department .
The last time the index moved into negative territory was February 2001 , when the economy was on the doorstep of recession .
A similar slide emerged in August 1990 , one month into what proved an even more severe downturn . "
Now what were the odds of that ?

Seeing the Shadow stats for inflation , it looks like the true number is where it was before Volcker had the balls to put a stop to it .
Now , we have Helicopter Ben in there and Volcker is calling this the " mother of all crises . "
Yet the stock market trades at 1.4 times sales , where historic bottoms are .8 times ... Nasdaq trades at 2 times sales and 34 trailing P/E using peak earning and margins .
My conclusion ?
Market is being manipulated big time and will likely crash within the near future .
( Look at Shanghai comp this year ... down about 50 % from its highs .
Is n't global growth responsible for the better than expected earnings we 've seen from IBM , Google , Intel , etc ? )

When Dan Walsh , a 33 - year - old technology manager in Dublin , started posting doctored versions of the comic strip “ Garfield ” on his blog in February , he thought he might amuse a few friends .
Instead , his site on Tumblr started receiving as many as 300,000 hits a day from the United States and beyond .
More recently it has leveled off to 30,000 to 35,000 a day , which is not bad for a site whose content takes about five minutes to create .
Mr. Walsh does nothing to the panels except strip away Garfield and other characters  like Odie the dog and Nermal the kitten  to create a new , even lonelier atmosphere for Jon Arbuckle , the main human .
Without the cutesy thought - bubbles of his lasagna - loving cat , Jon ’s observations seem to teeter between existential crisis and deep despair .
“ Do you have any unfulfilled dreams ? ” Jon asks in the first panel of the “ Garfield Minus Garfield ” strip posted on May 2 .
Then he stares into the void for the next two frames .
Will Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have to be bailed out by taxpayers ?
I have no inside information , but I ’d say yes , for two reasons .
First , as Reinhart and Rogoff document , big financial crises always end with an expensive bailout of the banking system .
It happened in Sweden , it happened in Japan .
Why should we be different ?
Except that in this case banks proper took on very little of the risk ; Fannie and Freddie , on the other hand , took on a lot of it .
Second , the housing bubble was immense ; see the figure above , taken from the always excellent Calculated Risk .
Fannie and Freddie only guaranteed conforming loans — loans that were n’t that big , did n’t have exotic financial features , and required a substantial downpayment .
But so what ?
If real prices of houses in places like LA return to historical norms — and there ’s no reason to think they wo n’t — many , many borrowers with conforming loans will end up with big negative equity anyway , and this in turn will produce a lot of defaults .
This crisis is a long way from being over .
At long last , we have resolution : Microsoft will not , despite the efforts of activist financier Carl Icahn , be taking over Yahoo and going toe - to - toe with mighty Google in the brave new realm of search - based Web advertising .
Instead , Yahoo , the definitive Web 1.0 company , will be casting its lot with ...
Google , the definitive Web 2.0 company .
Microsoft , the definitive Web 0.0 company -- the pre-Web leviathan , plying the increasingly dreary straits of operating systems and software -- is out in the cold .
This drama has been playing out since the mid-'90s , when the Internet first established itself as a business environment and as a compelling counterpoint to the era of Microsoft , which thanks to its monopoly on the operating system for PCs -- the mighty MS - DOS -- had dominated the dawn of personal computing .
Google and its emerging monopoly on search - based Web advertising is the new name of the game .
And now that Microsoft is almost categorically excluded from that competition , we are witnessing the final days of Web 1.0 .
It may look as though Yahoo has somehow saved itself by rebuffing Microsoft and teaming up with the dark lords of Mountain View .
But this is not the case .
Microsoft will survive .
Google will dominate .
Yahoo is toast .
Web 1.0 , whose heyday ran from about 1994 to the tech crash in 2000 , was defined by a highly idealistic set of values and summarized by the “ portal ” that Yahoo created .
For starters , Microsoft was the enemy .
Everything about its rapacious culture of profitable emulation , as opposed to plucky innovation , was to be despised .
To its credit , however , Microsoft realized that it had been an utter failure at the Web 1.0 game .
And now , in the uncertain realm of Web 2.0 , Microsoft has in Google a legitimate challenger for dominance of the techscape .
Advertisement
Google has set the tone for Web 2.0 , and the tone is grim and thuggish .
Microsoft , when it was the enemy , was at least an easy target : so corporate , so stiff , so slow on the uptake .
So guilty about its inability to get down with the cool crowd .
Google could care less about being cool , as long as it stays a juggernaut .
It ’s guilt - free .
It ’s like the Borg , the cybernetic aliens of “ Star Trek . ”
It ’s been said before , but I ’ll say it again : Resistance is futile .
Initially , Microsoft believed that by acquiring Yahoo , it could obtain enough search and advertising moxie to do battle with Google .
That sounded nice .
But pre-Web and Web 1.0 culture combined is still no match for Web 2.0 , which is less about solving problems and offering an outlet for creativity and more about raking in gobs and gobs of money ( or controlling the movement of everyone else ’s gobs and gobs of money ) .
In Web 2.0 , where there are lots and lots of projects afoot but all that really matters is their relationship to the gravity well that is Google , we ’re seeing the reassertion of the state of nature .
It ’s worth recalling Thomas Hobbes :
In Web 2.0 , if you do n’t render unto Google that which is Google ’s , your life will be solitary , poor , nasty , brutish and short .
Microsoft became the biggest fish in the pre-Web ocean because it was unencumbered by the need to be a hardware company ; its business was code , the magic that made the machines run and that allowed people to word - process and manage their balance sheets .
Yahoo moved this idea to the Web , engendering a space that was liberated from the need to sell anything but that ordered the chaos , thereby making Web 1.0 attractive to advertisers .
Both companies , however , supplied content -- Microsoft in the form of software , and Yahoo in the form of original commentary and other elements , such as horoscopes and aggregated news , surrounding its search engine and free e-mail .
Advertisement
Google , of course , is anti-content .
Content is for schmucks .
Other people make content .
Google yokes its search algorithm to its advertising products -- which are also content - free , involving none of the creative effort that people have traditionally associated with advertising -- and connects marketers to the lurching , undifferentiated Web audience running Microsoft ’s operating system and ignoring the snazzy display ads that Yahoo runs .
Google is the most successful gangster that has ever existed , insisting on its cut , even though everything that makes it Google is supplied by somebody else .
In the end , Yahoo believed that it was better to bond with Google , the big new thing , and continue to flip Microsoft the bird , as it has long done .
And so , Yahoo has sealed its doom .
Our only hope now , as we spy the gruesome Pax Googleannica of Web 3.0 on the horizon , is that renegade survivors of the Web 1.0 pioneer that took its name from Jonathan Swift ’s race of barbarians will say , “ Enough , ” and join with their former sworn foe to give hope to those of us who see the Web as something better than a merciless “ Matrix " - like monetized quantification of all we do and all we are .
That ’s right , as Yahoo makes its Faustian pact with Google , Microsoft -- Microsoft ! -- has finally become the heroic underdog .
The street where you live could be making you fat .
That ’s what a study of 450,000 Americans suggests .
Ken Smith and colleagues at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City gleaned the height , weight and address details of people living in the Salt Lake City area from a database of drivers ’ licences .
They then used census and map data to score neighbourhoods on various measures of “ walkability ” .
People with a lower body mass index – a measure of obesity – tended to live in areas with older buildings and where a higher proportion of people walked to work .
Advertisement
Building age is a factor in Salt Lake City , Smith says , because older houses tend to be surrounded by sidewalks , trees and shade , and close to shops , making it “ easy and pleasant ” to walk compared to newer neighbourhoods .
“ Older homes were built with pedestrians in mind . ”
The average difference in BMI between the top and bottom 25 % of neighbourhoods was 1.28 for men – equating to 4.5 kilos for someone 1.83 metres tall – and 0.95 for women , or 3 kilos for someone 1.65 metres tall .
Making cities more walkable wo n’t necessarily keep people in trim , however , as they may choose areas to suit their behaviour , rather than vice versa , he says .
“ If it ’s truly all selection , changing the environment is just going to induce a kind of migration , ” Smith says .

Why are rat testicles so big ?
So , why are rat testicles so large ?
A species ' sexual anatomy is related to its mating system -- who mates with whom .
In species in which many males mate with one female when she is in heat , sperm from all these males is deposited in the female 's reproductive tract in a short span of time .
A male that deposits more sperm under these conditions will have a higher chance of fertilizing the female 's eggs , and hence siring offspring .
Males with larger testicles produce more sperm , and therefore have an advantage in such a sperm competition scenario .
This is called sperm competition theory , because sperm from different males duke it out inside the female 's reproductive tract .
Rats have just such a mating system in which multiple males mate with one female , especially at higher population densities .
When a female rat comes into heat , she may be mated by multiple males in a short span of time .
The male with the biggest testicles will produce the most sperm , which means he 'll have a higher chance of fertilizing some of her eggs .
In contrast , species in which just one male mates with a female during her estrus do n't have sperm competition , because the sperm racing to fertilize the female 's eggs belong to a single male .
There is no need to produce a lot of sperm , so males of such species can afford to have small testicles .
This relationship between testicle size and sperm competition holds true across the animal kingdom , and has been found in mammals ( primates , sheep , rodents etc. ) , birds , amphibians , fish and insects .
In fact , testicle size is considered an excellent predictor of a species ' mating system .
Species in which multiple males mate with a female in a short span of time encounter sperm competition and have large testicles relative to their body size .
Species in which just one male mates with a female encounter no sperm competition and have relatively small testicles .
What about the testicles of humans and our close relatives , the gorilla and the chimpanzee ?
Gorillas are large 400 pound animals , but their testicles are tiny , a little over 1 oz together .
Gorillas live in small groups in which one male mates with multiple females -- no sperm competition , hence the small testicles .
Chimpanzees are much smaller animals , tipping the scales at 100 pounds , but they have large testicles weighing about 4 ounces together .
Not surprisingly , chimpanzees live in groups with multiple males and females , and when a female comes into heat she may mate with several males in one day .
This means lots of sperm competition , hence the large testicles .
Humans fall between gorillas and chimpanzees , with a body size around 150 - 200 pounds , and testicles that weigh about 1.5 ounces .
Human testicles are neither especially large nor especially small .
This indicates that humans have a mating system that was neither as promiscuous as that of the chimpanzee , nor as exclusive as that of the gorilla .
Therefore , sperm competition probably played a small role in the evolution of our sexual anatomy and behavior .
Mechanic builds himself the ' world 's smallest Hummer ' to cope with rising fuel prices
A mechanic was suffering so much from rising fuel prices that he built himself the world 's smallest Hummer lookalike which does 60 miles to the gallon .
Andy Saunders , 45 , used five cars to create the tiny , eco-friendly version of the notorious , gas - guzzling US road beast .
The auto - alchemist now rides around in the vehicle that does 60 miles to the gallon - 54 miles further than the genuine Hummer .
Fuel efficient : Andy Saunders built himself the world 's smallest Hummer lookalike which does 60 miles to the gallon
Based on the pensioners ' favourite , the Suzuki Wagon R , the dwarf Hummer is now turning heads when Andy drives it around his home town of Poole , Dorset .
The 1,000 cc engine can reach speeds of nearly 100 mph , but takes an age to get there .
And while rap stars who are keen to be seen with the original Hummer might sneer at Andy 's creation , it has become a hit on the streets among young lads .
Sprayed in Pagan Gold , the 10ft 6ins long and 4ft 10ins high motor took 300 hours to create from a variety of vehicles .
Custom built :
The Hummer lookalike is based on a Suzuki Wagon R and runs on a tiny 1,000 cc engine
The bonnet is made from the boot of a Peugeot 206 , the roof was taken from a Vauxhall Agila , the headlights are from a Land Rover Discovery and the indicators were from a VW Golf .
Andy paid £ 1,500 for the Suzuki Wagon R and now believes a car firm should start to produce its own version of the dwarf Hummer .
Micro machine :
Andy with his tiny car
Andy said : ' When I saw the Suzuki Wagon R I thought the doors looked a bit like Hummer doors .
' I had the idea of building a small Hummer so I bought the Suzuki , which is mainly sold to the over - 70s who are disabled .
' It 's not very cool at all , but after converting it into the Hummer people think it 's really trendy .
' Fuel prices are rising so quickly that a genuine Hummer would cost an absolute fortune to run - but not my Hummer .
' It costs about £ 46 to fill up and does about 60 miles to the gallon .
And it 's cheap to tax .
' I used a number of cars alongside the Suzuki to build it , including a Peugeot for the boot , a Vauxhall Agila roof and Land Rover Discovery lights .
' Although it 's small and I 'm 6ft 4ins tall , I get into it quite easily and there is plenty of head room .
' Although it is compact and has a little engine it has plenty of attitude and that 's what the youngsters love .
' If you offered them a Suzuki Wagon R they would laugh at you , but show them my Hummer and they think it is so cool .
' With the price of petrol soaring , small , fuel efficient cars will become more popular and I really think someone ought to produce a dwarf version of the Hummer . '
The genuine Hummer was derived from a military vehicle and became a favourite of celebrities until environmentalists began to criticise them .
They are nearly 17ft in length , 6ft 6ins high and boast a 6,200 cc engine and go from 0 - 60 in eight seconds .
But they need all the power to shift the 8,600lbs .
Famous owners have included Arnold Schwarzenegger and David Beckham , and they can cost up to £ 50,000 to buy .
TOKYO , Japan ( CNN ) --
There 's nothing better than a sweet , juicy watermelon on a hot summer 's day , right ?
But what if you had to pay six grand for it ?
A marine products dealer in Japan plunked down a record $ 6,125 ( ¥650,000 ) Friday for a black Densuke watermelon -- grown only on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido .
Premium melons regularly go for eye - popping amounts there .
Only three years ago , someone shelled out about $ 3,000 for one .
The one that sold Friday had dark green skin -- nearly black -- making it look more like a bowling ball than a fruit .
The nearly 18 - pound ( 8 kg ) watermelon was one of 68 sold as part of the season 's initial harvest this year and is one of only a few thousand available each year .
As for the buyer , he said he wanted to support local agriculture , according to an official with a local cooperative .

The markets come into their full glory starting in May , with the arrival of stone fruits like cherries , peaches and pluots  a juicy cross between a plum and an apricot  adding to seasonal vegetables and the year - round fare of olive oil , organic honey , goat and cow ’s milk cheese , greens , walnuts , beef and more .
Because most vendors provide samples to taste , the markets offer opportunities to learn some fine points  the difference , for example , between a Seascape strawberry and an Albion strawberry .
They also offer a chance to mingle with San Francisco ’s diverse populace  all of whom are united , it seems , in a common appreciation for food .
Barack Obama mentioned GTA IV in a recent speech .
He acknowledged that the game is n’t intended for kids , but his greatest concern is n’t with the game ’s content , but rather that kids left to be raised by video games rather than spend time outside or doing more uplifting activities .
Here ’s a snippet of his speech :
â€ œI was just catching the news this morning about Grand Theft Auto , this video game , which is gonna break all records and make goo - gobs of money for whoever designed it .
â€ œNow , this isnâ€™t intended for kids , although I promise you there are kids who are playing it , but these video games are raising our kidsâ€ ¦
â€ œAcross the board , middle - class , upper - class , working - class kids , theyâ€™re spending a huge amount of their time not on their studies , but on entertainment .
â€ œAnd so part of our job is going to have to be to inspire the entire country to say , â€ ˜How are we giving our kids a thirst for knowledge ?â€ ™
â€ œAnd turning off the TV set , and getting them to be engaged and interested , like their future really does matter on how well they do in school.â€ 
Rather than blaming the content of games , Obama is blaming parents for allowing their kids to live unbalanced lives .
If you ask me , this is the correct stance to take .
As I grew up , games were less violent , but violence still existed in gaming .
As I grew up , however , I was also very involved in sports , was expected to do well in school , and my parents were good to keep an eye on the games I played .
As long as they could see that the things I was playing were n’t having an effect on me in a negative way ( be it school , physical fitness , or emotional health ) , they never had a problem with the gaming I did .
The problem is n’t with the games themselves , but rather with the parent that would rather let their 7 yr. old kid spend an extra two or three hours in front of the TV playing games rather than taking them out to the park and teaching them to hit a baseball or throw a football .
Kids are n’t going to self - regulate , so parents have to learn to be a bit more proactive and , well , you know , be a parent .
Note : I ’m not endorsing Obama for anything nor any other candidate .
We met on the internet , off Match.com.au .
I did n't want to ' date ' as such , because I do n't like the pressure .
We spoke for hours online for 2 days .
We met and he picked me up at 6:30 pm and we went for drinks and a bite to eat .
I did n't get in bed til after midnight !
I got a bit tipsy , he did n't .
I kissed him on the cheek and that was it .
We went out 2 nights later ... for drinks at the casino .
We did the same thing ... just sat , talked about family and stuff in general .
He kissed me on the cheek , gave me a hug .
He did say he wants to go slowly , and that 's cool .
But what is slow ?
I 'm not used to all this .
Gentleman , paying for everything , not being a sleeze .
I 'm used to sleeping with guys on the first date !
haha .
I have no idea what I 'm doing .
I asked if he wants to catch up Wed or Thurs this week and he said yeah for sure !
So I guess he 's keen :D
How do I play it cool ?
I seriously do n't know what I 'm doing !
Any tips ?
Good .
Very good .
Launching a two - week focus on the ailing U.S. economy , Obama drew a sharp contrast with Republican John McCain , his rival in the November election , accusing him of a “ full - throated endorsement ” of President George W. Bush ’s fiscal policies , including tax breaks for oil companies .
“ I ’ll make oil companies like Exxon pay a tax on their windfall profits , and we ’ll use the money to help families pay for their skyrocketing energy costs and other bills , ” the Illinois senator said .
An arrest warrant has been issued for a woman considered a person of interest in phone calls that may have sparked a raid on a polygamist group in Texas after she did n’t show up in court on the charges of violating probation .
Rozita Swinton of Colorado Springs failed to show up for a hearing in Douglas County District Court on Monday afternoon for one of two false - reporting cases against her in Colorado .
Court administrator Lori McKager says an arrest warrant has been issued for Swinton .
Swinton ’s accused of violating her probation stemming from her 2007 guilty plea for telling police she was a 16 - year - old girl who was suicidal after giving birth .
Authorities have linked her to a phone number used to call a Texas crisis center that may have led to the raid where more than 460 children were removed from the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints ’
Yearning for Zion ranch in Eldorado , Texas .
The 33 - year - old Swinton faces jail time if found guilty of violating probation .

This undated image made available by the University of Durham shows the frontispiece of a " priceless " edition of Shakespeare 's works stolen 10 years ago , which was recovered after a man took the book into a U.S. library and asked to have it authenticated .
LONDON 
It 's a case of all 's well that ends well .
Police have recovered a 400 - year - old volume of Shakespeare stolen in England a decade ago and worth millions of dollars ( pounds ) after a man walked into a library in Washington , D.C. and asked to have it authenticated .
Police in Durham , northeast England , said Friday they had arrested a 51 - year - old man over the theft of the First Folio edition of 1623 , which scholars consider one of the most important printed books in the English language .
It was among seven centuries - old books and manuscripts stolen in December 1998 from a display case at the Durham University library .
The university said at the time it would be virtually impossible to sell the books to legitimate buyers , and for almost a decade police found no trace of them .
The mystery began to unravel on June 16 when a man brought the First Folio to Washington 's Folger Shakespeare Library and asked to have it verified as genuine .
The man claimed to be an international businessman who had bought the volume in Cuba .
" We have people come to us from time to time with questions about books , " said Garland Scott , head of external relations at the library , one of the world 's leading centers of Shakespearean research .
" It 's not every day that someone walks in with a First Folio . "
Scott said library staff members soon had their suspicions raised .
The book was largely intact , but the end boards and some early pages — which bore marks that would have identified them as the Durham copy — had been removed .
" There was something about it that felt a little off to us , " Scott said .
Staff members at the library asked to keep the book while they did research , and their investigation soon confirmed it was stolen .
They told the FBI , which launched an international appeal to find the man .
Police said a suspect was arrested at an address in the English town of Washington , near Durham , on Thursday .
He was being questioned Friday while detectives searched his home .
The book remains in a climate - controlled vault at the Folger Library .
Durham Police said authorities felt would be safer there than in " an FBI warehouse next to piles of cocaine and cannabis . "
Plans were being made to bring the book back to Durham .
American writer Bill Bryson , the university 's chancellor , said its recovery was " wonderful news . "
" Like Shakespeare himself , this book is a national treasure giving a rare and beautiful snapshot of Britain 's incredible literary heritage , " said Bryson , whose books include " Shakespeare : The World as a Stage . "
" I 'll certainly be joining the crowds who will be eagerly welcoming it home . "
The First Folio was published seven years after William Shakespeare 's death and was the first collected edition of his plays .
Some 750 copies were printed , and about a third have survived , though most are incomplete .
Only about 40 complete copies of the book are known to exist , most in museums or public collections .
The stolen copy was acquired by John Cosin , former Bishop of Durham , and was part of the library he established in Durham in 1669 .
The university said its estimated value , if in perfect condition , was 15 million pounds ( US$ 30 million ) .
The university said it was hopeful of recovering the other stolen woks , which include a 15th - century manuscript containing a fragment of a poem written by Geoffrey Chaucer , author of " The Canterbury Tales " ; an edition of " Beowulf " printed in 1815 ; and a book of maps and poetry dating from 1612 .
It promised to keep the First Folio safe .
" Our security has been very significantly reviewed and enhanced to the highest standards since the theft 10 years ago and we are confident the First Folio will be safe when it arrives back in Durham , " said the university 's vice chancellor , Chris Higgins .

The cover of the July 21 New Yorker depicts Obama in turban fist bumping his wife who is complete with an afro and automatic weapon while an American flag burns in the fire place and picture of Osama Bin Laden on the mantle that is getting all the attention .
Both presidential campaigns have denounced this cover .
Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton said , “ The New Yorker may think , as one of their staff explained to us , that their cover is a satirical lampoon of the caricature Sen .
Obama ’s right - wing critics have tried to create .
But most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive .
And we agree . ”
Here is the cover :

McCain campaign spokesman Tucker Bounds agreed , “ We completely agree with the Obama campaign , it ’s tasteless and offensive . ”
The New Yorker has defended their cover as satire , and even if you can get past the hatchet job this does on Obama , what bothers me most is the burning of the American flag , and picture of Osama Bin Laden over the mantle .
To me that image is a slap in the face to all of those who were injured , died , or lost loved ones on 9/11 .
I do n’t think it is appropriate to joke about Bin Laden in such a personal and political sense .
People who see this cover wo n’t see satire .
What they should see is a shameless attempt by an irrelevant magazine to get some cheap publicity .
In politics , presidential nominees deal with this kind of trash all of the time .
Obama is a big boy , he can take it , but I think this cover shows a great deal of insensitivity towards the troops who are overseas , because of 9/11 , justified or not , and those who were harmed by the attacks masterminded by Bin Laden .
I just do n’t see any humor in terrorism .

Statement before the US House of Representatives Financial Services Committee , Humphrey Hawkins Hearing on Monetary Policy , July 16 , 2008
Mr. Chairman , today we find ourselves on the verge of an economic crisis the likes of which the United States has not seen in decades .
Our economy is very clearly in a recession , and every time someone tells us that the worst has passed , another serious event takes place , as we saw once again last week and early this week .
Everyone now realizes that the situation is dire , yet either no one understands the cause behind the credit crisis , or no one is willing to take the necessary steps to ensure as orderly an end to the crisis as possible .
Instead , we hear talk of further bailouts .
The Fed - brokered takeover of Bear Stearns , a supposed one - off incident , has now been joined by a potential bailout of the Government - Sponsored Enterprises , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
The two GSE ’s have been disasters waiting to happen , as I and many others have warned over the years .
It was bad enough that Fannie and Freddie were able to operate with significant advantages , such as lower borrowing costs and designation of their debt as government debt .
Now , the implicit government backstop has turned out to be an explicit backstop , just as we feared .
The Greenspan reflation of the economy after the dot - com bust pumped additional liquidity into an already - skewed housing market , leading to an unsustainable boom that from many accounts has only begun to unravel .
With a current federal funds rate of two percent , and inflation at over four percent , the Fed is currently sowing the seeds for another economic bubble .
At the heart of this economic malaise is the Fed ’s poor stewardship of the dollar .
The cause of the dollar ’s demise is not the result of a purely psychological response to public statements on US dollar policy , but is rather a reaction to a massive increase in the money supply brought about by the Federal Reserve ’s loose monetary policy .
The policies that led to hemorrhaging of gold during the 1960 ’s and the eventual closing of the gold standard are the same policies that are leading to the dollar ’s decline in international currency markets today .
Foreign governments no longer wish to hold depreciating dollars , and would prefer to hold stronger currencies such as the euro .
Foreign investors no longer wish to hold underperforming dollars , and seek to hold better - performing assets such as ports and beer companies .
Every government bailout or promise thereof leads to moral hazard , the likelihood that market actors will take ever riskier actions with the belief that the federal government will bail them out .
Bear Stearns was bailed out , Fannie and Freddie will be bailed out , but where will the line be drawn ?
The precedent has been established and the taxpayers will end up footing the bill in these cases , but the federal government and the Federal Reserve lack the resources to bail out every firm that is deemed too big to fail . 
Decades of loose monetary policy will lead to a financial day of reckoning , and bailouts , liquidity injections , and lowering of the federal funds rate will only delay the inevitable and ensure that the final correction will be longer and more severe than it otherwise would .
For the sake of the economy , I urge my colleagues to resist the temptation to give in to political expediency , and to oppose loose monetary policy and any further bailouts .

What do they say – one man ’s meat is another man ’s poison .
Looks like that was for T - Mobile USA that has filed a lawsuit against Starbucks , which had recently switched over from T - Mobile to AT&T .
AT&T offering free WiFi at Starbucks locations is putting the hurt on T - Mobile ’s WiFi business , prompted the lawsuit .
( Hey Ma Bell , thanks for listening to our suggestion about free Wifi . )
At the time of the original WiFi announcement all three parties – Starbucks , T - Mobile and AT&T – made polite noises about getting along and impacting each other ’s business .
Even though , only two markets ( San Antonio , TX & Bakersfield , Calif . ) have switched to AT&T , T - Mobile is chagrined that Starbucks & AT&T are offering a free WiFi promotion .
( Rest of the Starbucks ’ stores still use the T - Mobile network .
As a result the free offer breaches most of the agreements put in place between the three parties .
“ Our wifi business is a key component of our strategy as we are looking at it to build our [ email protected ] offering , ” Peter Daobrow , spokesperson for T - Mobile said in conversation this morning , The company plans to have about ten [ email protected ] devices by end of this year .
He would n’t say how much his company is going to lose because of Starbucks actions .
“ After six plus years of our relationship this was quite a disappointment .
They did n’t involve us even though it does impact us financially . ”
The fact that a coffee seller has become a key pawn for two telecoms is amusing .
First , the free WiFi is vital for AT&T , which might be facing the worst kind of network usage with the launch of 3G iPhone .
They need to offload as much traffic off the 3G network to WiFi networks , whether at home , work or at Starbucks .
T- Mobile on the other hand seems to make a considerable amount of money from its WiFi network , which also compensates for its current lack of 3G network .

While drivers are facing sticker shock at the pump these days , here is a bigger shock : high prices are putting a strain on oil refiners .
After last year ’s stellar profits , American refiners are going through a traumatic period .
In a time of record gasoline prices , some of them actually lost money in the first quarter , and for virtually all refiners , profits are down sharply .
Experts say the refiners are caught in a double bind .
The price of their raw material , oil , is rising because of strong global demand .
At the same time , consumption of gasoline in the United States is falling as a result of slower economic growth and consumer efforts to conserve .
However much the companies would like to raise gasoline prices enough to pass along the full increases in oil , analysts say they have been unable to do it .
Oil prices doubled in the past year , while wholesale gasoline prices rose a mere 39 percent .

TOKYO -- With Metal Gear Solid 4's anticipated worldwide release just a month away , Konami held a press conference near its headquarters today to announce that the game 's development is officially complete .
Press and guests were invited to the Toho Cinemas Roppongi Hills cineplex , where they were treated to the latest trailers and live gameplay on the big screen with some popcorn on the side .
Similar to a real movie experience , the conference started off with some commercials , which were actually fake ads based on the Metal Gear Solid 4 world .
Five commercials were shown , starting off with a " Praying Mantis unmanned security system . "
The ad featured a huge security robot chasing after a man on a bike and ultimately catching him , with fatal results .
The ads are all available at Metal Gear Solid 's new official site , together with a fresh Hollywood - style trailer that features numerous new scenes .
After the commercials and a brief look at what was apparently the game 's opening sequence , Konami Digital Entertainment president Fumiaki Tanaka took the stage to make the opening announcements .
" In recent years , casual games have become extremely popular .
With the rise of new consumers , the [ game industry ] is expanding into new directions , " said Tanaka .
" While it 's said that the current mainstream is casual games , we took the challenge to make a blockbuster title , Metal Gear Solid 4 , headed by Kojima . "
He continued , " Metal Gear Solid 4 surpasses the scale of its previous titles in all aspects , including their story , visuals , and music .
Using the PlayStation 3's high capabilities to its capacity , I believe that our developers have realized MGS4 without any compromise . "
However , Tanaka also stressed that MGS4 certainly wo n't be the last of Konami 's big projects on the PS3 .
" We believe that the PlayStation 3 still has some undiscovered capabilities , and there 's still many points where we can be more clever to take its full advantage , " he teased .
" We will continue to create more good products in the future . "
Following Tanaka , director Hideo Kojima appeared on stage to announce the completion of his four - year long project .
" I 'm very happy that we can announce the completion of MGS4 in front of everyone here today , " he said , beaming .
" MGS4 has been an extremely difficult project .
At one point , it was like an eternal spiral where the game felt like it would never get completed no matter how hard we worked on it . "
" We took on all sorts of challenges in the making of MGS4 , " reminisced Kojima .
" We were challenged to make MGS4 on the Cell - processor - operated , unknown monster of a hardware called the PlayStation 3 .
We were challenged to make MGS4 in high definition graphics and 5.1 ch surround sound so that it'd play in the leagues of movies .
We were challenged to give MGS4 the most [ content ] in the series , and so we had the largest number of developers working [ on the franchise ] ever .
We were challenged to release the game simultaneously worldwide for the first time .
And , we were challenged to make it the last title in the series , as the game will be the conclusion to the Metal Gear Saga . "
Interestingly , Kojima also took the opportunity to make some comments on the current situation of the game industry , with Japanese publishers increasingly leaning toward casual games that do n't require expensive development .
" Casual games have become mainstream in the industry , " he declared .
" It 's not just a Japanese phenomenon but also something that 's happening worldwide .
There are new markets and possibilities opening up thanks to the trend , which is great .
But on the other hand , we should n't forget about the hardcore gamers whose lives are about videogames .
The gamers who consider video games a subculture , and enjoy taking their time to sit down and play games that gives them energy and courage .
I wanted to remind those gamers about the fun of video games .
I know that we 're going against the trend , but we 've been working hard for the past four years so that the fire [ of non-casual games ] wo n't blow out . "
" I believe that video games are a form of synthesized art that evolves by adapting new technologies , " continued Kojima .
" It 's a business , so there are difficult decisions , but when you think about the future of video games , I think that you need to take some risks to move on forward .
Once you halt , it 's really hard to go [ back on track ] and take steps forward .
Unfortunately , overseas game production companies , which are well - funded and extremely skilled , have surpassed us by a couple of steps .
It was once said that Japan molded the world 's video game [ industry ] , but that 's becoming a thing of the past .
Sad as it may be , it 's the truth . "
" We developed MGS4 for fans that love Metal Gear .
But at the same time , I was creating it with some hopes to stir a revival of [ non- casual ] videogames . "
Kojima then went on to play some Metal Gear Solid 4 on the cinema 's big screen , revealing that the the game will be chapter - based , unlike the previous installments in the series .
A few minutes of the first chapter , " Act 1 : Liquid Sun , " was played in hard mode .
After playing the game , Kojima revealed a number of new collaborations in Metal Gear Solid 4 , the biggest being with Apple 's iPod .
Snake carries around an iPod in MGS4 , which lets him play music tracks that he finds scattered throughout the game .
Collected tracks can be played as background music during the game , with additional tracks being offered for download .
Last month on April Fool 's Day , footage of Metal Gear Solid 4 featuring Snake in Altair 's robe from Assassin 's Creed appeared without warning on YouTube .
Today , Kojima confirmed that it's more than just a prank , as the Altair costume will be an unlockable feature in the game .
Other collaborations in MGS4 include Triumph Motorcycles , Sony Ericsson , Regain , and Uniqlo .
For Triumph Motorcycles , this is the second time they 're collaborating with the Metal Gear series following MGS3 .
This time , their Bonneville T100 and Speed Triple Motorcycles will appear in a chase scene during the game .
With Sony Ericsson , their W62S model cell phone is seen in the game , used by Vamp and Naomi .
What 's more , the collaboration goes both ways .
Sony Ericsson 's mobile portal will offer a downloadable MGS4 version of " Ganbare Salary Man , " a cell phone game about a middle - age salary worker .
Another product being advertised in MGS4 is Regain , a popular Japanese energy drink .
The beverage is featured in - game as an item that energizes Snake when he takes a sip .
This collaboration also goes both ways : Starting on June 10 in Japan , convenience stores will sell special bottles of Regain that include an original MGS4 - themed cell phone cleaner or dog tag .
Uniqlo , a Japanese apparel maker with stores also in the USA and UK , France , Korea , China , and Hong Kong , does n't have any items appearing in - game .
Instead , they 're collaborating with MGS4 with the release of six " Metal Gear Solid 4 UT Design " T - shirts , featuring logos and artworks inspired from the game .
The shirts will be available at Uniqlo shops from June 12 .
Similar to previous Metal Gear Solid installments , MGS4 will also feature a gravure girl .
Minami Akina , an 18 - year - old cover girl who 's been a big fan of the series , appears on a poster in the game .
Akina appeared during the press conference and congratulated Kojima on his game .
Kojima 's staff also congratulated Akina with a large MGS4 cake , as she 's turning 19 in two days .
In Japan , Konami will also be releasing a variety of Metal Gear Solid merchandise near the launch of MGS4 .
The game 's soundtrack will be released on May 28 as a two - disc set , featuring a total of 47 tracks .
" Ga -ko , " a duck - shaped alarm clock that appears in the game , will be sold as a product on July 31 .
A novel by Raymond Benson based on the original Metal Gear Solid will be released on May 25 ( May 27 in the US ) , while a Japanese novel by Keikaku Ito , Metal Gear Solid : Guns of the Patriots , will be released on June 12 .
In terms of launch promotions , plans for a " Metal Gear Solid 4 World Tour " are underway .
Kojima and his staff will travel around the world to meet up with series fans .
Tour locations include London , Madrid , Milano , Frankfurt , Amsterdam , Paris , New York , Los Angeles , and San Francisco .
In Japan , Konami will also be collaborating with Sony to push MGS4 on the PlayStation Network .
The daily " Toro Station " show will feature three consecutive days of Metal Gear coverage , possibly with a sneak peek into the latest game 's development facilities .
One of the surprises at the press conference came at the very end .
As the lights dimmed out for the event to end , a one - way dialogue very similar to the endings in the MGS games took place , hinting about a " worldwide live broadcast " and " VIP " events in Akihabara , New York , and Los Angeles on June 12 .
One copy of the human genome is more than 3 billion nucleotides in length , and weighs in at about 3.5 picograms ( pg , or trillionths of a gram ) .
Only about 1.5 % of this is composed of our 20,000 or so protein - coding genes , though other data suggest that at least 5 % has been conserved by natural selection , suggesting that a notable portion of the non-coding majority is also functional .
On the other hand , it is now apparent that much of the genome residing in our cells is made up of sequences like transposable elements -- " parasites " of the genome that can move about wwithin and be copied independently of the " host " genome -- and especially their extinct remnants .
One such element , Alu , is present in more than one million copies .
Even if some of these prove to be functional , it is not necessary to invoke function at the organism level to explain the existence of all transposable sequences any more than one needs to identify functions for the host to explain the existence of viruses .
Nevertheless , and though a significant amount is known regarding the constituents of the genome and the mechanisms by which they accumulate , there has long been a tendency to assume that much -- perhaps even most or all -- of the DNA in the genome serves a function .
There are two sources of this view : creationism ( an intelligent designer would not make something useless ) and extreme adaptationism ( if it were not functional it would have been removed by natural selection ) .
Proponents of both viewpoints can be seen overstating the importance of new findings regarding function in small portions of the genome -- extrapolating from a discovery that a few percent is conserved or that a particular transposable element serves a function , to arguing that the entire genome is indeed functional .
It is in response to this line of thinking that I usually bring up the onion .
The onion , Allium cepa , is a diploid ( 2n = 16 ) plant with a haploid genome size of about 17pg , about five times larger than our own genome .
The reason this is relevant is that while it may be that most of the non-coding DNA in the human genome is necessary for gene regulation , chromosome structure , protecting against mutations , or some other function (s ) , simply assuming that this is the case runs into the immediate problem of explaining why an onion requires so much more regulatory , structural , protective , or otherwise useful non-coding DNA .
I have called this the Onion Test , a term that I am pleased to see has been useful in discussions about junk DNA .
For example , it has appeared in interesting articles published in New Scientist ( Pearson 2007 ) and Seed ( Myers 2008 ) .
As I summarized it ,
The onion test is a simple reality check for anyone who thinks they have come up with a universal function for non-coding DNA .
Whatever your proposed function , ask yourself this question : Can I explain why an onion needs about five times more non-coding DNA for this function than a human ?
What 's so special ( or bad ) about onions ?
Nothing .
They were simply chosen because they have considerably more DNA than humans and few people would find it easy to assume that onions require much more DNA than humans do .
Moreover , they have close relatives with radically different genome sizes but rather similar biological features ( Ricroc et al. 2005 ) .
Left , Allium altyncolicum ( 7pg ) ; centre , A. cepa ( 17pg ) ; right , A. ursinum ( 31.5pg ) .
The Onion Test is not original , it is just a specific example of the kind of diversity that exists in DNA amount among species .
Richard Dawkins gave the example of salamanders in The Selfish Gene ( first published in 1976 ) .
Similar examples of organisms that would not be expected to possess more DNA than humans , but in fact do , have been listed since the earliest discussions of genome size variation .
Comings ( 1972 ) , for example , wrote :
Being a little chauvinistic toward our own species , we like to think that man is surely one of the most complicated species on earth and thus needs just about the maximum number of genes .
However , the lowly liverwort has 18 times as much DNA as we , and the slimy , dull salamander known as Amphiuma has 26 times our complement of DNA .
To further add to the insult , the unicellular Euglena has almost as much DNA as man .
And , going back to the first major survey of genome sizes in animals , Mirsky and Ris ( 1951 ) noted that :
Comparing the largest and one of the smallest examples among vertebrates , one finds that a cell of amphiuma , a urodele , contains 70 times as much DNA as is found in a cell of the domestic fowl , a far more highly developed animal .
It seems most unlikely that amphiuma contains 70 times as many different genes as does the fowl or that a gene of amphiuma contains 70 times as much DNA as does one in the fowl .
To make a somewhat different comparison : a cell of amphiuma contains 170 times as much DNA as does a cell of a relatively closely related animal , the trigger fish , whereas a cell of the latter contains only nine times as much DNA as does a cell of a sponge , which is far removed phylogenetically from any vertebrate .
Amphiuma means , which has around 25 times more DNA than humans .
Amphiuma means , which has around 25 times more DNA than humans .
Takifugu rubripes , which has only 1/10 as much DNA as humans .
Takifugu rubripes , which has only 1/10 as much DNA as humans .
The search for functional components of the human genome is an important endeavour .
However , the results of such research must be taken in context , both in terms of the human genome itself -- namely that evidence for function in one small component is not evidence of function for all -- and in terms of the diversity that exists among species .
Even if functions could be attributed to most of the human genome ( which requires evidence ) , this would not answer the question of why onions and salamanders have so much more of it or why a pufferfish can survive just fine with only 1/10 as much .

Grossing over $ 150,000,000 in its first two weekends at the box office , “ Iron Man ” has come out of the gates as one of the top blockbusters of the year .
If you have n’t seen it – believe the hype .
Bar none it is the best ‘ hero ’ movie I ’ve seen .
Aside from being wildly entertaining , Iron Man serves up a number of lessons that can be carried over to business .
Lesson 1 – Diversify Or Die
Robert Downey Jr. , or “ Iron Man ” in the movie , saw the writing on the wall .
While his seemingly flawless company was an industry leader and the best weapons company in the world , it was built on a business model that was fundamentally unsustainable .
Long - lasting businesses function in good and bad economic environments .
They morph over time to maintain profitability , growth and viability .
Most importantly , they align strategically with the vision of those running it .
If your business is faltering , ask yourself : “ What can I do differently ” ?
Know what your core competencies are , find hidden avenues to leverage these competencies , and do n’t be afraid of an evolving vision .
Lesson 2 – Build Your Company With People You Can Trust
The biggest lesson I ’ve learned about business , and a good lesson from the movie , is that you have to trust the people you are working with .
Businesses are built by people – so if you ca n’t whole - heartedly trust and understand the motivations of those around you , there ’s a problem .
Look at the key employees in your business .
Are they the best individuals to build your company ?
Lesson 3 – Build Something That The World Has Never Seen
Cooker - cutter products serve a place in business .
However , it is the game changing ideas that lead to industry dominance and sustainable competitive advantage .
You obviously do n’t need to build a flying iron man machine to achieve unwavering success , but you should be solving an aching problem in your industry .
Are your products / services game changing ?
Lesson 4 – Know Your Motivations
A lot of people in business , entrepreneurs especially , have disjointed priorities .
They are in it for the power , the money , the glamor .
Unfortunately , these motivations do n’t deliver happiness or strong companies .
Do some soul searching and find out what your life ’s work should be .
Does it match up with what you ’re doing ?
If not , it ’s probably time to change your focus .
If you are looking for some good business lessons or just wanting to kill a couple of hours watching an entertaining movie – check out ‘ Iron Man ’ .
It might just change how you think about your business .
JERUSALEM ( CNN ) --
In his first address to Israel 's parliament Thursday , President Bush reiterated the United States ' " unbreakable " alliance with the Jewish state and denounced calls to negotiate with " terrorists and radicals . "
In a speech before the Knesset , Bush compared calls to talk with unnamed terrorist groups as a " foolish delusion " that was suggested before World War II .
" As Nazi tanks crossed into Poland in 1939 , an American senator declared , ' Lord , if only I could have talked to Hitler , all of this might have been avoided , ' " Bush said .
" We have an obligation to call this what it is -- the false comfort of appeasement , which has been repeatedly discredited by history . "
Former President Jimmy Carter recently wrapped up a trip to the Middle East , which included talks with leaders of Hamas -- an Islamic militant group that controls the Palestinian territory of Gaza .
Carter hoped to persuade Hamas to negotiate with Israel in an attempt to reach a broader Israeli - Palestinian peace deal .
Hamas has not been included in peace talks between Israeli and Palestinian leaders , under President Mahmoud Abbas , who control the West Bank .
Israel and the United States refuse to negotiate with Hamas until it renounces terrorism and recognizes Israel 's right to exist .
Bush also chided the United Nations for regularly criticizing Israel 's record of human rights .
The president called it a " a source of shame that the United Nations passes more human rights resolutions against the freest democracy in the Middle East than any other nation in the world .
" We believe that religious liberty is fundamental to civilized society .
So we condemn anti-Semitism in all forms -- whether by those who openly question Israel 's right to exist , or by others who quietly excuse them , " Bush said .
The Mideast peace talks , which Bush lauds as the path to an independent Palestinian state , are " largely secret , " National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley told reporters Wednesday en route to the Middle East , but negotiations are moving forward .
" There is less known about them publicly than is going on , " Hadley said .
" The issues are hard .
" One of the things he [ Bush ] needs to do is rally the support of the Arab world behind both Israeli and the Palestinian leadership so that they will support whatever is negotiated between the two sides , " he added .
Key players »
In an interview with al - Arabiya television before he left for the Mideast , Bush said a peace deal by year 's end was still possible , and that observers should not be discouraged that he was meeting separately with Israeli and Palestinian leaders .
It was more about logistics than discord , he said .
" It 's a very complicated process , and I do n't think necessarily not having a trilateral meeting should be read as anything other than that it just did n't work out , " he told the TV station Monday .
" It 's not a sign that the talks are n't going forward . "
Watch how the trip combines business , pleasure »
During his Mideast tour , Bush also is scheduled to visit oil - rich Saudi Arabia , where he will meet King Abdullah amid increasing American frustration at gas prices .
Congress on Monday directed Bush to stop filling the government 's emergency oil supply for six months to try to bring prices down , a move Bush has argued would have little effect .
" His visit to Saudi Arabia will also commemorate the 75th anniversary of the formal establishment of U.S. - Saudi relations , " the White House said .
Bush will then head to Egypt , where he will meet with another U.S. ally , President Hosni Mubarak .
He will also meet with Abbas and Jordan 's King Abdullah II .

BELGRADE , Serbia ( CNN ) -- Former Bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic will fight extradition from Serbia on war crime charges , his lawyer said Tuesday .
Lawyer Sveta Vujacic also disputed Serbian accounts of Karadzic 's arrest alleging the man known as the ' Butcher of Bosnia ' was seized Friday and held in secret for three days .
Karadzic , 63 , is accused of ordering the deadly siege of Sarajevo and some of the worst atrocities in Europe since World War II including the 1995 massacre of 8,000 Muslims in Srebrenica
Vujacic said Serbian authorities were not telling the truth about Karadzic 's arrest .
" Nobody seems to know who arrested him and where he has been since last Friday at 21:30 hours , when he was arrested , " he said .
" He just said that these people showed him a police badge and then he was taken to some place and kept in the room .
He was blindfolded ... he was kept in some room ... and that is absolutely against the law what they did . "
Vujacic said he will launch criminal proceedings in addition to an appeal against Karadzic 's transfer to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) at The Hague .
Watch Karadzic 's lawyer slam arrest »
A judge has three days to prepare for his transfer .
Prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic said Karadzic has the right to appeal that transfer within those three days .
Serb authorities say Karadzic -- in disguise and using a false identity -- was working at a medical practice in Belgrade prior to his arrest .
Karadzic was so convinced of his disguise he regularly contributed to a health magazine as he brazenly built up his profile as an alternative medical practitioner , The Associated Press reported .
Goran Kojic , editor in chief of Serbia 's " Healthy Life , " released new images of the former leader hidden behind an enormous white beard , long hair and spectacles , identifying one of the world 's most wanted men as a regular contributor .
" It never even occurred to me that this man with a long white beard and hair was Karadzic , " a shocked Kojic said , according to The Associated Press .
At a news conference in Belgrade on Tuesday , authorities displayed another recent picture of Karadzic that showed him with short white hair , a long white beard and glasses .
Before he went on the run , Karadzic was clean - shaven with a mop of salt - and - pepper hair .
Serbian minister Rasim Ljajic said Karadzic was using false documents giving him the name of " Dragan Dabic " and a non-Serbian identity at the time of arrest .
" It was n't expected at all that this would ever happen to Radovan Karadzic -- that he would ever be caught in this way , " said Ljajic , president of the National Council for Cooperation with the Hague Tribunal .
Watch CNN 's Christiane Amanpour chronicle the life of Karadzic »
The arrest has been hailed as a landmark for international justice and for Serbia , whose new government has pledged to bring its wanted war criminals to justice as a condition of membership of the European Union .
" We understand that there is an absolute determination by the state to finish this job , " Vukcevic said .
Karadzic 's arrest earlier drew jubilation in the streets of Sarajevo , the Bosnian capital , which Bosnian Serb forces had shelled heavily during the war , and a small protest from ultra Serb nationalists in front of Belgrade 's heavily guarded war crimes court .

Karadzic 's brother Luka told reporters that he had seen the former leader in custody .
" Karadzic is in good health .
He has lost a lot of weight , he is full of optimism , " he said .
Karadzic -- last seen in public in 1996 -- was the Bosnian Serb political leader during the 1992-1995 war that followed Bosnia - Herzegovina 's secession from Yugoslavia .
While president of the so - called Serbian Republic of Bosnia - Herzegovina , Karadzic 's troops were reported to have massacred hundreds of thousands of Muslims and Croats during a campaign of " ethnic cleansing . "
Follow a timeline on Karadzic »
Early estimates of the death toll from the 3 - year war ranged up to 300,000 , but recent research reduced that to about 100,000 .
Vladimir Petrovic , the charge d'affairs at the Serbian Embassy in Washington , said the arrest showed his country 's commitment to accounting for its past .
EU foreign affairs chief Javier Solana said : " I think it is very important that Radovan Karadzic will be in front of International Tribunal having a fair trial . "
CNN 's Alessio Vinci in Belgrade said few in the city believe Karadzic will get a fair trial but the size of the demonstrations is a sign that few care .
He said those supporting closer ties with the West are happy at the arrest .
Karadzic 's arrest leaves former Gen. Ratko Mladic , the Bosnian Serb military commander , as the top - ranking war crimes suspect still at large .
" Today , I can tell you that I feel kind of good , " said Zlatko Lagumdzija , a former Bosnian prime minister wounded during the siege .
He said the arrest could offer " a chance for new thinking " in Bosnia , still grappling with the scars of war .
Karadzic , a one - time psychiatrist and self - styled poet , declared himself president of a Bosnian Serb republic when Bosnia - Herzegovina seceded from Yugoslavia in 1992 .
The Bosnian Serbs , backed by the Serb - dominated Yugoslav military and paramilitary forces , quickly seized control of most of the country and laid siege to Sarajevo , the capital .
During the conflict that followed , the Serb forces launched what they called the " ethnic cleansing " of the territories under their control -- the forced displacement and killings of Muslims and Croats .

He was removed from power in 1995 , when the Dayton Accords that ended the Bosnian war barred anyone accused of war crimes from holding office .

Imagine gathering in one place dozens of the local – and not so local
\– geekerati .
Picture an assembly of artists , technicians , designers and engineers .
Hobbyists , tinkerers , and the geeky - by - trade .
Young and old , men and women of every stripe , their only common trait a drive to build and create .
What could draw this crowd together ?
What lure would bring some of them a hundred miles or more ?
Would you believe me if I said all it took was an empty building ?
A scant few days ago we converged on a nondescript business park on the edge of Durham , North Carolina , summoned by the siren song of arc - welders and metal lathes .
In the shell of a former office space , we listened as Jim Newton and Scott Saxon spun the dream they plan to make a reality in just a short time .
By way of introduction , Jim Newton is the founder of TechShop , the Menlo Park , CA maker 's paradise .
The quick - with - a - quip Newton calls his business " Kinko's for geeks , " though that hardly does justice to the depth of his vision .
His partner in this newest venture is Scott Saxon , a mustachioed bundle of energy with a complement of beltware that immediately marks him out as a GeekDad .
The budding partnership between the two men stems from Saxon 's immediate enthusiasm for the TechShop concept , and the first fruits of that partnership are what drew us all to Durham for a pre-opening event in what will soon be TechShop 's first expansion .
Saxon billed the event as a party , though the mien of most attendees was more of intense interest and anticipation than of party - hearty celebration .
In what will become the facility 's central workroom , attendees gathered to hear news about the new TechShop , ask questions and , almost as an afterthought , indulge in free Red Bull , water , soda and pizza .
It 's safe to say that Saxon and Newton have a fair bead on their audience .
As it stands , TechShop Durham is little more than a big , empty building with paper signs taped up as harbingers of the future .
Listen to Newton and Saxon talk , though , and you start to see it through their eyes .
The massive grouping of open work tables here , the member parts - exchange bins stacked along the wall there .
Behind the bins , the store and maker 's shed .
Along one end wall , private workshops for rent by members , along the other a lounge area and kitchen .
In the center of it all , an enclosed space holding one of the shop 's gems – an Epilog laser cutter .
Got your attention yet ?
Saxon hands off to Newton , and you quickly understand that that 's just the beginning .
There are slides and SketchUp walkthroughs of the entire 25,000 foot facility , evidence of the considerable planning and forethought that 's gone into the creation of the new Durham shop .
Saxon says he 's already leased the space , and plans to start his buildout as soon as funding is confirmed .
He 's looking for volunteers in the crowd , but enthusiasm notwithstanding , most seem a little reticent to swing a hammer on a volunteer basis .
Volunteers or no , Saxon will fill the space with a list of gear that already has " 400 line items , " as well as a full complement of spaces and services not available at the Menlo Park location .
Plans include 25 private workshops , a vehicle bay and a sign - cutting workshop .
Metal lathes and machine shop gear will be on hand , along with a woodshop , a sewing room , sheet metal tools , welding kit and , of course , storage for projects underway .
The shop will offer laser cutting , a Shopbot CNC router , 3D printing , plasma cutting and vertical milling machines .
Beyond mere equipment , Saxon plans for the facility to meet more basic needs of his members .
Getting hungry while you work ?
Hit the kitchen .
Need a shower before you head home ( or out to work ) ?
Covered .
Saxon 's plans are ambitious , at the very least .
At this point , Saxon says he 's still looking for investors for this first expansion of the TechShop brand .
Part of the money will come from people looking to buy into the concept and get a return .
Saxon says he hopes to bring 20 $ 25000 lenders on board at 10 % interest .
Additional funds will be raised by selling annual memberships , with total membership capped at 500 to assure that everyone gets time on the equipment .
Some members of the audience even offered – somewhat to crowd 's amusement – to donate money to the startup shop .
The guys demurred , pointing out that TechShop is , after all , a for - profit enterprise .
Listening to Jim Newton , Mythbuster alum and once - frustrated maker , talk about TechShop is an experience .
He spends as much time telling amusing stories about shop experiences as he does talking about what TechShop hopes to bring to Durham .
If you ever meet him , be sure to ask about the TechShopper who broke a serger trying to stitch wood .
The Durham crowd could be conservatively called interested , and remain intensely focused on Newton 's presentation , even when the occasional joke or quip went awry .
One joke took a bent that women in the crowd did n't appreciate , earning Newton a raised finger from at least one audience member .
On the whole , though , the crowd was abundantly receptive to Newton 's unabashedly geeky humor .
After a relatively short talk , Newton turned the session over to a question and answer period .
This is where the depth of the crowd 's interest truly came through .
The questions came thick and fast for an hour .
Will TechShop offer classes to non-members ?
Can members become paid staffers ?
Will we own our work ?
Will there be this or that piece of equipment ?
Can I bring my kids to TechShop ?
Throughout the session , Newton answered service questions by turning them back to the audience and asking their opinion .
Obviously , the company is focused on providing , to the extent possible , what members want to see .
Rather than simply cloning Menlo Park Saxon , like any good geek or maker , wants his facility to be special and customized .
After the Q&A session , the crowd was free to wander the facility , though most of the crowd seemed less interested in the building than in each other , or Saxon and Newton .
The gathering broke into small groups for the remainder of the evening , talking animatedly about what they could build using the tools Saxon plans to bring in .
Less common among the topics of conversation were what might be considered TechShop 's downsides .
First , it 's expensive .
At the discounted pre-opening price , memberships to Durham 's TechShop are a wallet - popping $ 1000 per year .
No small investment for a GeekDad and family .
Even day or month passes are n't especially cheap , and that does n't figure in the cost of training classes .
Then there 's the issue of location .
Though Newton plans a wave of post - Durham expansion that will see 10 TechShops open around the nation , odds that you 'll be within comfortable driving distance of one are still pretty small , especially for GeekDads in the middle of the country .
Newton says there is " lots " of additional interest , though .
Still , if you 're close , and can afford it , it 's a grand possibility for the motivated maker , or even just the inspired tinkerer .
Newton says the business will be set up to function as an incubator for small businesses , allowing people with good ideas to try them out without spending a huge chunk of money on space and manufacturing .
He and Saxon also hope to create some sort of investment fund that could provide startup capital for " good ideas . "
It 's fair to say that TechShop has big plans , and the road to world domination goes straight through Durham .
Geekdads in the RTP region will soon have an incredible array of tools and equipment at their disposal – provided they can meet the price of entry .
UPDATE : Jim Newton writes to point out that I 've incorrectly left you with the impression that the $ 1,000 membership is the only option , which is n't the case .
The monthly passes noted above are an option for those with short - term requirements or a tighter budget , and go for $ 125 .
Twenty - four hour passes are $ 30 for those who just want to get a feel for the place .
The annual membership is , as Jim notes , a larger up - front payment , but less costly over the course of the year if your needs or wants are long - term .
( I should also point out that the annual price goes up to $ 1200 after opening day . )

@ Mith :
That 's what multi tools are useful for .
Just poke the knife / saw / can opener / bottle opener around until the coin gets dislodged .
Wo n't be needing it in Starbucks ... that 's one coffee shop it wo n't be installed in .
I prefer this to having to juggle with accessing T - Mobile at Starbucks when I used to use it and if I can have half an hour of Internet connectivity for a dollar , I 'd be happy as a clam if they installed it at Penn Station .
I always find myself with extra time at terminals but do n't want to create an account with every single service provider , pay the $ 9.99 for the 24 hours of access , and only use the Internet for 45 minutes or until whenever my train / plane departs .

Mars Express closed in on the intriguing martian moon Phobos at 6:50 CEST on 23 July , flying past at 2.96 km/s , only 100 km from the centre of the moon .
The ESA spacecraft ’s fly - bys of the moon have returned its most detailed full - disc images ever , also in 3 - D , using the High Resolution Stereo Camera on board .
Phobos is what scientists call a ‘ small irregular body ’ .
Measuring 27 km × 22 km × 19 km , it is one of the least reflective objects in the Solar System , thought to be a captured asteroid or a remnant of the material that formed the planets .
The best full - disc images of Phobos ever Phobos in 3 - D
The HRSC images , which are still under processing , form a bounty for scientists studying Phobos .
They are a result of observations carried out over several close fly - bys of the martian moon , performed over the past three weeks .
At their best , the pictures have a resolution of 3.7 m/ pixel and are taken in five channels to obtain images in 3 - D and to perform analyses of the physical properties of the surface .
The images obtained by several other spacecraft so far have either been of a lower resolution , or not available in 3D and have not covered the entire disc of Phobos .
This is also the first time that portions of the far - side of the moon have been imaged in such high resolution ( Phobos always faces Mars on the same side ) .
Scientific bounty Potential Phobos - Grunt landing site
In observing Phobos , Mars Express benefits from its highly elliptical orbit which takes it from a closest distance of 270 km from the planet to a maximum of 10 000 km ( from the centre of Mars ) , crossing the 6000 km orbit of the martian moon .
Mars Express imaged the far - side of Phobos ( with respect to Mars ) for the first time after NASA ’s Viking mission in the 1970s , by flying outside the spacecraft ’s orbit around Mars .
Phobos - Grunt ( roughly translated as Phobos soil ) , a Russian sample - return mission , is due for launch in 2009 .
It is expected to land on the far - side of Phobos at a region between 5° south to 5° north , and 230° west to 235° west .
Phobos
The HRSC observations have been awaited eagerly to better assess the choice of and characterise the landing site .
The moon 's remarkably grooved surface can be seen in the pictures quite clearly .
The origin of these grooves is still debated .
It is not known whether they are produced by ejecta thrown up from impacts on Mars , or if they result from the surface regolith , or soil , slipping into internal fissures .
Phobos
In this image , at least two families of grooves with distinct orientations can be seen along with what is either a chain of pits or craters .
The stereo observations ( resolution 3.7 m/ pixel ) are important for structural analysis and they will be used to derive a digital terrain model ( a 3 - D map of the surface that includes elevation data ) .
The extra photometric channels ( at 7.4 m / pixel ) make it possible to study the properties of the Phobos regolith at micron to millimetre scales .
An operational challenge Geometry of the Phobos fly - by Managing the close fly - bys was an operational challenge , made possible by spacecraft operations engineers and scientists who worked together to specially optimise Mars Express ’s trajectory and obtain the best possible views .
The observation made use of a spacecraft slew , a special manoeuvre whereby the body of the spacecraft is rotated against the direction of motion , to effectively lower the speed at which the target passes in the field of view of the camera .
This makes it possible to avoid blurring of the pictures despite the high fly - by velocities , whilst maintaining acceptable exposure time .
Phobos fly - by animation The HRSC Super Resolution Channel ( SRC ) also observed during this close fly - by , with a nominal resolution of 90 cm / pixel .
As expected , despite the slew , some residual motion blur has crept into the image , but much detail will be recovered after further processing .
In the days running up to the observation , the primary star - tracker - a navigation device that helps the spacecraft point its instruments at the target accurately - experienced some temporary difficulty in recognising the star constellations in its field of view , leaving the spacecraft operating on its secondary system .
Concerned that this might affect this critical observation , the team at ESA 's European Space Operations Centre ( ESOC ) in Darmstadt , Germany , worked intensely to recover the primary system and were able to switch back successfully two days before the fly - by .
Notes for editors : The Principal Investigator ( PI ) for the HRSC experiment on ESA ’s Mars Express is Prof .
Dr Gerhard Neukum , who also designed the camera technically .
The HRSC science team consists of 45 Co-Investigators from 32 institutions located in 10 nations .
The camera was developed at the German Aerospace Center ( DLR ) under the PI in cooperation with industrial partners ( EADS Astrium , Lewicki Microelectronic GmbH and Jena - Optronik GmbH ) .
It is operated through ESA / ESOC by the DLR Institute of Planetary Research , where systematic processing of the image data is carried out .
The scenes shown here were processed by the PI group at the Institute for Geosciences of the Freie Universitaet Berlin in cooperation with the DLR Institute of Planetary Research , Berlin .

TERRIFIED workers at a mining compound in one of Russia 's most isolated regions are refusing to go to work after a pack of giant bears attacked and ate two of their colleagues .
At least 30 of the hungry animals have been seen prowling close to the mines in northern Kamchatka in search of food , where the mangled remains of the two workers , both guards , were found last week .
The gruesome discovery has left their co-workers at the compound in the Olyotorsky district too scared to venture out .
A team of snipers , with orders to shoot the bears , is now being dispatched , The Australian reports .
The Kamchatka brown bear is one of the world 's largest , with males growing to around 3 m and weighing up to 700 kg .
They can also reach speeds of 48 km / h despite their size .
The peninsula , nine time zones east of Moscow and twice the size of Britain , is home to an estimated 16,000 bears .
Environmentalists argue that widespread poaching has caused a fish shortage , prompting the starving bears to become aggressive as they seek out food close to human settlements .
Their arrival has paralysed work at platinum mines owned by the Koryakgeologia company .
Geologists refused to leave their compound in Mount Ledyanaya after 20 bears were seen wandering around , while at least 10 animals were spotted at nearby Penisty .
Kamchatka is not alone in facing problems with hungry bears .
The mutilated remains of a man were found last month after he was attacked on nearby Sakhalin island , the third person killed by a bear this year .
Last month a woman was mauled to death by a bear that had ventured into the suburbs of Petropavlovsk - Kamchatka .

The British Columbia Supreme Court has effectively thrown out a key provision of Canada 's drug law .
The Court 's decision supports the Insite safe injection facility in Vancouver .
The National Post reported on May 28 , 2008 ( " BC drug injection site legal , court rules " ) that " The B. C. Supreme Court has thrown the country 's drug law into limbo with a ruling that says it conflicts with health concerns that constitutionally are a provincial responsibility , as well as conflicting with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms .
In a surprise ruling yesterday , the court supported Vancouver 's experimental supervised injection clinic and halted federal attempts to close the facility .
Judge Ian Pitfield said Insite should be allowed to remain open for a year even without a federal exemption from current drug laws .
The judge declared a key section of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act ( CDSA ) of no force and gave Ottawa until June 30 , 2009 , to rectify the law because it appears to interfere with medical treatment .
Judge Pitfield said the current law governing illicit substances puts " unfettered discretion in the hands of the Minister " and violates the Constitution . "
According to the National Post , " In a 59 - page decision that reviewed more than a decade 's worth of social work on the Downtown Eastside , the judge said drug addicts deserved the same kind of health care as those in the thralls of alcohol or tobacco addiction .
Insite was established in September , 2003 , as a pilot project to reduce disease , reduce overdose deaths and foster better health care for addicts .
More than one million injections have occurred .
However , an exemption granted by the federal government for the clinic to operate expired , and the facility has been operating on temporary permits since .
The ruling was greeted with near disbelief and euphoria by advocates , who have lobbied for years , first to open the site and then to keep it open . "
The National Post reported that " Judge Pitfield concluded the national law blocked addicts from a health care facility that could reduce or eliminate their risk of death from an overdose or from contracting an infectious disease , thereby violating their right to life and security .
' While users do not use Insite to directly treat their addiction , they receive services and assistance at Insite which reduce the risk of overdose that is a feature of their illness , they avoid the risk of being infected or of infecting others by injection , and they gain access to counselling and consultation that may lead to abstinence and rehabilitation , ' he said .
' All of this is health care . '
Judge Pitfield went on to say the federal law ' forces the user who is ill from addiction to resort to unhealthy and unsafe injection in an environment where there is a significant and measurable risk of morbidity or death . ' "

Tesco shareholders have not backed proposals to improve welfare standards for chickens championed by TV cook Hugh Fearnley - Whittingstall .
The chef wanted investors to adopt new standards for rearing birds , but the plan got fewer than 10 % of votes at its annual general meeting in Solihull .
Mr Fearnley - Whittingstall and other chefs have highlighted what they say are appalling conditions in some farms .
Tesco says it is sourcing more chicken from farms with the highest standards .
Mr Fearnley - Whittingstall called the backing he garnered for his proposals a " significant showing " and denied that his efforts had been wasted .
For the plans to have been passed , Mr Fearnley - Whittingstall needed 75 % of the shareholders ' votes .
High - profile campaign Mr Fearnley - Whittingstall , star of food shows including Back to River Cottage , and a Tesco shareholder , has highlighted the plight of chickens in many intensive indoor battery farms .
HAVE YOUR SAY
I would love to pay more for food if it increased the quality of life for these animals but at the moment I can't afford it Sue , Tunbridge Wells
He and other celebrity chefs argue that conditions in such farms are unacceptable and that supermarkets are partly to blame for this for selling chickens too cheaply .
He had urged shareholders to support his motion , which would have required Tesco to adopt higher minimum standards for chickens it purchases .
Had the proposal been backed by shareholders , Tesco would have had to adopt the RSPCA 's freedom farm standards on how birds are fed , exercised and transported .
Farms approved by the RSPCA for meeting " higher welfare " standards are able to carry the freedom farm logo on their products .
Tesco says it has adopted such standards on a growing number of its farms , but that to do so universally straight away would force up the price of chickens and that this would be unpopular with families already facing higher shopping bills .
Mr Fearnley - Whittingstall said he was " disappointed " that Tesco had chosen to " abdicate responsibility " on the issue of poultry welfare to the government and shoppers .
But he said he was encouraged that " significant changes " were taking place " behind the scenes " in Tesco 's policies and called on the UK 's largest supermarket chain to take the lead in establishing a forum to discuss general poultry welfare issues .
" The way chicken has been sold in this country has been a bit of a secret for some time , " he said .
" I would like to see some real change from Tesco in the coming months . "
' High standards '
Tesco , which accounts for more than a fifth of all intensively reared chickens sold , was criticised earlier this year when it cut the retail price of its standard whole chicken to £ 1.99 .
Tesco said its welfare standards were " amongst the best in the world " and that the share of higher welfare chicken it sold had risen 70 % in the past year .
" We have been working hard for a while to increase the amount of higher welfare chicken we sell and the recent debate over chickens in the media has helped raise awareness of the choice available to customers , " a spokesman said .
Shareholders pressed Tesco bosses on a range of issues
But it added : " A large number of our customers are on a tight budget and rely on lower cost foods to feed their families .
We believe it would be wrong to remove these options for them . "
Corporate governance firm PIRC , which backed Mr Fearnley - Whittingstall 's resolution , said it had not expected to win the vote but that it had raised awareness of the issue .
Higher standards would create a " more enriched environment " for chickens and would ultimately be healthier for customers , it added .
Other issues debated at the meeting ranged from calls for union recognition at its new US stores to allegations of low pay for workers employed by global suppliers , particularly in India .

AMERICANS today spend almost as much on bandwidth  the capacity to move information  as we do on energy .
A family of four likely spends several hundred dollars a month on cellphones , cable television and Internet connections , which is about what we spend on gas and heating oil .
Just as the industrial revolution depended on oil and other energy sources , the information revolution is fueled by bandwidth .
If we are n’t careful , we ’re going to repeat the history of the oil industry by creating a bandwidth cartel .
Like energy , bandwidth is an essential economic input .
You ca n’t run an engine without gas , or a cellphone without bandwidth .
Both are also resources controlled by a tight group of producers , whether oil companies and Middle Eastern nations or communications companies like AT&T , Comcast and Vodafone .
That ’s why , as with energy , we need to develop alternative sources of bandwidth .
Wired connections to the home  cable and telephone lines  are the major way that Americans move information .
In the United States and in most of the world , a monopoly or duopoly controls the pipes that supply homes with information .
These companies , primarily phone and cable companies , have a natural interest in controlling supply to maintain price levels and extract maximum profit from their investments  similar to how OPEC sets production quotas to guarantee high prices .
In pictures : Baghdad bombing Suicide bombers have killed at least 53 people and wounded about 240 in attacks on crowds in the Iraqi capital Baghdad and the northern city of Kirkuk .
Three blasts in Baghdad killed at least 28 Shia Muslim pilgrims heading for the city 's Kadhimiya shrine .
The attacks , which wounded about 90 people , were carried out by women suicide bombers , police said .
In Kirkuk , a suicide bomber targeted a crowd of Kurdish protesters , killing at least 25 and injuring at least 150 .
Kirkuk is disputed between Kurds , Arabs and Turkomans .
Demonstrators were protesting at a proposed law on local elections which has raised tensions there .
Heavy security
In Baghdad , the bombers struck as pilgrims passed through the central Karrada district on their way to the shrine of the revered 8th - Century imam , Musa al - Kadhim .

The city has been under heavy security because of the annual Shia pilgrimage .
Women and children were among those killed , security and hospital officials told AFP news agency
The BBC's Jim Muir in Baghdad says that major gatherings for Shia religious ceremonies have frequently been the target for bomb attacks , blamed on Sunni extremists .
Such attacks were a feature of the cycle of sectarian violence that gripped Iraq last year .
The attacks have been greatly reduced by US and Iraqi government forces taking action against Sunni - based insurgents on the one hand , and the Shia militias on the other .
But our correspondent says that stopping suicide bombers who move among crowds on foot , especially women wearing voluminous clothing , is particularly difficult .
The pilgrimage will reach a climax on Tuesday and more than a million worshippers are expected .
The Iraqi military spokesman in Baghdad , Brig Gen Qassim al - Moussawi , told AP news agency that 100,000 Iraqi security forces were being deployed - along with US reinforcements and air support - to protect the ceremonies in Kadhimiya .
Security forces are using about 200 women volunteers to search female pilgrims , AP said .
Despite the extra security , gunmen also shot dead seven pilgrims in the southern outskirts of Baghdad on Sunday .
The attacks come after an overall drop in the level of violence in Iraq in recent months .
Analysts says that radical Sunni groups - including al - Qaeda - have an added incentive to try to show it is not a spent force after being weakened in the Sunni heartland north and west of Baghdad .
However , violence in Kirkuk has a different dynamic , with an ongoing power struggle between the city 's three main ethnic groups .
Despite the bombings in Baghdad , some Shia pilgrims said they were determined to continue with the ceremonies .
" Today we are going to visit the holy Shrine of Imam Kadhim .
We pay no heed to bombings and death .
We are believing in God , " said Jassim Jihad .
In 2005 more than 900 people died in a stampede on the route to the shrine .
The panic had been started by rumours of a suicide bomber in the crowd .

China has reneged on a pledge to provide journalists covering the Beijing Games with unrestricted internet access , Olympic officials have admitted .
Kevan Gosper , a senior member of the International Olympics Committee ( IOC ) who is overseeing the games , said yesterday that the only uncensored websites journalists at the event would have access to were those related to " Olympic competitions " .
The admission contradicts China 's promise to grant the international media " complete freedom to report " at the games , which it made seven years ago when bidding to host the Olympics .
The blocks on internet sites in the main press centre , which will house about 5,000 journalists , and other Olympic venues will make it difficult to retrieve information , particularly on political and human rights stories the government dislikes .
Journalists at the main press centre yesterday found they were unable to access sites such as Amnesty International or any site with Tibet in the URL .
Some also complained about slow speeds , suggesting it might be an intentional ploy to discourage use .
" This type of censorship would have been unthinkable in Athens , but China seems to have more formalities , " said Mihai Mironica , a journalist with ProTV in Romania .
" If journalists cannot fully access the internet here , it will definitely be a problem . "
And in April , Gosper and another senior IOC member , Hein Verbruggen , said they had received assurances from Chinese officials that web censorship would be lifted for journalists during the games .
But Gosper yesterday said the IOC had only negotiated free access to sites about the games .
" My preoccupation and responsibility is to ensure that the games competitions are reported openly to the world , " he said .
" The regulatory changes we negotiated with Bocog [ Beijing Olympic Games ] , and which required Chinese legislative changes were to do with reporting on the games .
This did n't necessarily extend to free access and reporting on everything that relates to China . "
IOC officials have said the internet would be operational by " games time , " which began on Sunday , when the Olympic village opened .
The IOC has maintained the Olympics is a sports event , and it should not intervene in politics .
But human rights activists and media groups have criticised the IOC for failing to hold China to the promises made seven years ago when it won the bid .
" It is truly sad to see the IOC fail in this regard , " said Vincent Brossell , a spokesman for the Paris - based press rights group Reporters Without Borders .
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen type Movie
About two years ago , Warner Bros. announced that 300 director Zack Snyder would be adapting that gold standard of comics , Watchmen , into a feature film .
The response was nothing short of orgiastic — from just about everyone except Watchmen ‘s own scribe , Alan Moore , who remains ambivalent about all the hoopla .
The 54 - year - old writer and co-creator of such seminal and erudite works as From Hell and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen ( both of which were adapted into eagerly anticipated movies that failed to match the quality of Moore ’s source material ) has a tangled history with the entertainment business .
Even in a time when comics creators are more influential than ever ( heck , The Spirit producers even gave comics great Frank Miller the helm ) , Moore simply wants to be left alone .
It ’s no surprise that Moore has been accused of being comics ’
Orson Welles — exceedingly talented , if profoundly prickly — and perhaps in certain incidents he ’s earned that description .
But when EW phoned him at his home in Northampton , England , we encountered a very different creature , one not unlike ( if we can be so bold ) his DC Comics character from 1983 , Swamp Thing .
Like the gentle giant who fought abominable invaders to save his wetland digs , the soft - spoken , somewhat reclusive Moore ( himself an imposing figure , what with his curtain of hair and thicket of beard ) battles Hollywood producers and mainstream comics publishers — fiscally minded forces he perceives as sullying his creative properties .
In this wide - ranging conversation , Moore talks in depth about those struggles , as well as about the new Watchmen movie , his upcoming League of Extraordinary Gentlemen installment , his next novel , magic , his favorite TV shows , singing along to South Park , and whether he ’ll ever shave his beard .
ENTERTAINMENT
WEEKLY : Do n’t you have the slightest curiosity about what Watchmen director Zack Snyder is doing with your work ?
ALAN MOORE : I would rather not know .
He ’s supposed to be a very nice guy .
He may very well be , but the thing is that he ’s also the person who made 300 .
I ’ve not seen any recent comic book films , but I did n’t particularly like the book 300 .
I had a lot of problems with it , and everything I heard or saw about the film tended to increase [ those problems ] rather than reduce them : [ that ] it was racist , it was homophobic , and above all it was sublimely stupid .
I know that that ’s not what people going in to see a film like 300 are thinking about but …
I was n’t impressed with that ….
I talked to [ director ]
Terry Gilliam in the ’ 80s , and he asked me how I would make Watchmen into a film .
I said , ” Well actually , Terry , if anybody asked me , I would have said , ‘ I would n’t . ” ’
And I think that Terry [ who aborted his attempted adaptation of the book ] eventually came to agree with me .
There are things that we did with Watchmen that could only work in a comic , and were indeed designed to show off things that other media can’t .
Do you think that any good can come of comics movies ?
I increasingly fear that nothing good can come of almost any adaptation , and obviously that ’s sweeping .
There are a couple of adaptations that are perhaps as good or better than the original work .
But the vast majority of them are pointless .

ENTERTAINMENT
WEEKLY :
You have n’t enjoyed any comics adaptations ?
Even the indie films ?
ALAN MOORE :
There are none that leap to mind .
I hear that the American Splendor film was pretty good .
I did n’t go and see the film ; I waited until Harvey [ Pekar ] and [ his wife ]
Joyce came over to our house — so I got the live talk .
We got to show them all around town — that was , for me , better than the film .
Has Warner Bros. tried to contact you about Watchmen ?
No , they ’ve all been told not to .
They get the message ….
I do n’t want anyone who works for DC comic books to contact me ever again , or I ’ll change my number … .
And I only started to get upset when I found out they [ DC Comics ] were trying to rob me of a couple thousand pounds .
It was over the Watchmen merchandising back in the ’ 80s , and they kind of eventually said , Oh , yeah , I suppose you do deserve this money .
But by that time the damage was done .
The only reason I ended up working for them again , during the ABC period from ’ 99 - ’ 04 , [ was because ]
I had already signed the contracts .
[ Editor ’s note : DC Comics President and Publisher Paul Levitz responds : ” We ’ve had our disagreements with Alan over the years , but we remain great fans of his talent and would be happy to work with him in the future if he ’s ever inclined . ” ]
Is there anything anyone could offer you — possibly outside DC and Warner Bros . — that could interest you in Hollywood ?
There ’s nothing that could get me interested in Hollywood again .
And , increasingly , there ’s nothing that could get me interested in the American comics industry again .
I ’m going to be doing more comics bits in the future , but that will most certainly be with [ his new publisher ]
Top Shelf or [ an indie ] company like Top Shelf .
Hollywood and American comics , I have given them a chance , and I think 20 years is long enough .
If they were going to deliver , they would have done it by now .
You , yourself , wrote a movie script in the ’ 80s , Fashion Beast .
I did , which was mercifully never itself brought to the screen .
I was doing it to see if I could write a screenplay , and to hang out with Malcolm McLaren [ the Sex Pistols impresario , who commissioned it ] .
Which is always a fun prospect .
What is it like when Alan Moore and Malcolm McLaren hang out ?
It ’s kind of about as amusing and cynical as you might expect .
He ’s considered by some to be the great evil music Svengali .
I ’m not saying that other people may not have completely different relationships with Malcolm — and , indeed , from reading most of the Sex Pistols biographies , I assume that that ’s probably the case .
But speaking only of my relationship with him :
He was an awful lot of fun , he seemed full of ideas , and I got paid for a film which never came out , so I was very happy with the arrangement !
But the thing is , Malcolm was also coming up with original ideas for these movies , which is something else that attracted me to him … .
I see a kind of degeneration , if you like , in terms of the imagination that those pioneers back in the 19th century were gifted with , and kind of recycled ideas that we tend to get served up today … .
So often any film that comes out is going to be a sequel or a remake of a film that ’s previously existed — and I ’ve said this before , that we will see Johnny Depp playing Cap ’n Crunch .
It will eventually get down to breakfast cereal mascots !
NEXT PAGE : Moore spills details on the latest League of Extraordinary Gentlemen installment and his novel , Jerusalem
ENTERTAINMENT
WEEKLY : Whereas The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen ( Vol. III ) : Century [ the third installment of Moore ’s Victorian - sleuthing comic , due out in April 2009 ] certainly stokes the imagination .
Why make it span three different eras — 1910 , 1968 , and the present ?
ALAN MOORE : [ Artist ] Kevin O’Neill and I realized we had two or three powerful stories .
It struck us that we might be able to link them together and make a three - part narrative , so that each would stand on it ’s own and thus relieve readers from any kind of painful cliffhanger between issues .
And yet the three stories would link up into an overarching narrative involving the occult .
How do these three chapters split up ?
The first book surrounds the coronation of King George , which was also the time The Threepenny Opera was set , a comet was passing overhead , and there was a general feeling of dread in the air .
We ’re also focusing on the occult fictions written around the time … [ like ] Aleister Crowley ’s [ 1917 ] book , Moonchild , where the protagonists are attempting to create a magically produced child that is going to usher in a new era .
[ Protagonist ]
Mina and her associates are trying to stop this from happening .
The second book [ revolves around ] that sort of peculiar 1960s melding of pop-star psychedelic lifestyles , fashionable interest in occultism , and to some degree , at least in London , crime .
We ’ve got it all centered around a big rock concert at Hyde Park .
Running all the way through this is the continuing threat of the production of a magical child who , by this time , we are fairly certain , is the Antichrist .
That second book ends very badly .
And they ’re not having a lot of luck .
The third part is set in 2008 when , basically , the League is in pieces — barely exists anymore — and this turns out to be the time at which the Antichrist project finally pays off , and this magical child finally manifests in quite a terrifying form .
You ’ve moved publishers , from DC Comics to Top Shelf .
Do you think that ’s going to affect your work ?
I think it ’s already affecting it .
Both me and Kevin have noticed that this third volume is very different from the first two [ published by DC Comics ] .
It ’s almost as if , while we were working within the confines of mainstream comics , we were perhaps unconsciously following the basic formulae of mainstream comics .
There ’s sort of an overall ethos in comics , in boys ’ adventure fiction , that you must keep the action moving , which is not really the standards of serious drama or literature .
So for this third volume of League , we ’re pacing it differently .
It ’s got a lot more depth and resonance , a lot more drama for the money .
And I think that the payoff of this first volume is that it will be frightening enough to make the reader forget the slower pace of its opening pages .
Tell me about your upcoming novel , Jerusalem .
This is probably taking up most of my time at the moment .
I ’ve been working on it for a couple of years , and it ’ll probably take me another couple of years .
I ’ve just passed the two - thirds mark ; I did a word count and it was 400,000 words , which means that the end result is gonna be somewhere between half and three - fourths of a million !
NEXT PAGE : The program that Moore says is , ” possibly the most stunning piece of television , full - stop . ”
ENTERTAINMENT
WEEKLY :
What is it about ?
ALAN MOORE : My first novel [ Voice of the Fire , released in the U.S. in 2004 ] was based upon Northamptonshire [ where he grew up ] , over the course of some 6,000 years .
I thought that with this one I would focus in upon this relatively tiny section of Northamptonshire called the Boroughs .
So I started to connect different things .
I remembered an incident during my childhood when my younger brother , Mike , had choked at the age of 3 or 4 , on a cough sweet … and he stopped breathing .
Because it was a fairly rundown neighborhood — there was n’t a telephone anywhere and nobody owned a car — a man who lived next door to us who had a vegetable delivery service drove my brother and mother to the hospital .
It would have taken about 10 minutes , even at a generous estimate ; apparently after two - and - a - half minutes I think it ’s brain death .
However , he was back with us by the end of the week .
I ’ve been having some thoughts myself , about life and death , where we go when we die .
Is death a fearful thing to you ?
Not at all .
Hopefully , if I do this book well enough , it will perhaps take some of the anxiety off of other people ’s shoulders … .
I started to formulate the theory , the idea [ of ] transience : that time is passing , that life is going away somewhere , that this is an illusion , albeit a persistent one .
And I think I can explain that pretty well somewhere in the course of this 2,000 - page leviathan .
Is there is an afterlife ?
Well , we may not need one .
That , just conceivably , we might get this life forever — you ’ll have to read the book to get the whole thing , but I tend to think that it ’s a pretty watertight theory :
That you do n’t get reincarnated as somebody else , but that you get reincarnated as yourself , over and over again .
You have the same thoughts , and you never know you ’ve done this [ before ] , except for those little moments of déjà vu .
Do you ever relax and just watch television ?
Selectively , mostly on DVD .
The absolute pinnacle of anything I ’ve seen recently has got to be The Wire .
It ’s the most stunning piece of television that has ever come out of America , possibly the most stunning piece of television full - stop .
That ’s a great example of storytelling that takes its time .
Absolutely , that is grown - up television !
It ’s novelistic .
You get to find out about all these tiny different aspects of Baltimore , to build up a huge picture of the city with all of its intricacies — from the wharf side , to the kids in the projects , to the power structure with the boardrooms and police department and governor ’s office .
And it ’s got some great writers :
It ’s got George Pelecanos and David Simon .
And so many wonderful characters , Bubbles , Omar .
So yeah , everything else looks pretty lame next to The Wire .
What did you think of the ending ?
We ’ve not seen the final season yet .
I ’m quite excited — do n’t tell me anything about it !
With something like The Wire , do you ever think , I might not mind writing for TV ?
That would be a possibility — but there again , I know how hard I have to fight .
Apparently , HBO is being absolute princes with regards to The Wire .
It ’s never had huge audiences , but they ’ve kept funding it .
They realized that this is a timeless , prestige program .
This is one of the reasons why I ’ve withdrawn from the comics industry : I do not want to deal with the people in these various industries anymore .
But if that could somehow magically be arranged , if I could think of a good enough story , and if it had a chance of being the same caliber as The Wire — then yes , I would perhaps think about it .
I do also tend to keep up on comedy programs .
NEXT PAGE : A South Park sing - a- long !
ENTERTAINMENT
WEEKLY : Which comedies do you like watching ?
ALAN MOORE : Well , over here , at the moment , we ’ve had some very good ones .
There ’s The Mighty Boosh , which is [ Laughs ] idiotically wonderful , childish , surreal , fantasy .
There ’s also a show called Snuffbox , and it ’s one of the darkest , funniest comedies I ’ve seen in ages .
And I ’m a very big fan of South Park .
Have you seen the ” Trapped in the Closet ” episode ?
[ Sings ] ” I ’m trapped in the closet ! ” Yeah , that was terrific .
I thought the way that South Park handled that bit with the Scientologists was wonderful .
I was also quite heartened the other day when watching the news to see that there were demonstrations outside the Scientology headquarters over here , and that they suddenly flashed to a clip showing all these demonstrators wearing V for Vendetta [ Guy Fawkes ] masks .
That pleased me .
That gave me a warm little glow .
Are you still practicing magic ?
Well , yes , practice makes perfect .
How did you first get into it ?
I was turning 40 and thinking , Oh dear , I ’m probably going to have one of those midlife crisis things which always just bore the hell out of everybody .
So it would probably be better if , rather than just having a midlife crisis , I just went completely screaming mad and declared myself to be a magician .
That would , at least , be more colorful .
So , I announced , on the night of my 40th birthday party — probably after more beers than I should have had — that , ” from this point on , I ’m going to become a magician . ”
And then the next morning you have to think , Oh , what have I said now ?
Are we going to have to go through with this ?
So I had to go about finding out what a magician was and what they did .
What is the end result of practicing magic ?
Is it a type of spirituality ?
The mystics all seem to want to go straight to the Godhead ; the magicians tend to be more curious .
They want to explore all of the other aspects of the universe .
For me , there is very little difference between magic and art .
To me , the ultimate act of magic is to create something from nothing :
It ’s like when the stage magician pulls the rabbit from the hat .
And then you can turn that idea into a film , a book , a painting , a piece of music , something that other people can experience .
That in itself is stunning .
And I suppose this is one of the reasons I got into magic , because I was tired of ducking that question that people always ask writers , which is , ” Where do you get your ideas from ? ”
San Diego Comic - Con is approaching .
Have you ever attended it ?
No…well , I mean , I stopped going in the late ’ 80s .
I just thought , I do n’t really want to do this anymore , and I do n’t really see why I am doing it .
I did find it a bit overwhelming and creepy .
Well , you ’re a god there .
And this is the last way that I want to be treated .
The reason that I live in Northampton is because everyone here is kind of used to me .
I mean , yeah , I do get a gratifying smattering of people coming up to me in the street and thanking me for me work , and shaking me hand and just wanting to wish me well .
Although if you shaved your beard and cut your hair — no one would recognize you !
No one would recognize me .
Would you ever do that ?
No , just the laziness that has enabled my beard to get to this length is not a habit that I ’m going to shake now .
But it would be your greatest act of magic : ” Where did Alan Moore go ! ? ”
Well , I saw the possibility , of course .
I ’ve always got this option .
So should I need to disappear , then , if you see a sort of bald guy with a really bad shaving rash going around somewhere , then that will probably be me , yeah .
Some members of Congress are n't happy about the Navy 's desire to kill off the $ 5 - billion - a - copy DDG - 1000 warship program and buy cheaper Arleigh Burke - class ships instead , The Boston Globe reports :
Led by Senator Edward M. Kennedy , __ __the dozen senators from Massachusetts , Maine , and elsewhere threatened to hold up other shipbuilding funds if the Navy does n't provide more explanation for why it wo n't buy more of the DDG - 1000 Zumwalt class of ships after the first two are finished around 2014 .
" A shift of this magnitude in the Navy 's shipbuilding plan requires a full review ...
including congressional oversight , " the lawmakers wrote to
Defense Secretary Robert Gates .
" To do otherwise would undermine the Navy 's shipbuilding plan . "
Perhaps , but jobs and votes certainly are a factor in the senators ' objections .
Kennedy 's constituents include defense firm Raytheon , which builds the DDG - 1000 's electronics .
As Galrahn from the excellent Information Dissemination blog reports , the DDG - 1000 's industrial base is spread over a greater number of states than that for the Burke class .
" Many sub - contractors from all across the nation lose big " in the switch from DDG - 1000s to Burkes .
" This will be a factor in any Congressional vote " to end , or preserve , the DDG - 1000 .

Ghrelin regulates hunger pangs
High levels of the " hunger hormone " ghrelin have an antidepressant effect , US researchers claim .
Blocking the body 's response to ghrelin has been suggested as a weight loss treatment but it may also produce unintended effects on mood , they said .
The Nature Neuroscience study found mice with increased levels of the hormone showed fewer signs of depression and anxiety .
Experts said the idea was interesting but further studies were needed .
Ghrelin is released by the empty stomach into the bloodstream before moving to the brain , where it triggers feelings of hunger .
An unfortunate side effect , however , is increased food intake and body weight
Dr Jeffrey Zigman Treatment with the hormone itself - or a drug designed to cancel its effects - might be able to help both people who are eating too little , such as cancer patients , or those who eat too much , researchers believe .
In the latest study , Dr Jeffrey Zigman and colleagues restricted the food intake of laboratory mice for 10 days , causing their ghrelin levels to quadruple .
Compared with mice who had free access to food , the calorie - restricted mice showed lower levels of depression and anxiety when subjected to mazes and other behaviour tests .
Hormone response
The team also looked at mice genetically engineered to be unable to respond to ghrelin .
When they were fed a restricted - calorie diet they did not experience the antidepressant or anti-anxiety effects .
The researchers found the same thing when they induced higher ghrelin levels by subjecting the mice to stress .
Those mice that could not respond to ghrelin had greater levels of depression - like symptoms than the normal mice .
" Our findings in mice suggest that chronic stress causes ghrelin levels to go up , and that behaviours associated with depression and anxiety decrease when ghrelin levels rise , " said Dr Zigman , a researcher at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas .
" An unfortunate side effect , however , is increased food intake and body weight , " he added .
He said the results made sense from an evolutionary standpoint , as hunter - gatherers may have had a survival advantage in remaining calm and collected in times of hunger in order for them to successfully find food .
The researchers are now hoping to look at the antidepressant effect of the hormone in conditions such as anorexia .
Professor Stephen Bloom , an expert in appetite regulation at Imperial College London , said it was reasonable to believe that ghrelin had an impact on behavioural responses other than just hunger .
But he said there was a lot of research to be done before it could be confirmed that a hormone released in the stomach can have an effect on mood in the brain .
" The role of ghrelin in the gut and in the brain are likely to be completely different , " he said .

For more than 200 years there have been people who have argued that the world is overpopulated , and that this is the main cause of poverty , unemployment , homelessness and damage to the environment .
In 1798 an English clergyman , the Reverend Thomas Malthus , published his Essay on the Principle of Population .
He argued that population always tends to grow faster than food production and that therefore , without severe moral restraint , mass poverty and famine were inevitable .
Now , with food prices rocketing , oil at $ 140 a barrel , recession looming and hostility to immigrants being whipped up all over the place , addressing this argument is more urgent than ever .
Socialists , beginning with Karl Marx and Frederick Engels , who called Malthus ’s theory “ a slander on the human race ” , have always rejected the overpopulation argument .
It is false on principle because it inverts the relationship between human beings and their means of subsistence , and it is also completely at variance with historical and contemporary facts .
World population stands at about 6.7 billion .
It is growing , but it is not exploding .
The rate of growth is in fact declining .
Between 1950 and 2000 the global population grew from 2.5 billion to 6.0 billion – an increase of 140 percent .
But in the 50 years to 2050 experts on population predict it will rise by just 50 percent , and in the fifty years after that by 11 percent .
The reason for this pattern is simple – world birth rates continue to exceed death rates , but birth rates are falling because , as living standards , education and medical care improve , women have fewer children .
The growth in population is not outstripping food production .
Between 1950 and 1970 , world food production rose by 250 percent , completely outstripping population growth over the same period .
There is no world food shortage .
On the contrary there is more than enough food produced in the world to supply everyone with a decent diet .
Density
If people are starving and there are food riots breaking out across the world , this is because of the inability of the poor to pay the prices demanded by the market .
In other words it is because of capitalist economics and capitalist politics .
Nor is the prosperity of individual countries determined by , or even significantly related to , their population size or population density .
For example Bolivia in South America has a population density of 8.4 people per square kilometre , and a GDP per capita ( the total amount of goods and services produced divided equally among the population ) of £ 2,030 .
Venezuela , conversely , has a population density of 28.5 people per square kilometre and a GDP per capita of £ 6,190 .
Therefore Venezuela is more than three times more densely populated than Bolivia , but is three times as rich .
The lack of a link between population density and the wealth of a society can also been seen if we compare two Asian countries .
India has a population density of 345 people per square kilometre , broadly similar to Japan at 343 .
Yet India has a GDP per capita of just £ 1,370 , compared to Japan ’s £ 16,750 .
India and Japan have similar population densities , but very different histories – India was colonised , while Japan was a colonising power – and hugely different levels of economic prosperity .
What these examples prove is that it is economics , politics , imperialism and war – in a word , history – that determine a country ’s living standards , not the size of its population .
And that fact goes to heart of what is wrong with the whole overpopulation argument .
Its proponents take a country ’s goods – its food , houses , health service , jobs , wealth and so on – as more or less fixed in quantity to which the population should be adjusted .
In reality people produce all these goods , so an increase in the number of people means not only increased demand for these products , but also an increase in the number of people available to produce them .
If this were not so the history of humanity would be an unmitigated disaster of increasing impoverishment and unemployment as the world population increased from around 200 million in 1BC , 310 million in the year 1000 , 978 million in 1800 , to 1,650 million in 1900 .
In fact , the basic tendency has been for humanity to get richer ( albeit incredibly unequally ) , survive better and live longer – which is precisely why the population has increased !
What prevents the process from being even or harmonious are the contradictions inherent in class society , especially capitalism with its periodic wars and economic crises .
Because capitalism makes production dependent on profit , production falls when rates of profit fall , regardless of population size or the effects on the population in terms of poverty , unemployment or starvation .
The politics of this whole question are at their sharpest over the issues of climate change and immigration .
Many greens and other genuinely concerned people who might broadly accept the argument presented so far begin to change their tune when it comes to the environment .
The earth ’s resources are finite , they say , and human beings are using them up .
The more human beings there are , the more pressure on these resources , and unless population growth is stopped , the planet will be destroyed .
But this reasoning is as false as the arguments already refuted and repeats the same basic error .
Emissions
Yes , the earth ’s resources are finite .
But this does not mean that human activity is anywhere near reaching those limits , either now or in the foreseeable future .
This is because while some resources , such as oil , may be fixed in quantity , others such as the power of the wind or tides can only be harnessed or “ produced ” by human labour in the same sense that food is .
Consequently an increased population means potentially more labour to create more of these resources .
Where the carbon emissions that generate climate change are concerned , it is not people as such that produce these emissions but , overwhelmingly , the burning of fossil fuels .
The reason our societies are locked into the burning of these fuels , despite the knowledge that it is leading to catastrophe , is not due to the size of their populations but the crucial role fossil fuels play in the profits of big business .
Those who cite population reduction as a way to stop climate change are really saying they find it easier to conceive of “ losing ” a billion or so people , rather than contemplate overthrowing capitalism , or even seriously challenging its priorities .
When it comes to immigration , the overpopulation argument is largely a fig leaf for xenophobia and racism – though proponents of this argument always insist it is a question of numbers , not of race .
Britain is simply full up , they say .
The falsity of this claim is obvious when one thinks of the vast empty spaces in the Scottish Highlands , Mid Wales and North Yorkshire .
Clearly what they mean to say is that the country is full up because of the lack of jobs , homes , and services .
But this brings us back to the original argument that the quantity of these things is not fixed .
People , including immigrants , produce them and it is therefore utterly wrong to blame unemployment or housing shortages on immigration .
Underlying the claim that immigration is causing unemployment is the idea that some people ( such as foreigners or black people ) are not entitled to jobs , or at least are less entitled than others ( such as the British ) .
Both the absurdity and the racism of this way of thinking is neatly exposed if one simply substitutes some other group ( red haired people , for example ) instead of foreigners .
Try saying , “ Its those red haired lot that I blame .
There are two million gingers and two million unemployed – kick out the gingers and we ’d all have a job , ” and the ridiculous nature of racism is clear .
Unfortunately in a period of economic and social crisis it is much easier for such a ludicrous argument to gain ground , particularly among those who are forced to complete for life ’s basics .
In the end all the claims about overpopulation boil down to same thing – blaming people for the problems of the system .
That is why socialists should reject them root and branch .

Till now , DOJ guidelines have required the FBI to have some evidence of wrongdoing before it opens an investigation .
The impending new rules , which would be implemented later this summer , allow bureau agents to establish a terrorist profile or pattern of behavior and attributes and , on the basis of that profile , start investigating an individual or group .
Agents would be permitted to ask “ open- ended questions ” concerning the activities of Muslim Americans and Arab - Americans .

Kucinich impeach bill charges Bush ‘ fabricated threats ’; Pelosi hints at possible hearing —
TheRawstory , Mike Sheehan — Former Democratic presidential candidate Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) held a press conference today in which he presented a single article of impeachment of President George W. Bush .
“ Yesterday in the House , ” Kucinich said , according to prepared text , “ we had a moment of silence for the troops .
Today it is time to speak out on behalf of those troops who will be in Iraq for at least another year , courageously representing our nation while their Commander in Chief sent them on a mission that was based on falsehoods about the threat of WMDs from Iraq . ”
He continued , “ Throughout the summer and fall of 2002 , the Congress , the media and the American people heard the terrifying drumbeat of fear from the Bush White House in the form of loud , well - advertised and orchestrated chanting by the President and his Administration about ‘ Weapons of Mass Destruction , ’ ‘ Nuclear Threats , ’ ‘ Biological Weapons , ’ ‘ Chemical Weapons , ’ ‘ Threats of Imminent Attack , ’ all calculated to gain media attention , public support and Congressional support for a war against Iraq .
Kucinich is to formally introduce the single article of impeachment to Congress later this afternoon .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) , long opposed to the impeachment of the president , today raised eyebrows when she said Thursday that the House Judiciary committee could hold hearings on Kucinich ’s impeachment articles sometime in the near future , as RAW STORY earlier reported .
Kucinich ’s article is titled , ‘ Deceiving Congress with Fabricated Threats of Iraq WMDs to Fraudulently Obtain Support for an Authorization of the Use of Military Force Against Iraq ’ and focuses , as the Ohio Democrat described , on “ what the President presented to Congress in the Authorization of the Use of Military Force .
It does not address the voluminous evidence of orchestrated deceptions which have been well documented by various governmental , non-governmental and media sources .
“ I understand that many members of Congress voted in good faith to authorize the use of force against Iraq , ” Kucinich then said , “ and I understand that many in the media supported that action .
When the President of the United States makes representations on matters of life and death , we all want to believe him and give him the benefit of the doubt .
Trust is the glue which holds the fabric of our nation together .
“ Those in Congress and in the media who acted on the President ’s representations of the threat of Iraq WMDs did so trusting that those representations were honest .
Unfortunately , they were not .
He continued , “ We all know the consequences of the war , the loss of lives and injury to our troops , the deaths of innocent Iraqis , the cost to the American taxpayers .
There has been another consequence : Great damage to our Constitution through an unnecessary , illegal war and the destruction of the superior role of Congress in the life of this nation .
“ Congress must , ” Kucinich asserted , “ in the name of the American people , use the one remedy which the Founders provided for an Executive who gravely abused his power : Impeachment .
“ Congress must reassert itself as a co-equal branch of government ; bring this President to an accounting , and in doing so reestablish the people ’s trust in Congress and in our United States system of government .
We must not let this President ’s conduct go unchallenged and thereby create a precedent which undermines the Constitution .
He continued , “ In the final analysis this is about our Constitution and whether a President can be held accountable for his actions and his deceptions , especially when the effects of those actions have been so calamitous for America , Iraq and the world .
“ Unless Congress reasserts itself as the power branch of government which the Founders intended , our experiment with a republican form of Government may be nearing an end , ” Kucinich said in closing .
“ But when Congress acts to hold this President accountable it will be redeeming the faith that the Founders had in the power of a system of checks and balances which preserves our republic . ”
Following is a draft of the impeachment article as issued by Kucinich .

AN ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT OF PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH
INTRODUCED BY CONGRESSMAN DENNIS J. KUCINICH
JULY 10 , 2008
Resolved , that President George W. Bush be impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors , and that the following Article of Impeachment be exhibited to the United States Senate :
An Article of Impeachment exhibited by the House of Representatives of the United States of America in the name of itself and of the people of the United States of America , in maintenance and support of its impeachment against President George W. Bush for high crimes and misdemeanors .
ARTICLE ONE
DECEIVING CONGRESS WITH FABRICATED THREATS OF IRAQ WMDs TO FRAUDULENTLY OBTAIN SUPPORT FOR AN AUTHORIZATION OF THE USE OF MILITARY FORCE AGAINST IRAQ .
In his conduct while President of the United States , George W. Bush , in violation of his constitutional oath to faithfully execute the office of President of the United States and , to the best of his ability , preserve , protect , and defend the Constitution of the United States , and in violation of his constitutional duty under Article II , Section 3 of the Constitution “ to take care that the laws be faithfully executed , ” deceived Congress with fabricated threats of Iraq Weapons of Mass Destruction ( WMD ) to fraudulently obtain support for an authorization for the use of force against Iraq and used that fraudulently obtained authorization , then acting in his capacity under Article II , Section II of the Constitution as Commander in Chief , to commit US troops to combat in Iraq .
To gain Congressional support for passage of the Joint Resolution to Authorize the Use of United States Armed Forces Against Iraq , the President made the following material representations to the Congress in SJ Res 45 :
That Iraq was “ continuing to possess and develop a significant chemical and biological weapons capability … ”
That Iraq was “ actively seeking a nuclear weapons capability … ”
That Iraq was “ continuing to threaten the national security interests of the United States and international peace and security . ”
That Iraq has demonstrated a “ willingness to attack , the United States … ” That “ members of Al Qaida , an organization bearing responsibility for attacks on the United States , its citizens and interests , including the attacks that occurred on September 11 , 2001 , are known to be in Iraq … ”
The “ attacks on the United States of September 11 , 2001 , underscored the gravity of the threat that Iraq will transfer weapons of mass destruction to international terrorist organizations … ”
That Iraq “ will either employ those weapons to launch a surprise attack against the United States or its Armed Forces or provide them to international terrorists who would do so , … ” That an “ extreme magnitude of harm that would result to the United States and its citizens from such an attack , … ” That the aforementioned threats “ justify action by the United States to defend itself ; … ” The enactment clause of Section 2 of SJ Res 45 , the Authorization of the Use of the United States Armed Forces authorizes the President to “ defend the national security interests of the United States against the threat posed by Iraq … ” Each consequential representation made by the President to the Congress in SJ Res 45 , in subsequent iterations and the final version was unsupported by evidence which was in the control of the White House .
Iraq was not “ continuing to possess and develop a significant chemical and biological weapons capability … ”
“ A substantial amount of Iraq ’s chemical warfare agents , precursors , munitions and production equipment were destroyed between 1991 and 1998 as a result of Operation Desert Storm and United Nations Special Commission ( UNSCOM ) actions … .
There is no reliable information on whether Iraq is producing and stockpiling chemical weapons or whether Iraq has–or will –establish its chemical warfare agent production facilities . ”

“ In April and early May 2003 , military forces found mobile trailers in Iraq .
Although intelligence experts disputed the purpose of the trailers , Administration officials repeatedly asserted that they were mobile biological weapons laboratories .
In total , President Bush , Vice President Cheney , Secretary Rumsfeld , Secretary Powell , and National Security Advisor Rice made 34 misleading statements about the trailers in 27 separate public appearances .
Shortly after the ( mobile trailers were found , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) issued an unclassified white paper evaluating the trailers .
The white paper was released without coordination with other members of the intelligence community , however .
It was disclosed later that engineers from DIA who examined the trailers concluded that they were most likely used to produce hydrogen for artillery weather balloons .
A former senior intelligence official reported that “ only one of 15 intelligence analysts assembled from three agencies to discuss the issue in June endorsed the white paper conclusion . ”

Former chief of CIA covert operations in Europe , Tyler Drumheller , has said that the CIA had credible sources discounting weapons of mass destruction claims , incuding the primary source of biological weapons claims , an informant who the Germans code - named “ Curveball ” whom the Germans had informed the Bush Administration was a likely fabricator and including the Niger Yellowcake forgery .
Two other former CIA officers confirmed Drumheller ’s account to Sidney Blumenthal who reported the story at Salon.com on September 6 , 2007 .
“ In practical terms , with the destruction of the Al Hakam facility , Iraq abandoned its ambition to obtain advanced biological weapons ( BW ) weapons quickly .
The Iraq Survey Group ( ISG ) found no direct evidence that Iraq , after 1996 , had plans for a new BW program or was conducting BW - specific work for military purposes .
Indeed , from the mid-1990s , despite evidence of continuing interest in nuclear and chemical weapons , there appears to be a complete absence of discussion or even interest in BW at the Presidential level .
In spite of exhaustive investigation , ISG found no evidence that Iraq possessed , or was developing BW agent production systems mounted on road vehicles or railway wagons ” ¦.

“ One , there is no indication of resumed nuclear activities in those buildings that were identified through the use of satellite imagery as being reconstructed or newly erected since 1998 , nor any indication of nuclear - related prohibited activities at any inspected sites .
Second , there is no indication that Iraq has attempted to import uranium since 1990 .
Three , there is no indication that Iraq has attempted to import aluminum tubes for use n centrifuge enrichment .
Moreover , even had Iraq pursued such a plan , it would have been — it would have encountered practical difficulties in manufacturing centrifuges out of the aluminum tubes in question .
Fourthly , although we are still reviewing issues related to magnets and magnet production , there is no indication to date that Iraq imported magnets for use in a centrifuge enrichment program .

“ [ British Secret Intelligence Service Chief Sir Richard Billing Dearlove ] reported on his recent talks in Washington .
There was a perceptible shift in attitude .
Military action was now seen as inevitable .
Bush wanted to remove Saddam , through military action , justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD .
But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy .
The NSC had no patience with the UN route , and no enthusiasm for publishing material on the Iraqi regime ’s record .
There was little discussion in Washington of the aftermath after military action … .
The Foreign Secretary ( of England ) said he would discuss this with Colin Powell this week .
It seemed clear that Bush had made up his mind to take military action , even if the timing was not yet decided .
But the case was thin .
Saddam was not threatening his neighbours , and his WMD capability was less than that of Libya , North Korea or Iran .
We should work up a plan for an ultimatum to Saddam to allow back in the UN weapons inspectors .
This would also help with the legal justification for the use of force . ”

Iraq had no connection with the attacks of 9/11 , or with al - Qaida ’s role in 9/11 .
“ The report [ of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence ] documents significant instances in which the Admnistration went beyond what the Intelligence Community knew or believed in making public claims , most notably on the false assertion that Iraq and al - Qaida had an operational partnership and joint involvement in carrying out the attacks of September 11th .
The President and his advisors undertook a relentless public campaign in the aftermath of the attacks to use the war against al - Qaida as a justification for overthrowing Saddam Hussein .
Representing to the American people that the two had an operational partnership and posed a single , indistinguishable threat was fundamentally misleading and led the Nation to war on false premises . ”

On June 16 , 2004 , a Staff Report from the 9/11 Commission stated : “ There has been reports that contacts between Iraq and al Qaeda also occurred after bin Laden had returned to Afghanistan [ in 1996 ] , but they do not appear to have resulted in a collaborative relationship … .
Two senior bin Laden associates have adamantly denied that any ties existed between al Qaeda and Iraq .

Iraq possessed no weapons of mass destruction to transfer .
Furthermore , available intelligence information found that the Iraq regime would only transfer weapons of mass destruction to terrorist organizations if under severe threat of attack by the United States :
According to information in the October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) on Iraq that was available to the Administration at the time they were seeking Congressional support for the authorization of the use of force against Iraq , the Iraq regime would transfer weapons to a terrorist organization only if “ sufficiently desperate ” because it feared that “ an attack that threatened the survival of the regime were imminent or unavoidable … ”
“ Iraq probably would attempt clandestine attacks against the US Homeland if Baghdad feared an attack that threatened the survival of the regime were imminent or unavoidable , or possibly for revenge .
Such attacks – more likely with biological than chemical agents – probably would be carried out by special forces or intelligence operatives .
“ The Iraqi Intelligence Service ( IIS ) probably has been directed to conduct clandestine attacks against US and Allied interests in the Middle East in the event the United States takes action against Iraq .
The IIS probably would be the primary means by which Iraq would attempt to conduct any CBW attacks on the US Homeland , although we have no specific intelligence information that Saddam ’s regime has directed attacks against US territory .
“ Saddam , if sufficiently desperate , might decide that only an organization such as al - Qa’ida – with worldwide reach and extensive terrorist infrastructure , and already engaged in a life - or - death struggle against the United States – would perpetrate the type of terrorist attack that he would hope to conduct .
“ In such circumstances , he might decide that the extreme step of assisting the Islamist terrorists in conducting a CBW attack against the United States would be his last chance to exact vengeance by taking a large number of victims with him . ”

There was not a real risk of an “ extreme magnitude of harm that would result to the United States and its citizens from such an attack ” because Iraq had no capability of attacking the United States .
“ Containment has been a successful policy , and I think we should make sure that we continue it until such time as Saddam Hussein comes into compliance with the agreements he made at the end of the ( Gulf ) War… .
[ Iraq is ] not threatening America . ”
Powell , Colin .
Secretary of State .
The aforementioned evidence did not “ justify the use of force by the United States to defend itself ” because Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction , or have the intention or capability of using the non-existent WMD ’s against the United States .
Since there was no threat posed by Iraq to the United States , the enactment clause was predicated on lying to Congress .
Congress relied on the information provided to it by the President of the United States .
Congress provided the President with the authorization to use military force that he requested .
As a consequence of the fraudulent representations made to the Congress , the United States Armed Forces , under the direction of George Bush as Commander in Chief , pursuant to Section 3 of the Authorization for the Use of Force which President Bush requested , invaded Iraq and occupies it to this day , at the cost of 4,116 lives of US service men and women , injuries to over 30,000 of our troops , the deaths of over 1,000,000 innocent Iraqi civilians , the destruction of Iraq , and a long term cost over $ 3 trillion .
President Bush ’s misrepresentations to Congress to induce passage of a use of force resolution is subversive of the Constitutional system of checks and balances , destructive of Congress ’ sole prerogative to declare war under Article I Section 8 of the Constitution , and is therefore a High Crime .
An even greater offense by the President of the United States occurs in his capacity as Commander in Chief , because he knowingly placed the men and women of the United States Armed Forces in harm ’s way , jeopardizing their lives and their families ’ future , for reasons that to this date have not been established in fact .
In all of these actions and decisions , President George W. Bush has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as President and Commander in Chief , and subversive of constitutional government , to the prejudice of the cause of law and justice and to the manifest injury of the people of the United States and of those members of the Armed Forces who put their lives on the line pursuant to the falsehoods of the President .
Wherefore , President George W. Bush , by such conduct , is guilty of an impeachable offense warranting removal from office .

Let us know what he tells you .
After Downing Street —
If you ’re able to speak with Conyers or his staff at any length , please remind them that Bush and Cheney and members of their administration are refusing to comply with numerous subpoenas and even contempt citations , as well as refusing to answer questions by claiming " executive privilege . "
During an impeachment hearing , there is no executive privilege .
The Judiciary Committee should hold an impeachment hearing of Bush and Cheney on refusal to comply with oversight .
It ’s the fastest way to justice and the only chance of establishing any oversight .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Sen .
Ted Stevens declared his innocence Tuesday after his indictment on charges that he concealed hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of gifts and services from a company in his home state .
Sen .
Ted Stevens , R - Alaska , says he is innocent of the charges a grand jury handed up on Tuesday .
" My public service began when I served in World War II .
It saddens me to learn that these charges have been brought against me .
... I am innocent of these charges and intend to prove that , " Stevens said in a statement released by his office .
In the indictment , Stevens is charged with lying about receiving gifts worth more than $ 250,000 from Veco , an Alaska - based energy company on whose behalf he intervened in Washington .
The indictment , returned Tuesday by a federal grand jury in Washington , says the veteran lawmaker " schemed to conceal " the fact that Veco paid for hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of work on his home .
The indictment follows a wide - ranging investigation into ties between the company and lawmakers in Alaska .
The indictment does not accuse Stevens of accepting bribes , Matt Friedrich , the acting assistant attorney general , emphasized in a news conference announcing the charges .
" Bribery is not charged in this case , " he said , adding that such a charge " requires proof of a specific quid pro quo .
This indictment does not allege that . "
Watch Friedrich announce and explain the indictment »
But it does accuse Stevens and his staff of receiving requests from Veco for help in Washington and acting on some of them .
In the 28 - page indictment , Stevens was charged with seven counts of making false statements on his Senate financial disclosure forms .
Stevens denied those charges , saying in the statement " I have never knowingly submitted a false disclosure form required by law as a U.S. senator . "
Stevens was caught by surprise Tuesday by his indictment , Sen. Daniel Inouye told CNN .
" Apparently , the media knew about it before he did , " Inouye said , adding he had just spoken to Stevens , a Republican from Alaska .
Stevens was meeting with Republican colleagues when the indictment was returned , and he was pulled out of the meeting , his colleague said .
" As far as he 's concerned , he 's not guilty .
And I believe him , " said Inouye , a Hawaii Democrat who is one of Stevens ' closest friends in the Senate .
The indictment says the home improvements provided by Veco and its chief executive officer , Bill Allen , a " personal friend of Stevens , " included a new first floor , a new garage , a new first - and second - story wraparound deck , new plumbing and new wiring .
Allen gave Stevens a new 1999 Land Rover worth $ 44,000 in exchange for $ 5,000 and Stevens ' 1964 Ford Mustang , which was worth less than $ 20,000 at the time , the indictment charged .
In exchange , Stevens " could and did use his official position and his office on behalf of Veco , " one of the state 's largest employers , the indictment charges .
Allen pleaded guilty in May 2007 , paying out more than $ 400,000 " in corrupt payments " to Alaska officials , the Department of Justice said in announcing the Stevens indictment .
Allen is cooperating with the Department of Justice as part of his plea agreement , Friedrich said .
Veco was acquired by another company , CH2M Hill , in September 2007 .
The indictment does not restrict Stevens ' ability to vote in the Senate , speak on the Senate floor or participate in committee work .
Stevens , however , did say he would relinquish his co-chairmanships and ranking member positions , in accordance with Senate Republican rules .
Reacting to the indictment , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nevada , said it was up to Senate Republicans to decide if any punishment was warranted .
" I , of course , have served with Sen .
Stevens my entire congressional career , " Reid said .
" It 's a sad day for him , us .
But I believe in the American system of justice that he is presumed innocent .
" As far as what 's going to happen in the Republican caucus , that 's up to them .
...
How they handle Stevens is certainly up to them .
It is not our responsibility .
I 'll cooperate in any way that I can . "
Sen . John Warner , a Virginia Republican , recalled that he and Stevens were veterans of World War II and that " he was a hero and a fighter , and he 's been a fighter for this country since then -- a fighter for his state ever since and a strong leader in the Senate .
" So all I can say is I hope this can turn out fairly consistent with the law and good decision , " Warner said .
Another Republican , Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania , said , " I have known Ted Stevens for 28 years , and I have always found him to be impeccably honest .
Sen. Barbara Boxer , a California Democrat who chairs the Senate ethics subcommittee , said she would release a statement later Tuesday .
FBI and Internal Revenue Service agents searched Stevens ' Alaska home in July 2007 in connection with the investigation , which has snared two oil company executives and a state lobbyist , among others .
At the time , he urged constituents " not to form conclusions based upon incomplete and sometimes incorrect reports in the media . "
The 84 - year - old senator is a former chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and is renowned for his prowess in steering federal funds to his vast , sparsely populated state .
Stevens is the oldest Republican senator and second in age only to Sen.
Robert Byrd , the 90 - year - old Democrat from West Virginia .
He has represented Alaska in Washington since 1968 and is up for re-election in November .
He is the longest - serving Republican senator in history .

Dennis Farina is a bum shot .
Still , Los Angeles International Airport police took no chances Sunday with the former “ Law and Order ” actor , who was teased for his poor shooting skills during his earlier career as a Chicago police officer .
Farina , 64 , was booked in a felony case after LAX screeners found a loaded handgun in his briefcase as he prepared to board a plane .
The actor , who is often cast as a foul - mouthed mobster or cop , was contrite when he told airport police and FBI agents that he had forgotten he put the .22 - caliber semi-automatic weapon in the case , authorities said .
He spent most of the day in a Van Nuys jail and was released on $ 35,000 bail .

“ He was apologetic and very cooperative , and he said he understood what was going to happen , ” said LAX Police Sgt. Jim Holcomb .
Farina had no permit for the gun , and it was not clear why he was carrying it .
A representative for the actor could not be reached .
Holcomb said Farina told investigators he put the gun in the case before driving to L.A. from Arizona for the United Airlines flight to Chicago .
He was booked on suspicion of carrying a concealed weapon .
The actor has starred in several feature films , including “ Get Shorty ” and “ Saving Private Ryan , ” and the current “ What Happens in Vegas . ” Farina served with the Chicago Police Department for nearly 20 years .

LAX police run into this problem -- of passengers forgetting they have guns in their carry - on luggage -- regularly , Holcomb said .
Most of the roughly 10 incidents a month involve police officers traveling as civilians .
“ People do n’t get it , ” Holcomb said .
“ When you go to an airport , the only people that can carry a gun are federal agents . ”
That ’s not to say high - profile travelers have n’t tried to board with weapons .
Rapper Snoop Dogg pleaded guilty in 2007 after screeners at John Wayne Airport in Orange County found a collapsible baton in his luggage .
Although the rapper said it was a prop for a music video , authorities deemed it otherwise .

David Huckabee , son of former presidential candidate Mike Huckabee , received a one - year suspended sentence last year after he was caught at a Little Rock , Ark. airport with a loaded Glock pistol in his bag .

Truthout
When Nancy Pelosi became Speaker of the House in 2006 , one of the first things out of her mouth was “ impeachment is off the table . ”
With this sentence she betrayed the American people and her oath of office .
But that ’s only scratching the surface of the problem …
We have witnessed a staggering abuse of power by President Bush .
Even former Bush Justice Department officials now charge him with trampling the Constitution .
Bush has claimed the prerogative to declare an endless war without congressional approval , to designate someone an enemy without cause , to proceed to wiretap them without warrant , arrest or kidnap them at will , jail them without a hearing , hold them indefinitely , interrogate them intensively ( read torture ) , bring them to trial outside the U.S. court system .
He claims that executive privilege exempts his aides – even the aides of his aides and his vice president ’s aides – from congressional investigation .
He claims the right to amend or negate congressional laws with a statement upon signing them .
And much more .
The possible consequences of Pelosi ’s colossal failure …
According to the leading case on presidential powers , if Bush ’s extreme assertions of power are not challenged by the Congress , they end up not simply creating new law , they could end up rewriting the Constitution itself .
Inaction can alter the Constitutional division of powers by establishing the president ’s claims as authority that the Congress or the courts may not infringe .
( Emphasis added )
Read that again .
Yeah , you read it right …
The Steel Seizure case – Youngstown Sheet and Tube v Sawyer , 343 U.S. 579 ( 1952 ) , remains the leading case on presidential power .
In Youngstown , a six - member majority of the Court joined in overturning President Truman ’s executive order nationalizing the steel plants to end a strike during the Korean War .
What does this have to do with anything ?
First , read the pertinent parts of the opinions in the Youngstown case , by Justice Felix Frankfurter :
Deeply embedded traditional ways of conducting government cannot supplant the Constitution or legislation , but they give meaning to the words of a text or supply them .
It is an inadmissibly narrow conception of American constitutional law to confine it to the words of the Constitution and to disregard the gloss which life has written upon them .
In short , a systematic , unbroken , executive practice , long pursued to the knowledge of the Congress and never before questioned , engaged in by Presidents who have also sworn to uphold the Constitution , making as it were such exercise of power part [ 343 U.S. 579 , 611 ] of the structure of our government , may be treated as a gloss on “ executive Power ” vested in the President by 1 of Art. II .
( Emphasis added )
Do you see where this is going ?
Now , Justice Robert H. Jackson :
When the president acts in absence of either a congressional grant or denial of authority , he can only rely upon his own independent powers , but there is a zone of twilight in which he and Congress may have concurrent authority , or in which its distribution is uncertain .
Therefore , congressional inertia , indifference or quiescence may sometimes , at least as a practical matter , enable , if not invite , measures on independent presidential responsibility .
In this area , any actual test of power is likely to depend on the imperatives of events and contemporary imponderables rather than on abstract theories of law .
When a president egregiously abuses his power – particularly in areas relating to the rights of American citizens – remedies are often difficult .
The Supreme Court is reluctant to arbitrate a power struggle between two co-equal branches .
That is why the Constitution prescribes the specific remedy of impeachment for crimes and abuses of power – “ high crimes and misdemeanors ” – and empowers the House and Senate to sit in judgment whether the actions are to be accepted or condemned .
( Emphasis added )
So , if the President continually oversteps the boundaries of the Executive , making assertions of unilateral power , with full knowledge and no questioning by Congress — those assertions become a Constitutional power of the Executive , which cannot be challenged by Congress or the Courts .
The Judiciary Committee in the House should formally convene that inquest , no matter what the decision is on impeachment .
For if Pelosi ’s sensible political judgment results , as it has to date , in a show of congressional “ inertia , indifference or quiescence , ” the Democratic majority in Congress may have gained a dozen seats at the cost of relinquishing its own powers , and putting the rights of Americans at risk .
Is this an unintended consequence of Pelosi ’s determination to gain a few Congressional seats in 2008 ?
Has this possibility not been presented to her ?
She ’s not stupid , and neither is Dick Cheney .
He ’s all for an extremely powerful Executive , and if Nancy does n’t find herself a table — or if she ’s not replaced —
Cheney could succeed beyond his wildest dreams .

McCain raises money off Obama ’s trip
John McCain , resigned to what an adviser memorably called “ table scraps ” of news coverage this week , has blasted a fundraising e-mail to supporters arguing that the press has “ a bizarre fascination with Barack Obama . ”
The e-mail has the blunt subject line : “ The media is in love . ”
Advertisement
Grammatically , it would be “ the media ARE in love , ” but his point is clear that news organizations are overdoing it in their expensive , extensive coverage of Obama 's weeklong swing through the Middle East and Europe .
The message to the “ McCain Team ” from the “ McCain Campaign ” reads :
“ It 's pretty obvious that the media has a bizarre fascination with Barack Obama .
Some may even say it 's a love affair .
We want you to be the judge .
We 've compiled two videos of the more outrageous moments of this not so secret love affair .
Follow this link to watch the two videos and vote on which one you think is better .
Your vote will determine which video we put on the air .
The media is in love with Barack Obama .
If it was n't so serious , it would be funny . ”
The link leads to a page with a Valentine ’s color scheme , emblazoned with red hearts and saying , “ The media is in LOVE with Barack , ” and invites visitors to vote for clips of two montages from cable news shows , accompanied by the line “ Love Is in the Air . ”
The e-mail has buttons to “ Join Our Team , ” “ Send to Friends ” and “ Contribute . ”
Wall Street could keep falling a long way yet .
I do n't know when it will stop , and I do n't trust anyone who says they do know .
Trying to guess when and where it will stop is a waste of your time and money .

The market , he intoned gravely when asked , " will fluctuate . "
It 's still true .
When it comes to the economy , clearly there are a lot of problems , and many banks are in trouble .
Too many Americans owe too much money , and this will need to be unwound .
We may , indeed , go through the biggest process of balance sheet repair in many decades .
But even after saying all that , it is far too easy to get too gloomy , too panicky , and too bearish about your investments .
It 's always supposed to be the end of the world when the market falls .
Here are 10 reasons to be more bullish .

Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Admiral Michael Mullen appeared to warn Israel on Wednesday against an attack on Iran .
He said at news conference , “ Opening up a third front right now would be extremely stressful on us . . .
This is a very unstable part of the world , and I do n’t need it to be more unstable . ”
Mullen is afraid of all hell breaking loose in Iraq and Afghanistan in the aftermath of an attack on Iran , and of all the Pentagon ’s efforts in both places coming unraveled .
Mullen was a nominee of Secretary of Defense Robert Gates , who is known to concur with Mullen on this matter .
They are boxing up Dick Cheney , who , his former adviser David Wurmser said , was angling for an Israeli attack on Iran if an American one could not be arranged for .
It is not clear what would be attacked , anyway .
Civilian enrichment labs permitted by the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty ?
Apparently under Cheney ’s CIA it was it was not allowed for an analyst to say that Iran and Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction or that Iran had given up any weapons research in early 2003 .

Later on , they Said they became fortunate on arresting the governor
Police imprisoned the head of the local council for the province , Abd al - Jabbar Wahid al - Ukayli .
He and other arrested officials were accused by the police of being Special Groups linked to Iran .
This accusation is unlikely to be true , since the Sadrist dislike Iran and are Iraqi nationalists .
The Iraq War has soured so many military families on the Republican Party that the Dems may split their vote this year instead of only getting 25 % of it .

Scientists in Japan have worked out a new technique for improving the lifespan of flash memory devices from around a decade currently to hundreds of years .
The new ferroelectric NAND flash technology can do rewrites 100 million times , versus the 10,000 or so of existing tech , and can be scaled down to 10 nm — one third the size of next - gen conventional flash .
Furthermore , the ferroelectric chips use a " wear leveling " system to even - out the usage of memory cells , and can even disable bad cells without killing the whole chip .
Plus it uses a rewriting voltage of 6 volts versus the 20 + volts of current chips .
Sounds like a promising , long - life , low - power future for solid - state drives .
Though as with all these advances it 'll be a good while ' til we see actual products .

I 've recently been working on a fairly large javascript project that was using the Ext javascript library .
Ext is a powerful javascript library that provides lots of UI widgets , in addition to a DOM manipulation API .
The complete Ext library comes in at 546KB , and on this project we were only really using the Ext DOM functions , which made the library a bit overkill .
The decision was made to use jQuery instead , which weighs in at only 16KB .
I set about replacing all the existing Ext code with jQuery equivalents .
The majority of Ext functions map directly onto jQuery equivalents , which made things easier .
For example :
Ext .
get ( ' id ' ) -& gt ; $ ( ' #id ' )
Ext .
get ( ' id ' ) . query ( '.class ' ) -& gt ; $ ( ' #id .class ' )
Some things do n't map quite so well , but are still relatively simple .
The position functions are one such example :
Ext .
get ( ' id ' ) . getAbsoluteXY ( ) -& gt ; [ $ ( ' #id ' ) . offset ( ) . left , $ ( ' #id ' ) . offset ( ) . top ]
Ext .
get ( ' id ' ) . bottom ( ) -& gt ; $ ( ' #id ' ) . offset ( ) . top + $ ( ' #id ' ) . height ()
However , some Ext functions have no equivalents at all in jQuery .
Two Ext functions we were using with no jQuery equivalent were serialiseForm and decodeJson .
I came up with the replacement functions below :
$ . fn .
decodeJson = function ( string ) { // if we do n't have a string then there is n't any decoding to be done , return as is if ( typeof ( string ) != " string " ) return string ; // make sure the string starts with { and ends with } if ( string .
substr ( 0 , 1 ) == " { " & amp ; & amp ; string .
substr ( string .
length - 1 , 1 ) == " } " ) { eval ( " var decoded = " + string ) ; return decoded ; } return {};} $ . fn .
serialiseForm = function ( form ) { //
We might have been passed a form ID , or a form object if ( typeof ( form ) == " string " ) form = jQuery ( ' # ' + form ) ; // lets try ourselves !
var getValuesFromForm = function ( form ) { var serialised = [ ] ; jQuery ( form ) . children ( ) . each ( function ( ) { var child = jQuery ( this ) ; if ( child .
children ( ) . length & gt ; 0 ) { var t = getValuesFromForm ( child ) ; if ( t . length & gt ; 0 ) jQuery .
merge ( serialised , t ) ; } var name = child .
attr ( ' name ' ) ; var type = child .
attr ( ' type ' ) ; var val = child . val ( ) ; if ( name ) { if ( type != ' checkbox ' ) { serialised .
push ( encodeURI ( name ) + ' =' + encodeURI ( val ) ) ; } else { var checked = child .
attr ( ' checked ' ) ; if ( checked ) { serialised .
push ( encodeURI ( name ) + ' =' + encodeURI ( val ) ) ; } } } } ) ; return serialised ; } var data = getValuesFromForm ( form ) . join ( " & " ) ; return data ; }
The only feature of Ext being used without a relatively simple replacement was Ext.basicDialog , a UI widget .
The jQuery BlockUI plugin came to the rescue :
dialog . hide ( ) -& gt ; $ . unblockUI ( ) ;
During this rewrite I came to appreciate just how powerful jQuery selectors are .
The codebase was considerably smaller after the rewrite , due to the expressiveness of jQuery .
Many 3 or 4 liners in Ext would condense down to a single expression in jQuery !
It is part of a general decline in violence that is resonating in American as well as Iraqi politics : Senator John McCain argues that the advances in Iraq would have been impossible without the increase in American troops known as the surge , while Senator Barack Obama , who opposed the increase , says the security improvements should allow a faster withdrawal of combat troops .
The Mahdi Army ’s decline also means that the Iraqi state , all but impotent in the early years of the war , has begun to act the part , taking over delivery of some services and control of some neighborhoods .
“ The Iraqi government broke their branches and took down their tree , ” said Abu Amjad , a civil servant who lives in the northern Baghdad district of Sadr City , once seen as an unbreachable stronghold for the group .
The change is showing up in the lives of ordinary people .
The price of cooking gas is less than a fifth of what it was when the militia controlled local gas stations , and kerosene for heating has also become much less expensive .
In interviews , 17 Iraqis , including municipal officials , gas station workers and residents , described a pattern in which the militia ’s control over the local economy and public services had ebbed .
Merchants say they no longer have to pay protection money to militiamen .
In some cases , employees with allegiances to the militia have been fired or transferred .
Despite the militia ’s weakened state , none of the Iraqis interviewed agreed to have their full names published for fear of retribution .
In a further sign of weakness , Shiite tribes in several neighborhoods are asking for compensation from militia members ’ families for past wrongs .
It is known as the Inland Empire : a vast stretch of land tucked in the high desert valleys east of Los Angeles .
Once home to fruit trees and Indians , it is now a concrete sprawl of jammed freeways , endless suburbs and shopping malls .
But here , in the heartland of the four - wheel drive , a revolution is under way .
What was once unthinkable is becoming a shocking reality : America 's all - consuming love affair with the car is fading .
Surging petrol prices have worked where environmental arguments have failed .
Many Americans have long been told to cut back on car use .
Now , facing $ 4 - a - gallon fuel , they have no choice .
Take Adam Garcia , a security guard who works near the railway station in Riverside .
Like many Inland Empire residents , he commutes a huge distance : 100 miles a day .
He used to think nothing of it .
But now , faced with petrol costs that have tripled , he is taking action .
He has even altered the engine of his car to boost its mileage .
' I have to .
Everyone does .
I ca n't afford to drive as much as I did , ' he said .
Recent figures showed the steepest monthly drop in miles driven by Americans since 1942 .
At the same time car sales are collapsing , led by huge SUVs .
General Motors , once the very image of American industrial might , is in deep trouble .
Cities are now investing in mass transit , hoping to tempt people back into town centres from far - flung commuter belts where they are now stranded by high petrol prices .
Jonathan Baty used to be a pioneer .
The lighting designer has cycled to work every day since 1993 .
It 's a nine - mile round trip through the heartland of a car - based culture once famously termed ' Autopia ' .
But now Baty has company on his daily rides as others choose two wheels rather than four to navigate southern California 's streets .
' We have seen a whole emergence of a bike culture in this area .
There is a crescendo of interest , ' said Baty , who does volunteer work for a cycling group , Bicycle Commuter Coalition of the Inland Empire .
In Riverside , bus travel is up 12 per cent on a year ago , rising to 40 per cent on commuter routes .
Use of the town 's railway link is up eight per cent .
A local car pooling system is up 40 per cent .
It is the same in the rest of the US .
In South Florida a light rail system has reported a 28 per cent jump in passengers .
In Philadelphia one has shown an 11 per cent rise .
Even nationwide scooter sales have shot up .
At the same time car sales are hitting 15 - year record lows .
Last week major American car - makers reported a devastating 18 per cent drop in car sales .
The numbers point to a more fundamental shift .
In America car sales carry a symbolic value that transcends the wheeler - dealering of the showroom .
This is a nation of fabled road trips and Route 66 .
' There is an American dream of mobility and freedom and wealth .
The car is part of all that , ' said Professor Michael Dear , an urban studies expert at the University of Southern California .
In the 1950s the confident nation that helped win the Second World War was expressed in classic car designs of huge fins and open tops .
By the 1990s it had become the Hummer , a huge bulking car born from the military .
Now there is to be another shift .
For , hidden within the car sales figures , is a more complex story than a simple fall .
Sales of big cars are plummeting while smaller vehicles , especially fuel - efficient hybrids , are replacing them .
GM has now closed SUV production at four plants .
Its Hummer brand is up for sale , or might even be closed .
GM is ploughing huge resources into its 2010 launch of the Chevy Volt , a hybrid car that may get up to 150 miles a gallon .
It needs to .
GM 's share price recently hit a 54 - year low , prompting one top investment bank to warn that the firm could go bankrupt .
The Volt , and cars like it , could become symbols of a new more conservation - minded car age .
As Americans enjoyed the 4 July holiday weekend , increasing numbers of them were staying at home rather than hitting the road .
Newspapers were full of tips for ' stay - cations ' , not weekend breaks away .
Customs once scorned , such as car pooling and cutting out trips to the mall , are now commonplace .
The fact is , the vast majority of Americans cannot give up their cars altogether .
Too many cities lack any reliable public transport .
Adam Garcia is one of those caught .
He does two jobs and his daily road trip by car is a necessity .
' We do n't have much of a choice .
I have to drive , ' he said .
Sacrifices come elsewhere , in giving up trips to the cinema and to see friends .
But America 's changing relationship with the car is just part of the story of how the most powerful nation is changing in the face of the oil price rise .
America has been built on an oil - based economy , from its office workers in the suburbs to its farmers in the fields .
Since the 1950s and the building of the pioneering car - orientated suburb of Levittown in Long Island , the American city has been designed for the convenience of the car as much as its human inhabitants .
People live miles away from jobs , shops or entertainment .
If you take away cars , the entire suburban way of life collapses .
To some , that development is long overdue .
' Suburbia has been unsustainable since its creation , ' said Chris Fauchere , a Denver - based film - maker who is producing a new documentary on the issue called The Great Squeeze .
' It was created around cheap oil .
People thought it would flow easily from the earth forever . '
Fauchere 's film , due out later this year , aims to tackle the profound changes caused by a world where oil is becoming scarcer .
He does not think that it is going to be easy for America to make the adjustment .
' It is going to be tough .
It is like a chain reaction through the economy .
But if you look at history , it is only crisis that starts change , ' he said .
The suburbs are already being hit .
As cars become more expensive , the justification for suburbs seems to disappear .
Some commentators have even suggested that suburbs - once the archetype of an ideal American life - will become the new slums .
In the face of expensive fuel and crashing property prices , the one - time embodiment of a certain American dream will become crime - ridden , dotted by empty lots and home to the poor and unemployed .
That is already happening as crime and gang violence has risen in many suburban areas and tens of thousands of homes have been reposessed because of the mortgage crisis .
In effect , suburbs will become the new inner cities , even as once - abandoned American downtowns are undergoing a remarkable renaissance .
Even malls , the ultimate symbol of American life since the war , are undergoing a crisis as consumers start to stay away .
But there are even deeper changes going on .
The car , the freeway system and cheap air travel made America smaller .
Everywhere was easily accessible .
That , too , is ending .
Higher fuel prices have dealt a terrible blow to America 's airlines .
They are slashing flights , raising costs and abandoning routes .
Some small cities are now losing their air connections .
In effect , America is becoming larger again .
That will lead to a more localised economy .
To many environmentalists that is a blessing , not a curse .
They point out that cheap fuel for industrial transport has meant the average packaged salad has travelled 1,500 miles before it gets to a supermarket shelf .
' Distance is now an enemy , ' said Professor Bill McKibben , author of the 1989 climate - change classic The End of Nature .
' There 's no question that the days of thoughtless driving are done . '
The worst hit parts of the US are not yet the suburbs or the freeways of southern California , but the small towns that dot the Great Plains , Appalachia and the rural Deep South .
Even more than the Inland Empire , people in these isolated and poor areas are reliant on cheap petrol and much less able to afford the new prices at the pump .
Stories abound of agricultural workers unable to afford to get to the fields and of rural businesses going bust .
Even farmers are not immune .
They might not need a car to get to their fields but their fertilisers use oil - based products whose prices have gone through the roof .
A handful have started using horses again for some tasks , saving petrol on farm vehicles .
The American dream of the last half century is thus changing .
The car and its culture is now under a pressure unimaginable even a few years ago .
' The frontier of endless mobility that we 've known our entire lives is closing , ' said McKibben .
America 's excess has had many imitators .
Recently a delegation of Chinese government officials and architects visited an Arizona suburb near Phoenix .
Approving notes were taken as they surveyed the luxurious car - driven suburban lifestyle on display .
This was just one of the many delegations that regularly come from the Far East or South America .
Even as America is sobering up from its excess of cheap oil , other parts of the world are seeking to join the party .
They , too , want homes far from dirty city centres , huge open roads and fast cars .
It is still a beguiling vision of freedom , mobility and bountiful riches .
McKibben spent last week on a visit to Beijing .
He was worried about what he saw .
Even as America 's obsession with the car lifestyle is ending , others are embracing it .
' The Chinese have spent the Bush years starting to build their own version of America .
A key question for the planet is whether they still have time to build a version of Europe instead - global warming will probably hinge on the answer to that question , ' he said .

McCain has spot removed from his face : aide
BAKERSFIELD , California - Republican presidential candidate John McCain , who has suffered from skin cancer in the past , had a spot removed from his face on Monday during a routine checkup by a doctor in Phoenix , an aide said .
" At this point it was just a precautionary removal , " the aide told reporters on McCain 's campaign plane .
She said the spot was covered by a bandage and was visible on his face .
McCain has had four malignant melanomas -- a potentially lethal type of skin cancer -- surgically removed since 1993 .
Three of them were limited to the top layers of the skin and were not invasive .
The fourth melanoma was invasive and was removed from his left temple in 2000 .

Disaster Strikes China Thousands Feared Dead in Chinese Earthquake
Monday 's earthquake in southwestern China has extracted a far higher death toll than initially assumed .
Chinese authorities say up to 5,000 people have been killed in one county alone in the 7.8 - magnitude tremor that was felt as far away as Pakistan and Thailand .

Though the name of the hearing – Executive Power and Its Constitutional Limitations – did n’t include the hot - button word , impeachment was on the minds of judiciary committee members and witnesses Friday .
Last month , Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) introduced 35 articles of impeachment against President George W. Bush .
In an interview with BuzzFlash [ 0 ] shortly after the introduction , Kucinich said it was imperative that Congress act now , rather than later :
“ If we wait , we ’re licensing further abuses of power .
There ’s been broad concern that this administration could attack Iran .
Why should we give them the opening to do so by failing to challenge the lies that they told that took us into war with Iraq ? ” he asked .
“ We can not wait for after the election .
We do n’t know what could happen in the next six months with respect to a further erosion of our democratic process .
And what the impeachment process would do would be to have a chilling effect on further abuses of the Constitution and on creating another war . ”
Kucinich recently introduced more articles of impeachment against Bush .
After years of sticking to her impeachment is “ off the table ” line , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) said [ 0 ] earlier this month that she supported the idea of Kucinich ’s articles making it to a hearing .
It has been suggested [ 1 ] that Pelosi took impeachment off the table to avoid being entangled in legal issues .
A Washington Post article [ 2 ] from December of last year revealed that party leadership such as Pelosi had been briefed by the Bush Administration early on regarding torture policies , including waterboarding , as well as other controversial subjects .
Journalists and lawmakers alike have suggested that the Democratic Party ’s reluctance to hold impeachment hearings relates to these closed meetings .
They have suggested that Pelosi and others could be held legally responsible [ 3 ] for their reticence on harsh interrogation techniques .
When such Bush Administration wrongdoings are brought up publicly , Republican lawmakers often say that since the Congressional leaders known as the Gang of Eight did not express concern at the closed hearings that they are complicit in the condoning of torture , an opinion mentioned again at today ’s hearings .
In at least one way , these were the impeachment hearings that were n’t .
Conyers ’ staff made sure [ 4 ] each witness had a written copy of the House rule that state “ personal abuse , innuendo , or ridicule of the president is not permitted .
. .
Any suggestion of mendacity is out of order . ”
Being called out of order could result in being barred from speaking for the duration of the hearing .
In order to talk specifically about impeaching the president , Congress would have to vote to begin an inquiry .
“ To the regret of many , this is not an impeachment hearing , ” Conyers said .
The lawmakers and witnesses repeatedly had to result to codes to refer to specific members of the Bush Administration .
At one point , Rep. Cohen , wanting to ask a question about the vice president , referred to a “ barnacle attached to the legislature . ”
Many were pleased that Conyers set up such parameters .
Rep. Trent Franks ( R - AZ ) said he was taking Conyers at his word :
“ I hope we can expect that none of the witnesses will mention the word impeachment . ”
Cindy Sheehan , an activist who is running for Pelosi ’s seat , addressed [ 5 ] the media and impeachment advocates gathered at the National Press Club yesterday :
“ I read that Conyers has said that tomorrow they can’t talk about lies or crimes or mention George Bush or Dick Cheney because it ’s not an impeachment hearing .
Well , I have a solution for that :
Make it an impeachment hearing .
There ’s so many good people here that are really being betrayed by our Democratic leadership in Congress …
I ’m afraid that tomorrow ’s hearing is going to be another dog and pony show . ”
Pelosi ’s recent change of heart on whether or not impeachment is off the table put Judiciary Committee Chair John Conyers ( D - MI ) in a political bind .
He has said [ 5 ] he supports impeachment hearings , but also that he could n’t make a move without the approval of party leadership .
One way to avoid the problem was to hold a hearing that ’s not technically about impeachment .
Though Sheehan did not testify , she was addressed by the committee chair : “ Sheehan , you ’re out , ” Conyers said , as security guards escorted her out of the hearing room after a disturbance during testimony .
One constant during the hearing was audience participation .
The hearing was paused several times to remove protestors , and Conyers reminded those in attendance repeatedly not to show appreciation or disappointment with testimony or statements .
Even before the hearing began , the audience was audible .
Screams and clapping accompanied Kucinich and his wife as they entered the hearing room .
Not everyone was as excited as the audience about the prospect of impeachment .
Several Republicans used derogatory language to refer to the hearings .
Ranking Member Lamar Smith ( R - TX ) called the hearing an “ anger management class , ” saying “ nothing is going to come ” of the exercise :
“ There is no evidence to support impeachment . ”
Comparing the hearing to watching the “ Friday night fights ” as a child , Rep. Dan Lungren ( R - CA ) called the gathering the “ Friday morning show trials : ”
“ Maybe what we ’re here for is impeachment - lite … to allow the press the opportunity to print that the president has been accused of impeachable offenses . ”
Franks said the proceedings “ would make Alice in Wonderland roll her eyes . ”
Sardonic language came from both sides of the aisle .
“ Thank God we ’re not in Kansas any longer , ” Rep. Steve Cohen ( D - TN ) said in reply to Franks ’ comment .
Cohen had much higher expectations , saying , “ These hearings will restore the faith of the American people . ”
Zoe Lofgren ( D - CA ) also raised the ire of at least one Republican lawmaker when she stated that , “ President Bush is the worst president we have ever suffered . ”
Witnesses invited by the minority party also used invective language when referring to impeachment .
George Mason University Law Professor Jeremy Rabkin was asked by House Republicans to testify .
“ The tone of the deliberations is slightly demented , ” he said of the hearing .
Rabkin characterized the idea that Bush lied in order to start a war in Iraq as an unbelievable , outrageous “ conspiracy theory , ” born of bitterness and political divisiveness .
Both Rabkin and Northwestern University Legal History Professor Stephen Presser spoke to what exactly is an impeachable offense and advised against impeachment .
Presser appeared before Congress in 1998 during the effort to impeach President Bill Clinton .
He said the allegations against President Bush were “ different ” from those mounted against Clinton .
He said that since Bush did n’t appear to have acted out of self interest , as Clinton did , his offense was not impeachable .
Presser said that while “ obstruction of justice ” was the best legal course for Congress to take in constructing a case against the Bush Administration , he saw no direct evidence of the president obstructing justice .
Though both the professors were vehemently against the idea of impeaching the president , when Rep. Keith Ellison asked them if Kucinich ’s assertions proved accurate whether Congress should act , they both agreed that Congress should investigate .
Former Mayor of Salt Lake City and President of High Roads for Human Rights Rocky Anderson said that the two lawyers that used the personal interest argument were misusing law to prove a partisan point :
“ That is atrocious scholarship . ”
He brought up several instances of legal precedent that allow for actions by the Bush Administration to be classified as impeachable offenses .
“ I stick by the list of impeachable offenses , ” Presser simply replied .
There were many different offenses committed by the Bush Administration that were mentioned as impeachable at the hearing .
Elizabeth Holtzman , who most recently wrote a book on the subject of impeaching President Bush , was also a member of Congress who served on the Judiciary Committee .
She was present , along with Conyers , during the impeachment of President Nixon .
Holtzman said there was a case , based on prima facie grounds , for impeachment .
Among the grounds was the charge that the Bush Administration refused to obey the FISA law , the Geneva Conventions , the War Crimes Act , and the Anti-Torture Act .
She noted that since the death penalty could factor in some of these charges , there is no statute of limitations .
She also noted the improper use of signing statements , misuse of executive privilege , and deceptions about going to war with Iraq as further impeachable offenses .
Holtzman suggested beginning an impeachment inquiry .
She said that prosecution is unrealistic , a truth commission would be stonewalled , and the only realistic remedy is impeachment , because executive privilege would not be a legal possibility in such a case .
“ The options are limited , but there are options , ” Holtzman said .
Rep. Maurice Hinchey ( D - NY ) testified that he was most concerned about the quick shift from the war in Afghanistan to war with Iraq :
“ They did not want to capture bin Laden , ” Rep. Maurice Hinchey ( D - NY ) said in his opening testimony .
“ It would have been much more difficult to justify the attack of another country which had nothing to do with the attack of Sept. 11 . ”
Much of the discussion revolved around what , in the absence an impeachment inquiry , should be done about accusations against the Bush Administration .
“ My question is how we can enforce limitations of power … without using the impeachment inquiry process , ” Rep. Bobby Scott ( D - VA ) asked another witness , Bruce Fein , who was associate deputy attorney general from 1981 - 82 and is currently chairman of the American Freedom Agenda .
“ Short of impeachment , there is n’t anything you can do about a president , ” Fein replied .
Former U.S. Congressman from Georgia and Libertarian Presidential Candidate Bob Barr disagreed , saying that there are numerous Congressional actions that could at least “ not make things worse . ”
One of the examples he gave where Congress could have acted differently to change the actions of the administration was the recent passage of the FISA bill .
Despite the name of his book , The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder , witness Vincent Bugliosi , author and former deputy district attorney , did not necessarily support the formation of impeachment hearings .
“ Once he leaves office he could be criminally prosecuted for any crimes he had committed while in office , ” he said .
“ I ’ve never suggested he could be prosecuted for murder while he was in office . ”
Many resolutions were suggested , including a bill to limit the president ’s authority to pardon of members of his administration .
Rep. Brad Miller ( D - NC ) serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and was also a witness at the hearing .
He introduced a bill last week to restore certain checks and balances against executive power and expects to introduce similar legislation next week .
He said Bush should be pursued after leaving office :
“ Those disputes will not be moot next year . ”
The election loomed large over the hearings .
Many hinted at the theory that Democratic leadership does not want impeachment hearings to ensue because they are concerned the inquiry could make their party appear petty in the eyes of voters .
While the recognition of a new administration in 2009 put a short timetable on the possibility of impeachment , many were concerned by precedents that could be set by Congress ’ failure to act .
Rep. Tammy Baldwin ( D - WI ) said the future presidents “ are informed by the actions and inaction of past administrations and Congresses … [ Our actions ] will impact the conduct of future presidents . ”
Previous administrations played a big part in the hearing as well .
Impeachment efforts against both the Nixon and Clinton Administrations were referenced several times .
Rep. Hank Johnson ( D - GA ) rebuffed some who said that Clinton deserved impeachment while Bush should be exempt .
“ If lying about consensual sexual activity fits the bill … lying to the American people about the invasion of Iraq , a sovereign country … certainly that qualifies as an impeachable offense , ” he said , to an outburst of applause .
Once again , Conyers was forced to ask the audience to keep quiet .
Others were worried that the current partisan nature of Congress is much closer to that of the Clinton Administration ’s era , and that voters might see the impeachment effort as disingenuous .
“ The reason the Nixon impeachment worked was because it was bipartisan , ” said Holtzman .
At one point , both concerns over what should be done about the situation and what has been done in the past converged .
Every year , more than 100 beachgoers on average drown due to these strong river - like channels of water that pull swimmers away from the shore , according to the U.S. Lifesaving Association ( USLA ) .
And that 's just in the United States .
Nearly half of all rescues made by lifeguards at ocean beaches are related to rip currents , according to the USLA .
Sharks typically kill about 6 people a year globally .
[ Find Out Your Odds of Dying from Various Phenomena ]
How they work
A common perception is that rip currents pull swimmers underwater ; in reality , they 're strong , narrow currents that flow away from the beach .
" Essentially , they 're rivers of the sea , " said Wendy Carey , a coastal hazards specialist with the Delaware Sea Grant Advisory Service at the University of Delaware .
" People start going under because they panic , and they feel like the current is pulling them under , " Carey said .
" There is no current that will pull you under in the ocean . "
There are many different types of rip currents , and they form in several ways .
Quickly changing wave heights , which occur when a large set of swells rolls in , can trigger a rip current .
Rip currents can also occur at spots where there 's a break in a sandbar ; there , water is funneled out to sea .
These channels in sandbars lie just off the beach .
When water returns to the ocean , it follows the path of least resistance , which is typically through these channels .
Strong rip currents also often appear next to structures such as piers , jetties and groins , Carey said .
Breaking waves are the key ingredients for all rip currents .
" If there are no breaking waves , there wo n't be any rip currents , " Carey said .
[ Science of Summer : How Do Ocean Waves Form ? ]
The risk of rip currents is determined by many factors , including weather , tides , local variations in beach shape and how waves break offshore .
Some beaches may have rip currents nearly all the time , while other beaches almost never see the dangerous flows .
These strong and often very localized currents can carry unsuspecting swimmers out to sea .
The currents usually move at 1 to 2 feet per second ( 0.3 to 0.6 meters per second ) , but stronger ones can pull at 8 feet per second ( 1.6 meters / second ) .
That 's the same pace as a world - record Olympic freestyler , Carey said .
" Even an Olympic swimmer would find themselves going backward in a rip current pulse , " she said .
( Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps can swim the butterfly stroke at about 6.5 feet / second . )
Rip currents can speed up dramatically in a short time .
The unsteady flow of a rip current is similar to standing in a river on land .
The strong flow can sweep you off your feet , Carey said .
" An adult standing in waist - deep water in a rip current would find it hard to stay in the same place , " she said .
Rip tide is a misnomer
Heavy breaking waves can trigger a sudden rip current , but rip currents are most hazardous around low tide , when water is already pulling away from the beach .
In the past , rip currents were sometimes called rip tides , which was a mistake , Carey said .
" Tides are really slow changes in water level and by themselves do not induce a rip current , " she said .
" A rip current is not at all a tide . "
Scientists have been studying rip currents for more than 100 years .
In the past decade , advances in measurement techniques have provided many new insights into how these complicated currents work .
Researchers now toss GPS - equipped drifters into the surf to precisely track rip current movements and speed .
Acoustic Doppler current profiling ( similar to sonar ) has revealed the inner workings of rip currents .
This acoustic Doppler current profiler sends out high - frequency pulses of sound that hit and bounce off particles in the water .
The instrument measures the frequency of this returning signal —
If the particle ( and surrounding water ) is moving away from the instrument , the signal will have a lower frequency and if it 's moving toward the instrument , the return signal will have a higher frequency , according to NOAA .
Highly detailed laser measurements of the beach environment shows how water and topography combine to trigger rips .
" There is a new understanding of rip current flow and behavior , " Carey said .
How to spot a rip current
Surviving a rip current starts before you even enter the water , Carey said .
" Avoidance is the most important thing .
Swim at a lifeguard - protected beach and talk to the lifeguard on duty about ocean conditions for the day , " she said .
" It 's also really important to know how to swim and how to float before you venture ankle - deep into the ocean . "
Learning how to spot a rip current can help you avoid getting caught , Carey added .
For instance , rip currents above deep sandbar channels look like calm patches of water .
These calmer waters are often between turbulent breaking waves , presenting an inviting pathway to inexperienced beachgoers .
" Sometimes people inadvertently enter the water in one of the most dangerous spots just because it looks calm , " Carey said .

The following features could also signal there 's a rip current in the water , according to the USLA :
A channel of choppy water
An area with a different color than the rest of the water
A line of foam , seaweed or debris that 's moving out to sea
A break in the incoming waves
Even if you do n't spot any of these signs , a rip current could still be underway .
The USLA recommends wearing polarized sunglasses to see these ocean features more clearly .
How to survive a rip current
It is easy to be caught in a rip current .
Most often , it happens in waist - deep water , experts say .
A person will dive under a wave , but when they resurface they find they are much farther from the beach and still being pulled away .
What they do next can decide their fate .
Those who understand the dynamics of rip currents advise remaining calm .
Conserve energy .
A rip current is like a giant water treadmill that you can't turn off , so it does no good to try to swim against it .
" Even small rips can flow faster than a person can swim .
You should not try to swim against the rip , " Carey said .
Rip currents are often narrow , and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) and the USLA suggest trying to swim parallel to the shore and out of the current .
Once you 've gotten out of the current , you can begin swimming back to shore .
" You may want to swim toward whitewater , where the waves are breaking , " Carey said .
" That may help guide you out of the rip . "
However , if it is too difficult to swim sideways out of the current , try floating or treading water and let nature do its thing .
You 'll wash out of the current at some point and can then make your way back to shore .
The latest research indicates that many rip currents circulate back to shore , and would carry stranded swimmers along with the current , but not all rip currents rotate in this manner , Carey said .
" There are still occasions where the drifters would not be brought back , " she said .
If swimming does n't seem to be working for you , conserve your energy by floating or treading water and try to get the attention of someone on shore , hopefully a lifeguard .
And if you see someone who is caught in a rip current , do n't become a victim yourself , the USLA warns .
The USLA suggests that you :
Get help from a lifeguard .
If a lifeguard is n't available , call 911 .
Do n't try to rescue the person yourself unless it 's the last resort and you have a raft , body board or life preserver with you .
If you do go out close enough to the victim , throw the person a floatable device like a lifejacket or inflatable tube .
You can also yell instructions on how to escape a rip current to the stranded person .
" There are many tragic stories where someone went into a rip current to try and save someone else and they became drowning victims themselves , " Carey said .

The soaring cost of oil is causing growing strain to economies around the world , rich and poor .
With prices more than doubling in the past year to $ 135 a barrel , the impact is being felt acutely by consumers and businesses alike .
The risk of strikes and social unrest has become a reality in many countries as fuel becomes unaffordable for more people .
BBC reporters around the world examine the effects of the oil prices on their regions .
BRAZIL NIGERIA CALIFORNIA CHINA BELGIUM THE GULF INDIA BRAZIL - GARY DUFFY
Major oil fields have recently been discovered off the country 's coast
There was a time when rising oil prices would have sent a shiver down the spine of the average Brazilian motorist , but nowadays the Latin American country appears largely immune to this kind of negative impact .
In fact most of the talk about oil here is focused on the major discoveries recently off the coast near to Rio de Janeiro , which some Brazilians hope will put them in the OPEC league of oil nations .
More cautious analysts have , of course , been quick to point out that much of this oil lies buried deep beneath layers of rock and salt , and will take significant investment and years of hard work to bring to the surface .
Even so , when it comes to oil Brazilians are feeling more comfortable than at any time in recent years .
It was of course an earlier " oil crisis " in the 1970s which prompted Brazil to embark on an energy policy for which it is now famous , the mass production of biofuels for cars .
This alcohol , made from sugar cane , is widely available at garages across Brazil .
More than nine in 10 new vehicles here can now run on both alcohol derived from sugar cane or petrol .
In 2007 , Brazil produced 22bn litres of ethanol .
Motorists say they have hardly noticed changes in petrol prices here , though it helps to live in a market dominated by Petrobras , the state controlled oil company .
A tax reduction was used to soften a recent price rise .
And even if the prices are having an impact , there is always the alternative to fill up with the cheaper ethanol at the pumps .
Many taxis here can also run on gas .
Some economists warn however that higher diesel prices may still have an impact on inflation and indirectly on food prices .
Return to top NIGERIA - ANDREW WALKER Strikes by Nigerian oil workers have helped push oil prices to record highs Nigeria is the eighth largest exporter of crude in the world .
For every barrel of oil sold , $ 59 goes to the national budget , the rest goes into an account in the Central Bank .
Record oil prices mean that stock of cash now stands at $ 12bn .
For all this money in the bank , ordinary Nigerians still suffer in poverty .
Hospitals are inadequate , schools are ramshackle .
Cities cannot keep up with their population growth , and many people live in slums without electricity , water or sanitation .
But one thing Nigerians do have is cheap fuel , almost all of it imported .
In Nigeria a gallon ( 3.79 litres ) of petrol costs $ 2.37 , cheaper than in the US .
Many Nigerians think the massive subsidies the government pays importers is the only thing the government actually does for them .
Without reliable electricity , most of Nigeria 's 140 m people rely on generators for their livelihoods .
Any increase in price , even by just a few cents , is painful .
The pipelines that cross the country taking fuel to depots are often sabotaged .
When one is broken open , instead of running away , many people of Nigeria 's slums grab whatever vessel they can and run towards the spill .

Higher oil prices push up the price of fuel , energy bills and food Drivers in Silicon Valley are suffering from sticker shock at the petrol pump as petrol prices hit record highs .
The cost of filling up in the Bay area has always been among the highest in the nation , but now with a gallon of petrol costing around $ 4.19 , people are rethinking the way they get around .
Tina Patterson is a preschool teacher who runs her own business out of her home .
She says that while she does not need to drive as much as she used to , she is looking at alternatives .
" Today I put six gallons of gas in my car and it cost over $ 40 .
I can't afford that and I am seriously looking at getting a hybrid car . "
Rafael Solis runs his own landscaping business and says that the cost of filling up totals around $ 800 a month , compared to about $ 500 a month a year ago .
" It 's crazy the price of gas .
But the prices are crazy for everyone . "
He says the constantly rising costs are affecting his business and his ability to get by .
" I can't put up my prices because in this present economy everyone is trying to make savings .
Yet I can't afford to carry on as things are . "
This time of year is regarded as the start of the driving season for many Americans .
Mr Solis says he will not be taking any trips .
He cannot afford holidays anyway and he certainly cannot afford to take to the highways and byways of the Bay Area for pleasure .
Return to top CHINA - MICHAEL BRISTOW
Chinese drivers have been largely protected from rising world oil prices because of government price caps .
The government sets upper limits on the prices consumers pay for oil products , as it does for other energy sources .
Drivers interviewed by the BBC did not seem too concerned by rising world oil prices .
In return for price caps , the government directly compensates oil firms for selling their products at below the market price by paying them subsidies .
But this policy has come under increasing scrutiny ever since oil prices started reaching record levels .
World crude prices are now well above domestic retail prices in China , meaning the government is paying out more in subsidies .
The government has increased prices to consumers in the past - last year it upped retail prices by 10 % in response to higher crude costs .
And there is speculation that it will relax price controls later this summer and let fuel prices rise .
But doing that could cause other problems , such as increasing the rate of inflation , which is already higher than the government wants .
And , as Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said earlier this year , fighting inflation is one of the government 's key tasks for this year .
Return to top BELGIUM - DUNCAN BARTLETT
French fishermen are blockading ports and refineries in protest at diesel costs People in Belgium have felt the impact of rising oil prices via a rise in the price of the country 's favourite food , the chip .
A bag of fried potato pommes frites in Brussels now costs about two euros ( $ 3 ) , up 4 % in the past year .
That is despite a 24 % drop in the cost of potatoes .
The government has launched an investigation but the chip - makers blame their price increase on more expensive petrol for transport and fuel for their factories .
It is a similar story across the eurozone region , where food price inflation reached 6 % in April .
The overall inflation rate stood at 3.3 % .
The European Central Bank , which sets interest rates for all 15 countries which use the euro , admits it cannot bring inflation down to its 2 % target rate in the short term .
There is not much the European Commission can do about rising oil prices and their knock - on effects .
It leaves it to individual countries to decide how much tax they put on oil .
Many governments are under pressure to make tax cuts to offset the inflation .
Recent protests by fishermen in France , who blockaded Channel ports , underline how strongly many European citizens feel about the issue .

The streets of the Gulf are coated in oil money .
There is evidence everywhere you look - the investment in mammoth projects , like the huge economic cities being created in Saudi Arabia , the museums and hotels being built in Abu Dhabi and the shimmering new buildings rising up along Qatar 's shores .
These are boom times for the ruling families who own the land and seas beneath which huge amounts of the world 's oil lies .
Some are better than others at using this excess liquidity to reinvest in their region , diversify away from oil and so better ensure their futures .
The United Arab Emirates has been leading the way , but others see the benefits and are following .
They know that the oil will not last forever , whatever its price , and that there is a need to make alternative arrangements .
That means the monetary benefits are trickling down to those at the coal face of the non-energy economy .
Construction , manufacturing , media , IT , tourism - the opportunities are here for growing numbers of young Gulf nationals and foreign " guest workers " alike .
Indeed the Gulf is a recruiting ground for expatriates whose home countries are faring less well in the current economic climate .
But the downside is inflation .
Food prices are increasing here as elsewhere and most food is imported .
All Gulf countries ' currencies bar Kuwait are pegged to the US dollar , which is currently weak , making things worse .
The increasing population is putting pressure on housing ; rents have risen so much that some governments have imposed caps on increases .
In short , there is too much oil money chasing too few goods and services and it is those poorest paid - the migrants from South Asia and East Asia - who are feeling it the most .
Return to top INDIA - KARISHMA VASWANI
Here in India , the soaring cost of oil is having a significant impact on the country 's economy .
India spends billions of dollars subsidising fuel for its citizens every year .
That means petrol here is a lot cheaper than it should be .
But that also means Indian oil firms have to buy oil on the international market at international prices - and then sell it at a subsidised rate to customers here .
By some accounts , state - run Indian oil firms are losing $ 100 m a day .
And if oil prices continue to rise , the problem will get much worse .
The Indian government has been under pressure to raise the price of fuel at home , but it is a politically unpopular move , and with the government facing elections in a number of states this year , it may be one this administration cannot afford .
There had been rumours that Indian officials would raise the price of fuel this week , but media reports now suggest that has been put on hold after the government lost a crucial election in southern India .

Mississippi Justice : Bush US
Attorney targeted my wife , supporters and friends Larisa Alexandrovna
Published : Wednesday April 9 , 2008

Print This Email This Republican effort jails largest Democratic donor in Mississippi , helps put ex-RNC chairman in governor 's chair The Permanent Republican Majority Part V
In an exclusive interview with RAW STORY , a former Mississippi Republican state legislator who was later backed by Democrats to win a seat on the Mississippi Supreme Court discussed political prosecutions and what he sees as the corruption and politicization of the Department of Justice .
Mississippi Supreme Court Justice Oliver Diaz Jr. was indicted in 2003 on charges relating to his receipt of a loan guarantee from trial lawyer Paul Minor  a personal friend and the largest Democratic donor in Mississippi  to help defray campaign debts .
A Bush - appointed US Attorney , Dunnica Lampton , brought charges of bribery against Diaz , Minor and two other Mississippi judges .
Diaz was acquitted of all those charges .
A jury acquitted Minor of the charges related to Diaz , but was unable to reach a verdict on other charges .
Within days of his acquittal , Diaz was indicted a second time .
He was again acquitted .
 Normally , a criminal investigation begins after a crime is committed ,  Diaz told me .
 Investigators are sent out to gather evidence and a list of suspects is drawn up .
Sometimes an investigation is begun after a complaint is made about suspicious activity .
In our case neither of these things occurred . 
 In other words ,  he continued .
 An individual was singled out for examination from the federal government and prosecutors then attempted to make his conduct fit into some criminal statute .
This is not how our system of justice is supposed to operate .
Diaz first contacted me after having read Raw Storys  Part One  The Political Prisoner in this series , which reported on the prosecution of former Alabama governor Don Siegelman .
Our interview was conducted over a period of several months in telephone conversations and email exchanges .
" The Permanent Republican Majority Part V : Interview with Diaz , " is part of our ongoing investigation into the undermining of both the electoral process and the US legal system by corporate interests , their lobbyists and elected and appointed government officials aligned with them .
Prior to being appointed to the judiciary , Diaz served in the Mississippi House of Representatives as a Republican for seven years , representing Biloxi and D'Iberville .
Diaz was elected to the Mississippi court of appeals in 1994 , and in 2000 he was appointed to the state Supreme Court by Democratic governor Ronnie Musgrove .
What emerges during our interview are allegations of even more aggressive prosecutorial tactics and intimidation than has previously been reported .
The allegations seem to fit the pattern of prosecution in Alabama , where another Bush - appointed US Attorney successfully prosecuted a popular democratic governor for bribery .
As in Alabama , Diaz was indicted a second time after the first set of charges failed to hold up in court .
Diaz was ultimately acquitted and still retains his state Supreme Court seat .
House broken into , wife ' threatened '
 After I was indicted and before my trial , my home was also broken into ,  Diaz tells RAW STORY .
 Our door was kicked in and our documents were rummaged .
Televisions , computers and other valuables were not taken , despite the fact that we were out of town for several days and the home was left open by the burglars .
We could not figure out a motive for the burglary and reported it to the Biloxi Police Department .
The crime was never solved .
As previously reported in  The Permanent Republican Majority Part II  in our investigative series , Governor Siegelmans home was broken into twice during the trial , and his attorneys office was broken into at least once during the tortuous process of his case .
In another eerie parallel , Mississippi judge John Whitfield , who was tried along with Diaz and Minor , had his office set on fire .
The Alabama Republican whistleblower , Dana Jill Simpson  who alleges White House involvement in the Siegelman case  had her home set on fire and her car run off the road after she came forward .
An FBI agent was also reassigned to Guantanamo Bay , Cuba after he voiced his concerns about the way Lampton was running his investigations .
Agent Michael Campbells specialty is forensic accounting ; so its unclear what his role might be at the prison .
Diazs wife , Jennifer , was indicted along with her husband .
According to Diaz , the US Attorneys office offered a veiled threat when discussing a plea agreement , making her an offer she could not refuse .
 Just before our trial , federal prosecutors spoke to Jennifers attorney and told him that they were willing to make a deal ,  Diaz told me .
 They explained that she and I were each facing many years in federal prison and millions of dollars in fines .
They told her that it would be a shame if both she and I were convicted because they knew that we had two small children . 
 They said that if she would agree to plead guilty to a single count of tax evasion they would guarantee her that she would serve no time and would pay no fine ,  Diaz added .
 All she would have to do is fully cooperate with investigators by telling them everything she knows and to truthfully testify if they called her to the stand .
Not being able to risk the loss of our children , Jennifer accepted this deal . 
Ultimately , Diaz notes , prosecutors did not call Jennifer to testify , as she was not able to add anything to their case .
Timing of indictments helps elect GOP governor Diazs prosecutions  and those of the largest state Democratic donor and other Democrat - supported judges also seem to be part of a larger pattern to use flimsy criminal indictments for political gain .
Diaz was indicted three months prior the Mississippis gubernatorial elections .
Because hed been appointment by the incumbent Democratic governor , Republicans used his name as part of a smear campaign to bolster their candidate , Haley Barbour .
Barbour was the Chairman of the Republican National Committee from 1993 to 1997 .
 The indictment was used prominently in the Republican campaign ,  Diaz said .
 The Haley Barbour campaign used the indictments of Paul Minor and me to taint Governor Musgrove .
Minor had been one of Musgrove 's largest contributors , and I was his appointee to the Supreme Court .
 Minor was also a large contributor to Democratic candidates across the country ,  Diaz .
 In fact , at the time he was one of John Edwards  top ten largest contributors .
The indictments would also serve to embarrass Edwards , who was considered at that time to be one of the most serious challengers to George Bush in the 2004 Presidential election .
A political operative could not have picked a better time to issue the indictments in order to influence the upcoming elections .
The Interview : Corporate interests target Diaz Raw Storys Larisa Alexandrovna : Let 's start with 2002 and the FBI 's investigation into trial lawyers .
What was going on at this time in the political atmosphere and what , if any , cases were on the docket ?
Justice Oliver Diaz , Jr. :
In 2002 I was in the second year of an eight - year term on the Mississippi Supreme Court .
A struggle was brewing over control of the court .
In the 2000 election , large amounts of money were put into Mississippi judicial elections by big business , tobacco and insurance , with mixed results .
I was targeted for defeat by these groups , who were not able to beat me in the election .
RS : When you say targeted  by these groups , through what mechanism ?
OD : The mechanism used by these groups to target me for defeat was the U.S. Chamber of Commerce .
The U.S. Chamber spent more than a million dollars in the final two weeks before my election , running television and radio ads , direct mail , telephone solicitations and leaflets and flyers .
Most of the ads were what you would call negative attack ads directed at me .
They also ran a few ads that praised my opponent .
RS : Your opponent was Judge Keith Starrett , correct ?
OD : Yes , Starrett was a state trial court judge .
RS : Judges in Mississippi do not run on a political ticket .
But is it safe to say that before you were judges you were both Republicans in terms of party affiliation ?
You were in the state legislature as a Republican before you became a judge , right ?
OD : From 1987 until 1994 , I served in the Mississippi House of Representatives .
I was elected as a Republican .
However , in 1994 I ran for a position on the Mississippi Court of Appeals .
I was elected that year and began serving as a non-partisan judge .
I have not been affiliated with a political party since 1994 .
RS : So why do you suppose the Democratic voters supported you against Starrett ?
OD : While in the legislature , I often worked across the aisle to reach consensus .
I think that I gained the respect of many Democratic leaders and groups because of my bipartisan work in the legislature .
One of the many Democrats that I worked with was a State Senator named Ronnie Musgrove .
In 1999 , Musgrove was elected governor as a Democrat .
When a vacancy occurred on the Supreme Court Musgrove appointed me to fill that vacancy .
Because of our work together in the legislature , I think Musgrove was comfortable in appointing me to the court .
Having the support of the Democratic Governor , Democratic legislative leaders and Democratic groups certainly helped me in my election .
RS : Okay , lets go back to the Chamber of Commerce for a moment .
During the 2000 election they flooded the airwaves to support your opponent , Keith Starrett .
Is that legal ?
OD : In Mississippi , corporations and individuals are limited in the amount of money they can donate to a judicial election campaign , and the names of all donors must be disclosed .
The U.S. Chamber refused to reveal the source of their funding and claimed that they were not subject to the funding limits imposed by state law .
The state of Mississippi sued the U.S. Chamber and a judge ruled that the Chamber violated state law .
RS : What happened next ?
OD : The Chamber appealed to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and the Chamber prevailed .
That was how I was targeted during the campaign .
After the campaign , the only way I would be removed from office would be through death , resignation or if I were convicted of some impeachable offense .
RS : Before we get into the question of removing you from office , would you mind briefly explaining what happened with the U.S. Supreme Court and how the Chamber prevailed ?
OD : The Fifth Circuit ruled that the U.S. Chamber did not have to disclose their donors in Mississippi .
In its opinion , the Court actually stated ,  We recognize that the result we reach in this case may be counterintuitive to a commonsense understanding 
It seems that the Court anticipated criticism of the decision they issued in this case , as it was not necessarily a rational or logical decision .
The U.S. Supreme Court declined to review this decision , and so it stood .
RS : I thought Justice Scalia supported states rights ?
OD : Apparently , he can be selective in that interpretation .
Political struggle for the control of the Mississippi Supreme Court RS :
So you say that two years into your eight - year term , a struggle was brewing over control of the court . 
Can you describe the make - up of the Mississippi Supreme Court in 2002 ?
OD : The court was evenly split philosophically .
At the time , we were preparing for statewide elections in 2003 .
We see cases of all kinds , from routine criminal cases to complex business transactions .
We handle divorce and child custody cases and multi-million dollar lawsuits against every major corporation .
Particularly important at that time were lawsuits by large groups of people joined together in a single cause of action .
These types of suits are referred to as class action lawsuits , even though we dont technically have class action suits in Mississippi .
Business groups were concerned about potentially large verdicts when these claims were joined together .
Remember , Mississippi had just taken the lead in the multi-billion dollar tobacco litigation , and other corporations feared the same thing .
[ Forty - six states sued several large tobacco companies for the recovery of Medicare expenses accrued from tobacco - related illnesses , starting in1994 with Mississippi .
The tobacco companies settled the case in 1998 for $ 206 billion . ]
RS : Right , we reported in  The Permanent Republican Majority  Part IV  what had gone on in Mississippi , and in  The Permanent Republican Majority  Part I ,  what had happened in Alabama with the lawsuits during the 1990s .
We also discussed this type of stacking the courts in Alabama during the 1990s .
Do you see similarities ?
OD : I think that Alabama is the model that is used by conservative groups who are interested in stacking the courts .
Nothing like this had ever occurred prior to [ former White House deputy chief of staff to President George W. Bush ] Karl Roves experiment with this in Alabama .
The same thing occurred in Texas under Roves direction .
RS : Rove was a consultant for Phillip Morris and was instrumental in keeping Alabama and Texas out of the class - action cases brought by the other state attorneys general .
Alabama was just one of four states that declined to sue .
OD : I was aware that Alabama and Texas were reluctant to join in the tobacco litigation .
I was not aware of Roves involvement .
RS : Is stacking the courts common or restricted to a handful of Southern states ?
OD : Today , many states with an elected judiciary find their courts under attack from big business , insurance and tobacco .
This is so prevalent that it has even made its way into popular culture .
This entire scenario is the plot of John Grishams latest best - seller , .
The Appeal .
I dont think that John Grisham needs any help from me in selling his books , but I do highly recommend it for anyone who wants to learn more about this topic in a very entertaining way .
RS : To get back to my question , you re saying this isnt limited to the Southern states ?
OD : Absolutely not .
The same thing has happened in Illinois , Ohio , Michigan and West Virginia .
Any state with an elected judiciary is at risk for this sort of political attack .
A political crusade : FBI targets largest Democratic donor in Mississippi RS : So were in the fall of 2002 .
Tell us what happens .
OD : In the fall of 2002 , press reports began to appear in Mississippi saying that a federal investigation was under way to examine campaign loans to judges .
Loans to campaigns are a fairly regular thing in Mississippi politics .
Not many people can afford to fund the entire cost of a large election , and so it is common to seek loans to cover some of the costs .
I was not overly concerned about the investigation , because I knew that there was nothing out of the ordinary in the way my campaign was operated and funded .
Then my wife and I were contacted by FBI agents , who said that they were specifically investigating my campaign and my relationship to one specific attorney , Paul Minor .
We were told that a grand jury was looking into allegations of bribery of me by Mr. Minor .
RS : How does an investigation typically start ?
OD : One of the startling things about my case is the way it began .
Normally , a criminal investigation begins after a crime is committed .
Investigators are sent out to gather evidence and a list of suspects is drawn up .
Evidence will then point to someone who is then prosecuted for that crime .
Sometimes an investigation is begun after a complaint is made about suspicious activity .
In our case neither of these things occurred .
At about this time in 2002 , federal investigators began to look into the financial dealings of large contributors of the Democratic Party .
Paul Minor was the single largest contributor to the Democratic Party in the state of Mississippi .
Investigators were sent to examine Minors banking records and discovered that he had guaranteed loans to several judges .
This became the basis for the bribery allegations .
In other words , an individual was singled out for examination from the federal government and prosecutors then attempted to make his conduct fit into some criminal statute .
This is not how our system of justice is supposed to operate .
RS : Just to be clear , what Mr. Minor did in guaranteeing loans to a judges is not against Mississippi state law , is that correct ?
OD : The loan guaranteed by Minor was a campaign loan prior to the election , not after .
All of the proceeds of this loan were used in my campaign to counter the attacks launched by the U.S. Chamber .
This is all perfectly legal in Mississippi .
Mississippi law specifically provides for loans to campaigns .
RS : And in return , did he get anything that could be seen as quid pro quo ?
OD : Paul Minor had been a friend of mine for years , and he provided a great deal of help for me in my campaign .
In addition to monetary support , he also provided advice and was involved in campaign decisions .
Because of this relationship , I did not want anyone to be able to question my participation in cases in which he was involved .
Therefore , in my entire time at the Mississippi Supreme Court , I have never voted or participated in any way in any case in which Paul Minor , his firm or his clients were involved .
Paul knew that by taking such an active role in my campaign , I would not participate in his cases , and he agreed with that decision .
RS : So no crime is committed , but a target is identified for investigation ahead of time ?
OD : Yes .
One of the main reasons that I feel that I as an individual was targeted rather than my conduct was targeted was because there were actually other judges that I served with who also had campaigns loans guaranteed by Paul Minor and these judges were not prosecuted .
Specifically , the Chief Justice of the Mississippi Supreme Court , Edwin Pittman , also had a campaign loan guaranteed by Paul Minor .
The main difference between me and Pittman was that Pittman voted in all of Minors cases and even authored opinions that were favorable to Minor and his clients while I did not participate .
Now , I am not saying that Pittman did anything wrong .
However , I could never understand , and it has never been explained to me , how his conduct and active participation and favorable rulings were ignored and I was indicted and prosecuted for bribery and I had never been involved in Minors cases .
The only reasonable explanation seems to be that prosecutors were more interested in specific individuals and not the conduct of an individual .
James Thomas ( who has since died ) was another judge I served with who had a campaign loan guaranteed by Minor .
Judge Thomas also participated in Minors cases and was not prosecuted .
I do not believe , and do not want to be seen as implying , that Thomas did anything inappropriate , just that under similar circumstances I was prosecuted and others were not .
Federal prosecutors were fully aware of these other loans but chose not to prosecute them , even though these judges ruled in Minors favor in cases before them .
Again , I did not participate in any of Minors cases and was indicted and tried for bribery [ and eventually exonerated ] .
The only reasonable explanation is that prosecutors were more interested in prosecuting particular individuals .
RS : Now there was an FBI agent at the time of this case working with Lamptons office who had taken issue with the investigation .
What happened to him when he voices his concerns ?
OD : I understand that FBI agent Matthew Campbell , who was originally assigned to my case , was reassigned to Guantanamo Bay , Cuba after he raised questions about the investigation .
RS : You were saying about the loan and Mr. Minor OD : Mr. Minor had signed as a guarantor on one of my campaign loans .
I knew the accusations of bribery were absurd , because I had never voted on any cases in which Mr. Minor was involved while I was on the Supreme Court .
However , I was concerned because the investigation was being conducted by Dunnica Lampton , the Bush appointed U.S. Attorney .
Lampton was also a close personal friend and the former employer of my opponent in the election for which he was investigating .
RS : US Attorney Dunnica Lampton is a childhood friend of Keith Starrett , your opponent in the 2000 election .
And Starrett employs a Lampton family member , now and during the investigation and two trials .
What happened to Judge Starrett after he lost the election against you ?
When did his career begin in terms of the judiciary ?
OD : Starretts legal career began when he was hired by Dunnica Lampton as an assistant state prosecutor .
Lampton and Starrett were close personal friends and political allies .
After Starrett was defeated in 2000 , George Bush appointed him to the federal trial bench .
One of the main speakers at Starretts investiture ceremony was Dunnica Lampton .
Lampton spoke of his long relationship with Starrett going back to childhood baseball games .
RS : Right , and he talked about their long friendship OD : Another speaker at this ceremony was Judge Henry Wingate , the trial judge in our case .
Wingate referred to Starrett as a rising star in the federal judiciary .
This speech occurred as our trial was pending before Wingate .
In our minds , this certainly created an appearance of a conflict of interest on the part of Wingate , who was publicly praising my opponent as I was standing trial before him .
Wife pleads guilty to a crime she didnt commit RS : Now , your wife was also indicted .
Can you tell us a bit about that ?
OD : The case against Jennifer was even more absurd than the case against me , because she was indicted simply for her role in my campaign .
RS : What was your wifes role in your campaign ?
What were the charges against her ?
OD : Jennifer acted as my campaign manager and was involved in all of the campaign decisions .
The charges against her were the same as the charges against me : mail fraud and bribery .
The absurdity was that Jennifer did not have any knowledge about any of Minors cases and certainly could not influence my decisions , as I did not participate in any of Minors cases .
RS : How did your wife deal with the indictment ?
OD : Just before our trial , federal prosecutors spoke to Jennifers attorney and told him that they were willing to make a deal .
They explained that she and I were each facing many years in federal prison and millions of dollars in fines .
They told her that it would be a shame if both she and I were convicted , because they knew that we had two small children .
They told her that they were certain that we could find someone good to raise our children while we were in prison .
They said that if she would agree to plead guilty to a single count of tax evasion they would guarantee her that she would serve no time and would pay no fine .
This would assure that one parent was left at home to raise our children .
All she would have to do is fully cooperate with investigators by telling them everything she knew and truthfully testify if they called her to the stand .
Not being able to risk the loss of our children , Jennifer accepted this deal .
I think it is significant to point out that prosecutors did not call Jennifer to testify as she was not able to add anything to their case even though they agreed that she fully cooperated with their investigation and truthfully provided them with all of the information that was requested .
RS : Can a wife be made to testify against their husband with the threat of losing her children ?
Is this even legal ?
OD : This was the deal that was offered .
Jennifer was in no position to argue .
The reason she was offered a deal was because the case against all of us was very weak , and Jennifer 's was the weakest .
The prosecutors thought that she might be able to provide them with some information that could be used against us .
Jennifer could continue to protest her innocence and risk the loss of our children , or she could plead guilty to a crime she did not commit and be assured that she would remain at home to care for the children .
As any mother will tell you , that choice was easy .
Jennifer did what she had to do in order to remain at home with our children .
She pled guilty to a crime she did not commit .
It was at this point when I realized just how despicable these prosecutors were and to what lengths they were willing to go to get a conviction .
The first trial : Diaz is acquitted RS :
What happens during the first trial ?
What exactly are the charges ?
OD : The basic charges were that I had provided an unfair advantage to Minor when he or his clients appeared before the Mississippi Supreme Court .
In other words , prosecutors alleged that Paul Minor bribed me to rule in his favor because he guaranteed loans to my campaign .
The problem that prosecutors had with this theory was that I had never voted on a single case where Paul Minor , his law firm , or his clients were involved .
RS : How they were able to secure an indictment ?
OD : Despite the fact that I had not been involved in any of Mr. Minors cases , prosecutors advised the grand jury that I had provided an unfair advantage to Minor and his clients , and I was indicted .
RS : But dont they have to illustrate this ?
I mean they cant just say so , right ?
OD : A judge is not involved in the grand jury process other than initially swearing in the grand jury .
Grand jury proceedings are confidential .
Criminal defendants do not even know the names of the grand jury members .
Prosecutors , witnesses and grand jury members are the only people present in the grand jury room , along with a court reporter .
I was provided with transcripts of grand jury testimony of some of the witnesses prior to my trial .
I was able to see that government agents were able to inform the grand jury that I provided an unfair advantage to Minor without anything to support that statement .
The agent would say that he examined banking records and saw that Minor guaranteed a loan to my campaign and then  Diaz provided an unfair advantage to Minor in cases before him at the Supreme Court . 
In all of the transcripts that I saw , no one challenged these statements or asked for specific examples of how an unfair advantage was provided .
Grand jurors are average citizens and do not necessarily have any legal training .
Im sure they were more than willing to accept the word of a federal agent .
RS : With regard to the government agents , you are speaking of an FBI agent or agents ?
Agent Campbell was complaining about the US Attorneys handling of the case and in retaliation was reassigned to Gitmo .
Someone else was then assigned to replace him ?
OD : Yes , I am referring to the grand jury testimony of FBI agent Kevin Rust .
He was appointed to be the lead agent on my case after Campbell was dismissed .
Rust actually donated money to my opponent , Keith Starrett , when he ran against me .
Of all of the available FBI agents to be assigned to my case , Lampton selected the one who had taken an active role to defeat me during the election .
Despite this serious conflict of interest , Rust accepted the assignment and actually testified before the grand jury on seven separate occasions .
Not once did he mention to the grand jury that he supported my opponent in the election for which he was investigating .
The governors race : Former chairman of Republican Party takes Mississippi after indictments RS :
The gubernatorial election was right around the corner , too , in November of 2003 .
Do you think your indictment had anything to do with this election ?
OD : The Mississippi gubernatorial elections were scheduled for November 2003 .
The indictments in my case were handed down July 25 , 2003 , just over three months prior to the election .
The indictment was used prominently in the Republican campaign .
I had been appointed to the Supreme Court in March 2000 by incumbent Democratic Governor Ronnie Musgrove .
The Haley Barbour campaign used the indictments of Paul Minor and me to taint Governor Musgrove .
Minor had been one of Musgrove 's largest contributors , and I was his appointee to the Supreme Court .
[ Barbour was chairman of the Republican National Committee from 1993 to 1997 . ]
Minor was also a large contributor to Democratic candidates across the country .
In fact , at the time he was one of John Edwards  top ten largest contributors .
The indictments would also serve to embarrass Edwards , who was considered at that time to be one of the most serious challengers to George Bush in the 2004 Presidential election .
A political operative could not have picked a better time to issue the indictments in order to influence the upcoming elections .
RS : Any particular operative in mind ?
OD : I am not suggesting that any particular political operative was involved in the timing of my indictment , only that the timing was politically beneficial to the Republican Party .
RS : So now we go to trial OD : During a trial that lasted for more than three months , prosecutors argued that I had provided unfair advantage to Mr. Minor and that I should therefore be convicted .
Fortunately , the jury was able to see that the prosecutors were never able to point to any case I had ruled on involving Mr. Minor or his clients .
I think the jury was able to logically reason that a judge cannot provide an unfair advantage to a lawyer when the judge is not involved in the case .
After this lengthy trial I was fully acquitted .
RS : How can a trial go on for months without evidence being shown ?
What about the judge in the case ?
Why did he / she not put a stop to this ?
OD : There was lots of evidence presented at the trial .
A large number of witnesses were called .
You have to remember that this was a trial of four separate defendants .
This was not a conspiracy trial .
That means that evidence had to be presented against each individual defendant .
We were tried together even though we were not accused of the same crimes .
The only link between us was the fact that Paul Minor had guaranteed campaign loans for us .
A trial judge has a great deal of discretion in the conducting of a trial .
RS : So they tried this as a racketeering case ?
OD : Paul Minor was charged with RICO violations but the rest of us were not .
RS : Who was the trial judge ?
OD : The trial judge in this case was Henry Wingate .
Wingate was appointed by Ronald Reagan and is known as one of the few black Republicans in Mississippi .
Wingate is notorious for his failure to make timely rulings and his cases tend to drag on for years .
He took several motions in our case under advisement for over a year .
Wingate rarely begins court on time .
Lawyers , litigants and jurors are often left waiting for him to appear in court .
It is not unusual for him to arrive over an hour late .
Based upon his conduct , I do not think that Wingate is concerned about the waste of taxpayer money .
The second trial : Diaz is acquitted again RS :
What happens during the second trial ?
How are the charges different ?
OD : [ After the first trial , ] in August of 2005 I was fully acquitted .
However , three days after my acquittal , Lampton unsealed another indictment against me .
This time the charges were tax evasion .
The new prosecution theory was that if I had not been bribed then I did not properly disclose the campaign loan proceeds guaranteed by Mr. Minor on my tax returns .
This charge too was a stretch .
The problem the prosecutors had was that all of the loan proceeds were indeed spent on my election campaign .
It was difficult for prosecutors to argue that campaign loans should have been listed as personal income .
If they were to prevail on this theory then every politician in this country could be indicted for tax evasion .
Anyway , I went to trial a second time in March 2006 .
After a week - long trial , I was again fully acquitted after the jury deliberated for about fifteen minutes .
RS :
The irony here is that in our reporting on Lampton , we had found that he did not properly disclose his campaign loan proceeds and that he was in fact under FEC investigation at the time he was appointed to the US Attorneys office .
Had you heard about this ?
( See  Part IV  How Bush pick helped prosecute top Democrat - backed judge . )
OD : Prior to our trial I also did some research into Lampton .
I saw that he was fined by the FEC for not properly reporting his campaign contributions .
I also noticed that he did not disclose the FEC fine and investigation to the United States Senate when he was being confirmed for his position as U.S. Attorney .
Some would consider this to be a lie of omission .
The irony did not escape me .
RS : Now you were not the only judge indicted .
Tell us about the other judges .
Were they also acquitted and indicted again as you were ?
OD : Two other judges were tried along with us .
Wes Teel and John Whitfield were trial judges who had also had campaign loans guaranteed by Minor .
When the jury verdict was returned , I was fully acquitted and Minor , Teel and Whitfield were acquitted on some charges .
The jury could not reach a verdict on some of the charges against these three , and Lampton decided that he would re-try them on these charges .
They went to trial a second time about eighteen months later .
RS : Who was the judge for their second trial ?
OD : The same judge , Wingate , presided over Minor , Teel and Whitfield 's second trial .
In my second trial I had a different judge , Walter Gex , who I think conducted a very fair trial .
RS : In Alabama , we see the same thing happen to former Governor Don Siegelman .
He is indicted , goes to trial and on the first day of trial the judge dismisses the charges and holds the prosecutors in contempt .
Then right before he gets ready to run again , he is again indicted .
OD : The difference here is that Governor Siegelman had a trial judge who was willing to question the government in his first trial .
That did not happen in our case .
My experience has been that as a former federal prosecutor , Wingate rarely criticizes the government .
RS : Is it common for prosecutors to keep indicting someone until they finally get a conviction ?
OD : Criminal defense lawyers will tell you that once the federal governments sets its sights on convicting someone it is similar to the killing robot in the  Terminator movies .
It has no compassion and shows no mercy .
It doesnt care if you have children or you are sick .
All of its energy and resources are focused on one thing and that is conviction .
In fact , statistics show that greater than ninety - eight percent of everyone indicted by the federal government is ultimately convicted or pleads guilty .
The odds of being twice acquitted as I was are like winning the power ball lottery .
Most people simply do not have the resources to fight back when the federal government chooses to prosecute .
RS : What would have happened if you were convicted and your seat on the Mississippi court opened up ?
Is there a special election held in such a case or does the state governor appoint a replacement ?
OD : Had I been removed from office , Governor Haley Barbour would have the opportunity to appoint my replacement .
He would have complete discretion to appoint anyone he wanted who was otherwise qualified to hold the office .
RS : Were there any rumors as to whom he may have appointed ?
Did you have a theory as to whom he would have appointed ?
OD : If there was speculation at the time , no one shared it with me .
Starrett would have been a leading candidate , I 'm sure .
Bush Department of Justice gets involved RS : What was the role of the Justice Departments Public Integrity Section in your case ?
OD : The DOJ in Washington played a key role in my prosecution .
As I understand it , any time a high ranking elected official is prosecuted , it must be approved in Washington .
In my case , the public integrity section in Washington assigned a full - time attorney to my case .
This attorney actually acted as a lead trial attorney during my trial .
RS : Was the US Attorney there at the trial at all ?
I was told by a spokesperson that Lampton had recused himself .
I was , however , unable to get any paperwork to illustrate this and could find no evidence of Lampton having recused himself .
He appears on press releases and in press conferences as well .
So if Lampton did not recuse himself , which it appears he did not , then why did a Washington attorney have to take the lead in the case ?
OD : You didnt find the paperwork because Lampton did not recuse himself .
Lampton made several statements to the press that he was not involved in the case .
The DOJ continues to make this false statement .
RS : In my recent conversation with a spokesperson from the Justice Department , I was told that she had spoken to the other attorneys on your cases and was assured that Lampton had recused himself .
When I asked for any documentation to confirm this , she told me that she would get back to me .
Lampton has also said he had recused himself , but later changed his statement .
OD : When forced to say so on the record , prosecutors admitted that Lampton did not recuse himself .
I understand that there is a very detailed procedure to be followed when a U.S. Attorney recuses himself from a case .
This includes the filling out of several documents that are sent to the DOJ in Washington .
Lampton did not do this in our case .
The reason this is important is because of the serious conflicts of interest that Lampton had in prosecuting our case .
Anyone looking at all of these conflicts would understand that Lampton could not fairly participate in this prosecution .
RS : We illustrate those conflicts in a graphic to better help people understand .
In terms of the non-recusal recusal , was Lampton indeed participating in the cases ?
OD : Lampton tried to dodge the questions of conflict by saying that he was not participating .
This was simply a lie .
Lampton questioned witnesses in the grand jury and signed the indictment .
He issued press releases trumpeting the charges against us .
His office personnel and resources were devoted to the prosecution .
He regularly attended court and observed the proceedings .
Again , the irony was that we were being prosecuted by Lampton for perceived conflicts of interest , and Lampton himself was not even attempting to live up to the standard for which he was prosecuting .
RS : Noel Hillman , then - head of Public Integrity office at the Justice Department took a particular interest in your case as well .
Is that right ?
OD : Noel Hillman was intimately involved .
He actually signed the indictment in my case .
His office supplied the Washington attorney to assist in my prosecution .
Was Rove involved ?
RS : You touched on Karl Rove before .
Is Karl Rove related to your case ?
OD : It is widely known that Karl Rove is greatly responsible for engineering the takeover of the Alabama Supreme Court by the Republican Party .
Rove 's influence stretched into Mississippi through , among others , the Choctaw Indians and their casinos in Mississippi , who were clients of Jack Abramoff .
RS : Why would the Indian casinos be opposed to you ?
OD : I dont know that the Choctaws were opposed to me , but they apparently did support my opponent .
RS : Is it really the Indian casinos or are they a front for other interests who use the unregulated casinos for other purposes ?
OD : Again , I dont know what motivated them to support my opponent .
RS : What else makes you think Rove would have been involved ?
OD : Before my trial , Dunnica Lampton , the U.S. Attorney prosecuting my case , was placed on the list of U.S. Attorneys to be fired by the Bush Administration .
After he pushed my case to trial , Lampton 's name was removed .
Rove , as you are aware , has been attributed to have been involved in deciding who would be on the list to be fired .
Rove has also been linked to the Public Integrity Section in the Department of Justice .
This is the section in the Department responsible for taking the lead in the prosecution of Alabama Governor Don Siegelman .
The Public Integrity Section was also involved in my prosecution .
RS : I have always said the real scandal is not who was fired , but who was NOT fired .
That seems to be the case with the two US Attorneys in Alabama , Leura Canary and Alice Martin , and it would appear to be the case in the Southern District of Mississippi with Lampton .
The official public version is that the fired US Attorneys were not aggressively pursuing voter fraud cases .
But in looking at your case and that of Don Siegelman , what begins to emerge is that the fired US Attorneys were not using their positions aggressively enough to find a reason to indict political opponents .
What are your thoughts on the US Attorney scandal ?
US Attorneys who survived firing list targeted political opponents OD :
There has been a good deal of focus on the fact that several U.S. Attorneys were fired because they refused to participate in what they considered to be political prosecutions .
However , there has not been much focus on the flip side of this proposition .
In other words , were there U.S. Attorneys who were not fired because they did in fact engage in political prosecutions ?
Did some U.S. Attorneys actually bring political indictments ?
Have politicians who were seen as opposed to the incumbent political partys agenda in fact been prosecuted for political reasons ?
Do we now have political prisoners in the United States ?
These questions are much more subversive than the original question of whether some U.S. Attorneys refused to engage in political prosecutions .
If any of these questions are answered in the affirmative then it means that our entire system of justice has been compromised for political reasons .
Unfortunately , the evidence that has come to light since this scandal began seems to indicate that this is exactly what has occurred .
RS : What about this phrase now in use ,  selective prosecution ? 
Because to me that implies that two parties are equally guilty or are alleged to be as guilty , but only one party is being prosecuted .
In your case , and the case of Siegelman , the more appropriate phrase seems to be  fraudulent prosecution or political prosecution ,  and that is in itself a criminal act , is it not ?
Whereas selective prosecution is not necessarily criminal per se .
Is that the case ?
OD : That is true .
Paul Minor repeatedly pointed out that others who had guaranteed loans to judges were not prosecuted and he was .
I have pointed out that other judges who had campaign loans guaranteed were not prosecuted as I was .
However , I also state that I do not believe that any of these people have done anything illegal .
Paul Minor and I were not selectively prosecuted .
We were however politically prosecuted .
There is a tremendous difference .
RS : What has happened to Minor since his conviction ?
OD : During our trial I was fully acquitted and Minor was acquitted of some charges and the jury could not reach a decision on some of the charges .
He was tried again in 2007 and was convicted .
In some very bizarre rulings , the trial judge in his case actually ruled exactly opposite of his rulings in our first trial .
The judge went so far as to instruct the jury that they could convict Minor even if they found that the rulings of a judge in his case were the correct rulings .
In other words , the trial judge basically instructed the jury that the simple fact that Minor guaranteed loans to a judges campaign was enough to convict him of bribery .
Because there was never a question as to the existence of loans , this instruction completely took away Minors defense that there were loans but that there was never a quid pro quo or something done by the judge in exchange for the loan .
Without a defense , it was easy for the jury to convict .
RS : In Alabama , we found that Judge Mark Fuller , according to whistleblower Dana Jill Simpson , was allegedly discussed by Alabama Republican operative Bill Canary prior to even getting the case .
According to Simpsons testimony , Canary said  Fuller would hang Siegelman . 
George W. Bush then appoints Fuller to the bench and Fuller gets the Siegelman case .
He goes on to make a series of bizarre rulings and sits on the trial transcript for 30 months , making the appeal process a problem for the Siegelman defense team .
As you likely know , Siegelman was not allowed out of jail during the appeal process .
Once a few reporters , including myself , began to investigate this story , Siegelman was finally released on an appeal bond .
What can you tell us about the judge on your case ?
OD : As I stated before , the trial judge was a Reagan appointee named Henry Wingate .
Wingates delays and inability to make decisions are legendary among Mississippi lawyers .
During the trial , Wingate was constantly being publicly promoted as a possible Bush nominee to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals .
After the trial Wingate was again passed over for promotion .
Like what happened to Governor Siegelman , it has been a year since his trial , and Minors transcript is still not complete .
RS : What happened next ?
OD : Upon his conviction , Minor was immediately shackled and manacled and taken into custody .
Just like Siegelman , he was not allowed to remain free pending appeal .
RS : Is this normal in a white - collar crime case ?
That is to say , for the convicted party to be manacled , shackled and taken into custody without appeal ?
OD : This is extremely unusual in cases such as this .
Normally , a person convicted of a crime that is not a danger to society and is not a flight risk is given an opportunity put his affairs in order before reporting to prison .
It is also common to allow them to remain free pending appeal .
Neither of these things were allowed in this case , and Minor has been in custody since his conviction .
RS : I understand that Minors wife is unwell , that she is terribly ill with cancer , is that correct ?
So her husband had not been given the ability to even see her ?
OD : This has been particularly cruel in Minors case , given the fact that his wife was battling cancer during his trial .
Because he is being held in a facility that is a four or five hour drive away from his home , and due to her deteriorating physical condition , Ms. Minor is not able to visit her husband .
He has not been able to assist in her care and treatment or been allowed to comfort her during her ordeal .
Unfortunately , her prognosis is not good at this time .
RS : Minors sentence was rather extreme in addition to this other , more personal stress , was it not ?
OD : Minor was sentenced to eleven years in prison and fined over four million dollars .
The fine was more than ten times the fine recommended by the government and appeared to be vindictive in nature .
The prison sentence was well above what should have been imposed under the federal sentencing guidelines .
RS :
The same thing occurred in the Siegelman case , prompting what is now over 50 former state attorneys general  of both parties  to demand an investigation .
Have you been in contact with any of these attorneys general about your case ?
OD : Since our trial , we have received a great deal of national publicity .
We have learned of others who have been prosecuted under similar circumstances .
I have recently been contacted by Congressional investigators who are interested in pursuing a more detailed investigation of this case .
I will fully cooperate in that investigation .
RS : What of the other judges targeted along with you ?
How have they fared ?
OD : The two other judges who were convicted along with Minor have not fared well either .
Judge Wes Teel , who also had a campaign loan guaranteed by Minor , was sentenced to five years in prison .
Judge Teels wife is also ill and requires constant medical attention .
He was required to report to prison in December 2007 on his thirtieth wedding anniversary .
On his first day in custody , he suffered a major heart attack .
His family was not notified of this event for more than a week .
He is being treated in a federal prison facility .
Violent criminal acts of intimidation ?
OD : Judge John Whitfield was sentenced to eight years in custody .
He was allowed to report to a medical facility because of chronic health problems .
Judge Whitfield was forced to leave behind his minor son , who is now without a parent , as his mother died prior to his conviction .
RS : Judge Whitfields office was set on fire and ruled an arson case by local authorities .
The US Attorneys office inserted themselves into the arson investigation .
Is that normal , or legal ?
OD : Before our trial began , Judge Whitfields office was burned .
The computers and files that survived were seized and examined by authorities .
Whitfield protested the fact that prosecutors now had access to his trial strategy .
To this day , the arson case has not been solved .
RS : In Alabama , we saw something similar while investigating Siegelmans case .
His house was broken into twice during his trial , and his attorney had his office broken into at least once .
The Republican whistleblower Simpsons house burned down and she was driven off the road .
As far as I know , none of these crimes have been solved .
Do you think it a possibility that these crimes are not random and unrelated ?
OD : In another eerie similarity , after I was indicted and before my trial , my home was also broken into .
Our door was kicked in and our documents were rummaged .
Televisions , computers and other valuables were not taken , despite the fact that we were out of town for several days and the home was left open by the burglars .
We could not figure out a motive for the burglary and reported it to the Biloxi Police Department .
The crime was never solved .
RS : If a Governor and a state Supreme Court Justice can be targeted like this and the country is largely unaware , how can we be sure  the public that is  that people with less visibility are not being targeted in this same way for their political work and views ?
OD : In order for our legal system to work , it must remain free from political influences .
In a speech to federal prosecutors , on April 1 , 1940 , former Attorney General of the United States , Robert H. Jackson said :  If the prosecutor is obliged to choose his cases , it follows that he can choose his defendants .
Therein is the most dangerous power of the prosecutor : that he will pick people that he thinks he should get , rather than pick cases that need to be prosecuted .
With the law books filled with a great assortment of crimes , a prosecutor stands a fair chance of finding at least a technical violation of some act on the part of almost anyone .
In such a case , it is not a question of discovering the commission of a crime and then looking for the man who has committed it , it is a question of picking the man and then searching the law books , or putting investigators to work , to pin some offense on him .
It is in this realm in which the prosecutor picks some person whom he dislikes or desires to embarrass , or selects some group of unpopular persons and then looks for an offense , that the greatest danger of abuse of prosecuting power lies .
It is here that law enforcement becomes personal , and the real crime becomes that of being unpopular with the predominant or governing group , being attached to the wrong political views , or being personally obnoxious to or in the way of the prosecutor himself . 
My fear is that Jacksons warning has come to fruition during this administration .
I do not think that we will learn the full extent of the abuse that has occurred until a new administration takes over .
Until then , I think that there is evidence that political prosecutions have occurred in the United States during this administration .
Can Congress redress these cases ?
RS : But if this is in fact what is happening in our legal system , who is there to turn to ?
I am always asked by people ,  what can we do ? 
I dont have an answer .
Do you have any suggestions ?
OD : Unfortunately , I do not think we are going to get any answers as long as the current administration is in office .
I think the only way we will see any action taken to correct the injustices that have been done will be if we insist that the next administration conduct a full investigation into these abuses .
RS : But if we  the public  have to wait for a new administration , then what does that say about Congress ?
OD : I understand the realities facing the current Congress .
Democrats have a razor thin majority in the Senate and a narrow majority in the House .
As long as the Bush administration continues to block any investigation Congress cannot do much .
RS : Thank you Justice Diaz for your time .
