The new law is part of a comprehensive security package , which the opposition will have the opportunity to vote against next week .
However , Mr Berlusconi's enormous majority in both houses of the Italian parliament make it almost impossible for him to be defeated .

McCain suffers right wing backlash over immigration flip - flop Muriel Kane
Published : Friday May 23 , 2008

Print This Email This Since running into problems with grassroots conservatives over his support last year for an immigration bill that would have offered citizenship to illegal immigrants , Republican presidential candidate John McCain has steadily maintained that he would deal with border security before taking up larger immigration issues .
Now a statement by McCain to a group of business leaders concerned about obtaining visas for foreign workers , which suggests he has reversed his position yet again , is leading to rumbles of discontent within the conservative base .
McCain told the business roundtable on Thursday , " Senator Kennedy and I tried very hard to get immigration reform , a comprehensive plan , through the Congress of the United States .
...
Because of our failure as a federal obligation , were seeing all these various conflicts and problems .
...
We must enact comprehensive immigration reform .
We must make it a top agenda item . "
McCain 's statement immediately led to a blast from right - wing blogger John Hawkins .
" John McCain is a liar , " Hawkins wrote in an entry that quickly became the subject of widespread discussion on the right .
" He 's a man without honor , without integrity , who could not have captured the Republican nomination had he run on making comprehensive immigration a top priority of his administration . "
Last year 's immigration reform bill became an important issue in the Republican primary and threatened for a time to derail McCain 's candidacy .
In February , McCain changed direction , telling the Conservative Political Action Conference that he had heard the concerns of the American people .
" While I and other Republican supporters of the bill were genuine in our intention to restore control of our borders , " McCain stated , " we failed , for various and understandable reasons , to convince Americans that we were .
I accept that , and have pledged that it would be among my highest priorities to secure our borders first . "
In the months since , McCain has continued to insist that border security must precede immigration reform , which is why his apparent reversal of priorities comes as such a blow to conservative supporters like Hawkins .
" Under these circumstances , I simply cannot continue to support a man like John McCain for the presidency , " Hawkins writes .
" Since that is the case , I have already written the campaign and asked them to take me off of their mailing list and to no longer send me invitations to their teleconferences . "
Michelle Malkin also joined the anti-McCain chorus , writing , " McCain has shed every last pretense that he ' got the message ' from grass - roots immigration enforcement proponents and is back to his full , open - borders shamnesty push .
No surprise to any of you .
But his complete regression back to the ' comprehensive immigration reform ' euphemism is a notable milestone . "
Other right - wing bloggers are cautioning against overreaction and calling for conservatives to unite around McCain on the grounds that he is still preferable to Barack Obama .
However , Greg Ransom concludes , " If someone is making a simple choice between Obama and McCain , as Thomas Sowell has said , the choice is an easy one .
But for me as with John Hawkins , the decision to pull the lever for McCain is more than a choice between Obama and McCain , it 's a decision to pull the lever for someone who has personally betrayed me , someone who has personally lied to me .
And that 's a decision that is really hard to make . "
Citing ' phenomenal ' change , Cheney says ' it 's good to be back in Iraq ' Reuters
Published : Monday March 17 , 2008

Print This Email This Vice President Dick Cheney , an architect of the U.S - led invasion of Iraq , on Monday hailed " phenomenal changes " in Iraq on a visit to assess the success of a troop build - up five years after the war began .
" It 's good to be back in Iraq , " Cheney said after an hour - long meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki .
Cheney , who was in Iraq 10 months ago , said the Iraqis have made legislative advances that would be vital to the country 's future .
He also said there was no question but there had been a dramatic improvement in security .
Cheney arrived as Republican candidate John McCain , who will be the Republican choice in November 's presidential election , was meeting Iraqi leaders as part of a Senate Armed Services Committee fact - finding mission .
" Especially significant is to be able to return this week to mark the fifth anniversary of the beginning of the campaign that liberated the people of Iraq from Saddam Hussein 's tyranny , " Cheney said after meeting Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki .
Cheney said he sensed " phenomenal changes " since his last visit 10 months ago and described security gains as " dramatic . "
Like McCain , Cheney is in Iraq as part of a wider tour to the Middle East .
Cheney will also visit Saudi Arabia , Jerusalem , the Palestinian territories , Turkey and Oman on a nine - day tour .
Both men have been staunch supporters of a U.S. troop build - up that Washington says helped drag Iraq back from the brink of all - out sectarian civil war between majority Shi'ite and minority Sunni Muslims who were dominant under Saddam .
" I 'm happy to say Americans are more and more understanding of the success of this strategy of the surge , " McCain , referring to the build - up , told U.S. soldiers in volatile Mosul in Iraq 's north on Sunday , according to a video released by the military .
Cheney was met on his arrival in Baghdad by General David Petraeus , the commander of U.S. forces in Iraq .
He last visited Baghdad in May 2007 , a month before the deployment of an extra 30,000 troops was completed .
The U.S. military says attacks across Iraq have fallen by 60 percent since last June , when the troop build - up was completed , but says a spike in violence since January is not a trend .
Neighborhood security units set up by mainly Sunni Arab tribal leaders and a ceasefire ordered by anti-U.S. Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr for his Mehdi Army militia have also contributed to bringing down violence , the U.S. military says .
Violence remains a daily threat despite the security gains .
Roadside bombs and a minibus packed with explosives killed four people , including a policeman , and wounded 13 others in four attacks across Baghdad , police said .
Neither Cheney nor McCain were in the area at the time .
PROGRESS
A senior U.S. administration official said before Cheney 's trip that Middle East leaders would be interested in seeing what conclusions he draws now compared with a year ago and that it was expected he would say progress is being made .
Among the political issues Cheney is discussing with Iraq 's leaders are a stalled hydrocarbon law , one of Washington 's so - called reconciliation benchmarks , U.S. officials said .
The law will share revenues from Iraq 's vast oil reserves , the world 's third - largest , but remains blocked because of reluctance to compromise among Iraq 's political blocs .
Cheney and Maliki also discussed security and the future relationship between Washington and Baghdad after the U.N. mandate for the U.S. presence expires at the end of 2008 , with talks on that pact to include the presence of U.S. troops .
" This visit is important because it comes at a time when there 's a great deal of progress taking place in Iraq , " Maliki said through a translator after meeting Cheney .
Cheney and McCain were not expected to meet in Iraq .
McCain arrived on Sunday and has held talks with Maliki and other leaders .
As well as Mosul , which U.S. commanders regard as al Qaeda 's last urban stronghold in Iraq , he has toured Haditha in western Anbar , once Iraq 's most dangerous province .
Television footage showed McCain , surrounded by U.S. soldiers , buying a soft drink at a Haditha market .
He made an embarrassing gaffe on his last trip a year ago when , on a similar market tour , he said Americans were not being told the " good news " about the war in Iraq .

Vanessa Kirsch : I think the amount of money is not necessarily the primary decision for our billionaire .
He should really be thinking about the strategic influence he can have .
Because if you are strategic about it , you can have an incredibly powerful impact with less money .
Philanthropy can help invent and develop new programs and projects that work .
And then it can help to scale those programs , so that they can be demonstration models that can really change an entrenched system .
Tough : Joel , you run the country ’s biggest school system .
What if this money was simply added to New York City ’s regular education budget for next year ?
Would you be able to make a difference with it ?
Klein :
Well , I agree with Vanessa that philanthropists should think strategically , and what you ’re suggesting would be about as nonstrategic an investment as you could make .
Which is not to say that I would n’t like an additional billion dollars next year .
But I think our billionaire should think about this entirely differently .
There are two things that I would do with this money .
One , I would try to set up a national institute for educational policy that does serious research .
This is an industry in which there are so many myths , and that ’s because there are such large gaps in our knowledge right now .
And second , I would make bets on a few selected individuals .
Look , we have lots of wonderful examples in America of educational success .
The work Steve is doing with Green Dot is a terrific example .
But what we do n’t have is an entire urban school district  one that ’s predominantly made up of minority kids , with lots of English - language learners and lots of poverty  that really works , that works in a way that people say , “ O.K. , I want to replicate that district . ”
To get there , you ’re going to need a combination of circumstance and individuals .
I would look for the most promising individuals and make heavy investments in them .
Let ’s say you choose Michelle Rhee , the new schools chancellor in D.C.
That school system has long been one of the worst - performing in the country , and Michelle wants to really overhaul it .
I think our philanthropist could make an eight - year bet on her .
It ’s the same kind of thing I would have wanted to have happen to us when we started six years ago in New York .
To start , I ’d give her a couple of million to do some planning .
Then I ’d ask her to sit down and show me what strategic investments she thinks a philanthropist could make in D.C. that the system itself , for whatever reason , is not going to make .
And I would try to make three or four of these strategic bets around the country , on individuals who I thought had the talent , the longevity and the political support to make significant change feasible .
Tough :
And are those individuals all superintendents of school systems ?
Klein :
Yes , superintendents with firm support from the mayor .
What you need to create  and what , despite our progress , we have n’t achieved yet in New York  is a school district that people from other cities can come to and say : “ This works .
All we ’ve got to do is replicate this . ”
Tough : Steve , Eli Broad , who is one of the biggest philanthropists in the education world , recently decided that he wanted to make an impact on the Los Angeles school system .
But rather than doing what Joel is suggesting and making a bet on the superintendent , he made that bet on you and some other charter - school managers .
Why ?
Image Steve Barr Credit ...
Henry Leutwyler
Steve Barr : Because I ’m a disruptive force .
And he ’s betting on that force gaining enough momentum that it will ultimately change the system , not just in L.A. but elsewhere , too , in a way that really realigns the education debate .
The problem right now in education reform is that there is a tribal mentality .
We have nonunion charters spitting out studies saying how good they are versus the unions doing the opposite .
If you can find the common ground between those two groups , then you can start to move past that gridlock .
In the fall , Green Dot is going to open a new charter school in the South Bronx , and it has the support not only of the mayor and the chancellor but also of the president of the biggest teachers ’ union local in the country .
That ’s what change looks like , and that ’s the kind of innovation that I would advise somebody to invest in .
I think that ’s why people invest in Green Dot .
I like that we get good numbers and our test scores and graduation rates are fantastic , but people really invest in us because we ’re a disruptive force .
Our philanthropist should go out and find 100 people who are where I was a decade ago or where Mike Feinberg of the KIPP network of charter schools was a decade ago and invest in them .
One - third of likely voters say they are less likely to vote for McCain because of Bush
PRINCETON , NJ -- George W. Bush may do as much damage to John McCain 's chances of being elected as Jeremiah Wright does to Barack Obama's , according to results of a recent USA Today / Gallup poll .
The May 1 - 3 poll finds 38 % of likely voters saying McCain 's association with Bush makes them less likely to vote for McCain , while 33 % say Obama 's association with Wright diminishes their likelihood of voting for Obama .
The Bush - McCain relationship does have more upside than the Obama - Wright association , though , as 7 % say they are more likely to vote for McCain because of his association with Bush , while only 1 % say they are more likely to vote for Obama because of his association with Wright .
Importantly , a majority of voters in both questions say the personal association will not affect their vote either way .
The nature of the relationships is clearly different -- Wright was Obama 's former pastor , while Bush and McCain were rivals for the 2000 presidential nomination but Bush has endorsed McCain in the 2008 election .
But both present problems for the candidates -- Wright for his incendiary sermons and controversial remarks that have raised questions about Obama 's beliefs and his personal judgment , and Bush for his low approval ratings that hurt the GOP in the 2006 elections and may well do so again in 2008 .
The poll also asked how Bill Clinton might affect voters ' propensity to vote for Hillary Clinton .
While the 33 % who say it makes them less likely to cast a ballot for Hillary for president rivals the percentages found for the McCain - Bush and Obama - Wright associations , the 18 % who say it makes them more likely to vote for Hillary means Bill also helps to attract support for his wife .
Just under half say the Clintons ' association would not affect their vote .
The percentages of voters saying they are less likely to vote for a candidate because of one of their personal associations probably overstates the true negative impact for the candidates , mainly because voters who might not seriously consider voting for a candidate in the first place ( e.g. , Democrats for McCain or Republicans for Obama ) often respond that they are " less likely " to vote for that candidate .
So it is instructive to see how the results compare among voters who are generally inclined to support a candidate -- the rank - and - file of the candidate 's party .
From this perspective , the data suggest that Wright may be more detrimental to Obama 's candidacy than Bush is to McCain's .
Nearly one - fifth of Democrats , 19 % , say they are less likely to vote for Obama because of his ties to Wright ( only 2 % say the Wright - Obama connection increases their odds of voting for Obama ) .
Meanwhile , just 10 % of Republicans say they are less likely to vote for McCain because of his association with Bush ; about the same percentage ( 12 % ) say this relationship makes them more likely to vote for McCain .
It is important to note that the question asks about likelihood of voting for a candidate , so individual respondents may say that Obama 's association with Wright makes them less likely to vote for Obama , but they still might vote for Obama .
So in addition to measuring vote intention , the question probably also picks up some measure of enthusiasm for the candidates .
As such , the actual percentages may best be thought of as a rough gauge of the risks that each of the controversial personalities poses to the respective candidate .
Implications
In general , the results are mixed as to whether Wright or Bush is a greater threat to his associate 's presidential ambitions .
Among the entire electorate , the two appear to be about equally damaging .
In particular , Bush could hinder McCain 's ability to attract independent and Democratic voters .
However , the poll suggests Obama may have a harder time holding his natural base of support given his association with Wright , and , as such , that may make Wright a greater threat to Obama than Bush is to McCain .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 803 likely voters , aged 18 and older , conducted May 1 - 3 , 2008 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±4 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

The Clinton campaign ’s press call with reporters this afternoon felt like a scene from a bizarro universe , where the suspension of disbelief was demanded at the door .
Reporters were primed for the call by a memo disseminated by the campaign earlier in the morning that referred to the four primaries on March 4 as “ Obama Must - Wins . ”
It cited Obama ’s spending advantage in Ohio and Texas and the fact that he has campaigned heavily in these states .
“ Should Senator Obama fail to score decisive victories with all of the resources and effort he is bringing to bear , ” it said , “ the message will be clear : Democrats , the majority of whom have favored Hillary in the primary contests held to date , have their doubts about Senator Obama and are having second thoughts about him as a prospective standard - bearer . ”
The memo did n’t bother to answer some obvious questions , such as , Given that the Clinton campaign has lost 11 primaries in a row , how can Obama losing a few close contests on Tuesday in states where he has trailed in the polls be considered a repudiation of his campaign ?
And considering that streak of losses , how can this be a must - win for anyone but Clinton ?
But on these questions and others , the Clinton representatives on the call , including communications director Howard Wolfson and chief strategist Mark Penn , stuck to the party line , no matter how ridiculous .
Ignoring that Clinton had a 15 - point lead in Ohio and a 20 - point lead in Texas just two months ago , Wolfson said that Obama has “ every advantage ” going into the contests .
He pointed out that Obama “ and his allies ” are outspending Team Clinton by a minimum of 2 to 1 in Ohio and Texas .
If Obama does n’t win , Wolfson said , it will be a “ very clear signal that Democrats want this campaign to continue and that there is a some concern and dissatisfaction with Sen.
Obama ’s campaign . ”
When asked what it would mean if Obama won Texas , Ohio , and Vermont , but lost tiny Rhode Island , the campaign representatives said they could n’t answer the question because they rejected its premise .
But despite weeks of treating Ohio and Texas as their firewall , they we ’re looking ahead to the states that vote after Texas and Ohio , saying , “ 16 states and territories … want to make their voices heard . ”
Guam , apparently , is now part of the plan .
The campaign also took questions on a new TV advertisement it is running in Ohio that depicts children sleeping in bed , with the voice over , “ It ’s 3 a.m. , and your children are safe and asleep .
But there ’s a phone in the White House , and it ’s ringing — something ’s happening in the world .
Your vote will decide who answers that call . ”
In response to the claim that the ad is trying to use fear to gain votes , Mark Penn said it is a “ positive ad ” with “ soft images . ”
Multiple members of the campaign insisted that the ad merely raises the issue of national security , and the question of which candidate is better prepared in the event of a crisis .
When asked to point to a national security test that Senator Clinton had faced , the campaign responded that it was a “ moment of test ” when she stood up in China and said “ women ’s rights are human rights . ”
They added that Senator Clinton has worked with high - ranking members of the military through her post on the Armed Services Committee .
Barack Obama responded to the ad with this statement :
It asks a legitimate question .
It says , who do you want answering the phone in the White House when it ’s 3:00 a.m. and something has happened in the world .
It ’s a legitimate question .
And we ’ve seen these ads before .
They ’re usually the kind that play upon people ’s fears and try to scare up votes .
I do n’t think these ads will work this time because the question is not about picking up the phone .
The question is , what kind of judgment will you exercise when you pick up that phone .
In fact , we have had a red phone moment ; it was the decision to invade Iraq .
Ignoring the substance of that response , Penn repeatedly insisted that Obama had given the ad an implicit stamp of approval because he used the phrase “ legitimate question . ”
Wolfson added that it is an “ insult to voters ” that a conversation about national security was being considered fear - mongering by the press and the blogosphere .
The call eventually returned to the topic of expectations .
Wolfson dismissed the Obama campaign ’s argument from earlier in the day that Clinton had no chance to catch it in the delegate count as “ mathematical games and fantasies . ”
If Obama did n’t win the two states Clinton long insisted she would win , Wolfson added , the press should consider it a “ profound signal about Democratic unease about his candidacy . ”
I say this a lot , but it bears repeating – as cynical as I may appear , I can still be incredibly naive and optimistic about people .
I ’ve come to actually be proud of that , because it ’s not a naiveté borne out of not having bothered to live or open my eyes , and certainly not one borne out of having been sheltered or lucky ( though I know that , in many ways , I am ) .
Sometimes , my illusions get shattered , in small ways as well as big ones .
Relatively speaking , I ’m extremely open with people about my experiences of rape .
I do n’t generally go into detail , but I often reveal that I ’ve been raped and revictimized several times , by different individuals , all of whom were known to me .
I was talking to a woman yesterday who I ’ve known for about six months , and I alluded again to those experiences ( unemotionally , just as a statement of fact in contextually understanding other things that had happened to me and the timelines of my autobiography ) .
She interjected to say “ I ca n’t believe you ’ve been raped so many times . ” I sort of shrugged and nodded .
She said “ And they were all strangers ? ” I responded “ Oh no , all of them were acquaintances , people I trusted at least on a basic level . ”
And then she asked my illusion - shattering question “ But …if you knew them , how did you know it was rape ? ”
I stayed calm and think I actually managed to avoid showing just how shocked I was to be asked this question by a 29 year old , intelligent , well - educated woman ( she just graduated from teacher ’s college , so she ’s going to be passing that education along to the next generation shortly ) , but I shattered some illusions back with some gentle force .
( trigger warning behind the cut )
I knew because , above all else , I had no intention of having sex with these individuals , whether they were familiar to me or not .
I knew because on two occasions , I was passed out and came to while a man was having sex with me , only to find I was barely capable of moving , let alone pushing him off of me .
I knew because the first time it happened , before I even had a chance to say “ no ” , before I even had a chance to set boundaries and define how “ far ” was okay , as soon as I tried to push a hand away because things were moving too far , too fast , he grabbed my hair and banged my head against a nearby tree root .
That ’s pretty much exactly what I said to my friend .
Dispassionate descriptions of the events ; if there was any emotion in my voice at all it was mostly compassion for her , knowing that this had to be the first time anyone had voiced these realities in her presence .
And I ’m grateful for my ability to do that , because damn–clearly somebody ’s got to .
I ’m shocked and amazed and saddened that a 29 year old woman in our culture has apparently never been told about date rape , though presumably she ’s heard the term .
I ’m angered that anyone can graduate from teacher ’s college and be granted license to educate others in the province without ever having this explained to her .
Lots of things in the world make me angry , and lots of experiences threaten my ability to remain a vocal , passionate feminist .
But these are the ones that remind me .
Because the reality is , although I know now , and I think it ’s pretty obvious how I know , I did n’t always , and it ’s important for me to remember how I learned .
Silvio Berlusconi's new government was sworn in yesterday afternoon , completing a changing of the guard from the government of Romano Prodi transacted at blinding speed by Italian standards .
Mr Berlusconi left opponents , allies and media observers gasping as he breezed into the head of state 's office on Wednesday with a full list of ministers already prepared .
Such a thing has never happened before in messy , snail - pace , fudge - happy post - war Italy , where allocating portfolios among a baffling variety of parties often takes weeks .
And over three weeks of talks , Mr Berlusconi has left his coalition allies , the post - Fascist National Alliance and the secessionist Northern League , in no doubt that this time around he will be the boss .
The top jobs go to Berlusconi loyalists .
Another sure sign of the Forza Italia leader 's deciding vote is the fact that all four women in the cabinet are strikingly good looking , and include the former show girl Mara Carfagna , 32 ( who has a law degree ) as Equal Opportunities Minister .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The average age of the new cabinet is 50 , remarkably low for Italy ; but the average age of the women ministers – Mr Berlusconi calls them le bambine , " the kids " – is 34 .
Mr Berlusconi has been aided in his efforts to speed things up by the fact that the last election , at which he won a handsome majority , saw the number of parties represented in parliament shrink dramatically from 26 to six .
He is also aided by Italy 's desperate financial situation : with growth close to zero , there is an awareness that tough decisions must be taken .
Neither of the immediate crises awaiting Mr Berlusconi 's attention – the imminent bankruptcy of Alitalia , and the rubbish disaster in Naples – offer easy or comfortable solutions .
Mr Berlusconi wasted months of parliamentary time between 2001 and 2006 forcing through laws to extract himself from legal difficulties , but this time he must do things differently .
A commanding prime minister is a novelty in post - war Italy .
Not any more , says the media billionaire .
He can count on loyal cronies in key jobs : Giulio Tremonti is once again his Finance Minister , the multi-millionaire lawyer who in a previous incarnation helped Mr Berlusconi minimise his tax burden now taking on the task of pulling the Italian economy out of recession .
Franco Frattini returns from Brussels where he was EU Justice Commissioner to being Foreign Minister as he was for two years in the last Berlusconi government .
In the other key job of Justice Minister is Angelino Alfano , equally loyal to Mr Berlusconi , a 38 - year - old Sicilian with clean hands and a taste for hard rock .
And Roberto Calderoli , the Muslim - baiting League politician who wore a T - shirt illustrated with one of the Danish cartoons lampooning the Prophet Mohamed was named Minister for Simplification , with the task of eliminating defunct laws .
" I have five years to change the country , " Mr Berlusconi said .
The outside world may have to adjust to the novelty of a Berlusconi bereft of gags .
“ The complexity and the size of it is what creates a huge challenge for Russia and for Gazprom , ” said Vitaly V. Yermakov , director of research for the Russian and Caspian region at Cambridge Energy Research Associates .
CRITICS say that Gazprom muscled its way into the ranks of the world ’s energy giants with blatant and often ham - handed tactics , particularly during the Putin years .
The Yuzhno - Russkoye field , which Gazprom points to as an example of its resurgence , is a case in point .
Richard W. Moncrief , a Fort Worth oilman , says he is the rightful owner of 40 percent of the field , which he says he bought in a series of agreements with Gazprom about a decade ago .
But he says that Gazprom did n’t recognize his contract , instead granting BASF , a Germany company , a 35 percent stake in the field .
Mr. Moncrief is suing Gazprom in Berlin , contending that his stake is now worth $ 12 billion .
Gazprom maintains that the agreements were not binding : “ The company denies any obligations toward Moncrief Oil in relation to the Yuzhno - Russkoye field , ” the company said in a statement .
Mr. Moncrief disagrees , but is pessimistic about his legal position .
“ Nobody has ever gotten a Russian company into a court that could enforce a contract , ” he said in a telephone interview .
“ In the end , the Russians are going to do exactly what they want to , and they ’re going to ride the back of Western commerce to fund their country . ”
Western executives say that the Kremlin is always on call whenever Gazprom needs a boost .
Last year , TNK - BP , a Russian joint venture involving BP and the Alfa Group , Access Industries and the Renova Group , agreed to sell Gazprom a vast Siberian gas field after Russian authorities threatened to cancel the venture ’s license to operate there .
Gazprom offered $ 700 million to $ 900 million for TNK - BP ’s stake in the field and a local gas distribution company .
It is a complex deal that has yet to close .
Whatever its terms , analysts say , they would hardly compensate BP for the field , Kovykta , which is thought to hold immense gas supplies  and for the millions of dollars that the venture had already invested there .
June 4 , 2008  --
Do n't call Barack Obama an appeaser .
In his speech Wednesday before the American - Israel Public Affairs Committee , Obama sounded a bit like the more hawkish officials in the Bush administration .
He said the military option is " on the table " for dealing with Iran 's nuclear program , and in stark contrast to earlier statements , he said he would meet with Iranian leaders " if and only if it can advance the interest of the United States . "
Obama 's tone was strikingly different from it has been in the past .
During a debate last summer , he said he would be willing to meet with Iranian leaders and other American adversaries " without preconditions " during the first year of his presidency .
Today , he made it clear that we should not expect a President Obama to be sitting down with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad any time soon :
" [ A ]s president of the United States , I would be willing to lead tough and principled diplomacy with the appropriate Iranian leaders at a time and place of my choosing if and only if it can advance the interest of the United States .
That is my position .
I want to be absolutely clear . "
Obama Camp Defends
Obama campaign officials insist the presumptive Democratic nominee has not changed his position .
" It 's not a precondition to say he 'll only do it to advance our interests , " said Obama foreign policy adviser Denis McDonough .
McDonough said Obama has never promised to meet with Iran 's leaders .
He 's simply said that he is willing to meet with Iran 's leaders .
" And the key word there is willing .
The idea that some have suggested is that he has promised a meeting .
That is not the case and never was the case .
He argued then as he argued today that he is willing to meet as it advances our interests . "
But take another look at what Obama said during last July 's Democratic debate sponsored by CNN and Youtube .
The question is clear , and so is his response :
QUESTION : " Would you be willing to meet separately , without precondition , during the first year of your administration , with the leaders of Iran , Syria , Venezuela , Cuba and North Korea ? "
OBAMA : " I would .
And the reason is this :
The notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them -- which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this administration -- is ridiculous .
Ronald Reagan constantly spoke to the Soviet Union at a time when he called them an evil empire .
He understood that we may not trust them , and they may pose an extraordinary danger to this country , but we had the obligation to find areas where we can potentially move forward .
And I think that it is a disgrace that we have not spoken to them . "
Obama 's position on talking to Iran has been evolving for some time .
Since the CNN / Youtube debate , he has been saying that he would only meet with Iranian leaders after " preparation " by lower - level officials .
Most recently , talking to reporters in South Dakota last month , he explained , " The preparation would involve starting with low - level , lower - level diplomatic contacts , having our diplomatic corps work with their Iranian counterparts , an agenda .
But what I have said is that at some point , I would be willing to meet . "
Now with his speech before AIPAC he said he will meet with Iranian leaders " if and only if it can advance the interest of the United States . "
This is n't all that different from the Bush administration 's position .
Echoes of Bush Policy
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has also offered to meet with Iranian leaders if Iran agrees to suspend its uranium enrichment program .
It 's a more specific precondition than Obama's , but it is an offer to hold negotiations .
" We would be willing to meet with them but not while they continue to inch toward nuclear weapons under the cover of talks , " Rice said Tuesday .
" The real question is n't why wo n't the Bush administration talk to Iran .
The real question is why wo n't Iran talk to us . "
There is , of course , one important difference .
Obama is willing to start low - level talks on Iran 's nuclear program right away , something the Bush administration has refused to do .
Obama said he would engage in such diplomacy " with no illusions about the Iranian regime . "
" I will do everything in my power to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon , " he said , repeating himself for emphasis , " everything in my power to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear , everything . "
Echoing the Bush administration , Obama added : " I will always keep the threat of military action on the table to defend our security and our ally , Israel .
Do not be confused . "

A secret draft agreement is being drawn up to allow United States forces to remain in Iraq indefinitely , it has been reported .
The document , which was written a month ago and is and marked “ secret ” and “ sensitive ” , is intended to replace the United Nations mandate for coalition troops , including British forces , to remain in Iraq , which expires at the end of the year .
The draft authorisation would allow for the US to “ conduct military operations in Iraq and to detain individuals when necessary for imperative reasons of security ” .
It does not set a time limit , but describes the arrangement as temporary and points out that the US does not want “ permanent bases or a permanent military presence ” in the country .
It also states that the US does not seek to use Iraq as a base to launch operations against other states .

At the core of the official story about 9/11 is the claim that the four airliners that crashed that day had been taken over by a band of al - Qaeda hijackers led by Mohamed Atta .
No proof was ever provided for this claim .
But various kinds of evidence have been offered , the most important of which was reportedly found in Atta ’s luggage after the attacks .
The materials in this luggage were said to confirm the suspicion that the planes had been hijacked by Atta and fellow Muslims .
As Joel Achenbach wrote in a Washington Post story on September 16 , 2001 :
Atta is thought to have piloted American Airlines Flight 11 , the first to slam into the World Trade Center .
A letter written by Atta , left in his luggage at Boston ’s Logan Airport , said he planned to kill himself so he could go to heaven as a martyr .
It also contained a Saudi passport , an international driver ’s license , instructional videos for flying Boeing airliners and an Islamic prayer schedule .
( “ ’ You Never Imagine ’ A Hijacker Next Door . ” )
This discovery was clearly very helpful in making the case against Atta and al - Qaeda .
But why was Atta ’s luggage there to be discovered ?
Achenbach said : “ Officials believe that Atta and [ Abdul ] Alomari rented a car in Boston , drove to Portland , Maine , and took a room Monday night at the Comfort Inn . . . .
They then flew on a short flight Tuesday morning from Portland to Boston , changing to Flight 11 . ”
But why did Atta ’s luggage not make it on to Flight 11 ?
A 9/11 staff statement suggested that it was a tight connection , saying : “ The Portland detour almost prevented Atta and Omari from making Flight 11 out of Boston .
In fact , the luggage they checked in Portland failed to make it onto the plane ” ( Staff Statement No. 16 , June 16 , 2004 ) .
When The 9/11 Commission Report appeared the following month , however , this suggestion was missing .
Indeed , the Commission , after saying that “ Atta and Omari arrived in Boston at 6:45 , ” added that “ American Airlines Flight 11 [ was ] scheduled to depart at 7:45 ” ( 9/11 Commission Report [ henceforth 9/11CR ] , 1 - 2 ) .
If there was almost an hour for the luggage to be transferred , why was it left behind ?
We might suppose that the ground crew was careless .
American Airlines reported , however , that “ Atta was the only passenger among the 81 aboard American Flight 11 whose luggage did n’t make the flight ” ( Paul Sperry , WorldNetDaily.com , September 11 , 2002 ) .
There was , moreover , even a bigger mystery :
Why did Atta , if he was already in Boston on September 10 , take the trip to Portland and stay overnight , thereby necessitating the early morning commuter flight ?
If the commuter flight had been delayed by an hour , Atta and al - Omari would have missed the connection .
There would have been only three hijackers to take control of Flight 11 .
Atta , moreover , was reportedly the designated pilot for this flight and also the ringleader of the whole operation , which , after years of planning , he might have had to call off .
Why he would have made such a risky trip has never been explained .
A year after the attacks , FBI Director Robert Mueller , testifying to the Congressional Joint Inquiry into 9/11 , said :
[ T ]he day before the attacks , Mohamed Atta . . . picked up Abdul Aziz . . . and drove to Portland , Maine .
They checked into the Comfort Inn in South Portland .
. . .
[ T ] heir reason for going there , to date , remains unclear .
( “ Statement for the Record , ” Joint Intelligence Committee Inquiry , Sept. 26 , 2002 )
Two years later , the 9/11 Commission wrote : “ No physical , documentary , or analytical evidence provides a convincing explanation of why Atta and Omari drove to Portland , Maine , from Boston on the morning of September 10 , only to return to Logan on Flight 5930 on the morning of September 11 ” ( 9/11 CR 451n1 ) .
We have , therefore , two mysteries .
Why would Atta have risked the trip to Portland ?
And why did his luggage fail to get loaded onto Flight 11 ?
My book , 9/11 Contradictions , is about contradictions , not mysteries .
Clues to these mysteries , however , can be found by exploring a full - fledged contradiction : the fact that the Atta - to - Portland story contradicts stories that appeared in the press in the first days after 9/11 .
The Original Story : Boston and the Bukharis
According to the official account , as we have seen , Atta drove to Portland in a blue Nissan Altima , then flew on the morning of September 11 from Portland to the Boston airport , where the incriminating materials were found in his luggage later that day .
In the first few days after 9/11 , however , the story was very different .
On September 12 , a CNN report distinguished between Atta and the men who flew from Portland to Boston .
Law enforcement sources say that two of the suspected hijackers . . . are brothers that lived [ in Vero Beach , Florida ] .
. . .
One of them is Adnan Bukhari .
We have a photograph of him .
. . .
Also living in Vero Beach , Bukhari ’s brother , Ameer . . . .
Law enforcement sources . . . tell CNN that the Bukhari brothers were believed to have been on one of the two flights out of Boston . . . .
Also we can report to you that a car impounded in Portland , Maine , according to law enforcement authorities , was rented at Boston Logan Airport and driven to Portland , Maine .
Now the Maine state police confirm that two of the suspected hijackers were on a U.S.
Air flight out of [ the Portland airport . ]. . .
The FBI is also looking at two more suspected hijackers . . . , Mohammad Atta and Marwan Yusef Alshehhi . ” ( “ America Under Attack : How Could It Happen ? ”
Although the reporter , Susan Candiotti , said “ Logan Airport , ” the information she received had to have referred to the Portland airport , from which the U.S. Airways flight originated , and about which the Maine state police would have had information . )
Another CNN report that same day stated that the incriminating materials were found in a car at the Boston airport and , while discussing the Nissan found at the Portland airport , did not connect it to Atta :
Law enforcement officials confirmed that a car was seized at Boston ’s Logan International Airport and that suspicious materials were found .
The Boston Herald said there were Arabic language flight training manuals in the car .
. . .
Meanwhile , in Portland , Maine , police said that two individuals who traveled by plane from that city to Boston were under investigation .
. . .
Maine authorities said a car — a rented silver Nissan Altima with Massachusetts plates — was seized from the Portland airport Tuesday evening .
( “ US Says It Has Identified Hijackers ” )
On the next day , September 13 , CNN named the Bukharis as the renters of the Nissan and said that the car found at Boston , now identified as a Mitsubishi , was rented by Atta :
“ Two of the men were brothers , . . .
Adnan Bukhari and Ameer Abbas Bukhari . . . .
The two rented a car , a silver - blue Nissan Altima , from an Alamo car rental at Boston ’s Logan Airport and drove to an airport in Portland , Maine , where they got on US Airways Flight 5930 at 6 AM Tuesday headed back to Boston .
. . .
A Mitsubishi sedan impounded at Logan Airport was rented by [ Mohamed ] Atta , sources said .
The car contained materials , including flight manuals , written in Arabic that law enforcement sources called “ helpful ” to the investigation . ”
( “ Two Brothers among Hijackers ” )
Another CNN report that same day said that law enforcement authorities were led to the Bukhari brothers by documents connected to the Nissan ( “ Hijack Suspect Detained , Cooperating with FBI ” ) .
A Problem Emerges
However , that same day ( September 13 ) , CNN issued a correction ( “ Feds Think They ’ve Identified Some Hijackers ” ) , pointing out that neither of the Bukharis had died on 9/11 : Ameer had died the year before and Adnan was still alive .
CNN apologized for the “ misinformation , ” which had been “ [ b] ased on information from multiple law enforcement sources . ”
However , this discovery did not immediately lead to a complete change of story .
For example , the next day ( September 14 ) , CNN said : “ A Mitsubishi sedan [ Atta ] rented was found at Boston ’s Logan Airport .
Arabic language materials were found in the car ” ( Mike Fish , “ Fla. Flight Schools May Have Trained Hijackers ” ) .
The Emergence of the Final Story
That same day , however , the story began to change more drastically .
An Associated Press report , referring to “ two suspects in the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center , ” said :
One of the two suspects who boarded a flight in Portland was Mohamed Atta , 33 . . . .
The 2001 Nissan Altima used by the men came from the same Boston rental location as another car used by additional suspects that contained incriminating materials when it was seized at Boston ’s Logan Airport .
Once in Maine , the suspects spent the night at the Comfort Inn in South Portland before boarding the plane the next morning .
( “ Portland Police Eye Local Ties ” )
Suddenly , the Nissan Altima had been driven to Portland by Atta and his companion , who had then flown back to Boston the next morning .
But the transition to what would become the accepted narrative was not yet complete .
The incriminating materials were still found in a rental car left at Logan — although this car was now said to have been rented by unnamed “ additional suspects , ” not by Atta .
The complete transition was made on September 16 , in the aforementioned Washington Post article by Joel Achenbach , which had the incriminating evidence found in Atta ’s luggage .
This new story was soon fleshed out with various details , including physical evidence that Atta and al - Omari had been in Portland the night before the attacks .
One article said :
The FBI released a detailed chronology Thursday [ October 4 ] showing that two of the suspected hijackers in the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center spent their final hours in Greater Portland .
. . .
After checking in at the motel , Atta and Alomari were seen . . . [ b ] etween 8 and 9 PM . . . at Pizza Hut ; at 8:31 PM , they were videotaped by a KeyBank automatic teller machine , and videotaped again at 8:41 PM at a Fast Green ATM next to Pizzeria Uno . . . .
At . . .
9:22 PM , Atta was caught on videotape in the Wal - Mart in Scarborough .
( “ The Night Before Terror , ” Portland Press Herald , October 5 , 2001 )
The Mysteries and the Contradiction
This new story solved a problem created by the discovery that the Bukharis had not died on 9/11 — how to explain why a rental car left at the Portland airport could have led authorities to two of the hijackers .
This solution , however , created the mystery of why Atta would have taken this trip plus the problem of explaining the well - reported fact that incriminating materials had been found at Logan Airport .
This latter problem was solved by saying that they were found in Atta ’s luggage , which did not make it onto Flight 11 .
But this solution created , in turn , the mystery as to why Atta ’s luggage failed to make the flight .
The main problem facing the new story , however , is simply the fact that it is a new story , which radically contradicts what the authorities had said the first few days .
The 9/11 Commission dealt with this contradiction by simply ignoring it .
It did not mention the early reports that the Nissan left at the Portland airport had documents leading the FBI to Adnan and Ameer Bukhari , that the Bukharis had taken the early morning flight from Portland to Boston , that the FBI was led to Atta ( along with Marwan al - Shehhi ) by information found in a Mitsubishi left at Boston ’s Logan Airport , or that this Mitsubishi was where the treasure trove of information was found .
It instead simply told the new story as if it had been the story all along .
Congress and the press need to ask why this contradiction exists and why the 9/11 Commission ignored it .

Several years ago I bought some remote property in Arizona .
I am an astronomer and wanted a place to practice my hobby far away from the sky - wrecking light pollution found near cities of any real size .
In my attempt to escape city light pollution , I found a great piece of remote property .
The problem is , it 's so remote that there is no electric service available .
That 's not really a problem .
No electricity equals no light pollution .
However , it would be nice to have at least a little electricity , since so much of life in the 21st century is dependent on it .
I built a wind turbine to provide some power on the remote property .
It works great , when the wind blows .
However , I wanted more power , and more dependable power .
The wind seems to blow all the time on my property , except when I really need it too .
I 've also been experimenting with a biomass gasifier .
With well over 300 sunny days a year on the property though , solar power seems like an obvious choice to supplement the wind turbine and gasifier .
Solar panels are very expensive though .
So I decided to try my hand at building my own .
I used common tools and inexpensive and easy to acquire materials to produce a solar panel that rivals commercial panels in power production , but completely blows them away in price .
Read on for step by step instructions on how I did it .
Here is a video of the solar panel set up and in use on my remote , off - grid property .
Let me state up front that I probably wo n't be able to help you out much if you decide to build your own solar panel (s ) .
This web site has become insanely popular , often taxing the bandwidth limits of the server .
I get dozens of requests for help each day .
I simply do n't have time to answer the majority of them .
Most of the questions and requests I get are the same ones over and over again .
I have crated a FAQ to handle these repetitive questions .
Please read it before emailing me .
Simple questions , not covered by the FAQ , which only require a quick and simple answer may get replies if time permits .
However , there is no way I can help you out with complex issues , teach you electronics theory , help you locate parts , build a charge controller for you , or custom design a system for you .
There just are n't enough hours in the day .
Sorry .
So what is a solar panel anyway ?
It is basically a box that holds an array of solar cells .
Solar cells are the things that do the actual work of turning sunlight into electricity .
However , it takes a lot of cells to make a meaningful amount of power , and they are very fragile , so the individual cells are assembled into panels .
The panels hold enough cells to make a useful amount of power and protect the cells from the elements .
It does n't sound too complicated .
I was convinced I could do it myself .
I started out the way I start every project , by Googling for information on home - built solar panels .
I was shocked at how few I found .
The fact that very few people were building their own panels led me to think it must be harder to do than I thought .
The project got shelved for a while , but I never stopped thinking about it .
After a while , I came to some conclusions :
The main stumbling block to building solar panels is acquiring solar cells at a reasonable price .
New solar cells are very expensive , and can even sometimes be hard to find in quantity at any price .
Blemished and damaged solar cells are available on Ebay and other places at a fraction of the cost of new perfect cells .
and other places at a fraction of the cost of new perfect cells .
These second rate solar cells could probably be used to make a solar panel that would work just fine .
Once I came to the realization that I could use blemished and factory - second solar cells to build my panels , I finally got to work .
I started by buying some solar cells off of Ebay .
I bought a couple of bricks of 3 X 6 mono - crystalline solar cells .
It takes a total of 36 of these type solar cells wired in series to make a panel .
Each cell produces about 1/2 Volt. 36 in series would give about 18 volts which would be good for charging 12 volt batteries .
( Yes , you really need that high a Voltage to effectively charge 12 Volt batteries )
This type of solar cell is as thin as paper and as brittle and fragile as glass .
They are very easily damaged .
The seller of these solar cells dips stacks of 18 in wax to stabilize them and make it easier to ship them without damaging them .
The wax is quite a pain to remove though .
If you can , find cells for sale that are n't dipped in wax .
Keep in mind though that they may suffer some more damage in shipping .
Notice that these cells have metal tabs on them .
You want cells with tabs on them .
You are already going to have to do a lot of soldering to build a panel from tabbed solar cells .
If you buy cells without tabs , it will at least double the amount of soldering you have to do .
So pay extra for tabbed cells .
I also bought a couple of lots of cells that were n't dipped in wax from another Ebay seller .
These cells came packed in a plastic box .
They rattled around in the box and got a little chipped up on the edges and corners .
Minor chips do n't really matter too much .
They wo n't reduce the cell 's output enough to worry about .
These are all blemished and factory seconds anyway .
The main reason solar cells get rejected is for chips .
So what 's another chip or two ?
All together I bought enough cells to make 2 panels .
I knew I 'd probably break or otherwise ruin at least a few during construction , so I bought extras .
There are lots of other sizes of solar cells besides 3 X 6 inches available .
You could use larger or smaller cells for your panel .
Just keep a few things in mind .
Cells of the same type all produce the same voltage no matter what size they are .
So the same number of cells is always needed .
Larger cells produce more current ( Amps ) and smaller cells produce less current .
The total power your panel can produce is determined by Amps X Volts .
So using bigger cells produces more power , but the panel will be large and heavy .
Using smaller cells keeps the panel small and light , but wo n't produce as much power .
Also , mixing cell sizes is not a good idea .
This is because the current your panel can produce will be limited by the smallest cell in the group and the larger cells wo n't work to their full potential .
The cells I settled on are 3 X 6 inches in size and are rated at roughly 3 amps .
I will wire 36 of them in series to get a little over 18 volts .
The result should be a panel capable of delivering almost 60 Watts of power in bright sunlight .
It does n't sound like a lot , but it sure beats no power at all , which is what I had on my property before .
And that is 60 Watts all day when the sun is shining .
That power will go into charging batteries which will primarily be used for powering lights and small appliances for only a few hours after dark .
Once I go to bed , my power requirements drop to almost nothing .
So 60 Watts is actually quite a lot of useful power , especially when I also have my wind turbine adding to the power production when the wind is blowing .
After you buy your solar cells , put them away in a safe place where they wo n't get dropped , played with by the kids , or eaten by the dog until you are ready to install them in the panel .
These cells are very fragile .
Rough treatment and excessive handling will turn your expensive solar cells into little , blue , shiny shards that are n't useful for anything .
A solar panel is really just a shallow box .
So I started out by building myself a shallow box .
I made the box shallow so the sides would n't shade the solar cells when the sun comes at an angle from the sides .
It is made of 3/8 inch thick plywood with 3/4 X 3/4 pieces of wood around the edges .
The pieces are glued and screwed in place .
This panel will hold 36 3 X 6 inch solar cells .
I decided to make 2 sub - panels of 18 cells each just so make it easier to assemble later .
So there is a center divider across the middle of the box .
Each sub - panel will fit into one well in the main panel .
Here is my sort of back of the envelope sketch showing the overall dimensions of the solar panel .
All dimensions are in inches ( sorry you fans of the metric system ) .
The side pieces are 3/4 by 3/4 and go all the way around the edges of the plywood substrate .
also a piece goes across the center to divide the panel into two sub-panels .
This is just the way I chose to do it .
There is nothing critical about these dimensions , or even the overall design .
Feel free to deviate in your own design .
These dimensions are included here for those people who always clamor for me to include dimensions on my projects .
I always encourage people to experiment and innovate on their own , rather than blindly follow the way I ( or anyone else ) does things .
You may well come up with a better design .
Here is a close - up showing one half of the main panel .
This well will hold one 18 cell sub-panel .
Notice the little holes drilled in the edges of the well .
This will be the bottom of the panel ( it is upside down in the photo , sorry ) .
These are vent holes to keep the air pressure inside the panel equalized with the outside , and to let moisture escape .
These holes must be on the bottom of the panel or rain and dew will run inside .
There must also be vent holes in the center divider between the two sub panels .
Update :
After using the panel for a while , I now recommend that the vent holes be increased to at least 1 /4 inch in diameter .
Also , to keep dust and critters out of the panel , stuff a little fiberglass insulation in the holes in the bottom rail of the panel .
The insulation is not needed in the holes in the center divider .
Next I cut two pieces of masonite peg -board to fit inside the wells .
These pieces of peg - board will be the substrates that each sub - panel will be built on .
They were cut to be a loose fit in the wells .
You do n't have to use peg - board for this .
I just happened to have some on hand .
Just about any thin , rigid and non-conducting material should work .
To protect the solar cells from the weather , the panel will have a plexiglass front .
Here two pieces of scrap plexiglass have been cut to fit the front of the panel .
I did n't have one piece big enough to do the whole thing .
Glass could also be used for this , but glass is fragile .
Hail stones and flying debris that would shatter glass will just bounce off the plexi .
Now you can start to see what the finished panel will look like .
Oops !
This photo shows a close - up of where the two halves of the plexiglass cover meet over the center divider .
I drilled and countersunk holes all around the edges of both pieces of plexiglass so I could screw them onto the face of the panel with 1 inch drywall screws .
Be careful working close to the edge of the plexi .
If you get to aggressive it will break , as happened here .
I just glued the broken piece back in and drilled another hole a short distance away .
Next I gave all the wooden parts of the panel several coats of paint to protect them from moisture and the weather .
The box was painted inside and out .
The type of paint and color was scientifically chosen by shaking all the paint cans I had laying around in my garage and choosing the one that felt like it had enough left in it to do the whole job .
The peg - board pieces were also painted .
They got several coats on both sides .
Be sure to paint them on both sides or they will curl when exposed to moisture .
Curling could damage the solar cells that will be glued to them .
Now that I had the structure of the panel finished , it was time to get the solar cells ready
As I said above , getting the wax off the cells is a real pain .
After some trial and error , I came up with a way that works fairly well .
Still , I would recommend buying from someone who does n't dip their cells in wax .
The first step is a bath in hot water to melt the wax and separate the cells from each other .
Do n't let the water boil or the bubbles will jostle the cells against each other violently .
Also , boiling water may be hot enough to loosen the electrical connections on the cells .
I also recommend putting the brick of cells in the water cold , and then slowly heating it up to just below boiling temperature to avoid harsh thermal shocks to the cells .
Plastic tongs and spatulas come in handy for teasing the cells apart once the wax melts .
Try not to pull too hard on the metal tabs or they may rip off .
I found that out the hard way while trying to separate the cells .
Good thing I bought extras .
This photo shows the complete setup I used .
My girlfriend asked what I was cooking .
Imagine her surprise when I said solar cells .
The initial hot water bath for melting the wax is in the right - rear .
On the left - front is a bath of hot soapy water .
On the right - front is a bath of hot clean water .
All the pots are at just below boiling temperature .
The sequence I used was to melt the bricks apart in the hot water bath on the right - rear .
I 'd tease the cells apart and transfer them one at a time to the soapy water bath on the left - front to remove any wax on the cell .
Then the cell would be given a rinse in the hot clean water on the right - front .
The cells would then be set out to dry on a towel .
You should change the water frequently in the soapy and rinse water baths .
Do n't pour the water down the sink though , because the wax will solidify in your drains and clog them up .
Dump the water outside .
This process removed almost all the wax from the cells .
There is still a very light film on some of the cells , but it does n't seem to interfere with soldering or the working of the cells .
A solvent bath would probably remove the rest of the wax , but that would be dangerous and stinky since the only solvents I could think of that would cut wax are either flamable , toxic or smelly , or all three .
Here are some separated and cleaned solar cells drying on a towel .
Once separated from their wax stabilized brick form , they are amazingly fragile and difficult to handle and store .
I would recommend leaving them as bricks until you are ready to install them in your panel .
That way you wo n't wreck them before you get to use them .
So build the panel first .
Now it 's time to start installing them in the panel
I started out by drawing a grid pattern on each of the two pieces of pegboard , lightly in pencil , so I would know where each of the 18 cells on them would be located .
Then I laid out the cells on that grid pattern upside - down so I could solder them together .
All 18 cells on each half panel need to be soldered together in series , then both half panels need to be connected in series to get the desired voltage .
Soldering the cells together was tricky at first , but I got the hang of it fairly quickly .
Start out with just two cells upside - down .
Lay the solder tabs of one cell across the solder points on the back of the other cell .
I made sure the spacing between the cells matched the grid pattern .
I used a low - Wattage soldering iron and fine rosen - core solder .
I also used a rosen pen on the solder points on the back of the cells before soldering .
Use a real light touch with the soldering iron .
The cells are thin and delicate .
If you push too hard , you will break the cells .
I got careless a couple of times and scrapped a couple of cells .
UPDATE 04/01/10
A lot of people write me confused about how to solder the solar cells together .
When a hundred people all ask the same question , it 's obvious I am not being clear in this area .
A lot of people look at the photos and assume I am soldering the cells in parallel instead of in series .
I have created this crude sketch to hopefully clear things up .
This is a side view of the solar cells soldered together .
The negative tabs from the top of one cell are soldered to the positive pads on the bottom of the next .
This connects the cells in series , and adds their voltages .
I do this until I have a string of 6 cells .
3 strings of 6 make a half panel .
I hope that helps .
I repeated the above steps and soldered solar cells together until I had a string of six cells .
I soldered tabs from scrapped cells to the solder points on the back of the last cell in the string of six .
Then I repeated the whole process two more times to get three strings of six cells for a total of 18 for this half of the panel .
The three strings of cells need to be wired in series .
So the middle string needs to be rotated 180 degrees with respect to the other two .
I got the strings oriented the way I wanted them ( still upside - down ) on top of the pegboard panel before the next step of gluing the cells in place .
Gluing the cells in place proved to be a little tricky .
I placed a small blob of clear silicone caulk in the center of each cell in a six cell string .
Then I flipped the string over and set in place on the pencil line grid I had laid out earlier .
I pressed lightly in the center of each cell to get it to stick to the pegboard panel .
Flipping the floppy string of cells is tricky .
Another set of hands may be useful in during this step .
Do n't use too much glue , and do n't glue the cells anywhere but at their centers .
The cells and the panel they are mounted on will expand , contract , flex and warp with changes in temperature and humidity .
If you glue the cells too tightly to the substrate , they will crack in time .
gluing them at only one point in the center allows the cells to float freely on top of the substrate .
Both can expand and flex more or less independently , and the delicate solar cells wo n't crack .
Next time I will do it differently .
I will solder tabs onto the backs of all the solar cells .
Then I will glue all the cells down in their proper places .
Then I will solder the tabs together .
It seems like the obvious way to go to me now , but I had to do it the hard way once to figure it out .
Here is one half panel , finally finished .
Here I used copper braid to interconnect first and second strings of cells .
You could use solar cell tabbing material or even regular wire .
I just happened to have the braid on hand .
There is another similar interconnection between the second and third strings at the opposite end of the board .
I used blobs of silicone caulk to anchor the braid and prevent it from flopping around .
Here I am testing first half panel outside in the sun .
In weak sun through clouds the half panel is producing 9.31 Volts .
YAHOO !
It works !
Now all I had to do is build another one just like it .
Once I had two half panels complete , I could install them in their places in the main panel frame and wire them together .
Each of the half panels dropped right into their places in the main panel frame .
I used four small screws ( like the silver one in the photo ) to anchor each of the half panels in place .
Wires to connect the two half panels together were run through the vent holes in the central divider .
Again , blobs of silicone caulk were used to anchor the wire in place and prevent it from flopping around .
Each solar panel in a solar power system needs a blocking diode in series with it to prevent the panel from discharging your batteries at night or during cloudy weather .
I used a Schottky diode with a 3.3 Amp current rating .
Schottky diodes have a much lower forward voltage drop than ordinary rectifier diodes , so less power is wasted .
Every Watt counts .
I got a package of 25 31DQ03 Schottky diodes on Ebay for only a few bucks .
So I have enough left - overs for lots more solar panels
My original plan was to mount the diode inline with the positive wire outside the panel .
After looking at the spec - sheet for the diode though , I decided to mount it inside since the forward voltage drop gets lower as the temperature rises .
It will be warmer inside the panel and the diode will work more efficiently .
More silicone caulk was used to anchor the diode and wires .
I drilled a hole in the back of the panel near the top for the wires to exit .
I put a knot in the wires for strain relief , and anchored them in place with yet more of the silicone caulk .
It is important to let all the silicone caulk cure well before screwing the plexiglass covers in place .
I have found through past experience that the fumes from the caulk may leave a film on the inside of the plexiglass and the cells if it is n't allowed to thoroughly cure in the open air before screwing on the cover .
And still more silicone caulk was used to seal the outside of the panel where the wires exit .
I added a polarized two - pin jones plug to the end of the panel wires .
A mating female plug will be wired into the charge controller I use with my home - built wind turbine so the solar panel can supplement its power production and battery charging capacity .
UPDATE : 10/12/09
I 've been getting a lot of emails from people giving me grief for using a male plug on the solar panel .
They say that power sources should always have female pugs on them to prevent short circuits .
I understand their point .
However , the reason I used the male plug on the solar panel is because there is a much greater danger of a short circuit on the cable going to the charge controller and battery bank .
The solar panel can only supply 3 Amps to a short circuit at most .
The battery bank though could pump hundreds or possibly thousands of Amps through a short circuit .
That is enough energy to do serious damage .
So I put the female end on the cable to the charge controller .
Still , I agree that it is dangerous to have a male plug on the solar panel .
On a recent trip to Radio Shack I found this sort of plug .
It only cost a few bucks and will solve the potential short circuit problem .
When unplugged , neither end can short out .
Here is the completed panel with the plexiglass covers screwed into place .
It is n't sealed shut yet at this point .
I wanted to wait until after testing it because was worried that I might have to get back inside it if there were problems .
Sure enough , a tab popped off one of the cells .
Maybe it was due to thermal stresses or shock from handling .
Who knows ?
I opened up the panel and replaced that one cell .
I have n't had any more trouble since .
I will probably seal the panel with either a bead of silicone caulk , or aluminum AC duct tape wrapped around the edges .
Here I am testing the Voltage output of the completed panel in bright winter sunlight .
My meter says 18.88 Volts with no load .
That 's exactly what I was aiming for .
Here I am testing the current capacity of the panel , again in bright winter sunlight .
My meter says 3.05 Amps short circuit current .
That is right about what the cells are rated for .
So the panel is working very well .
So how much did all this cost to build ?
Well , I saved all the receipts for everything I bought related to this project .
Also , my workshop is well stocked with all sorts of building supplies and hardware .
I also have a lot of useful scrap pieces of wood , wire and all sorts of miscellaneous stuff ( some would say junk ) lying around the shop .
So I had a lot of stuff on hand already .
Your mileage may vary .
Part Origin Cost
Solar Cells Ebay $ 74.00 * Misc. Lumber Homecenter Store $ 20.62 Plexiglass Scrap Pile $ 0.00 Screws & Misc. Hardware Already on hand $ 0.00 Silicone Caulk Homecenter Store $ 3.95 Wire Already on hand $ 0.00 Diode Ebay $ 0.20 ± Jones Plug Newark Electronics $ 6.08 Paint Already on hand $ 0.00
Total
$ 104.85 Not too bad .
That 's a fraction of what a commercially made solar panel with a comparable power output would cost , and it was easy .
I already have plans to build more panels to add to the capacity of my system .
I 'll post more here as the project evolves .
Stay tuned * I actually bought 4 lots of 18 solar cells .
This price represents only the two lots that went into building this panel .
Also , the price of factory second solar cells on Ebay has gone up quite a lot recently as oil prices have skyrocketed .
±
This price represents 1 out of a lot of 25 diodes I bought on Ebay for $ 5.00 .
UPDATE 07/18/08
Once again I stayed on my remote property during my recent vacation in Arizona .
This time I had both my home - built wind turbine and my home - built solar panel with me .
Working together , they provided plenty of power for my ( admittedly minimal ) electricity needs .
Here is a close - up of the solar panel in action .
I have to move it several times each day to keep it pointed at the sun , but that is n't really a big hardship .
Maybe someday I will build a tracking system to automatically keep it aimed at the sun .
UPDATE 10/12/09
Here is a close - up of the solar panel after having the edges sealed with aluminum tape .
This is not the cheap duct tape .
This is the thin metal tape with an adhesive backing .
I applied it all the way around the edges of the panel and across the center seam .
I burnished it down well to make a good seal .
I was careful to punch out the vent holes so they would n't be blocked .
The tape seems to be quite weather - proof , and the panel seems to be thoroughly sealed and protected .
Only time will tell how well it works .
However , since my panels are only outdoors when I am staying on my remote property , and are not exposed to the weather all the time , I suspect it will hold up well for a long time .
The Aluminum tape gives the panel a whole new look .
It looks like the frame is made of metal , rather than wood .
To my eye , it looks a lot more professional .
I have also completed a second solar panel .
This is a smaller 15 Watt panel .
It folds up for easier storage and transportation .
Click the photo to learn more about it .
UPDATE 03/20/11
I have designed a simple battery charge controller circuit for use with solar panels and wind turbines .
It is a simple circuit , and it uses only easy to find parts , so it is very easy to build .
Click the photo for more information .
UPDATE 11/02/11
This is a photo of my new home - built solar tracking platform for one of my home - made 60 Watt solar panels .
Actually , I could get two panels on this tracker , but I only have one mounted now for testing .
This is really just a teaser photo because the tracker is n't finished yet .
I am still working on the electronics to drive it .
The structure was mostly completed a couple of days ago , and I got this nice photo of it set up in my workshop .
It probably wo n't be completely done for another month or two .
Then I will put up a full write - up on how I built it .
I will tell you this much about it now .
It is driven by a 1960s vintage antenna rotator .
The structure is designed to come apart for eventual transport to my remote Arizona Property .
It was also cheap and easy to build .
Stay tuned for future updates on this project .

UPDATE 06/07/13
Here is a time - lapse video of my home - built solar panel sun tracker in operation .
In the video it is set up on my remote Arizona property , and is doing a good job of keeping my solar panels pointed at the sun .
It took me a while to get this project up and running .
Work and other priorities got in the way .
Plus I decided to scrap my original plan for the electronics and start over with something completely different .
So it took a while .
Now that it is up and running though , a thorough write - up on how I built it and how it works will be coming soon .
So stay tuned for more ...

Radiation is dangerous .
In high doses it is certainly lethal and chronic exposure is linked to the development of cancer .
That 's why we have bomb shelters and canned food .
But what if a short - term controlled exposure to a low dose of radiation were good for our health ?
Don Luckey , emeritus professor at the University of Missouri , claims just that in the International Journal of Low Radiation .
Luckey was also the nutrition consultant for NASA 's Apollo 11 to 17 moon missions and has spent the last several years developing the concept of improving health through exposure to low - dose radiation .
" When beliefs are abandoned and evidence from only whole body exposures to mammals is considered , it becomes obvious that increased ionising radiation would provide abundant health , " Luckey explains .
He suggests that as with many nutritional elements , such as vitamins and trace metals it is possible to become deficient in radiation .
" A radiation deficiency is seen in a variety of species , including rats and mice ; the evidence for a radiation deficiency in humans is compelling . "
In the first part of the twentieth century our understanding of radioactivity was only just emerging and health practitioners began to experiment widely with samples of radioactive materials .
Then , exposure to radiation , rather than being seen as hazardous , was considered a panacea for a wide variety of ailments from arthritis to consumption .
( 1)
The discovery of antibiotics and the rapid advent of the pharmaceutical industry , as well as the fact that it became apparent that exposure to high doses of radiation could be lethal , led to the demise of this " alternative " approach to health .
Today , radioactivity is used in targeted therapies for certain forms of cancer but the use of radiation sources for treating other diseases is not recognized by the medical profession .
Luckey argues that more than 3,000 scientific papers in the research literature point to low doses of radiation as being beneficial in human health and says that , as with many environmental factors , we have evolved to live successfully in the presence of ionizing radiation .
His research suggests that radiation exposure can minimize infectious disease , reduce the incidence of cancer in the young , and substantially increase average lifespan .
Studies on the growth , average lifespan , and decreased cancer mortality rates of humans exposed to low - dose irradiation show improved health , explains Luckey .
This represents good evidence that we live with a partial radiation deficiency and that greater exposure to radiation would improve our health , a notion supported by 130 on the health of people living in parts of the world with higher background levels of ionising radiation than average .
Luckey suggests that the medical use of small samples of partially shielded radioactive waste would provide a simple solution to radiation deficiency .
Of course , there are several questions that will have to be answered before a health program based on this study could be implemented .
How much should we have and what is the optimum exposure ?
Evidence suggests that low dose exposure increases the number and activity of the immune system 's white blood cells , boosts cytocrine and enzyme activity , and increases antibody production and so reduces the incidence of infection , assists in wound healing , and protects us from exposure to high doses of radiation .
" It is unfortunate that most literature of radiobiology involves fear and regulations about the minimum possible exposure with no regard for radiation as a beneficial agent , " says Luckey , " Those who believe the Linear No Threshold ( LNT ) dogma have no concept about any benefits from ionising radiation .
Many radiobiologists get paid to protect us from negligible amounts of ionising radiation .
Our major concern is health . "
Professor André Maïsseu , the journal 's Editor - in - Chief , and President of the World Council of Nuclear Workers WONUC ) says : " This is a very bright , interesting and important paper about the real effects of ionising radiation - radioactivity - on humans , mammals and biotopes . "
He adds that , the paper , " is part of the movement we - nuclear workers - promoting good science and fighting obscurantism in this scientific field .
Maïsseu points out that the European Union recently refused to support a world - wide study on related work .
" This was the first time nuclear workers have asked the European Union to support a scientific study , " Maïsseu says , " We received nothing yet for more than thirty years , so - called ' green ' organisations have received hundreds of millions euros , and with what results ? "
He adds that , " It is a shame and a scandal that political reasons are being used to decide on science funding . "

Be it war monuments or those dedicated to peace , memorials stand out from other structures man have built because of their unique and stunning appearance .
With so much history behind one , standing in front of a gigantic memorial can be very awe inspiring as these masterworks of art and engineering are dedicated to those who fought and died for a better future .
From all over the world , here are ten of the most impressive monuments dedicated to heroes .
Located in Romania , the Marasesti Heroes Mausoleum was built to commemorate those who died for freedom , during the Battle of Marasesti in the summer of 1917 .
The impressive construction stands on the grounds of the battle where Romanian troops lost over 24,000 men including 610 officers and managed to defeat the Germans .
Six thousands soldiers , identified or not , have been buried in crypts or common tombs inside the mausoleum along with flags , arms , guns , projectiles and many other trophies used during the battle .
No visit to Ankara would be complete without seeing the Mustafa Kemal Ataturk Mausoleum .
He was an army officer with great military capabilities , a revolutionary and the first President of Turkey .
During the Turkish Independence War , he successfully led his soldiers to achieve the country ’s liberation and most people consider him , the father of modern Turkey .
The Mausoleum is a notable example of modern Turkish architecture with its three female and three male sculpted figures representing the transition from Ottoman traditionalism to modernity .
His remains along with displays from his life , furniture and uniforms are available inside .
Located in the Heroes of the Ghetto Square in Warsaw , the monument ( Pomnik Bohater Getta ) was unveiled 5 years after the Jewish Ghetto Uprising .
It was the largest Jewish Ghetto established in Warsaw during the city ’s German Occupation in World War II , that started the first urban mass rebellion against the Nazis who wanted to deport them to extermination camps .
Though they lived in appalling , over - crowded conditions that lead to diseases or starvation , these people fought against death and showed that they can be free .
On the front there are young fighters running away from the burning ghetto , an injured man with a home - made grenade and a young woman who carries a gun , while the back of the monument is a little more touching with old people , women and children being taken to an extermination camp .
Nelson ’s Column is located in Trafalgar Square , London , and was designed by architect William Railton in 1838 .
It ’s an 18 feet sculpted statue standing on a 184 feet granite column and facing south , towards the Palace of Westminster .
A great leader with a strong personality that always loved risk and had a courage close to madness , Horatio Nelson is a British Admiral famous for winning the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 against the French - Spanish fleet .
Military specialists considered it to be the biggest Royal British Marine victory of all times .
Dedicated to those who made the ultimate sacrifice to help build the foundation for a peaceful Japan , the Yasukuni Shrine was founded in 1869 and contains in the Book of Souls more than 2.5 million spirits ( maki ) .
It ’s always been a controversy subject because more than one thousand people enshrined have been found guilty for war crimes while 14 of them were convicted as Class - A war criminals .
Nevertheless the Yasukuni Shrine has a deep relationship with the Japanese imperial family which attends twice a year , during spring and autumn , major rituals where offerings from His Majesty the Emperor are dedicated to the “ spirits ” .
Just next to the Shrine there ’s a museum commemorating Japan ’s wars , which should n’t be missed if you stop by .
It was the 38th ( Welsh ) Infantry Division that was charged with taking Mametz Wood during the bloody Battle of the Somme on July 7 , 1916 .
After five long days they managed to clear the woods of Germans , which cost them 4,000 deaths and casualties .
This is how the 38th ( Welsh ) Division Memorial erected , with a defiant dragon ( the Red Dragon of Wales was the division ’s insignia ) standing on a 10 feet plinth , facing the woods with the regimental cap badge of the South Wales Borderers carved on one side of the base .
The centerpiece in Manhattan ’s Grand Army Plaza , in New York City is a truly imposing gilded - bronze equestrian statue of the United States ’ best known general , William Tecumseh Sherman on a horse .
He fought during the California as well as in the Mexican War , and distinguished himself in the Vicksburg and Chattanooga campaigns of 1863 .
Built in 1903 , the elegant and dignifying Sherman Monument is the work of master sculptor Augustus Saint - Gaudens who also did the allegorical figure of peace who ’s leading Sherman , after his mistress , Davida Johnson .
The Marine Corps War Memorial is located near the Arlington National Cemetery in Rosslyn , Virginia .
Made of bronze and based on a photo of the Battle of Iwo Jima , it was dedicated to all personnel of the Marine Corps who died defending the country from 1775 onward .
The monument features 6 marines ( 32 feet tall ) sticking a US flag into the grounds , standing on a granite base where stays written “ In honor and memory of the men of the United States Marine Corps who have given their lives to their country since 10 November 1775 ” .
People ’s Heroes Monument in Beijing is a ten - story obelisk located to the north of Mao Zedong ’s mausoleum on the southern edge of Tiananmen Square .
Designed by architect Liang Sicheng , the imposing marble and granite monument commemorates all those who lost their lives during the 19th and 20th centuries revolutions .
The eight huge bas - relieves carved into white marble , cover the most important revolutionary episodes of the Chinese struggle , on the pedestal of the tablet .
The Kruty Heroes Memorial is a 33 feet red column on a 23 high hill which commemorates the young university students who died fighting for the Independence of Ukraine , at the Battle of Kruty trying to delay the Bolshevik Red Army from invading the city .
The events of the resistance to the Bolshevik army were hushed up in Soviet history and Ukrainians were forced to ignore them for many years .
However , in August 2006 , the memorial was dedicated .
The IT Crowd ( 2006 –2013 ) is a British comedy written by Graham Linehan .
The comedy follows Jen , Moss , and Roy and their work in the IT department , based in the basement of Reynholm Industries .

Yesterday's Jam [ 1.1 ] [ edit ]
Roy Trenneman : [ picking up the phone ]
Hello , IT .
Have you tried turning it off and on again ?
Uh ... okay , well , the button on the side , is it glowing ?
Yeah , you need to turn it on ... uh , the button turns it on ... yeah , you do know how a button works do n't you ?
No , not on clothes .
Maurice Moss : [ picking up the phone ]
Hello , IT ...
Have you tried forcing an unexpected reboot ?
Roy :
No , no there you go , no there you go .
I just heard it come on ... no , no , that 's the music you heard when it come on ... no , that 's the music you hear when ...
I 'm sorry , are you from the past ?
Moss :
See the driver hooks a function by patching the system call table , so it 's not safe to unload it unless another thread 's about to jump in there and do its stuff , and you do n't want to end up in the middle of invalid memory !
[ chuckle ]
Hello ?
Roy :
Oh really ?
Then why do n't you come down and make me then .
Huh , what you think I 'm afraid of you ?
I 'm not afraid of you .
You can come down here any time and I 'll be waiting for you !
[ slams down phone ]
I told her !
Moss :
You had a job ?
Roy : [ coyly ]
Girl on 5th .
Moss :
Did you hit it off ?
Roy : Define ' hit it off ' .
Moss :
Did she continue talking to you after you 'd fixed her computer ?
Roy : No .
And while I was working , she rested a cup on my back .
I mean , they have no respect for us up there !
No respect whatsoever !
We 're all just drudgeons to them !
Moss : Yes !
If there were such a thing as a drudgeon , that is what we'd be to them .
Roy :
It 's like they 're pally - wally with us when there 's a problem with their printer , but once it 's fixed —
Moss :
They just toss us away like yesterday 's jam .
Roy : Yes !
Yesterday 's jam .
That is what we are to them !
Actually , that does n't work as a thing , because , you know , jam lasts for ages .
Hello IT .
Have you tried turning it off and on again ?
( Moss and Roy are discussing Jen Barber )
Moss :
Did you notice how she did n't even get excited when she saw this original ZX81 ?
Roy : Yeah , that was weird .
It 's almost as if she does n't know anything about computers .
Moss :
What ?!
( Drops mug ) Roy :
What 're you doing ?!
Moss :
Oh , do n't worry .
That 's why I always make two cups of tea .
( Picks up another mug ) Anyway , what were we talking about ?
Roy :
Her not knowing anything about computers .
Moss : WHAT ?!
( drops mug )
( Jen has calmed down and walked out a woman who was beating Roy with a shoe )
Moss : Chairman Wow !
You just defused that entire situation !
Jen :
What situation ?
( Sees Roy on the floor ) Oh , yeah that .
Wow , does that happen often ?
Moss :
They 're fairly regular , the beatings , yes .
I 'd say we 're on a bi-weekly beating .
Roy :
Oh , it 's not that bad .
Moss : Come on , it 's pretty bad .

Moss :
Roy 's stuck underneath a lady 's desk .
Jen : [ laughs ]
What , still ?
Moss : Look , I know that normally this would be very funny , but he 's been under there too long for a reasonable explanation !
If that woman looks down , she 's going to assume he 's a desk - rabbit !
Jen :
What 's a desk - rabbit ?
Moss : I just made that up !
But that 's probably what they 're gonna start to call people like Roy .
But Roy 's not a desk - rabbit , he 's my best friend , and unless you do something , it 's just going to be you , me , and Tim Burton over there !

Oh.
Okay .
[ walks out of the room ; embarrassed . ]
Jen : Okay .
Moss , what did you have for breakfast this morning ?
Moss : Smartie cereal .
Jen : Oh my God , I did n't even know Smarties made a cereal .
Moss :
They do n't .
It 's just Smarties in a bowl with milk .
Roy : I am a man , he 's a man , we 're men !

[ Jen , Roy , and Moss are looking at a poster for Gay : A Gay Musical ] Roy Trenneman : " A gay musical " , called Gay .
That 's quite gay .
" Gay musical ? "
Are n't all musicals gay ?
This must be , like , the gayest musical ever made .
Maurice Moss :
It got some pretty good reviews .

Jen Barber : [ reads from the poster ]
" A story of a young man trying to find his sexuality in the uncaring Thatcher years .
Warning : includes scenes of graphic homoeroticism . "
Moss :
Oh no !
It 's set in the 80s !
Roy : Graphic homoeroticism ?
[ turning to Moss ]
Does that mean they 're going to get them out ?
Jen :
You 're not comfortable with your sexuality ?
Roy :
Oh , I 'm very comfortable with my sexuality , I just do n't want to be slapped in the face with their sexuality .
[ Jen is standing in the lobby at the theatre .
Three people in wheelchairs come in .

Theatre Manager :
He 's had quite an evening .
Someone stole his wheelchair .
Jen : [ shocked ]
Did you see who it was ?
Roy : Red - bearded man .
Jen : Uh - huh ...
How long have you been disabled ?
Roy :
Ten years ?
Jen :
Ten years , and how did it happen ?
If that 's not a rude question .
Roy : ... Acid.
Jen :

Roy :... Stolen .
Theatre Manager : How did they get in ?
Roy : [ breaks down ]
I do n't know ...
Jerome : [ sees group of disabled men ]
What ...?
Oh , I get it .
Very funny , you Irish !
[ laughs ; mockingly ]
" Oh , I 'm a bit tired .
Can I have a wheelchair too ? "
Ha ha , HILARIOUS !
" Oh , me legs do n't work !
Help , help !
I need a wheelchair ! " [ goes over to a disable man ; tries to pull him off ]
Come on , come on , get up .
Come on , stop messing around !
That a go .
[ tips wheelchair over ; disable man falls off ]
Return of the Golden Child [ 2.2 ] [ edit ]
Denholm Reynholm :
When I started Reynholm Industries , I had just two things in my possession : a dream and six million pounds .
Today I have a business empire the like of which the world has never seen the like of which .
I hope it does n't sound arrogant when I say that I am the greatest man in the world !
Moss : Unbelievable !
Some idiot disabled his firewall , meaning all the computers on floor Seven are teeming with viruses , plus I 've just had to walk all the way down the motherfudging stairs , because the lifts are broken again !
[ Jen comes out of her office , visibly shocked . ]
Jen : [ stunned ]
Oh my God. Roy : What ?
Jen : Oh my God.
Roy :
What is it ?
Jen : Denholm 's dead !
Moss : [ suddenly remembering ]
Oh yes — and Denholm 's dead !
Derek Pippen : [ talking about Denholm 's funeral ]
You do know we 're burying a great man today !
Roy : [ shocked ]
Did someone else die ?
Jen : There 's Denholm 's wife ...
Moss : I never know what to say to people at funerals .
Roy :
Me too .
I 'm terrible .
Jen : Just say you 're sorry and move on .
[ To Denholm 's wife ]
He 'll be in our prayers .
Roy : [ to Denholm 's wife ]
I 'm sorry for your loss .
Move on .
Moss : I 'm sorry for your loss .
Mrs. Reynholm : Thank you .
Moss :
It 's not like you 've lost a pen , is it ?
It 's so much worse .
Would you like a pen ?
I have a spare one .
Mrs. Reynholm :
No thank you .
Moss : Please take it .
Mrs. Reynholm :
Why are you giving it to me ?
Moss : I do n't know .
[ hands her the pen ]
Swings and roundabouts .
Douglas :
Where is your God ?!
Where is your God now ?!
Here , lies a great man .
A great man !
FAAAAAATTHHHHEEEEEEERRRRR !!!!!
Moss and the German [ 2.3 ] [ edit ]
Narrator :
You would n't steal a handbag .
You would n't steal a car .
You would n't steal a baby .
You would n't shoot a policeman .
And then steal his helmet .
You would n't go to the toilet in his helmet .
And then send it to the policeman 's grieving widow .
And then steal it again !
Downloading films is stealing .
If you do it , you will face the consequences .
[ FBI team member bursts in behind the girl downloading the film and shoots her ; cut to a pool of blood on the keyboard ]
Roy : [ sitting with Moss in a dark room ]
Man , these anti-piracy ads are getting really mean .
Roy : Yeah , I do n't like people .
Jen :
Oh , well now that 's not fair Roy .
Have you met all of them ?
Roy : I 've met enough of them .
People .
What a bunch of bastards !
Jen : Oh , Jorg , Jorg , such fire !
I am too tired for revolution … and we 've walked four f*cking miles .
Dinner Party [ 2.4 ] [ edit ]
Jen :
If this evening is going to work in any way , you need to pretend to be normal people , yeah ?
Keep the conversation about things that would interest everybody .
You know , nothing about memory , or RAM .
Moss : Memory is RAM !
Roy : Peter , what 's your email address ?
Peter : Oh , it 's filepeter@hotmail.com .
Roy : " filepeter " ?
Why " filepeter " ?
Peter : Well , File is my second name .
Roy :
Oh , right , I see .
Peter File .
Moss :
Who 's a paedophile ?
Roy :
No no , his name is Peter File .
Moss :
His name is paedophile ?
Jen : [ angry ]
Do n't say it like that .
It sounds like " paedophile . "
Moss :
Is n't that what he just said ?
Jen ' : No , Peter File .
Moss : [ enunciating ]
Paedo phile ?
Jen : Peter File !
Richmond : Who 's a paedophile ?
Jen :
No one is .
Moss : [ finally understanding ]
Right .
It just sounds like paedophile .
Jen :
No , no , it does n't !
Moss : Does a bit .
Peter File .
Roy : Peter File ...
Yeah , no , it does .
[ There are murmurings of agreement from the rest of the table as everyone starts pronouncing it themselves ]
Peter : [ exasperated ]
YES , I SUPPOSE IT DOES ! [ silence ]
Jen : I did n't noticed , so ...
Peter :
It does n't bother you , does it ?
Jen :
No , of course it does n't .
[ leans in for a kiss ]
Moss :
They say " pedophile " in America .
Maybe you should move to America .
Jen : [ shouting ]
He 's not moving to America !
Smoke and Mirrors [ 2.5 ] [ edit ]
John : I do n't think that 's true .
Jen :
With all due respect John , I am the head of IT and I have it on good authority that if you type " Google " into Google , you can break the Internet .
So please , no one try it , even for a joke .
[ the executives laugh ]
It 's not a laughing matter .
You can break the Internet .
Roy :
Is this another one of your inventions ?
Moss : Might be .
Roy :
What was the last one ?
Oh yes .
A ladder , to help moths escape from the bath .
How is that useful ?!
Moss :
How is that not useful ?
Roy :
Moths do n't get stuck in baths !
Moss : Yes .
They .
Do !
Roy :
Even if that were true , it 's just not in their nature to learn how to use a ladder !
They have wings !
When a moth thinks about travelling vertically upwards , a ladder is just the last thing they would think of !
Moss , I do n't like to be negative about it , but everything you invent is worthless !
Moss : Ah !
Well , prepare to put mustard on those words , for you will soon be consuming them along with this slice of humble pie that comes direct from the oven of shame , set at gas mark " egg on your face " ! [ pause ]
I sort of forget what I was talking about .
Men Without Women [ 2.6 ] [ edit ]
Douglas Reynholm : I like you , Jen .
You do n't ask questions .
A lot of people would be confused as to why I invited them up here then asked them to leave , not you .
A person 's got to have a lot of backbone to allow herself to be ordered around like that .
You 've got spunk and balls , and I like that in a woman .
Douglas :
Oh , not these idiots !
Jen : Mr Reynholm , the men in the IT department are my friends , they 're not idiots .
[ Moss and Roy walk in without their trousers ]

From Hell [ 3.1 ] [ edit ]
Douglas Reynholm : I can't seem to get it open .
Roy Trenneman :
You want me to open it .
That 's why you called me all the way up here , to open your laptop ?
Douglas : I would be beholden to you .
Maurice Moss :
Well , if someone called me a " big , ugly builder " , I 'd be furious - and not just because I 'm actually an IT consultant .
Revenge , that would be uppermost on my mind : " I 'm going to wee on everything .
I 'm going to taint her abode .
I 'm going to strain my personal potatoes throughout her premises . "
Roy : [ Acting as Moss 's teenage bullies ]
Nice glasses !
Moss :
Not as nice as your momma's glasses !
Moss : [ Chasing teenage bullies around the park , with Douglas ' grandfather 's revolver ] I got a gun !
I got a ruddy gun !
I got a ruddy gun !
I got a flipping gun !
I got a motherflipping gun !
I got a mother flipping gun ! [ spins the gun in his hands as he goes back to the bench , sits down and places the gun next to him ]
Are We Not Men ? [ 3.2 ] [ edit ]
[ Repeated conversation ]
Moss : Did you see that ludicrous display last night ?
Postman : What was Wenger thinking sending Walcott on that early ?
Moss :
The thing about Arsenal is , they always try and walk it in !
Postman : Yeah it is true .
See you later , Moss Moss : Mind 'ow you go .
Moss :
Just promise me we wo n't do anything else with them .
I want to go back to being weird .
I like being weird .
Weird is all I 've got .
That and my sweet style .
Tramps Like Us [ 3.3 ] [ edit ]
June :
What does IT stand for ?
Jen Barber :
What does it stand for ?
What does n't it stand for ?
June :
Yes , yes , but what does it stand for ?
Jen :
It stands for , it stands for commitment .
It stands for audacity .
It stands for courage in the face of - June : Yes , yes I can see what you 're getting at , but the specific letters " IT " , what do they stand for ?
Jen :
What do you think they stand for ?
June :
No , no , perhaps I 'm not making myself clear .
I 'm not looking for an interpretation , I really do n't know what the letters actually stand for .
So , let 's start with the I .
What does the I stand for ?
Jen : I ... need ... to ... [ nervously laughs ] wee wee .
Douglas : [ being shocked by his anti-harrassment device ]
But I 'm not aroused , it 's only cars !
God damn these electric sex pants !
Douglas :
You there , computer man .
Fix my pants !
Moss :
Beg your pardon ?
Douglas :
Pull down my trousers and do your job !
[ Moss , highly concussed , is amusing himself with an anglepoise lamp .
Phone rings ]
Moss : Hello , Roy speaking .
Jen : [ on phone ]
What ?
Moss ?
You 're still concussed , you need to see the doctor .
Moss :
Who is this ?
Roy ?
Wait , it could n't be Roy , I'm Roy .
Jen : Look , what does IT mean ?
Moss :
What ?
Jen : IT , what does I.T. mean ?
Someone 's just asked me .
Moss :
You do n't know what it means ?
Jen :
No , I never thought to ask .
Moss :
This must be Jen ! Jen : Yes — Moss : Hello Jen !
Jen : Hello !
Moss :
How may I help you ?
Jen :
Tell me , tell me what IT means .
Moss : Absolutely . [ pause ]
Jen : Well ?
Moss :
Very well , thank you .
How are you ?
Jen : Moss , please just stay with me , just for this simple question okay ?
What —
Moss : Jen , I 'm just going to put you on speakerphone , all right ?
Jen :
No no no , do n't hang up —
Moss : [ hangs up ]
Jen , you are now on speakerphone .
[ pause ] Jen ? Hello Jen ? [ phone rings ]
Jen , can you bear with me one moment ?
I 've got someone trying to get through in the other line .
[ picks up ]
Roy speaking .
Jen :
You just hung up on me .
Moss : Jen , can you hold on one second ?
I 've got Jen on the other line .
Jen : No! Don't —
Moss : [ switches lines ]
Jen , can I call you back ?
I 've just got Jen trying to get through on the other line .
[ switches lines ]
Jen , sorry about that .
Phew !
Chicken in a basket , it has been all ruddy go today !
Now how may I help you ?
Jen :
What does IT mean ?!
You know , computers ?
Something to do with computers probably ?
Moss : Computers ?
That 's not really my area .
Jen , I 'd love to help you but , it 's a real pain , I seem to have forgotten absolutely everything I know about computers .
Jen :
How can you forget everything you know about computers , Moss ?
Moss :
Let me see , maybe it is n't everything .
[ thinks ]
No , it 's definitely everything .
The Speech [ 3.4 ] [ edit ]
[ Jen looks at a small black box , which has a small red LED light on the top .
Moss stands next to her . ]
Jen :
What is it ?
Moss :
This , Jen , is the Internet .
Jen : What ?
Moss :
That 's right .
Jen :
This is the Internet ?
[ Moss nods . ]
The whole Internet ?
Moss : Yep .
I asked for a loan of it , so that you could use it in your speech .
Jen :
It 's so small !
Moss :
That 's one of the surprising things about it .
Jen :
Hang on , it does n't have any wires or anything ...
Moss : [ rolling his eyes ]
It 's wireless !
Jen :
Oh , yes , everything 's wireless these days , is n't it ?
So I can really use it in my speech ?
What if someone needs it ?
Moss :
Oh no , people will still be able to go online and everything ; it 'll still work .
Jen :
Oh , good .
Moss : I tell you : you present this to the shareholders , and you 'll get quite the response .
Jen : Can I touch it ?
[ Moss nods ; Jen picks the box up ]
Ooh , it 's so light .
Moss :
Of course it is , Jen !
The internet does n't weigh anything !
Jen : [ laughing ]
No , no , of course it does n't !
[ Roy enters the room ] Roy : [ agitated ]
Hey !
What is Jen doing with the Internet ?
Jen : Moss said I could use it for my speech .
Roy :
Are you insane ?
What if she drops it ?
Jen : I wo n't drop it , I 'll look after it !
Roy : No .
No , no , no , no , Jen .
[ He takes the box from Jen ]
No , this needs to go straight back to Big Ben .
Jen : Big Ben ?
Moss : Yep .
It goes on top of Big Ben .
That 's where you get the best reception .
Jen : I promise I wo n't let anything happen to it .
Roy : No , Jen , I 'm sorry .
[ Jen becomes woeful ]
The Elders of the Internet would never stand for it .
Moss :
Oh no , I spoke to the Elders of the Internet not one hour ago .
I told them about Jen winning Employee of the Month , and they were so impressed , that they wanted to do whatever they could to help .
Jen : [ suspiciously ]
Wait a minute , the " Elders of the Internet " !? [ shocked ]
The Elders of the Internet know who I am !?
You 've got to let me have it !
Roy :
No , Jen , I 'm sorry , it 's just too risky !
Jen :
Oh , please , Roy !
Roy : [ resignedly ]
Well , Moss , has it been completely demagnetised ?
Moss : By Stephen Hawking himself .
[ to Jen ]
He sends his congratulations , by the way .
Roy :
Well , if it 's okay with the Hawk ...
Jen :
So , can I have it ?
Roy :
You can .
[ Roy and Moss dramatically give the box to Jen , reminding her to pick her speech up and carry the box carefully .
As soon as she leaves the room , Roy and Moss dance happily ]
Douglas : April , these past few days have been like a dream .
Usually , I can't wait to get away from a woman once I 've ejaculated , but with you ...
I do n't know , I feel alive .
April , I love you .
April : What ?
Douglas :
That 's right , I totally love the bloody arse off you .
April : Oh , Douglas !
I love you too !
Douglas : Oh , poppet ... to think when we met , you were so worried that you came from Iran .
April : ... what ?
Douglas :
When we met , as if I 'd be worried about something like that !
I do n't care where you 're from ; Iran , France , does n't bother me .
I 'm very modern April : I 'm not from Iran !
Douglas :
Well , you said something along those lines .
April :
No , not Iran , a man !
I said I used to be a man !
Douglas :
You used to be a man ...?
April : Yes !
[ Douglas grips April very tightly ]
Douglas : OH GOD ...
[ During Jen 's speech ]
Shareholder :
Is it heavy ?
[ indicates the box ] Jen : [ laughs ]
That 's a bit of a silly question .
The Internet does n't weigh anything !
Indistinguishable shareholder : Fucking idiot !
Friendface [ 3.5 ] [ edit ]
Moss :
My mum's on Friendface !
My mum !
I 've opened up another line of communication with her !
Roy :
Is n't that a good thing ?
Moss :
She 's listed her " current mood " as " sensual " !
Roy :
Why did n't you just not accept her friend request ?
Moss :
What are you , an animal ?
Roy :
Oh no , it 's all coming back to me now .
She used to slap [ make - up ] on with a trowel .
Jen : [ applying more lipstick ]
Why do n't women have the confidence to know that less is more ?
Roy :
Then , when she started crying , it all ran down her face .
It was like breaking up with the Joker .
Calendar Geeks [ 3.6 ] [ edit ]
Jen :
Why are you doing this ?
Roy :
Same reason I do everything , Jen : to have sex with a lady .

Jen the Fredo [ 4.1 ] [ edit ]
[ Moss talking about Mysterious Music ] Maurice Moss : Does this sound mysterious ?
Jen Barber : Yeah , yeah it 's quite mysterious .
Moss : I was hoping for " ruddy mysterious " .
Jen : Mr Reynholm , I do n't need to remind you of the report that denounced Reynholm Industries as an institutionally sexist organisation .
Douglas Reynholm : Now , you hold on a minute , sugar - tits !
Jen : [ regarding a female character in a Dungeons and Dragons game ]
Look at those fun bags !
The Final Countdown [ 4.2 ] [ edit ]
[ Moss bursts into the office ]
Moss : I did it !
I did it !
I 've been accepted !
Roy Trenneman : [ in disbelief ]
No !
Jen :
What 's going on ?
Moss : I 've been accepted !
I applied , and they said yes !
Jen :
Who said yes ?
What are you talking about ?
Moss ...
Moss , you 're shaking !
[ Smash cut to the set of Countdown , with Moss sitting behind a desk ]
Moss : Consonant , please .
Moss :
It actually already is a word , Tnetennba .
Jeff Stelling : Good Heavens really ?
Could you , erm , use it in a sentence for us ?
Moss : Good morning , that 's a nice Tnetennba .
Moss : I came here to drink milk and kick ass .
And I 've just finished my milk .
[ The 8 + Club are playing Street Countdown ] Harold Tong , aka " Prime " : Eighteen letters , I 've never seen so many ... he is the One. Roy : [ incredulously ]
What are you ...
Prime : Shh !
This is the longest word yet on Street Countdown !
Unlike normal Countdown , you see — Roy : I do n't care .
[ The 8 + Club finish an acapella version of the Countdown music ]
Prime : Negative One ?
Negative One : Twelve .
Moss : Sixteen .
Prime : Your word , Negative One. Negative One : Enormousness .
Moss : I shall give my answer , if I may , in the form of a joke .
Prime :
This is most irregular ...
Moss :
What do you call Negative
One sitting alone in an empty room ?
Prime : I do n't know , what do you call Negative One sitting alone in an empty room ?
Moss : Overnumerousness !
Prime : Gyles ?
[ Pan to Gyles Brandreth in a makeshift Dictionary Corner ]
Gyles :
Yes , that is a word !
And the joke does make sense !
Something Happened [ 4.3 ] [ edit ]
[ Douglas is presenting an advert for " Spaceology " ]
Douglas : Space : what is it ?
The simple answer is , we do n't know .
Or at least we did n't know until now .
Hello , I 'm Douglas Reynholm , and I 'm not a scientist , but I do have a better understanding of what space is than any scientist living today .
Where did I gain these insights ?
From this man , the founder of Spaceology .
Beth Gaga Shaggy — no relation to Lady Gaga or Shaggy — is the founder of Spaceology , a religion , not a cult .
In other words , when it comes to space , he 's the man with his head screwed on tight .
This is what he told me when I met him on holiday two weeks ago .
Beth Gaga Shaggy : Space is invisible mind dust , and stars are but wishes .
Douglas : I mean , think about that !
That means every star you can see in the night sky is a wish that has come true .
And they 've come true because of something he calls Spacestar Ordering .
Spacestar Ordering is based on the twin scientific principles of star maths and wishy thinking .
If you 'd like to know more , there are thousands of Spaceology centres all over the UK .
If that does n't convince you , well , then , maybe you just do n't deserve to get what you want .
[ Camera changes to Roy and Douglas watching the advert on Roy 's computer ]
Douglas : Wow .
You 're a genius , Ray !
Love the special effects !
How did you do that thing where I 'm spinning around ?
Roy :
Well , in that bit , you 're actually spinning around .
[ Roy and Jen are at a Sweet Billy Pilgrim gig ]
Roy : I 'm going to go dance at the front .
Jen :
Are n't you a bit old for the front ?
Roy : I 'm 32 !
Teenager : Good for you , mate !
Italian for Beginners [ 4.4 ] [ edit ]
Jen : [ greeting the Italian guests ] Viennetta ... Fiat Punto .
Roy :
There was a fire ... at a Sea Parks ?
Moss : [ trapped inside of claw crane toy vending machine ]
These toys may smell of wee , come the morn .
Bad Boys [ 4.5 ] [ edit ]
[ Moss and Roy are walking down the street ]
Moss :
Oh my gosh !
[ Moss runs forward and kneels down ]
Moss :
It 's a robot !
[ Camera zooms out to show a bomb disposal robot ]
Moss : I 've never seen one in the wild before .
Where did you come from , fella , huh ?
Where 'd ya come from ?
Can we keep him , Roy ?
Only if he does n't belong to anyone .
[ Jen is asking Roy for help with her laptop ]
Jen : Someone told me I need a browser on my computer .
Could you install one , please ?
Roy :
You do n't have a browser on your comput - [ notices a chiming noise ]
What is - what is that sound ?
Is that coming from your laptop ?
It 's not supposed to sound like ... [ goes round and sees that Jen 's laptop is infested with malware ]
What the- what 's all that crap !? [ points to one ]
How long has that been - I have n't seen that one since the nineties !
[ goes to pick it up ]
Oh , Jen , I have to fix this .
Jen : [ grabbing it back ]
No , no , leave it .
I have it how I like it .
Roy : " How you like it ! ? "
No no no , Jen , it 's infected .
If this was a human being , I 'd shoot it in the face .
[ The computer controlling the bomb - disposal robot has crashed ]
Moss :
What kind of operating system does it use ?
Police : Err ... it's ...
Vista !
Moss :
We 're going to die !
Roy : [ quickly ]
Have you tried turning it off and on again ?
Police : What ?
Roy : [ quickly ]
Have you tried turning it off and on again ?
Police : ... what ?
Roy : [ agitated ]
HAVE YOU TRIED ... TURNING IT OFF , AND ON AGAIN ?!
Jen : [ shrieks , then turns to the Police ] I just won 100 quid .
Roy : Balloons explode , Jen .
They explode suddenly , and unexpectedly .
They are filled with the capacity to give me a little fright , and I find that unbearable .
Reynholm v Reynholm [ 4.6 ] [ edit ]
Moss :
When I was eleven I broke the patio window and my mother sued me ...
She 's always been a very aggressive litigator .
Douglas :
Two hundred and twelve million quid ?
You can't be serious !
Solicitor : Oh , we 're quite serious , Mr Reynholm .
Douglas :
But that 's enough to bring Reynholm Industries to its knees !
Bloody blast , this is up my arse !
Solicitor :
That is the amount , it is not up for negotiation .
Douglas : Balls from hell , you shit - twins !
Solicitor : Calm down , Mr. Reynholm .
Douglas : Bollocks to be telling me to calm down , my old chap .
She wants 220 titty million quid and you tell me to calm down !
You 're fired .
Judge : Mr Reynholm , are you ready to start your cross-examination of Mrs. Reynholm ?
Douglas : I am , your honour , but rest assured , it will a normal examination .
I am not in any way cross .
[ To Victoria Reynholm ]
You are Victoria Reynholm , are you not ?
Judge : Mr. Reynholm , we have already established that .
Might I suggest that you try less to do an impression of a lawyer you once saw on television and make your case as simply as you possibly can .
Douglas :
Wise words , my learned lud .
Douglas :
Your name is Maurice Moss , is it not ?
Moss : [ Mumbles , nods frenetically ]
Douglas : [ In same tone as before ]
Your name is Maurice Moss , is it not ?
Moss : [ Nervously lifts a glass of water ]
Bit nervous , so , yeah , bit of water .
[ drinks the water , and spits it into his hand ]
Fizzy , it 's very fizzy , it 's fizzy , it 's gone fizzy .
[ grabs the microphone and gets a shock ]
Yow !
Come on !
That 's electric , there 's electric in there , got a shock .
Douglas : [ In same tone as before ]
Your name is Maurice Moss , is it not ?
Moss :
It is not .
Sorry , yeah , sorry , um , my mother sued me .
Judge : Just relax , take your time and answer the questions as clearly as you can .
Moss :
Thank you , my love .
Douglas : [ In same tone as before ]
Your name is Maurice Moss , is it not ?
Moss : [ His chair collapses ]
The chair 's faulty .
[ lifts the chair back up , but falls off it as he sits down ]
Douglas :
No further questions , my lord .

The Internet is Coming [ 2013.1 ] [ edit ]
Moss : [ Jen enters room ]
Oh Jen , exciting news !
I 've just uploaded the second episode of my board games review show !
Care to have a look .
Jen : [ Looking displeased ]
That was fast .
Seems like only yesterday , we had to sit through the last one .
Moss : [ Incredulously ]
It was three months ago !
Moss : I thought you were going to give me a book recommendation or something .
Douglas [ laughs ]
Book recommendation ?
I can't read !
Roy : [ points at coffee ]
Look at that shit !
Look at it !
I can't - how am I supposed to drink - it looks like he milked a cow over it !
Roy : [ Angrily ]
That fella should n't be allowed to be a barista !
Jen :
Why not ?
Roy : Because he 's too small Jen .
He 's clearly too small to be a barista !
Jen : [ Looks at Roy and shakes her head ]
Roy : What ?
Jen :
You 're being a bit of a small - person - racist Roy .
Roy : [ Shakes head ]
A small - person - racist ?
That 's not a thing .
Douglas :
What 's your beef with the homeless ?
Jen : I do n't have any homeless beef .
Douglas :
Ah , so it 's women you hate !
Well , that I can understand .
Roy :
Wait , you record our emails and tape our phone calls ?
Douglas : Alright , dry your eyes Bono .
If you 've got nothing to hide , you 've got nothing to fear .
Jen : I would never throw coffee over a homeless woman .
Roy :
And I would never abuse a small person .
Certainly not enough to make a van with tits hit him .
[ beat ]
Although , I suppose I sort of did .
Jen : I sort of did my one too .
Roy :
It 's frustrating that we did both of our things .
Douglas : Alright , I was young once .
But if this got out it could deeply damage Reynholm Industries ability to make that product that we make .
Douglas :
What the hell were you thinking ?
I told you to keep a low profile and you do it again !
Jen :
No , no , no , no , no , it 's new footage , Mr Reynholm .
Douglas :
Bum your excuses !
Reynholm Industries has a reputation to uphold .
We 're not News International , for Christ 's sake !
Roy : [ On going to a funeral ]
I 'm gonna have to look convincingly sad for the majority of the day .
She 's not going to expect me to cry , is she ?
Moss : No. Roy :
What if she does ?
I can't cry on cue !
What do I do then ?!
Moss :
Do what I do when I need to cry : use a mild pepper - spray solution .
Roy :
Now that make sense !
See , that makes more sense than having to feel something ! [... ]'
Roy : [ Holds bottle of tear liquid suspiciously ]
What 's in here ?
Moss : [ Shrugs ] Just Tabasco , wasabi , and a bit of tear gas .
Roy :
Those sound like bad things to put in your eyes .
Moss :
It 's extremely mild .
It 's mainly water .
Roy : [ Nods and puts it in his jacket ]
Okay I 'll take it , as a last resort .
Moss : [ Shrugs ]

Computational thinking is a fundamental skill for everyone , not just for computer scientists .
To reading , writing , and arithmetic , we should add computational thinking to every childâ€™s analytical ability .
Just as the printing press facilitated the spread of the three Rs , what is appropriately incestuous about this vision is that computing and computers facilitate the spread of computational thinking .
Computational thinking involves solving problems , designing systems , and understanding human behavior , by drawing on the concepts fundamental to computer science .
Computational thinking includes a range of mental tools that reflect the breadth of the field of computer science .
from Jeannette M. Wing 's Computational Thinking Manifesto
The Center for Computation Thinking at CMU has more information about the subject .
We talked briefly about Computational Thinking back in 2006 .
Recently I listened to Jon Udell 's interview with Jeannette Wing and realized that it 's time to bring this subject up again for discussion .
An Edwards delegate moves
I suspect there will be more of these , but the AP reports on the first Edwards delegate to come out for Obama .
DemConWatch is keeping close track , and has the expected hints from more .
" It would be like committing suicide .
As soon as I step out of the Green Zone I would be walking around Baghdad with the word ' target ' across my forehead . "
This is the fate awaiting Zyad al - Saadon , an Iraqi who has lived in Britain for 35 years .
He faces deportation under the government programme for forced removal of failed asylum - seekers and foreign convicts .
He has been offered £ 500 from the British embassy in Baghdad if he goes voluntarily but nothing if his removal is enforced .
" They must be bloody mad if they think after all this time in Britain , a country I consider home , I 'm going to voluntarily walk out of here [ Dover immigration removal centre ] and on to a plane to Baghdad .
I 'd be dead in days . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Mr Saadon , 54 , is one of dozens of Iraqis facing removal to Iraq , despite making claims to residency or asylum in the United Kingdom .
The Government argues that under the strict terms of immigration law there is no " internal armed conflict " in Iraq and encourages those in detention to voluntary return to Baghdad and Basra .
Home Office officials claim that Mr Saadon , who says he has been granted indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom , cannot prove that he has lived in Britain since the 1970s .
But The Independent has obtained a copy of his marriage certificate , which shows he married Doreen Gardiner , the daughter of a Kent refuse collector , in Folkestone on 3 January 1976 .
Mr Saadon , the father of two adult children living in Britain , claims to be the victim of a harsh removal programme that aims to increase deportations at any cost in order to meet asylum removal targets .
Foreign nationals with convictions are seen as easy targets for removal as their cases rarely attract public concern .
While the Government works out how to forcibly return Iraqis back to central and southern parts of the country , many are being held in detention long after their prison sentences have expired .
In some cases this can mean more than two years ' additional detention .
Mr Saadon says he came to Britain in 1973 when his father sent him to a Kent college to study engineering .
Three years later he began a civil engineering degree at Swansea University .
But soon after moving to Folkestone in Kent , where he worked as a manager at an amusement arcade , his marriage collapsed .
" I began to struggle to keep my life together and started taking drugs , mostly heroin .
I fell in with bad people and committed crime to feed my habit .
I was down and out and for a long time I begged all over Kent . "
On 8 April 2004 he was convicted at Maidstone Crown Court for selling crack cocaine to an undercover police officer and was sentenced to five years ' imprisonment , which he completed in July last year .
It was then that Mr Saadon learnt that the Home Office had ordered his deportation to Iraq .
" It is unbelievable .
I told them that I came here at the beginning of the 1970s and have raised a family but the Home Office do n't believe me .
They have told me I must go back to Iraq where I have no family and where I do n't know anyone .
I'm British now and I'm a British problem , not an Iraqi one . "
The chief executive of the UK Border Agency , Lin Homer , said : " Those who come to the UK and break our rules , and are judged to be a threat to the public , will not be tolerated .
Foreign nationals must obey the laws of this country in the same way as everybody else .
Those who have committed criminal offences here are subject to the same legal processes as anyone else in the UK .
" Anyone breaking the law , irrespective of whether they are a British citizen or a foreign national , can expect prosecution and , where appropriate , a custodial sentence .
We have also made it perfectly clear that we will seek to deport foreign nationals who have committed a serious crime in the UK .
The UK Border Agency only enforces the return of individuals where we and the independent courts are satisfied they are not in need of international protection . "
Mr Saadon has spent nearly a year in detention at Dover immigration removal centre where he is awaiting deportation to Baghdad .
Staff say he is now clean from drugs and he has become a trusted detainee who works as an interpreter .
For Mr Saadon , the offer of a voluntary return to Iraq is not one he finds attractive : " All I want to do to find my children , who I have lost contact with , and live the remainder of my life in peace .
If they send me to Baghdad they might as well give me the bullet now and I 'll save them the trouble . "
Constitutional expert : FISA bill ' is an evisceration of the Fourth Amendment ' Nick Langewis and David Edwards
Published : Thursday June 19 , 2008

Print This Email This " Never appease political bullies , President Bush admonished at the Israeli Knesset , " MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann opened .
" Oddly , House Democrats chose to ignore him on the subject of dealing with him . "
Constitutional expert Jonathan
Turley sees a " very frightening bill " in a proposed " compromise , " currently in the House , that would update the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act to effectively grant immunity from civil lawsuits to telecommunications companies that agreed to spy on their customers as part of the National Security Agency 's warrantless wiretapping program , starting shortly before the World Trade Center attacks in 2001 .
If the White House asked a phone company to spy with its assurance that it was legal , the measure says , that 's enough to dismiss a case .
Congressional Democrats , Turley went on , knew about surveillance and torture programs , but were politically unable to oppose them at the same time they were touting themselves to the public as defenders of civil liberties .
The bill , he said , is part of a campaign of collusion between Congress and the Bush administration , immunizing not only the telecommunications companies , but the administration and any members of Congress , on either side of the aisle , that may have been involved .
" The proposed FISA deal is not a compromise ; it is a capitulation , " Senator Russ Feingold said today .
" The House and Senate should not be taking up this bill , which effectively guarantees immunity for telecom companies alleged to have participated in the Presidents illegal program , and which fails to protect the privacy of law - abiding Americans at home .
Allowing courts to review the question of immunity is meaningless when the same legislation essentially requires the court to grant immunity .
And under this bill , the government can still sweep up and keep the international communications of innocent Americans in the U.S. with no connection to suspected terrorists , with very few safeguards to protect against abuse of this power .
Instead of cutting bad deals on both FISA and funding for the war in Iraq , Democrats should be standing up to the flawed and dangerous policies of this administration . "
" The Democrats never really were engaged in this , " said Turley .
" In fact , they repeatedly tried to cave in to the White House , only to be stopped by civil libertarians and bloggers . "
" I think they 're simply waiting to see if the public 's interest will wane , " he went on , referring to repeated attempts to float said legislation past the public .
" This bill has quite literally no public value for citizens or civil liberties .
It is reverse engineering , though the type of thing the Bush Administration 's famous for , and now the Democrats are doing -- that is , to change the law to conform to past conduct . "
" It 's what any criminal would love to do , " Turley continued .
" You rob a bank , go to the legislature , and change the law to say that robbing banks is lawful . "
" People need to be very , very much aware of this bill , " he charged .
" What you 're seeing in this bill is an evisceration of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution .
It is something that allows the President and the government to go into law - abiding homes , on their word alone -- their suspicion alone -- and to engage in warrantless surveillance .
" That 's what the framers who drafted the Fourth Amendment wanted to prevent . "
The House could vote on the bill as soon as Friday .
A full copy of the bill , in PDF format , is available at this link .

Customers think that they had 100 % uptime guarantee when he signs for services .
Worst of all nightmare message sent to webmaster : “ Site is down !
Why ?
When will it be again up ?
What kind of business is running ? ”
But it 's too late , a user has to realize that he should always go through details of guarantees and services of a web host before signup .
Research
A user is looking at a platform for his website either business or personal .
How quickly would user decide to hire building to move his business ?
What should a user do any different in cyberspace - on the Net ?
Check up - time guarantees in detail .
Best will offer around 99.5 % uptime guarantee .
Earned credits can be applied automatically to users account if a server is not up 99.5 % of any month given .
Web host with high standards calculates downtime and reports every minute of downtime to all its clients .
Results are also posted on their web page for anyone to check .
To get any credits for other web hosts , a detailed report has to be submitted concerning downtime of a website in writing and host must verify this document .
Host monitoring cost of its servers ensures a website is up as much providing a guarantee that may cost more than refund is worth .
Other Example : User can see certain web host providing 99.999 % uptime guarantee .
A user has to sign a “ guaranteed contract ” to qualify for guarantee with them .
It means a user must choose pay for among most expensive packages .
If anybody buys extra features from them then this will help website stay up more than if he did n't buy these features .
Redundancy
At redundant risk , always keep in mind that it does n't matter how sophisticated and advanced equipment , how much techno savvy the engineers , technology , being technology , fail from time to time .
Web host with diesel generators backup , multiple routers and switches , secondary servers and UPS systems is able in providing high - speed access , consistent and can guarantee at least 99 % uptime .
Most web hosting companies have high - speed lines connected to more than one Internet “ backbone ” provider .
This is important to reliable website uptime since technical glitches interrupt network service .
A web host is allowed by redundant network design to traffic away from Internet “ hotspots ” directly and fastest routes are available at that time .
If one network service is interrupted then site remains up .
Reliability
Best web hosting providers are offering high uptime guarantees because investment is in best automatic monitoring equipment , hired professional and experienced engineers who can evaluate potential problems and emergencies redundant backup systems are installed to automatically take over situation produces wrong .
If a web host offering guarantees 95 % uptime , it means translates into 8.4 hours of downtime per week .
If there is not anything to lose when a website is down , then speed and efficiency bring the website back up may leave desirable deal .
An uptime guarantee means a little refund for a user , but if the web host is refunding $ 5 to every client on their server means real losses for them .
Before signing up with next host get a guarantee .
If any user is unclear about details , email then call and ask the host about it .
Uptime
“ Uptime ” is a server monitoring system provided service to the entire internet .
Bunch of websites is monitored by this program for a bunch of people .
An email message is sent to monitor 's owner during unreachable of a website .
A page is requested by uptime from a server .
A website will be checked by Uptime continuously .
If anybody wants to be beeped by Uptime , then beeper service is described by a user has an email gateway .
User server gets queries by Uptime in every 15 minutes .
Runtime Errors
What “ runtime errors ” have to do with downtime , uptime or anything ?
A runtime error is a type of error occurs during program execution .
Compile - time errors occur during compilation of a program .
In program , runtime errors indicate bugs or problems that have anticipated by designers but cannot do anything .
Runtime error caused by running out of memory is one of the examples .
INDIANAPOLIS – Hillary Clinton won Pennsylvania by feeling the pain of blue - collar voters .
Now she 's trying for a repeat here in Indiana , playing on voter frustration over high gas prices .
Mrs. Clinton addressed factory workers earlier this week at this city 's Miller Veneers plant , which produces hardwood veneers .
She railed against high pump prices and the " record " profits of oil companies , then introduced her five - point plan , which consists of equal parts fulminating at Big Oil and OPEC and waiving the federal gas ...
“ The public financing of presidential elections as it exists today is broken , and we face opponents who ’ve become masters at gaming this broken system , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ John McCain ’s campaign and the Republican National Committee are fueled by contributions from Washington lobbyists and special interest PACs .
And we ’ve already seen that he ’s not going to stop the smears and attacks from his allies running so - called 527 groups , who will spend millions and millions of dollars in unlimited donations . ”
Mr. Obama had pledged to meet with Mr. McCain following the primaries to attempt to work out an agreement on financing the campaigns .
That meeting never took place , aides to Mr. Obama said , because a meeting between lawyers for the two sides was not fruitful .
“ It became clear to me that there was n’t any basis for future discussion , ” said Robert Bauer , the general counsel for Mr. Obama ’s campaign .
Mr. McCain seized on Mr. Obama ’s decision to question his trustworthiness .
“ Senator Obama ’s reversal on public financing is one of a number of reversals that he has taken , ” Mr. McCain said in Columbus Junction , Iowa , where he had been touring the floods .
“ I ’m especially disturbed by this decision of Senator Obama ’s because he signed his name on a piece of paper , signed his name . ”
“ This election is about a lot of things but it ’s also about trust , ” he said .
“ It ’s also about whether you can take people ’s word . ”
Charlie Black , a senior adviser to Mr. McCain , charged that Mr. Obama had “ broken his word . ”
In fact , Mr. Obama stopped short of making a flat promise to participate in the public financing system .
Asked in a questionnaire whether he would take part if his opponents did the same , Mr. Obama wrote yes .
But he added , “ If I am the Democratic nominee , I will aggressively pursue an agreement with the Republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election . ”
Africa Backing Hydropower
June 5th , 2008 by Joshua S Hill
The quest for cleaner energy generation is one that is going to be a main focus for the next several decades .
Without a doubt , humanity has finally realized that our insane overdependence on oil and other fossil fuels is , if nothing else , simply not healthy .
It will eventually run out , and we ’ve decided to , finally , look for alternate sources .
But turn our eyes away from the mainstream and western face of this planet , and we see that Africa is already on the renewable energy bandwagon .
According to a report at Bloomberg.com , Uganda has just announced that they will start building the 200 - megawatt Karuma hydropower plant sometime in the first quarter of 2009 .
President Yoweri Museveni said that this is a chance to tackle the national electricity shortage .
Museveni told parliament on Thursday that the government had already allocated $ 200 million for the project , of a predicted $ 500 million total cost .
Ugand is in talks with Norway ’s Norpak Power Ltd. over developing the plant .
But even without the involvement of Norpak , Uganda is intent on going through with this project .
“ We are working with the Norwegians , but in case they delay we shall continue alone , ” Museveni said .
But Karuma is not the only hydropower plant in Uganda , and was in fact delayed in favor of the construction of the 250 - megawatt Bujagali power project .
Currently , Uganda has a demand of 380 - megawatts , but provides a total of 245 - megawatts via hydro and thermal power .

GISS Surface Temperature Analysis ( v4 )
Analysis Graphs and Plots
This page is updated each month by an automatic procedure .
Additional figures based on the GISTEMP analysis which require manual effort to create are available from Columbia University web pages maintained by Dr. Makiko Sato ; see Dr. Sato 's Temperature site .
Instructions :
Click on the section titles below to hide or expose the respective graphs .
At the bottom left corner of every graph are 3 icons to “ reset ” , “ move ” , and “ zoom ” the image .
Hovering over a data point will display the year and data value .
The annual mean graphs are paired with a lowess smooth , i.e. a non-parametric regression analysis that relies on a k - nearest - neighbor model .
In order to evaluate the function , we use a fraction of data corresponding to a ten year window of data , giving an effective smoothing of approximately five years .
For the option to select the strength of the smoothing as well as the base period and for seeing additional graphs please go to the Custom Plotter site .

A new study argues that the nation ’s focus on helping students who are furthest behind may have produced a Robin Hood effect , yielding steady academic gains for low - achieving students in recent years at the expense of top students .
The study , to be released on Wednesday , compared trends in scores on federal tests for the bottom 10 percent of students nationwide with those for the top 10 percent and said those at the bottom moved up faster than those at the top .
In tests of fourth - grade reading from 2000 to 2007 , for instance , the scores of the lowest - achieving students increased by 16 points on a 280 - point scale , compared with a gain of three points for top - achieving students , according to the study , by the Thomas B. Fordham Institute , a research organization in Washington .
The period of big gains for low achievers and minimal ones for high achievers coincides with the federal education law known as No Child Left Behind , which took effect in 2002 .
The study said that while it was impossible to know whether the law caused those scoring patterns , such a result would hardly be surprising , since the law made it a goal to reduce the gap separating low - scoring , poor and minority students from higher - scoring white students .
It 's official : Surfing the web while at work is enough to get you fired , at least in New York .
A Manhattan court ruled this month to uphold a decision by New York City 's schools chancellor , Joel Klein , to fire an employee in 2006 for excessive web browsing .
The employee , Toquir Choudhri , was an associate education analyst employed by the Department of Education 's Division of Human Resources .
After he had been warned about too much web surfing , an internal audit caught Mr. Choudhri visiting over 300 Web sites in six days , with court papers citing examples such as lonelyplanet.com , chinaadviser.com , escapeartist.com , and islandsun.com .
An administrative court had previously recommended a mere reprimand of Mr. Choudhri in 2006 , citing the fact that " the Internet has become the modern equivalent of a telephone or a daily newspaper . "
Mr. Klein disagreed , choosing to fire the employee instead .
The First Department , Manhattan 's state appellate court , upheld Mr. Klein 's decision earlier this month .
Liquor Industry Targets Lindsay Lohan
has contacted her legal team after discovering that USA TODAY ran a full page ad about ignition interlock devices that are used to keep impaired drivers off the road .
The ad used a mug shot of Lohan stating that it is a good idea for the star but a bad idea for us .
Lindsay 's lawyer Blair Berk issued the following statement :
USA TODAY is idiotic for running such an irresponsible advertisement , suggesting that drinking and driving is some kind of American " tradition " we should protect .
Not identifying that this ad was paid for by the liquor industry is profoundly reckless .
Drunk , old , white businessmen , drunk cougars out for girls night out , and drunk wedding parties should be kept off the roads of America .
Lindsay Lohan fully endorses ignition interlock devices that have been well - proven to save lives . "
For once I agree with Lindsay , no matter what her issues are .
We would assume that someone will be made to pay for the ill advised use of her mug shot and sending a message that smacks of recklessness .
Stay tuned for more on this story .
To say that Europeans will welcome President George Bush on his farewell visit to Europe next week would invite a charge of verb - abuse .
Welcome is hardly the word .
But they will be glad to see the back of him .
His two terms have been a bad time for relations between Europe and the United States .
The question now is how much better those relations will get under a President Barack Obama or John McCain .
My guess is : with Obama , it will be very different and an exciting ride , but still not easy ; with McCain , a little better than with Bush at the outset , but could rapidly get stormy again .
What we 're asking here is actually a deeper question : how much does the individual matter in history ?
Answer : a lot .
If the winner of the 2000 presidential election had been Al Gore ( ie the winner of the 2000 election ) the story of transatlantic relations over the past few years could have been very different .
The 9/11 attacks might have provoked a trans- atlantic crisis anyway , because America then felt itself to be at war while Europe did n't .
But so much of the subsequent bust - up had to do with Bush himself : his unilateralism , his obsession with Iraq , his cowboy style , his incompetence .
There has been some improvement in transatlantic relations during his second term .
The Spenglerian doom - and - gloom prophecies of five years ago , at the height of the Iraq crisis , look a bit comical now .
The coming " clash of civilisations " , predicted one American foreign policy expert , would not be between the west and Islam but between Europe and America .
" Americans are from Mars and Europeans are from Venus , " wrote the American neoconservative Robert Kagan .
It turns out we 're from and on the same planet , after all .
As European cities like Madrid and London have been hit by takfiri jihadist terrorism , as even conservative Americans have recognised that you can't win your " war on terror " like a conventional war , so there has been some convergence on what this long struggle involves .
Yet a few big , awkward facts remain .
During the cold war , the transatlantic west was held together by a common enemy .
No longer .
For all that transatlantic convergence on the threat of international terrorism , it does n't pull us together like the Soviet threat did .
( " If only we had Brezhnev back , " sighed a former British foreign secretary at the height of the Iraq crisis . )
A recent comparison of British and American counter - terrorist strategies in the New York Review of Books makes the point that for Britain - and much of Europe - terrorism is an enemy within , like cancer , whereas for most Americans it 's still an enemy without .
What 's more , analysts in Washington regard Europe itself as a threat to the national security of the United States , because the old continent is now home to potential jihadist terrorists .
In the bipolar world of the cold war , western Europe and America were condemned to work together .
In today 's multipolar world , there are more possible permutations .
The US has a burgeoning love affair with India .
It may prefer such large , friendly non-western democracies to our carping little old European ones .
Europe 's energy dependency on Russia , and its growing economic dependency on China , may tempt European countries to cuddle up to those authoritarian giants more than Washington would like .
In this brave new world , there 's nothing inevitable about the transatlantic alliance .
Because the structural ties that bind are weaker , the personalities , visions and strategies of leaders on both sides of the pond are more important than ever .
I 'll leave Obama for another week , and concentrate on the more difficult case .
McCain 's youthful biography commands respect , like that of the older Bush and unlike that of the younger Bush .
But he is an old man now and he holds none of Obama 's fascination for Europeans .
If " soft power " means " the power to attract " , then Obama is the personification of American soft power .
McCain is not .
Moreover , he has a famously volcanic temper - not necessarily an asset when dealing with time - consuming and self - important European leaders .
Quips about " McBush " and " McSame " may be too simple .
McCain does send some welcome new messages : renounce torture , close Guantánamo , practise " international good citizenship " on climate change .
But he also has a lot of foreign policy ground in common with his predecessor .
In a speech in Los Angeles earlier this year , he made a big point of how his personal experience of combat has led him to " detest war " , but the fact is that he operates , at least as much as Bush , within the paradigm or metaphor of " the nation at war " .
What many people see and like in him is precisely the image of the warrior chief .
He 's the guy who said America could still win in Iraq , when all about him were giving up .
" Defeating radical Islamist extremists is the national security challenge of our time , " he wrote in Foreign Affairs last year .
" Iraq is this war 's central front , according to our commander there , and according to our enemies , including al - Qaida 's leadership . "
And according to George Bush .
But not according to most of America 's military , security and intelligence experts , friends around the world and European allies , all of whom would reply : ( a ) that there is no " central front " ; and ( b ) that in this struggle Afghanistan , Pakistan , Saudi Arabia and the Muslim communities of Europe are at least as important as Iraq .
He has talked of " rogue - state roll - back " and speaks a language of confrontation with Iran .
Since Iran is pressing ahead with building up its uranium enrichment capacity at an alarming rate , sometime in the next four years he could face the decision whether to bomb its nuclear facilities .
For relations between the US and Europe , Iran could then become another Iraq - only worse .
Describing himself as " a realistic idealist " , McCain takes counsel both from the neocons who gained the upper hand after 9/11 in the administration of the younger Bush and the foreign policy realists who prevailed both before and after Europe 's 9/11 ( November 9 1989 , the fall of the Berlin Wall ) in that of the older Bush .
On the neocon idealist side , he takes from Robert Kagan the idea of a league of democracies .
He even suggests that Russia should be kicked out of the G8 to make room for Brazil and India .
And McCain , like Bush in his second term , endorses a strategy of democracy promotion in the wider Middle East .
We Europeans - and Canadians , Australians , Indians and other small " d " democrats around the word - should not be scared by any of this , but we should be prepared .
Kagan rightly points out that the Danish prime minister , Anders Fogh Rasmussen ( spoken of as a possible president of the European council ) has himself suggested an " alliance of democracies " .
We need to have our answers ready , by November , to the proposals likely to come lobbing over the Atlantic : here 's where we agree , this is how we'd do things differently .
We need our own post - Bush to - do list for a revived transatlantic partnership .
And we can not count on Obama winning .
After the rough ride with Bush , prepare for a rough ride .

Computing :
The ambitious “ $ 100 laptop ” programme is having a few problems , but it may have catalysed a whole new market
IN NOVEMBER 2005 , at the World Summit on the Information Society conference in Tunisia , Nicholas Negroponte , a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , unveiled a small , cute , lime - green computer .
The “ $ 100 laptop ” caused quite a stir among those interested in economic development .
Dr Negroponte and his non-profit venture , One Laptop Per Child ( OLPC ) , hoped that the combination of clever design and the scale efficiencies of manufacturing would make it possible to make the laptops for $ 100 each .
Governments in the developing world , he predicted , would order millions of the laptops and give them to schoolchildren , triggering a revolution in education .

A source of inspiration
Sceptics argued that it would make more sense to spend the money on other things — water , sanitation , health care , teacher training — rather than laptops .
Large orders from governments failed to materialise .
Two - and - a - half years after it was unveiled , the machine , now officially known as the XO Laptop , still costs nearly $ 200 to make and only about 300,000 of the things have been distributed .
And in recent months several senior figures have departed from OLPC , casting doubt over its ambitious goals .
But in one respect the XO Laptop has undoubtedly made an impact : by helping to spawn a new market for low - cost laptops .
Hardly any models costing $ 500 or less were available when the XO burst onto the scene , but now there is a wide selection of such machines , from familiar makers such as HP and Intel , and from relative newcomers such as Asus and Pioneer Computers .
By raising the very possibility of a $ 100 laptop , the XO presented the industry with a challenge .
Wayan Vota , founder of OLPCNews.com , an independent website that follows the project , calls the XO a “ harbinger of an entirely new class of computers ” .
The Classmate PC made by Intel , the world 's biggest chipmaker , is arguably a direct rival to the XO .
In July 2007 Intel joined the OLPC project , but pulled out in January 2008 .
Its departure stemmed from the rivalry between the Classmate and the XO , which take very different approaches to promoting low - cost computers in the developing world .
The XO is a radical , clean - sheet design that runs the Linux operating system under a graphical interface called Sugar .
The Classmate , by contrast , is a full - fledged but cheap laptop ( it costs $ 300 - 500 ) that runs standard Windows software .
Intel 's promotional literature , touting the Classmate 's “ real PC capabilities ” looked like a swipe at the XO .
But Intel had a point .
The XO 's Linux - based software is free and can be freely modified by users — something the XO 's backers were keen to encourage .
But government and education officials would prefer to stick with the software that has , for better or worse , become the worldwide computing standard .
In May Dr Negroponte conceded that the lack of Windows support had hindered the XO 's adoption , and announced plans to produce a new , Windows - based model .
Although the Classmate may have stolen some of the XO 's thunder in the developing world , another low - cost laptop has been a runaway success in the developed world .
The tiny Asus Eee PC , little bigger than a paperback book and weighing less than a kilogram , sold more than 300,000 units in 2007 alone .
It is now available in several versions : the most basic model , with a seven - inch screen , costs $ 299 , and a new high - end model with a nine - inch screen costs $ 549 .
HP , the world 's biggest PC - maker , entered this new market in April with the “ Mini - Note ” , a small laptop weighing just over a kilogram .
It too will cost under $ 500 .
All of these new machines are being aimed at consumers in the rich world , who like the idea of a computer that can be taken anywhere , as well as being sold for educational use in poor countries .
The $ 100 laptop has been a success — just not , so far , in the way its makers intended .
LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) -- Misha Di Bono zips around town in her Infiniti sport- utility vehicle , breezy and unconcerned about the price of gas .
Misha Di Bono says people used to make fun of her rolling billboard .
She gets $ 500 a month and free gas .
That 's because she gets $ 500 a month -- plus free gas -- for turning her car into a rolling billboard for Jobing.com , the online recruiting company she works for .
" People used to tease me about the ' Jobing ' mobile , and now they 're like , ' Oh , we 'll get Misha to drive , ' " she said , standing next to her decal - covered car .
Jobing.com might be the most extreme example of how companies are helping employees during the current gas crunch .
But with gas averaging more than $ 4 a gallon , more and more companies are trying to figure out incentives to help ease the pain at the pump for their employees .
Watch a rolling billboard for your company »
" There 's no question companies are feeling the pinch , " said John Challenger , the chief executive officer of global outplacement company Challenger , Gray and Christmas .
" It 's an important issue because no company wants to lose its people . "
His firm recently surveyed about 100 human resources executives at white - collar and blue - collar companies .
The survey found that 57 percent of the companies offer programs to help ease commutes .
The most popular option was reducing the work week from five eight - hour days to four 10 - hour days .
Twenty - three percent of the companies polled have such an option , Challenger said .
Calculator :
How much do you need to work to pay your gas ? »
" We 're at a watershed time of how people go to work , " he said .
" Maybe the gas crisis will be the real trigger . "
Other incentives :
Twenty percent of the companies offer carpools , and 18 percent pay for the cost of public transportation .
Only 14 percent of the companies offer telecommuting options , the poll found .
The survey reports that companies had seen a recent jump in carpooling of 43 percent and a 23 percent increase in the use of public transportation .
Still , 31 percent of the companies saw no increase in their employees ' commuting behaviors .
See gas prices around the country »
Some of the companies have had the incentives for years , but it 's taken the soaring gas prices for employees to look more closely at the programs .
" It 's something that is much more important than two years ago , " Challenger said .
" It 's hard to get away from , because you 're constantly going back to the gas station . "
He added , " It 's hitting people 's radar screens now . "
One company offering generous commuting benefits is online giant Yahoo , which rewards employees who organize carpools , ride bikes to work and take company shuttles to and from offices .
Yahoo rewards these green - conscious commuters with free movie tickets , lunches , massages and other benefits .

How is your company helping you
The company recently hired an " employee transportation coordinator " to help devise even more incentives .
" We 've really been listening to our employees to make sure we help them find ways to make the cost of the commute a little less excessive , " said Barbary Brunner , a Yahoo vice president .
But it is the Jobing.com vehicle that is most eye - popping .
Company spokesman Joe Cockrell says the company started the rolling billboard cars in 2001 , but only three executives took part in it .
But now , 60 percent of its 270 employees nationwide drive the cars .
Watch a shift from marketing ploy to employee benefit »
" This year , for the first time , we 've had a long waiting list for our wrap , " Cockrell says .
" It 's basically a huge sticker that goes on your car and should last in theory about three to four years . "
It costs the company about $ 3,000 to $ 4,000 to turn the cars into rolling billboards .
They do have rules :
The car ca n't be older than three years , and employees must take a driving safety course and have clean driving records .
Once the cars are wrapped , employees should n't flip the bird at other drivers .
The company did have to " unwrap " one employee 's car because he got too many speeding tickets .
Cockrell says the program has proved to be a huge win-win .
" These are mobile billboards , and wherever our employees go , so does that billboard . "
Di Bono , who works in community relations , says she loves it , too .
She says the cost of filling her tank has doubled in recent years .
Now , her company pays her to drive her car .
" They pay for everything , " she said .
" They pay for me to go to all my appointments and anything I want to do on my own time . "
She added , " You 'd be a fool not to take advantage of it . "
Although many people across the nation are seeking help from their offices , an iReporter in West Virginia recently stopped using his company car and began using his old clunker again .
Maurice Alouf 's company paid for his V - 8 Chrysler sedan , but he says it guzzled gas on his 80 - mile round - trip commute .
The company did n't offer a gas allowance , and it was costing him more than $ 60 a week to fill up .
So he dusted off his 50 - mile - per - gallon Geo Metro .
" It 's not fun , " he said .
" I 'd like to keep driving [ the Chrysler ] , but I can't . "

May 19 , 2008 | The Commuter ’s Lament
On the subway pathway from the 42nd street A , C , E stop leading to the 7 , 1 , 2 and 3 train platform , I spotted these placards upon the beams – everyone else seemed to be in too much of a hurry to appreciate them .
It turns out that this is a piece of work from Norman B. Colp entitled “ The Commuter ’s Lament / A Close Shave ” and was commissioned by the MTA for $ 5,000 back in 1997 .
The last part of the title itself is a testament to the Burma - Shave shaving cream ads that Colp said inspired him .
These were witty billboard ads posted on the side of highways between 1925 and 1963 :
If wifie shuns / your fond embrace / do n’t shoot the iceman / feel your face / Burma - Shave
When in school zones / take it slow / let the little / shavers grow / Burma - Shave
Turns out I also missed the first placard , which reads : “ Overslept ” .
Apparently it still stands incomplete , as Mr. Colp wrote
The work is incomplete , for the last panel ( a 24″x36 ″ B / W image of a slept - in bed ) was removed for the station renovation last year ( 2005 ) . [… ]
Also missing are wall labels at the beginning and end of the sequence which identifies the work as THE COMMUTER ’S LAMENT or A CLOSE SHAVE .
Norman B. Colp passed away on August 28 , 2007 .
Interestingly enough , two New York Times pieces ( one an opinion column , the other a neighborhood report ) offer differing takes on the artwork :
It ’s hard to imagine , however , why working people would enjoy having their angst captured , magnified and reflected back at them every morning on their way to work .
” The Commuter ’s Lament ” was meant to be on display for one year , but has n’t come down yet .
It might be time to try another approach .

But M.T.A. officials and commuters can get a laugh by taking a few seconds to look up and appreciate the dry wit attached to ceiling beams in a long , dingy and arid underground corridor , the one that connects the Eighth Avenue IND station to the IRT Nos. 1 , 2 and 9 trains at Times Square .

Before I go on to whatever it is that I say today and ...
I usually do n’t know what that ’s going to be , I want all of you to read this fine article from one of the better and more courageous writers going , Israel Shamir and then I want you to read this article on Ted Olsen .
These articles are n’t connected except that they are both to be found on The Truthseeker .
Across the space of the internet there are all too few sites where you can get real and truthful information .
Others are What Really Happened also Signs of the Times and The Peoples Voice .
Prison Planet and others also tell us things we usually do n’t find anywhere else but you probably know about them and you probably go there .
If you do n’t then you should visit these sites every day because they will tell you what is going on rather than telepathically invade you with messages crafted to form assumptions in your mind ; assumptions that have no connection to the truth .
I try not to get angry and usually that ’s not difficult .
I ’m not an angry person generally ... I do have a problem with injustice .
As much as I know that karma is a reality and that everything is under control , no matter how it looks , it still seems to me that we are required as human beings to protest and speak out against injustice .
It is less important that we succeed in any particular mission than that we tried .
You have to ask yourself what your life is about and what is important to you .
In these days the navel - gazing , self - absorption and pursuit of personal gain is epidemic .
Even when people take the high ground on bad behavior , the motive is often the pursuit of their own celebrity rather than giving a damn .
Speaking the truth feeds an oxygen tank that allows you to breathe in an ocean of lies .
Compassion is a protective device that defends your life .
Love is a power that , when truly possessed , makes one invulnerable .
Courage is the reward of conviction .
I could go on and on about what these things mean to me , making up pithy phrases ; Les Visible sound - bites that came out of one place and head off into another without either location ever being known .
We ’re traveling through dimensions and environments that we do n’t understand and either we are trying to make sense out of it or we are trying to make money off of it .
Anybody who is paying attention knows that if the neo-con weasels and their banking backers want to hit Iran they have to do it before January 20 of next year .
This is because no matter how much they think they know and no matter what steps they take they ca n’t be certain that the same evil process will remain intact after the election .
I ’m not a Barrack Obama supporter but I will give him a chance .
I want / wanted Jessie Ventura and Ron Paul as the ticket .
Obama is not likely to assault Iran so they have to get to it before the deadline .
This assault is the brainchild and desire of Israel .
America is no more than the dog being wagged .
Here are a few truths that are not being said except by those of us who are motivated to do so .
Iran cannot and will not have a nuclear weapon by the end of the year .
This is being said so that the attack can take place according to a fabricated desperate need .
Israel is a rogue nation with nuclear weapons which does not cooperate with the IAEA .
Israel does n’t want Iran to have nuclear power or weapons because Israel , possessing these weapons , can act with impunity in the neighborhood and go on practicing genocide ( Palestine ) and mass murder ( Lebanon 2006 ) .
If Iran were to have such a weapon then pressure could be brought to bear on the Nazi regime in Israel .
Balance of power is not a bad idea and certainly Iran and her people are not crazier than many of the belligerent countries who are presently waging war around the planet .
Hamas and Hezbollah are not terrorist organizations .
They have a right to exist and defend their homeland against terrorism .
What is being practiced in Palestine is terrorism .
What happened in Lebanon in 2006 was terrorism .
Bombing non-existent nuclear facilities in Syria is terrorism .
What happened on 9/11 was terrorism as was what happened on 7/7 and 3/11 .
When you connect the dots it becomes very apparent who the real terrorists are .
Here are some other truths .
Israel massacred a lot of Palestinian people back in the late 40’s and continues to do so until today .
They drove 700,000 + of these people off of their ancestral homeland .
Israel does not have a right to exist so long as they deny the Palestinians a right to exist .
Israel has profiteered off of an intricate manipulation of the facts concerning events that took place during World War 2 and the Zionist movement aided and abetted these atrocities .
They have fashioned a slur called ‘ anti-Semitism ’ to defend against any criticism of their pathological behavior and they keep pressing to have this word redefined until it includes every thought word and deed of which Israel disapproves .
Although Israel makes up a very small part of the world ’s population they are very highly represented in the neo-con movement .
They were the motive force behind the 9/11 attacks , the Afghanistan invasion , The Iraq War and the orchestration of political and media pressure to attack Iran .
Israel ’s celebration of 60 years of existence is actually a celebration of 60 years of bloodshed practiced on her neighbors .
The facts given for the ’ 67 war and ’ 73 war are lies .
Israel caused these events and hard data backs it up .
Take the trouble to look into it .
Take the trouble to find the last war that Iran ‘ started ’ .
Compare Iran ’s warmongering with Israel’s .
It appears that telling the truth is anti-Semitic .
Telling the truth is anti-Semitic .
Looking for the truth is anti-Semitic .
Finding the truth is anti-Semitic .
Disputing anything that Israel says or does is anti-Semitic .
The word neo-con ( according to Paul Wolfowitz ) is anti-Semitic .
Not being Semitic is anti-Semitic .
Breathing and having a free mind appear to be anti-Semitic unless you are one so defined as Semitic and which does not include Palestinians but does include Ashka - Nazis who are NOT Semitic .
Personally , I think an enormous wall should be erected around Israel ’s ’ 67 borders .
It would be better if it were a dome .
This is not with the interest of protecting Israel from the rest of the world but rather the rest of the world from Israel .
There are some wake - up calls coming for Israel and one of them is China down the road .
Israel ought to be relocated in Myanmar where there is not only space but a political predisposition that dovetails with their own .
The two articles that I gave you in the beginning of this essay point out some significant truths .
One of these truths is that a war is being fought through cultural manipulation with the intention of changing reasonable laws into unreasonable laws in order to create international police states so that the few can live at the expense of and upon the backs of the many .
The other article shows blatant and certain lies which further indicates that there are other lies about the 9/11 attacks .
My feeling is that we are all looking at a long hot summer which shall prove to be anything but metaphorical .
Maybe you have no interest in the truth .
Maybe you would not recognize it if you encountered it .
Maybe you do n’t care what happens to other people and maybe you do .
Whatever the truth of that may be will be clearly shown by what you say and do according to what you believe .
When enough people speak and act from their conscience , psychopathic , reptile behavior will naturally diminish .
So long as you do not speak and act from your conscience you are a contributor to the conditions of the times .
Due to the kind donations received from readers this site will soon contain video that we hope will enhance the experience of coming here .
I offer a deep and sincere thanks to all of you who made this possible .
# 854608 +( 2013 ) - [ X ] sterano :
Whats the difference between Raid_0 and Raid_1 ?
Steve :
In Raid_0 the zero stands for how many files you are going to get back if something goes wrong .
The Mounties ' anti-terror unit and Canadian Security Intelligence Service , Canada 's top spook agency , have a file dedicated to a harmless punk band called " The Suicide Pilots . "
Apparently , a grasp of irony is not a prerequisite for intelligence work in Canada — on the other hand , that 's pretty serious punk cred : the Mounties think we 're terrorists .
Woo !
Following the arrest of the band 's drummer , bones ( aka Jeffrey Monaghan ) , the RCMP 's anti-terror unit opened a file on the band , alleging their logo " depicts an airplane flying into the Peace Tower on Parliament
Hill . "
A copy of the frightened - looking airplane caricature was included in the 184 page file .
" If you want an example of bloated police powers , this is it , " says Ottawa - based lawyer Yavar Hameed .
Hameed notes that the investigation seems to be completely unrelated to the arrest of Mr. Monaghan .
Monaghan was alleged to have leaked the Tory Green Plan last spring .
The anti-terror investigation appears to have surfaced after media coverage of Mr. Monaghan denouncing the Harper regime 's actions of climate change .
Monaghan has never been charged .
The investigation is organized through the Integrated National Security Enforcement Teams ( INSET ) , and the documents reveal an explicit coordination with Canada 's spy agency , CSIS .
Hameed notes that this case illustrates the unaccountability of police agencies in their efforts to catalog and criminalize activists .
The Suicide Pilots have commented that the intelligence effort is another example of state - lawlessness in the so - called " War on Terror . "
" The explosion of security culture over the past few years has cost countless innocent people very dearly , in ways we can't even begin to fully appreciate – but this just straddles the line between disturbing and silly .
What 's next ?
A tag - and - release program for
social activists ?
We already have a make - work program for creepy , paranoid voyeurs , " says the band 's vocalist NaCl .
Is there a pattern in these numbers ?
By Ruth Alexander
BBC Radio 4 , More or Less
An otherwise entirely rational person might confess to having a lucky number or two , but why do some people base important decisions on the right numbers ?
Most of us see maths as a science , but to some , numbers have hidden meanings that can be used to make decisions in matters as serious as recruiting staff .
When Samantha Roddick , the daughter of Bodyshop founder Anita Roddick , launched her business , she crunched numbers with her bank manager , her accountant - and her numerologist .
Eight is good for business ... five is good for sales , PR and marketing
Sonia Ducie
Numerologist " When I pulled the whole team together , I just got everybody 's numerology done , " she says , describing how she used numbers to organise her new staff into efficient working groups .
" And then you just look at the overall numbers and how they interact .
Ones are very ambitious , hard - working , career - centric , money - driven , Threes are very creative , as are Sixes .
Fives , they 're very apt to a lot of change . "
Numerologists believe the numbers one to nine each have a mystical meaning , and that if you add together the digits in a person 's date of birth , the end result is a number which influences the path that person will take in life .
They also believe the letters in the alphabet have corresponding numbers , so a person 's name can be added up to produce a number with meaning as well .
Product launches
But how far can you take this ?
" The reality is it should never affect your decision - making process that much , " says Samantha Roddick .
" It is there just to inform you , not to direct you , because you do n't really want to hire and fire based on someone 's numerology - that would be ridiculous , " she laughs .
The spelling of Agyness Deyn 's name is numerological But possibly not unheard of .
The numerologist Samantha Roddick consulted is Sonia Ducie .
She claims companies big and small contact her for help with product launches , rebranding and recruitment decisions .
" Somebody came to me last week for a new company name , " Ducie says .
" The product it was selling was something fun , so we had to look at the number three .
It was also something very practical , so you 've got the number four .
" And then we looked at the launch date , because you might have the best product but the timing is out , " she says .
" So for example , take the date 26 May 2008 .
You look at the day number - two and a six is an eight - and eight is good for business .
Then you add up the whole date , and get 41 .
Four plus one is five .
Five is good for sales , PR and marketing . "
Dead heat People have even chosen their own names according to auspicious numbers .
Model Agyness
Deyn is believed to have chosen the unusual spelling of her name in conjunction with her mother using numerological principles .
Ducie claims she has helped a large publishing house recruit a new group managing director .
" They were down to the last two CVs .
They 'd interviewed both people three times , and they just could n't make up their mind . "
NUMEROLOGY
Personality number :
Add up the numbers from the day you were born - used to determine what you need Life path number :
Add up whole of date of birth - what you need to do in life Soul number :
Adding up numbers derived from vowels in full name - used to find " gifts within soul " Expression number :
Adding up all numbers from all letters in name - sum of gifts and experiences to date
She said she drew up numerology charts for the two candidates and was asked lots of questions about their potential based on this information .
" And then of course the most important thing is timing because everything goes in nine - year cycles .
We looked at when these two people were looking to join the company .
People who tend to join in say the 7th , 8th or 9th years of a nine - year cycle might be inclined to change jobs again in another few years . "
Did the publishers come to a decision ?
" Oh yes , " she says .
" They really knew by the end of the conversation who they felt was the best choice . "
One might ask why businesses normally concerned only with the hard numbers of profit and loss would go down this mystical course .
Marcus du Sautoy , a professor of mathematics at Oxford University , says numerology is a dirty word to mathematicians - as astrology is to astronomers .
Evolutionary programming " But , " he says , " in some sense it does capture a lot of what mathematics is about , which is trying to spot patterns and connections .
" I think humans are almost evolutionarily programmed to try to look for these patterns because that 's how we navigate the world around us .
So in the jungle if you see something with symmetry then it 's likely to be an animal that either you can eat , or it 's going to eat you . "
And modern numerology does have its roots in the thinking of someone you 'll remember from your geometry classes .
" Pythagoras certainly imbued certain numbers with a lot of mystical significance , " Marcus du Sautoy says .
" He thought 10 , for example , was a very special number because of the way you can arrange 10 stones into a beautiful sort of equilateral triangle - one , two , three , four stones in each row . "
But as an alternative way of making sense of a complicated world through numbers , numerology is ultimately flawed by that very complexity .
People living in different cultures around the world attribute different meanings to numbers .
The number four , according to Western numerology , is associated with the four corners of the earth , home , stability .
To the Chinese , it means death .

Associated Press
A landmark plan to fight climate change was defeated yesterday in the US Senate , likely postponing action on carbon emissions limits until after this autumn 's presidential election .
The bill aimed to cut US global warming emissions by 66 % by 2050 , but opponents said it would cost jobs and raise fuel prices in an already pinched American economy .
The bill was defeated 48 - 36 .
The US green movement expressed dismay at the political wrangling that killed the proposal , although environmental groups cheered the Senate for taking the first step towards addressing the issue that is expected to gain momentum when Bush leaves office .
" Americans are demanding global warming solutions .
It 's a shame they will have to wait another year , " Lexi Shultz , deputy director of the climate programme at the Union of Concerned Scientists , said .
" But our country will have another global warming debate in 2009 with a new Congress and president .
Putting a cap on global warming pollution is inevitable . "
Senator Joe Lieberman , who sponsored the bill , said : " I think people around the world are going to be greatly encouraged by the fact that 54 members of the US Senate are saying they want to support a real response to global warming . "
The bill was also backed by California 's Republican governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger .
Neither the Democrat presidential candidate Barack Obama nor his Republican counterpart , John McCain , cast votes on the bill .
Democrats had hoped this summer would be an opportune time to debate emissions caps .
But Republicans seized an opening to claim that the bill would increase fuel prices .
Real Time Economics at the WSJ has a nice summary today : Oil Bubble ?
The Debate Rages
For reference , here is Justin Lahart 's article today : Commodity Prices Soar , But Are They in a Bubble ? , and Professor Hamilton has a new research paper on the subject that covers all the key issues : Understanding crude oil prices
First , what is a bubble ?
Back when I was arguing there was a bubble in housing , I wrote : Housing : Speculation is the Key
A bubble requires both overvaluation based on fundamentals and speculation .
It is natural to focus on an asset ’s fundamental value , but the real key for detecting a bubble is speculation ...
It is far from clear that the first part of the bubble definition — prices in excess of their fundamental value — is in place .
But the second part — that people are buying in anticipation of selling at a higher price — certainly is .
[ T ] here is a possibility that what has looked like peak oil to some observers ( something I believe is coming ) , was actually GCC countries investing by not extracting oil .
If oil prices start to fall , and with rising expenditures , the GCC countries might increase production - causing prices to fall further .
" I keep no secret from you that when there were some new finds , I told them , ' no , leave it in the ground , with grace from god , our children need it ' . "
The Paris - based International Energy Agency is in the middle of its first attempt to comprehensively assess the condition of the world 's top 400 oil fields .
Its findings wo n't be released until November , but the bottom line is already clear :
Future crude supplies could be far tighter than previously thought .
...
For several years , the IEA has predicted that supplies of crude and other liquid fuels will arc gently upward to keep pace with rising demand , topping 116 million barrels a day by 2030 , up from around 87 million barrels a day currently .
Now , the agency is worried that aging oil fields and diminished investment mean that companies could struggle to surpass 100 million barrels a day over the next two decades .
The decision to rigorously survey supply -- instead of just demand , as in the past -- reflects an increasing fear within the agency and elsewhere that oil - producing regions are n't on track to meet future needs .
From Real Time Economics : I 'm not so sure .
Speculation requires storage - something that was obvious in the housing bubble , but is n't so obvious for oil .
From Real Time Economics : Frankel 's argument is similar to the one I suggested here ( based on research from Professor Krugman ! ) : Petroleum Prices and GCC Spending
So is oil a bubble ?
Is there evidence of speculation and storage ?
Some people have cited recent comments by Saudi Arabia 's King Abdullah as evidence of storage , from Reuters : Saudi King says keeping some oil finds for future I 'm skeptical of this comment ( and similar comments from Saudi officials over the years ) , because I think it is intended for domestic purposes .
The alternative to speculation is that oil prices being driven by the fundamentals of supply and demand - with strong growth in global demand , even as demand weakens in the U.S. - and suppliers are struggling to keep up .
On supply , from the WSJ : Energy Watchdog Warns Of Oil - Production Crunch Oil prices are n't an obvious bubble like housing or tech stocks .
It seems the key question is :
Are the oil exporting countries producing as much as possible - or are they investing by cutting oil extraction ( and leaving the oil in the ground ) ?
The lack of transparency for the GCC countries , and several other oil producing countries , makes it unclear .
In March , simultaneous installations in two Chelsea galleries – one called The Assassination of Barack Obama , the other The Assassination of Hillary Clinton – were canceled “ due to extreme legal pressures , ” according to LVHRD .
This morning the artist , Yazmany Arboleda , again attempted to hang his work in an empty storefront across from the New York Times building and got as far as putting up the name of the exhibit in the window before the NYPD , Secret Service , and – who would have guessed – the major media rushed to the scene .
Arboleda told authorities that the exhibit – which features a gigantic black penis ( pictured after the jump ) and mounted text like “ WOULD YOU HAVE SEX WITH HER ?
NEITHER WOULD BILL . ” – explores the idea of character assassination .
You did n’t think he was referencing a literal assassination with bullets , did you ?
It ’s just a “ metaphor ” !
Nevertheless , those philistines in the Secret Service ordered the show 's title in the window papered over to protect the politicians .
And Arboleda was detained and finally released , albeit outraged at the crackdown : “ I ’m renting that space ; the space was allocated for an exhibition and it ’s my right to put those words up .
It ’s terrible , because they ’re violating my rights . ”
The moral here , obviously , is that referencing the assassination of a presidential candidate for some weirdo art project is unacceptable , but if you 're doing it to push overpriced T - shirts , go nuts .

Obama camp scoffs at claim Clinton ' misspoke ' with Bosnia flub Nick Juliano

Print This Email This Update : Line on running from runway not in prepared speech , Clinton camp says Hillary Clinton 's chief spokesman tried to brush off her tall tale about ducking from sniper fire as she landed at a fortified air base in Bosnia just after a peace accord was signed there , saying the former first lady simply " misspoke " about the 1996 trip .
Rival Democrat Barack Obama 's campaign quickly scoffed at the attempt to dismiss the fib , noting that the mistaken wording was included in the text of Clinton 's speech .
 Senator Clinton said that a planned welcoming ceremony was cancelled because they needed to avoid sniper fire , but news footage shows that she was met by a small child who read her a poem .
Contrary to the latest spin from the Clinton campaign , when you make a false claim that 's in your prepared remarks , it 's not misspeaking , it 's misleading , and it 's part of a troubling pattern of Senator Clinton inflating her foreign policy experience ,  Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor said in an e-mail .
Update : Clinton camp text was ' as delivered , ' not prepared Responding to a question about the Obama campaigns statement Tuesday , Clinton spokesman Phil Singer said Vietor was " mistaken " in his characterization of the speech .
" Those were not prepared remarks , " Singer said .
" Those remarks on the Web site were as delivered . "
Clinton 's speech at George Washington University last Monday focused on Iraq , but it 's gained most notice for her re-telling of visiting troops in Bosnia .
" I remember landing under sniper fire .
There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport , but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base , " she said .
The Fact Checker on washingtonpost.com awarded Clinton four Pinocchios and called it " simply not credible , " after reviewing contemporaneous news accounts and speaking to others who were along on the trip .
It 's not clear whether the description was written prior to Clinton 's speech , or if the remarks posted online are a transcript of her delivered remarks .
A RAW STORY e-mail to the Clinton campaign seeking clarification was ignored until Singer addressed the question during Tuesday 's call .
During an earlier conference call , Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson swatted down questions about the former Clinton 's inaccurate portrayal of the trip with further contemporary news accounts describing the dangerous situation and noting she was the first First Lady since Eleanor Roosevelt to visit troops in a war zone .
He shared descriptions of her trip visiting " burnt out villages " and skirting " mine fields , " and he said Clinton 's runway reception was cut short due to security concerns .
" I do n't think there is any question ... that she was taking an opportunity to visit troops in a potentially dangerous area , " Wolfson said .
" There 's no dispute about that . "
Getting to what was disputed -- namely that Clinton and crew did n't have to sprint from their plane with bullets whizzing by -- Wolfson said , " It is possible in the most recent instance that she discussed this that she misspoke . "
He accused the Obama camp of making hay out of the issue out of desperation .
During her trip to Bosnia in March 1996 , Clinton was accompanied by the singer Sheryl Crow and comedian Sinbad , who was the first to cast doubt on her portrayal of the trip .
" I never felt that I was in a dangerous position , " Sinbad told the Washington Post 's Mary Ann Akers .
" I never felt being in a sense of peril , or ' Oh , God , I hope I 'm going to be OK when I get out of this helicopter or when I get out of his tank . ' "
Clinton dismissed Sinbad 's account because " he 's a comedian , " but the issue has continued to percolate .
Tales of her harrowing landing date back to last December , before anyone voted in any primaries or caucuses .
She told an audience in Iowa that her plane had to make a corkscrew landing to avoid being shot ( the tactical landing has not been questioned , and her campaign says there were reports of snipers in nearby hills ) .
" Somebody said there might be sniper fire , " she said , adding tartly , " I do n't remember anyone offering me tea on the tarmac . "
Video reports confirm that Clinton was n't served tea after exiting the plane , but she was greeted by an 8 - year - old girl who read a poem praising the peace process .
" We 're not a poor state ... we 're a wealthy state , " Jindal said , adding that Louisiana boasts oil , fisheries , ports and six major rail lines .
" We should be running circles around every other state in ....
As Louisiana recovers from the economic aftershocks of the 2005 storm , Jindal said he has been attempting to attract business to the state .
" I like the job I 've got , " said Jindal , who took office only four months ago .
He added that when McCain visited Louisiana last week , the two spoke about the state 's recovery plans , levees , wetlands and attempts to cut through government bureaucracy to speed the recovery from the devastation of Hurricane Katrina .
" I 've got a job where I get to make a difference for my state . "
" He 's not going to ask me to run , " Jindal said , answering a question he'd rather have instead of the one actually asked .
" I think it would be presumptuous to turn down something I 've not been offered .
I likened it earlier this week to -- like going to high school and telling the prettiest girl in the high school ' I 'm not going to the prom with you ' before she asks me .
Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal dodged a question today on whether he'd " promise " not to join Republican presidential candidate Sen .
John McCain as his vice presidential running mate this fall .
... the country .
And yet even before the storms ... we were one of the only states in the South to be losing our people . "
Recently , the Louisiana legislature approved dozens of ethics bills that the new GOP governor thinks will convince potential investors the stereotyped " Louisiana way " of doing business -- with widespread influence peddling for government contracting -- is a thing of the past .
The legislation prohibits elected officials from doing business with the state , and it forces elected and appointed officials to disclose sources of income .
It also requires lobbyists to disclose their lobbying income , what they are lobbying for and who they are lobbying .
He said that the changes in Louisiana led the Center for Public Integrity to rank the state first in ethics standards .
In previous years , Louisiana has ranked 43rd or 44th .
" We worked hard to restore the people 's trust in the system in Louisiana , " Jindal said .
But he said that the second step to attract commerce was to curtail business taxes .
" If you want businesses to borrow money , to expand , to modernize , to invest in your state , do n't tax them when they 're trying to do it , " Jindal said .
Jindal , speaking at the National Press Club in Washington , encouraged Congress to approve funding as soon as possible to rebuild levees in Louisiana , and he said there should be a national interest in restoring Louisiana 's wetlands .
Last year , Jindal became the nation 's youngest governor at 36 .
He 's the son of Indian immigrants who as a four - year - old asked his friends to call him Bobby after the Brady Bunch TV show character , graduated with honors from Brown University and attended Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar .
Before Jindal took over as governor , he twice was elected to the House , served as an assistant secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services , and ran unsuccessfully for governor .
Some Republicans tout Jindal , who is Louisiana 's first nonwhite governor since Reconstruction , as the ideal addition to the McCain ticket .
Conservative radio talker Rush Limbaugh has described the slight Jindal as the next Ronald Reagan .
In accordance with the state 's ethics rules , Jindal said he could not accept a mug presented to him by the press club .
But he said that he would donate the mug to the state .
" If you come to the governor 's mansion , you 'll see this sitting in the mansion long after I 'm governor , " Jindal said .

This week , the following events took place : 1 . We got a bunch of tips telling us that the Xbox 360 version of Alone in the Dark had turned up on BitTorrent sites .
2 . Scandinavian games site GameReactor ( The Norwegian edition specifically ) were one of the first to review Alone in the Dark .
They gave it 3/10 .
Ouch .
However , they then promptly pulled the review , and accusations of shady dealings were levelled against the site by Atari , who said that press copies had only been sent out the day before ( the review has since been reinstated , and the 3/10 stands ) .
Odd , seeing as many other European publications also had reviews go live this week , but whatever .
3 . German site 4 Players reviews the game .
Gives it 68 % .
Then is threatened with legal action by Atari because , yes , Atari had no idea how the site got a copy of the game .

4 Players ' EIC Jörg Luibl says that Atari 's lawyers have accused them of " breaking the law and violating the rights of their client ( Atari ) " , all because 4 Players reviewed the game prior to its release , but without using a copy sent to them by Atari .
4 Players maintain that , like many other games not sent to them by publishers , they secured a copy via a " trusted dealer " .
Which could well just be a firendly local GAME manager cracking open his shipment of the game before the street date , it could be point # 1 ( the leaked copies of the game ) , who knows .
It 's interesting that Atari are so worried about publications securing their own copy of a game .
Do they fear that , because these outlets may have received copies of the game " early " ( ie from pirated copies ) , that they 're somehow reviewing incomplete code , which could affect their opinion of the game ?
Maybe .
Pessimists could , however , be forgiven for thinking it's a convenient excuse for Atari to attack negative reviews of the only game they 're releasing in 2008 that has any chance of making them some money .

UPDATE - Tor -Steinar Nastad Tangedal , from Norwegian site Gamer.no , has contacted us with a similar story .
He writes ( though without proof we 're unable to confirm this ) :
When arteries carrying blood to the heart muscles become blocked , doctors often clear them by performing an angioplasty ( inserting a balloon to open the narrowing passageways ) and then inserting a mesh metal tube called a stent .
This conduit is designed to act as scaffolding to keep the artery open .
Because this procedure was introduced three decades ago , researchers have been searching for ways to coat such stents to protect patients from allergic reactions to the metal and keep surrounding tissue from growing through the mesh and reclogging the artery .
One biotech company believes it may have come up with a way to do both by covering its stents with hydroxyapatite , a ceramiclike substance found in tooth enamel .
Atlanta - based MIV Therapeutics , Inc. , says such devices are just as good as bare metal stents at keeping arteries open and less likely than polymer - coated stents — which typically administer a drug to keep tissue growth at bay — to contribute to blood clotting , irritation and inflammation , says MIV 's chief executive officer Mark Landy .
MIV recently began recruiting heart patients for a 120 - person trial designed to test how well the technology works .
If the trial is successful , MIV plans to use the data to apply for marketing approval in Europe .
This data will be used to help MIV gain approval for its VESTAsync stent from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration , a process that is longer and more complicated .
The current trial follows a nine - month safety and efficacy trial conducted last year at the Institute Dante Pazzanese of Cardiology in São Paulo , Brazil , on 15 patients that proved VESTAsync works safely in people , Landy says .
" We have developed a drug delivery system that can be used on stents and other implantable medical devices that is polymer - free and can administer medication to the local tissue " to keep an artery from reclosing , Landy says .
Patients who receive drug - coated polymer stents are generally required to take Plavix or another anticoagulant for at least a year after an angioplasty , in addition to the medicine dispensed by the stents .
" Our hope is to reduce the need for this oral blood - clotting drug , " he says .
" That is probably the most desirable outcome of what MIV is pursuing . "
MIV is hoping its use of hydroxyapatite will give the company an edge in a stent market worth nearly $ 2 billion in U.S. sales in 2007 and already crowded with medical supply heavyweights such as Johnson & Johnson and Boston Scientific Corporation as well as newer competitors Medtronic , Inc. , and Abbott Laboratories .
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved use of Johnson & Johnson 's Cypher stent in early 2003 , and approved Boston Scientific 's Taxus a year later .
Landy would not speculate on the price tag of the stents , developed with researchers at the University of British Columbia .
But he says they probably would cost about the same as — if not less than — polymer - coated stents now on the market .
The company 's ultimate goal , says Landy : to develop a stent that will dissolve once it is no longer needed , which would eliminate concerns about ingrown tissue and chronic inflammation .
But he says such technology is still at least a decade away .
The seemingly far - fetched theory that Leonardo da Vinci was of Arab descent has been given new backing in a study , published this week , that suggests his mother was a slave .
It is known that Da Vinci 's parents were not married and that his father was a Florentine notary , Ser Piero .
In a tax record dating from 1457 , five years after the Italian polymath 's birth , his mother is described as one Caterina , who by then was married to a man from the Tuscan town of Vinci .
It was assumed she was a local woman .
But , according to Francesco Cianchi , the author of the study , " There is no Caterina in Vinci or nearby villages who can be linked to Ser Piero .
The only Caterina in Piero 's life seems to be a slave girl who lived in the house of his wealthy friend , Vanni di Niccolo di Ser Vann . "
In his will , the Florentine banker left Caterina to his wife .
But on his death in 1451 , his house went to his friend and executor , Ser Piero .
The fact that the banker 's widow continued to live in the house , soon hiring a new servant , forms the basis for the theory that Ser Piero allowed her to stay in return for freeing Caterina .
The slave woman disappears from the Florence records thereafter .
On April 15 1452 , Da Vinci was born in Vinci .
A few months later , his mother married one Acchattabriga di Piero del Vaccha .
The study casts light on slavery in Renaissance Italy .
At the research 's launch , Alessandro Vezzosi , a Da Vinci scholar and founder of the Museo Ideale at Vinci , said : " A lot of well - to - do and prominent families bought women from eastern Europe and the Middle East .
The young girls were then baptised .
The most common names were Maria , Marta - and Caterina . "
Last year , a study by an Italian academic of a fingerprint left by Da Vinci found that it included a configuration normally only found among Arabs .
His Holiness the 17th Karmapa 's 2008 U.S. Visit
The official blog for the 2008 U.S. visit of His Holiness the 17th Karmapa , Ogyen Trinley Dorje .
May 15 - June 2 , 2008 .
As president , George W. Bush loves to talk to those who visit the Oval Office about the rug on the floor .
( He claims to have tasked Laura Bush with helping come up with a design that communicated “ optimistic person ” to those who saw it . )
But as governor , Bush was n’t excited about his carpet ; he was excited about a painting : “ A Charge to Keep . ”
In 1995 , he issued a memo to his Texas staff , describing the painting , by W.H.D. Koerner in 1916 , which he kept on his office wall .
Bush told his aides :
The reason I bring this up is that the painting is based upon the Charles Wesley hymn “ A Charge to Keep I Have ” .
I am particularly impressed by the second verse of this hymn .
The second verse goes like this : “ To serve the present age , my calling to fulfill ; O may it all my powers engage to do my Master ’s will ”
This is our mission .
This verse captures our spirit . [… ]
When you come into my office , please take a look at the beautiful painting of a horseman determinedly charging up what appears to be a steep and rough trail .
This is us .
What adds complete life to the painting for me is the message of Charles Wesley that we serve
One greater than ourselves .
When one looks at the painting , you see a man on horseback — who actually looks a little like Bush — apparently leading a group of missionaries .
It worked for Bush on a couple of levels : the title comes from one of the president ’s favorite Methodist hymns , the man in the picture looks like him , and he related to the missionary work depicted in the painting .
He liked all of this so much , Bush used the title for his autobiography ( which he admittedly did not write ) .
He even brought the picture with him to Washington upon taking office .
The funny part is the truth about the painting : " Bush ’s inspiring , proselytizing Methodist is in fact a silver - tongued horse thief fleeing from a lynch mob . "
A fight between rival groups of black and Latino students at Locke High School quickly escalated into a campus - wide melee Friday , with as many as 600 students brawling until police restored calm with billy clubs .
The troubled campus in South Los Angeles was locked down after the fight broke out at 12:55 p.m. , as students returned from lunch to their fifth - period classes .
Overwhelmed school officials called Los Angeles police for help , but students and faculty said it took about half an hour before dozens of officers , many in riot gear , restored order .
“ The kids were crazy , running from place to place , jumping on other kids , ” said Reggie Smith , the school ’s band director , who said he ran to pull his students from the melee .
“ Some of my kids were crying because they were walking to class with friends and they got jumped . ”
Los Angeles Unified School District police said that there are only two officers assigned to Locke but that the school police force brought in about 60 officers after receiving word of the brawl .
The Los Angeles Police Department also dispatched more than a dozen patrol cars and about 50 officers .

Susan Cox , an LAUSD spokeswoman , said police arrested four people -- three students for fighting and one non-student for illegal possession of a knife .
Four students were treated in the school nurse ’s office for minor injuries .
The campus at 111th and San Pedro streets has long been one of the city ’s most troubled .
This school year has been particularly difficult , with near - daily fights -- albeit on a much smaller scale -- during much of the fall and winter .
Locke is about to be reorganized as a cluster of charter schools run by Green Dot Public Schools , which will take over in July , and some faculty and staff have accused the district of letting the campus drift in its final year as a traditional public school .
“ Morale has really dropped because they do n’t feel like they have everybody behind them , ” cheerleading coach Marlo Jenkins said recently .
“ There are just fights upon fights upon fights now . ”
Faculty members and Green Dot complained that L.A. Unified nearly halved its funding for non-police security aides at the start of the year .
The school has been especially plagued by tagging crews -- the school employs two full - time workers just to paint over graffiti , said Green Dot ’s Kelly Hurley , who is managing the transition .

Faculty members also complained repeatedly about in - school ditching and a massive tardiness problem .
Finally , the district restored some of the trimmed security , faculty said , and also dispatched an additional administrator to help restore order .
Until then , the district had relied on Principal Travis Kiel , who ’d been brought back from retirement .
In recent weeks , students and teachers have reported improved conditions -- less ditching , a little less graffiti .
But then came Friday ’s melee , which students and teachers said was by far the worst of the year , perhaps the worst in years .
Joseph Sherlock , a senior , 17 , who has been at Locke for four years , called it “ my first actual encounter with a riot . ”
He added : “ I ’ve seen fights , and I ’ve seen fights between black and brown , but I ’ve never seen anything like this . ”
Sherlock , who said he saw police use pepper spray during the melee , said tensions between African American and Latino students have not been a serious problem at the school .
With an enrollment of 2,600 , Locke is 65 % Latino and 35 % African American .

“ It ’s not the way it ’s portrayed in the media ; that ’s not what it ’s like at all , ” said Sherlock , who is black .
Another black student , Ronald White , said African American and Latino students commonly divide along ethnic lines but are n’t necessarily hostile .
“ Everybody usually just sticks to themselves , ” he said .
White , a 17 - year - old senior , said he had just stepped from a main building into the school ’s grassy quad when he was met with a scene of chaos .
Hundreds of students were outside , and from what he could see , “ Most people was fighting . ”
Eventually , police began to swarm onto the campus , and White said the students began fighting the officers , who responded with their batons .
“ I was in the corner , just watching , ” he said .
“ I saw a girl get hit by the police and she went down . ”
Advertisement
Senior Victor Wong , 18 , said the brawl grew out of a fight two days earlier between a Latino student and an African American student .
Wong said Latino students who are friends of his asked him to participate in a fight planned for Friday that was to pit 10 Latino students against 10 African American students .
“ It was a crew - on - crew thing , ” he said , referring to graffiti gangs .
“ They asked for my help , but I ’m graduating , ” he said .
“ I ’m done with all that . ”
Wong said the two groups of instigators met as planned at the school ’s handball courts , and “ all of them started going at it . ”
Within seconds , he said , the fight escalated beyond the original two groups , and people began running throughout the campus fighting .
“ They would finish one place and run to another corner and fight , ” he said .
Advertisement
“ Security did n’t know where to go , ” Wong added .
“ They ’d concentrate in one spot and something would happen somewhere else .
This is the worst I ’ve seen . ”
Minor injuries at the scene were treated by the school nurse and L.A. Fire Department personnel .
No one required hospitalization , the school district said .
There were , however , some descriptions of students being badly beaten .
Wong said he saw one student beaten unconscious on a handball court .
Sherlock said he saw one Latino student walking along Saint Street , the road that bisects the campus , when he was surrounded by a large group of black students who began hitting and kicking him .
“ He was bleeding real bad , ” Sherlock said .
“ When they stood him up , he kind of collapsed back down . ”
Sherlock , who is a member of the Black Student Union and the school ’s new House of Representatives , which was formed to help guide the transition from traditional school to charter , added that he had tried to stop the fighting , but to little effect .
After securing order , authorities rounded up the students who had n’t returned to class and segregated them by race , holding Latinos in the boys gym and African American students in Hobbs Hall , the school ’s multipurpose room .

Beginning at 2 p.m. , school officials began releasing students in small groups to go home .
The school remained on lockdown until the last group had left about 3:15 p.m .
LAUSD ’s
Cox said that there would be an enhanced police presence at Locke during school hours next week and that the district would send human relations staff to the school to talk to students .
In recent years , melees have broken out periodically at many campuses with a black and Latino presence , including in Los Angeles , Lynwood and Compton .
There have been fights between Latinos and Armenians in other areas that led to campus lockdowns .
In nearly all cases , no serious injuries have resulted , but the incidents have frightened students and parents , marred the reputation of schools and hindered the learning of students who frequently already face substantial academic challenges .

Study : Global warming not to blame for rise in hurricanes
Cyclone Nargis recently made international headlines for dealing death and destruction to Burma .
Yet unlike the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina , global warming received little blame for the intensification of Nargis .
That 's possibly because , in the nearly three years since New Orleans flooded , the science of hurricanes and climate has matured .
A new scientific paper authored by prominent National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientists , published this weekend , reinforces the changing landscape .
The paper , which simulated Atlantic hurricane activity during warming 21st century conditions , found 27 percent fewer tropical storms , and 18 percent fewer hurricanes .
The strongest hurricanes , the researchers found , had slightly higher wind speeds .
" This does not support the idea that we 've already seen a large positive trend in hurricane activity emerging from greenhouse gases , " said lead author Tom Knutson , a Princeton , N.J. - based research meteorologist for NOAA .
" In fact , it points in the other direction . "
Published online today in Nature Geoscience , the paper is notable for finding such a striking reduction in Atlantic activity .
Earlier research has suggested a small reduction in total storms , or little change in a warming world .
By suggesting a marked decrease in activity , the new work bolsters the views of Chris Landsea , science and operations officer at the National Hurricane Center , who has argued that the apparent recent increase in Atlantic storm counts is due solely to better observational tools — satellites and the like — which blanket coverage of the Atlantic hurricane basin .
" After taking into account the changes in monitoring , the number of storms we 're seeing now is on par with previous busy periods in the Atlantic , " Landsea said .
This does n't mean there 's necessarily an emerging consensus on global warming 's impact on hurricanes .
While most research has suggested that the number of storms may not increase , and some like Knutson 's has indicated a decrease in storm counts , there are troubling signs that the stronger storms ' intensities may spike .
That 's what concerns scientists like Judith Curry , chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology .
Some simulations , she said , have found that while the average intensity of storms may not increase substantially , the number of Category 4 and 5 hurricanes , the most powerful ones , does rise .
Some observational evidence may bear this out .
Since 1935 there have been four seasons in the Atlantic basin with two or more Category 5 storms .
Two of those seasons have occurred in the last three years , 2005 ( Emily , Katrina , Rita and Wilma ) and 2007 ( Dean and Felix ) .
" There is strong agreement that intensity will increase in a warmer climate , although there are arguments about the magnitude of the increase , " Curry said .
The hurricane - climate debate took off during the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season , which set a record of 28 tropical storms and hurricanes .
At the time several influential published papers suggested global warming was already having a measurable impact on hurricane activity .
" We now have a much more diverse scientific literature , by far , " said author Chris Mooney , whose book Storm World chronicles the furious debate within the scientific community that has ensued since 2005 about hurricanes and climate .
But in addition to the scientific backdrop , Mooney said other reasons may exist to explain global warming 's general absence from the post - Nargis debate .
" There 's a different bad guy , not global warming but the junta , " he said of Burma 's ruling body .
" And there 's the risk of looking craven and opportunistic if you go off about global warming right now . "
For casual observers following the 2005 hurricane season , there were considerable reasons to think a warmer world would produce more storms .
Hurricane forecasters say tropical storms will form when sea surface temperatures reach 80 degrees .
In a warmer world , then , periods of favorable conditions for storm formation should last longer .
So why does n't the new study , and other simulations , identify such a trend ?
" The response of Atlantic tropical cyclones to increased greenhouse gases depends on more than the warming Atlantic Ocean , " said Gabriel Vecchi , a NOAA scientist who co-authored the new paper with Knutson .
" In our experiments , the reduction in Atlantic storms seems to be , at least partly , related to a projected increase in wind shear in the tropical Atlantic as we look out into the 21st century . "
Nearly all scientists agree the hurricane - climate debate remains unsettled because computer modeling of hurricane activity for the next century remains problematic .
For past simulations , researchers have generally used just one of the climate models employed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , or IPCC , to forecast future global temperatures .
But each of these models returns different solutions for wind shear changes over the Atlantic Ocean .
A strength of the new study by Knutson is that it uses an average of all the computer models used by the IPCC , a technique that generally leads to better forecasts .
But until the climate models all agree on different variables , such as future wind shear , knowing what future hurricane seasons will bring is impossible , scientists say .

BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - European Union states agreed on Thursday to scrap sanctions against Cuba in a move aimed at encouraging democratic reforms on the Communist island , officials said .

The lifting , agreed despite U.S. calls for the world to remain tough on Havana , will pave the way for a new dialogue with Cuba but come with calls that it address human rights concerns and free political prisoners .
Relations would be reviewed in one year , they said .
“ Cuban sanctions will be lifted , ” EU External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero - Waldner told reporters after foreign ministers of the 27 - nation bloc clinched agreement at a summit dinner in Brussels .
“ Of course there is clear language on human rights , on the detention of prisoners and there will have to be a review also , ” she said of the EU policy arrangements accompanying the move .
The EU measures , which triggered a so - called “ cocktail war ” over invitations of dissidents and government officials to European embassy receptions , were imposed after a crackdown on dissent in 2003 and include a freeze on high - level visits .
The sanctions were suspended in 2005 but their abolition is an attempt to encourage more reforms by President Raul Castro , who took over after the February 24 retirement of his brother Fidel .
There are about 230 political prisoners in Cuba , according to the illegal but tolerated Cuban Commission for Human Rights .
Unlike the 1962 U.S. embargo , the EU sanctions do not prevent trade and investment .
Lifting them will put the EU at odds with Washington ’s advocacy of a hard line against Cuba .
“ We certainly do n’t see any kind of fundamental break with the Castro dictatorship that would give us reason to believe that now would be the time to lift sanctions , ” U.S. State Department spokesman Tom Casey said on Thursday .
“ We would not be supportive of the EU or anyone else easing those restrictions at this time . ”
SPAIN LED
Spain had led the push to drop the sanctions and open a dialogue with Cuba but met resistance from the bloc ’s ex-communist members , led by the Czech Republic .
“ Countries that had less inclination to lift the measures have asked that , within one year ... the results of political dialogue on human rights be re-evaluated , ” Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos said .
“ What is not going to be re-evaluated is imposing the measures because they have been lifted definitively . ”
Of the disparity with U.S. policy he said : “ The United States has its policy on Cuba .
We do n’t share it ...
In the end , we have our interests and our autonomy in foreign policy . ”
Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt said there would be strict conditions for the move .
“ We have n’t softened our approach , ” Bildt said .
The EU would ask Cuba to improve its human rights record , release political prisoners and high - level EU visitors would also meet opposition figures when appropriate , he said .
Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg stressed : “ There are still people in prisons and their situation is terrible . ”
A draft of the agreement seen by Reuters urged Cuba to improve human rights , including by releasing unconditionally political prisoners , ratifying U.N. rights conventions and giving humanitarian organizations access to Cuban jails .

The FDA is investigating whether cancers in about 30 children and young adults are linked to the use of Remicade , Enbrel , Humira , or Cimzia to treat childhood arthritis , Crohn 's , or other diseases .
The cancers occurred over a 10 - year period beginning in 1998 .
Remicade is approved for use in children to treat Crohn 's disease .
Enbrel and Humira are approved for use in children to treat juvenile idiopathic arthritis , formerly known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis .
The drugs block a molecule , called tumor necrosis factor or TNF , thereby switching off immune responses that make joints and tissues swell and redden .
The drugs help calm overactive TNF in patients with certain types of arthritis , Crohn 's disease , severe psoriasis , and other autoimmune diseases .
But TNF is also part of the body 's defense against cancer .
On their labels , all of the drugs list cancer -- particularly lymphoma , a cancer of white blood cells -- among their serious possible side effects .
The labels warn patients and their parents that the drugs lower the body 's ability to fight off infections .
The FDA has asked the makers of the drugs approved for children to provide information about all cases of cancer reported in children taking the drugs .
The maker of Cimzia is required to conduct a long - term safety study of the product , which will begin in 2009 .
" At the current time , the FDA believes that the potential benefits of the use of TNF blockers outweigh the potential risks in certain children and young adults having one of the diseases for which the TNF blockers are approved to treat , " the FDA says in an " early communication " statement .
" Until the evaluation is completed , healthcare providers , parents , and caregivers should be aware of the possible risk of lymphoma and other cancers in children and young adults when deciding how to best treat these patients . "
During its investigation , which is expected to take six months , the FDA says it will consult medical experts to assess the potential link between these drugs and cancer .
The investigation will also look at whether there are certain children with juvenile arthritis or Crohn 's disease who may be at particular risk of developing cancer .
Europe returns to Coal : Italy to increase reliance on coal for power generation to 33 % from 14 % despite climate change concerns By Finfacts Team Apr 23 , 2008 - 3:40:40 AM
Enel power plant in Civitavecchia , northwest of Rome , where conversion from oil to coal is underway .
Europe returns to coal and in Italy , major electricity producer , Enel , is converting its massive power plant in Civitavecchia , northwest of Rome , from oil to coal , the dirtiest fuel on earth .
A report in the New York Times today says that over the next five years , Italy will increase its reliance on coal to 33 % from 14 % .
Power generated by Enel from coal will rise to 50 % .
The report says that Italy is not alone in its return to coal .
Driven by rising demand , record high oil and natural gas prices , concerns over energy security and an aversion to nuclear energy , European countries are slated to build about 50 coal - fired plants over the next five years , plants that will be in use for the next five decades .
Coal powered plants are being opened at a rapid pace in India and China .
Australia , the world 's biggest coal exporter , is a key supplier to Asia .
The port of Newcastle , north of Sydney , is straining to meet the demand .
Despite planned expansions , the ability of Australian seaports to handle increased coal shipments is unlikely to improve in the next few years , the head of the world 's largest coal producer said on Tuesday .
" It 's not going to happen , " Gregory Boyce , chairman and chief executive of Peabody Energy Corp said during a conference call with Wall Street analysts .
Boyce was asked whether recent congestion at Australian ports would be fixed soon .
" It depends on what you mean by ' fixed , ' " said Boyce .
" We 'll see some substantial increases in port capacity , but enough to satisfy demand ?
They will still be short . "
Some 38 % of global electricity is generated from coal .
Australia , Poland , South Africa and China all rely on coal to produce over three quarters of their electricity , India over 60 % , and the USA and Germany more than half .
In Germany and Italy , there is a ban on building nuclear power stations and some environmentalists who advocate anti-climate change measures do not accept that where oil is more expensive than coal , which has a reserve life of 200 years compared with up to 50 years for oil , choices have to be made in the real world .
In Ireland , Minister for Communications , Energy and Natural Resources Eamon Ryan , called last January for " an urgent public debate in Ireland on nuclear energy . "
The call by the Green Party minister coincided with the announcement of the UK government 's plans for a new generation of nuclear power stations , ending years of uncertainty over its energy strategy .
The " urgent debate " may as well be held on Mars .
The New York Times report says that Europe ’s power station owners emphasize that they are making the new coal plants as clean as possible .
But critics say that “ clean coal ” is a pipe dream , an oxymoron in terms of the carbon emissions that count most toward climate change .
They call the building spurt shortsighted .
“ Building new coal - fired power plants is ill conceived , ” said James E. Hansen , a leading climatologist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies told the NYT .
“ Given our knowledge about what needs to be done to stabilize climate , this plan is like barging into a war without having a plan for how it should be conducted , even though information is available .
“ We need a moratorium on coal now , ” he added , “ with phase out of existing plants over the next two decades . ”
Enel , like other electricity companies , say they have little choice but to build coal plants to replace aging infrastructure .
Fuel costs have risen 151 % since 1996 , and Italians pay the highest electricity costs in Europe .
Enel said in 2006 when it announced the planned conversion of the Civitavecchia plant from oil to coal , that the adoption of cutting - edge emissions - abatement technologies and the increased efficiency of coal - fired plants , make the use of coal compatible with the even stricter environmental regulations that were due to enter force in 2008 .
" The project not only helps to reduce emission levels of more than 80 % compared with the previous oil power plant but it also allows the plant working under further better conditions even compared with the emission limits contained in the VIA Decree ( Environmental Evaluation Impact decree ) . "
Enel also emphasized that the wide availability of coal in many countries and the size of estimated coal reserves , which are far greater than those of gas and oil , make it an attractive option and an essential component of a balanced mix of energy resources for power generation .
About one fourth of all energy consumed in Finland is generated utilising nuclear power .
A French - German Consortium formed by Framatome ANP and Siemens has responsibility for the current construction of the Olkiluoto 3 plant pictured above .
Enel also said that in circumstances " that are laying bare the dramatic structural fragility of the natural gas supply system and the dangers of over - reliance on one type of fuel to generate electricity , the diversification of energy resources , supplier countries and supply systems , and the need to ensure energy security and greater competitiveness for Italy has become a matter of even greater urgency and strategic importance . "
The company also defended the decision to expand the role of coal in electricity generation in Italy , with the objective of increasing its share of the fuel mix towards the European average , as the only feasible way to bring Italian electricity prices into line with those in the main European countries , thereby boosting the competitiveness of Italian companies and easing the burden of energy costs on the budgets of Italian households .
Today 's NYT report says that the technology , which the industry is counting on to reduce the carbon emissions that add to global warning — carbon capture and storage — is not now available for coal .
No one knows if it is feasible on a large , cost - effective scale .
Enel says it will only start experimenting with the technology — in which carbon emissions are pumped into underground reservoirs rather than released — in 2015 , in the hopes of “ a solution ” by 2020 .
New Ethics Law Still Does n't Stop Congressional Freebies
Sen. Daniel Inouye and Rep. Dan Lungren Found a Way to Get Someone Else to Pay for Their Travel to One of Hawaii's Top Resorts
Despite a new ethics law designed to prevent lobbyists from paying for lush vacations for members of Congress , Sen. Daniel Inouye , D - Hawaii , and Rep. Dan Lungren , R - Calif. , found a way to get someone else to pay for their travel to one of Hawaii 's top resorts , ABC News has found .
A full report will air tonight on " World News With Charles Gibson " as part of the ABC News Money Trail series .
Lobbyists for an aviation industry trade group , the American Association of Airport Executives ( AAAE ) , arranged to throw fundraisers for both key lawmakers at the group 's annual conference this January on Hawaii 's Big Island , amidst beautiful beaches and championship golf courses .
The arrangement , first suggested by the lobbyists , allowed Inouye and Lungren to bill their trips as legitimate campaign fundraising expenses , meaning they did n't have to pay a dime of their own money .
" If the lobbyist is paying the campaign and the campaign is actually writing the checks , it 's a shell game , " said Ellen Miller of the watchdog group the Sunlight Foundation .
" It is still lobbyist money influencing lawmakers . "
Campaign documents examined by ABC News show that Lungren billed his campaign $ 4,900 for lodging and first - class travel for him and his wife .
Lungren told ABC
News he needed to fly first - class because of an ailing hip .
Inouye also billed his campaign for his trip expenses , but his staff would not disclose the precise amount .
Lungren , dressed in a festive yellow Hawaiian shirt , spent about a half hour addressing the members of the trade group and much of the rest of the time could be seen around the pool of the Hapuna Beach Prince resort .
" Organizations have their conventions usually at nice places , " Rep. Lungren told ABC News .
" I 'll admit I like to go to that particular one . "
Lungren , a member of a key committee that oversees airport security issues , insisted he carried out important discussions with airport executives while at the pool .
" I'm a California kid , " Rep. Lungren told ABC News .
" I grew up around pools .
We do a lot of business around pools . "
Asked if he would have attended if the January conference were held in Pittsburgh , Lungren said , " Do I look like I go to Pittsburgh in January ? "
Inouye , chairman of the Senate Commerce , Science and Transportation Committee , said through a spokesman that his time at the conference was part of a nine - day " work trip " to his home state , for which he brought four staffers .
His travel costs were paid by the campaign .
Travel costs for four aides were charged to taxpayers , according to the spokesperson .
Until the passage of the new congressional ethics reform law , the aviation lobbying group had spent almost $ 650,000 flying members of Congress and their aides to meetings around the world , including the yearly gathering in Hawaii .
But at this year 's meeting , many of the usual suspects were missing .
Congressman Harold " Hal " Rogers , R - Ky. , sent his regrets on tape , by song , bemoaning , " You do n't buy me lunches .
You do n't throw me fundraisers anymore . "
Rogers declined to comment to ABC News .
At this year 's opening reception , a whole pig was roasted on a spit while federal officials and lawmakers rubbed shoulders with executives from every corner of the aviation industry .
The fundraiser for Lungren was held at sundown on the private terrace of the lavish Hapuna Suite , which the hotel brochure describes as an " ultra - exclusive 8,000 square foot private estate " with two levels , a private butler and a private swimming pool .
Lungren raised about $ 20,000 in a two - hour time span from the industry lobbyists and executives in attendance .
He says all aspects of the trip were done in full compliance with the new ethics law .
Sen .
Inouye 's fundraiser was a luncheon affair which raised $ 37,950 , according to Inouye 's office and campaign finance records recently filed .

The phrase " Merchants of Death " takes center stage in the movie Iron Man , which is a spectacular exposé of a subject that dominates the American economic landscape but about which Americans have very little knowledge .
The phrase and the movie deal with the odd juxtaposition of capitalism and war as found in the weapons industry .
Here we have innovations and efficiency of the type we associate with the private commercial sector but serving ends that are the very opposite of capitalism .
The industry serves war , not peace , depends on coercion , not human volition , and profits from destruction , not creation .
The movie itself follows the career of Tony Stark ( Robert Downey , Jr. ) , a billionaire engineering genius who inherited his father 's weapons company and took it to new heights .
Touring Afghanistan , he is captured by a guerilla army and here he experiences an epiphany .
It is his weapons that they are using to solidify their control over the population .
He had long consoled himself that his bombs were being used to defend freedom but now he sees that they are used by anyone who seeks to control others — the very opposite of his propaganda .
He makes an escape and sets out on a new course to build a high - powered exoskeleton to beat back the very thugs he had inadvertently empowered with his own weapons .
Now , in the film , the bad guys get his guns because a rival in the corporate structure had been double - dealing behind the scenes .
In real life , the scenario is a bit different .
Traditional merchants of death sold to anyone .
The more their weapons were used , the more wars resulted , and the higher the profits .
Now , with controls in place on weapons contractors , it 's no longer that simple .
What happens now is that the state simply changes its mind on who are its friends and who are its enemies .
It sells guns to friends ( " freedom fighters " ) until times change and the same people become enemies ( " terrorists " ) .
It seems incredible until you realize the memory loss that Americans have toward US foreign policy .
The 1980s are not exactly ancient history but in those days , the Reaganites had as a core doctrine of US policy that Islam constituted a valiant ally in the struggle against Communism .
The Mujahideen in Afghanistan were leading the struggle against Soviet control , and the leaders of this army were courted and celebrated in Washington , particularly by conservatives .
We were told that they shared our struggle because they believed in traditional values , freedom , and a strong defense .
They were given vast weapons and the CIA assisted in their ultimately successful effort to oust the Soviets .
Once the Mujahideen had the Soviets out of the way , they seized control of the country and imposed a dictatorship and an antidrug theocracy with a government that became known as the Taliban .
The Taliban must have been shocked when Washington suddenly turned on them since they were merely carrying out the " traditional values " for which they had been previously celebrated .
Now , suddenly , they were being called a dictatorial band of thugs that had to go .
Once overthrown by Washington , they moved into the mountains and became an essential part of what is today collectively known as Al - Qaeda .
So the labels changed : from freedom fighter to terrorist in one decade .
But the weapons remained the same : their equipment and resources and bombs were almost entirely provided by the same folks who backed them to the hilt the previous decade .
So Iron Man telescopes events somewhat , but the core of the truth is there — though hardly ever spoken about in American public life .
Nor is this something new .
The problem of the Merchants of Death has been around for at least a century .
The existence of such an industry scandalized Americans in the interwar period , and there was one treatise that led the way in helping to foment the outrage .
In fact , it was a bestselling book in 1934 with the title Merchants of Death .
We are justified in calling it the first megaselling conservative book of the 20th century .
Why conservative ?
The lead author was H.C. Engelbrecht , and , most importantly , its coauthor was Frank C. Hanighen , who would later become the founder of Human Events , which was the most important weekly publication on the Right in the 1940s and 1950s .
In other words , the phrase " Merchants of Death " did not originate on the Left but on the Right , during the New Deal period , when the people later called conservatives became alarmed about the union between big corporations and big government .
This book is not a typical left - wing style attack on commerce as the essence of war .
In fact , it argues the opposite : " The arms industry did not create the war system .
On the contrary , the war system created the arms industry . "
The blame , then , lies not with the private sector that makes the weapons :
All constitutions in the world vest the war - making power in the government or in the representatives of the people .
The root of the trouble , therefore , goes far deeper than the arms industry .
It lies in the prevailing temper of peoples toward nationalism , militarism , and war , in the civilization which forms this temper and prevents any drastic and radical change .
Only when this underlying basis of the war system is altered , will war and its concomitant , the arms industry , pass out of existence .
The book holds up as a marvelous analysis of how the merchants of death profited from World War I , a fact that the public found riveting and helped solidify a strong antiwar temperament in the electorate during those years .
This raised consciousness led to a broader insight about the nature of the warfare state , namely , that the only way to restrain it was to keep centralized power of all sorts at bay .
The leading spokesmen for the ideal here was later called the Old Right by Murray Rothbard .
How it came to be that the Old Right cause would later be taken up by the New Left , while the New Right came to embrace the warmongering creed of the Old Left — well , let 's just say it was a complicated maneuver accomplished in a brief period of time in the late 1950s .
Murray Rothbard was there and he chronicled the transition blow by blow .
His book is called The Betrayal of the American Right .
Sure enough , checking the book , on page 58 , we find a nice discussion of Human Events , Frank Hanighen , and the problem of the Merchants of Death .
So there we have the connection between Rothbardian political analytics and the hottest movie in theaters today .
The real Iron Man is Rothbard , whose influence on the way we view the world seems to rise with every day .

My Life as a Prolog Implementor
Bart Demoen
Department of Computer Science
K.U.Leuven
Belgium
Editor : Enrico Pontelli
I heard about Prolog for the first time when I was teaching IBM - 370 assembler in a technical school .
I was studying for a masters in informatics at that moment as well .
A colleague said : " very soon now , you will learn about a language in which backtracking is build in " .
I thought he was joking because this did strike me as too weird .
But soon afterwards , indeed , we learned about Prolog in class , and at some point the professor even gave the floor to a bearded man who tried to explain the implementation of Prolog to us : that was the first time I saw Maurice Bruynooghe .
I can't remember much about that implementation , but it was n't anything WAM - like : we speak beginning 1983 .
During the summer vacation of 1983 , the ministry decided that teachers would no longer be paid for overtime , so I had to quit my teaching job : another colleague at school told me about his brother Raf Venken who worked in a small company ( BIM ) that was looking for collaborators for a new project .
He gave me the telephone number of ...
Maurice : Maurice was in waiting for a permanent research job with the national FWO ( kind of NSF ) , and in the mean time he got the manager of BIM
( Michel Van den Bossche ) interested in Prolog .
They wrote up a project proposal which would - in collaboration with the university in Leuven - design and implement a commercial Prolog system : BIM - Prolog .
At the phone Maurice asked me my qualifications and when he heard I had a masters in mathematics , I was hired .
My PhD in theoretical physics was of no interest to him .
Gerda Janssens was one of the project members at the university : she had done her engineering thesis on an abstract machine for Prolog , and the idea was to use this machine as a starting point for the BIM - Prolog .
She would do the implementation of the machine , I would do the compiler .
We knew we still needed to do some redesign , but we were quite optimistic .
Our goals were not very ambitious : beating C - Prolog in performance would have been considered a success .
We looked at
manuals ( DEC - 10 Prolog , C - Prolog , M - Prolog ) and a book ( Clocksin and Mellish ) for learning / understanding which built - ins were needed and which we could do without .
We considered some of the things we read rightout silly : how can you name a predicate tab / 1 and let it write out spaces ?
How stupid is it to make the space between a functor name and the next open bracket meaningful ?
We did some redesign of the Prolog syntax .
We were also influenced a lot by the original Marseille
attitude towards Prolog .
We decided on a set of built-ins and went on implementing .
It was fall 1983 .
In February 1984 , Maurice took me to the Atlantic City ILPS .
That was a wonderful experience .
Also a bit awkward at some point because Maurice took me to a program committee dinner where I definitely did not belong .
But most of all it was interesting , and I only realised much later who I met in person : on the way to Atlantic City we met Peter Kovacs who had been involved in the implementation of M - Prolog ( we had studied the M - Prolog manuals while doing the BIM - Prolog design , especially the modules ! ) and Kenneth Kahn .
During the conference , I was within touching distance of Alain Colmerauer who gave what might have been his first invited talk on constraint logic programming ( I did n't buy it : arithmetic in which the variables are still free ... too weird for me ) , two giants named David Warren ( an
H.D. and an S. ) , Ehud Shapiro ( who gave his talk on the Bagel ) , Seif Haridi , Mark Stickel and many more .
It is worth looking at the proceedings of that conference , not just for the historical perspective : lots of the work presented there is really mandatory reading .
The evenings in the hotel room with Maurice were also interesting : he had been given a bunch of papers to referee for some next conference ( for the young : in those days you submitted 6 hard copies ) and he made me read them , even though I lacked lot 's of background to make sense of them .
For the BIM - KUL team , the most important ILPS paper was by Evan Tick and David H. D. Warren : Towards a Pipelined Prolog Processor .
Although it did n't introduce the WAM , it was for us ( Maurice and me ) the first contact with the WAM - remember this is pre-internet time .
After hearing the talk ( Evan delivered it ) Maurice and I were back in our room and Maurice asked : " What do you think ? " .
I answered : " Gerda will not be happy about this ; we must restart from scratch " .
It seems that other teams went through the same experience / evolution .
So on coming back to Belgium , we restarted with the WAM as the new starting point for a faster implementation .
Not that we understood the WAM at that point : some of the instructions in the Tick - Warren paper did n't make sense to us at all , so we invented our own variants , in particular related to indexing .
For instance , we could n't understand why one would create TWO choice points for one activation of a predicate , so we did away with that from the start .
While working on the first release of BIM - Prolog , a competitor emerged in the USA : Quintus - Prolog , headed by D.H.D. Warren himself , and with people like David Bowen ( with whom I spend a nice evening for the first time in Atlantic City and later more at other conferences ) , Richard O'Keefe , Tim Lindholm , just to name some of the Quintus people I met in person , and whose names I did not forget .
At BIM , we were particularly worried about speed , the speed of nrev to be more precise : while our implementation matched Quintus - Prolog in speed for most benchmarks , we lagged far behind for nrev .
BIM - Prolog had at that point already upgraded from an emulator to a native code generating system , under the impulse of two new team members : Herman Crauwels and Andre Marien .
The Quintus trick to get nrev so fast was discovered by Herman by dumping the Quintus code in assembly form ( somehow we had a tape with the Quintus implementation - I still have it ! ) and there we learned about instruction merging .
All implementations do it now and it benefits not just nrev of course .
We knew Quintus Prolog quite well at BIM .
During the 1987 ICLP in Melbourne , where Quintus had a demo booth , I was denied access to the Quintus demo machine , because I was too good at making it crash - it was just something silly with floating point numbers .
Another player was showing at some point : SICStus Prolog , with Mats Carlsson as the main implementor .
Mats was then ( also ) known for his LM - Prolog implementation and he gave a demo of it at the university of Brussels , probably the only place in Belgium with a Lisp Machine ever .
We were very impressed .
And also his later work on SICStus Prolog has always impressed me enormously : while I fled from BIM with its demanding clients back to the university - where you basically only do as you like if you play your cards right - Mats combines the development and support for a commercial system that now contains almost everything else other systems have ( and it is on top of that also robust , reliable and reasonably fast ) , and he keeps writing interesting papers .
Mats is one of my implementation heroes .
Garbage collection for Prolog was always of particular interest to me : it started ( for me ) with ideas by Maurice and Edwin Pittomvils ( see a paper in Boston SLP 1985 ) and a first version of a garbage collector for BIM - Prolog which I spend about two months debugging before we decided to rewrite it from scratch - together with Alain Callebaut .
Alain was also the main drive behind a full - screen debugger for BIM - Prolog , similar to dbxtool for C on SUN machines .
This debugger
was far ahead of its time : it just laughed at the traditional Bird box debugging model ( which I never liked to say the least - not that I think programmable debuggers are better : give me a print statement [ that works even in nondet context ] and I can debug anything ) .
Garbage collection was also my first ( sometimes only ) involvement with some other Prolog systems : when Kostis Sagonas came to Leuven in 1996 , our goal was to build a garbage collector for XSB , but before we did that , we had to understand its usefulness logic .
I am so grateful to Yves Bekkers ( and his colleagues ) to have emphasised this concept , because the intuition that one can have about it really benefits from making it explicit .
I also wanted to work on the implementation of tabling as an add - on , sort of a library that could be added to any Prolog implementation and give the benefits of the SLG - WAM : Kostis rather quickly convinced me that this is not possible , so I abandoned the idea .
It is good to see that implementation groups in Madrid and Porto have made progress in this area quite recently , but important challenges still remain , and perhaps Kostis was right after all .
A very interesting development during the mid-80's was the coupling of external databases with Prolog .
Unify was one such DB system and I went with Ann Mulkers ( who worked like Gerda at the university on the BIM - project ) to Hamburg to do such an integration - February 1986 I believe it was .
It was a very exciting time .
Some things we did then are now being rediscovered and published by other groups : that is good , because it means we were not too far off the right track :-)
1986 was also interesting for its ICLP in London , generally interesting , but for Prolog implementors in particular .
I could n't attend the conference , but when I saw the proceedings , I realised that we ( at BIM ) could have had three Prolog implementation papers there , if only we had realised that what we did in BIM - Prolog was worth
writing up , instead of merely implementing it .
Other papers at ICLP ' 86 have influenced me a lot .
Chris Mellish with a paper on abstract interpretation ( at Leuven we had seen a preprint of that paper and under the impulse of Maurice worked on it ) , and a paper by Saumya Debray .
It was the first Saumya paper I ever saw , but not the last one I was impressed with .
Saumya 's papers show such a good mix ofscientific rigidity and pragmatism : mandatory reading for implementors I would say .
In 1987 I left BIM and went back to the university , to join the research group that Maurice was leading .
Danny De Schreye also joined the group .
Shortly before that , Peter Van Roy had spend some time in Leuven and I worked with him on Prolog implementation issues .
It would be fun ( for me ) to go on like this , hopping from one conference to another , remembering little details from my life as an implementor while I had the opportunity to meet interesting people .
Let me make some big jumps in time .
BIM went bankrupt during my second visit to Paul Tarau in Moncton in 1996 ( it was n't Paul 's fault ! ) : we implemented together a novel garbage collector in BinProlog in 1995 , and a Prolog to Java compiler in 1996 - just too much fun to be true .
In 1997 , I spend a semi-sabbatical in Melbourne with Peter Stuckey , Maria Garcia de la Banda and Kim Marriott : they seduced me to get involved in HAL , a new constraint solver programming language on top of Mercury .
In the mean time , Mercury has assimilated ( or has it been assimilated by ? ) HAL .
Also too good to be true .
In
1999 , I felt it was time to do my own Prolog system : not for the sake of having Yet Another Prolog ( wink ) but because there were too many open questions ( for me ) about Prolog implementation and there was no way to satisfy my curiosity with other systems - the XSB experience had somehow convinced me of that .
So dProlog was born , in four incarnations ( corresponding to four basic questions I had about WAM variants ) , one of which was implemented by Phuong - Lan Nguyen .
dProlog
gave life to ilProlog ( still heavily used under the name of hipP for ILP applications , maintained and further developed by Henk Vandecasteele and Remko Troncon for some time ) and to hProlog which I and Phuong - Lan use regularly for experiments .
h Prolog was also a very good test bed for the CHR implementation by two of my PhD students , Tom Schrijvers and Jon Sneyers .
It has resulted in a CHR version under SWI - Prolog , which is single - handedly maintained by Jan Wielemaker :
another hero .
I have worked for a while on providing SWI - Prolog with a faster basic engine , but that failed .
Since hProlog is rather speedy , I have been offered the following advice more than once : " just replace the SWI - Prolog engine with the one from hProlog " .
I think brain surgeons will be able to replace whole human brains sooner ...
A lot of work was done in the area of concurrent and parallel Prolog systems .
There was pressure to participate in ESPRIT projects like PEPMA and ACCLAIM , and I gave in .
Patrick Weemeeuw and Remco Moolenaar - two of my PhD students - worked on Parallel Garbage Collection for Aurora and on AKL .
We had a ridiculously expensive 8 - processor Sequent machine and it was an interesting experience .
However , my attitude towards making parallel Prolog implementations is now : do n't do it , it is too difficult .
I had a short involvement with GNU - Prolog : Ruben Vandeginste worked with me on garbage collection for Prolog during his PhD .
He implemented a garbage collector for GNU - Prolog , I think in 2003 .
Unfortunately the final integration never happened .
I must have contributed directly or indirectly a garbage collector to three
systems ( besides BIM - Prolog and the dProlog offspring ) : XSB , GNU and BinProlog .
None of those survived : the garbage collection level of involvement is just too intimate to last very long :-)
But at least XSB and BinProlog have garbage collectors .
And Daniel Diaz is now putting one in GNU - Prolog I recently heard .
What are the prospects for a Prolog implementor in 2007 ?
There are several aspects to the situation .
First of all it is clear that the basic implementation technology for Prolog proper is not evolving fast : in fact , the WAM is just too good .
From time to time someone claims to have designed a fundamentally better machine than
the WAM , but it has always turned out that the WAM was actually superior , or the WAM is versatile enough to assimilate a particular good idea .
Secondly , Prolog itself is not evolving much : having an ISO Prolog standard is part of the reason for that ( and of course Part II on modules is a complete disaster ) .
You might conclude that the prospects for a Prolog implementor look dim .
On the other hand , the application domains in which Prolog is used are evolving and become more demanding .
This is a great opportunity for Prolog implementors to live out their phantasies .
Just to name one field I am involved in : Inductive Logic Programming , as part of Machine Learning .
In the past years I have - together with Henk , Gerda and Remko , and in cooperation with the ML team in Leuven - done work on the execution of large sets of queries on large example sets .
This pushes compiler technology to the limit , requires additions to the WAM , ... just the thing one would like to be involved in when making a life as a Prolog implementor .
Also , have a look at what Vitor Santos Costa ( one more hero ! ) has been doing in Yap in the past years : quite a bit of it is inspired by the needs of ILP .
For sure other
application domains do or will certainly present new challenges to the Prolog implementor .
Let me go back to the issue of Prolog as a not evolving language .
There is a split - almost a schism ( in the church sense , not the musical sense ) - in the Prolog community ( implementors mainly I think ) about whether Prolog should move towards a more robust type of language where one must declare at least types , and maybe also modes .
This split is very detrimental to the evolution of Prolog .
Under the impulse of Zoltan Somogyi ( a hero !)
Mercury moved to one extreme in this respect ( extreme is not meant to be judgemental ) and I am not so happy with its program development model , but it is clear that the rest of the world just demands ( at least ) types in a programming language and for good reasons .
Not having types restricts the acceptance potential of Prolog seriously .
Types ( and declarations ) is not at all against the LP philosophy .
Just complement the equation PROGRAM = LOGIC + CONTROL and get PROGRAM = LOGIC + CONTROL + TYPES .
The challenge for Prolog implementors is to integrate types in the implementation in a decent way , and I am not thinking primarily about performance gains - I surprised you here , did n't I :-) BTW , I am still partly in the abstract interpretation and program analysis camp , but I believe that the equation PROGRAM = LOGIC + ANALYSIS has only imaginary solutions .
A relatively recent challenge is put to the Prolog implementors by ASP .
I am using ASP in a generic way for a bunch of LP paradigms or systems based on model generation .
ASP is currently the closest to what LP promised to be : you specify in a logic formalism and the implementation will find the answers to your problem .
It is very much only the LOGIC part of the equations above , but that has always been the first part to get right .
Still , the world needs the CONTROL part also very badly and as far as ASP goes , we are not there yet .
Integrating a model generation paradigm with a goal solving paradigm has been investigated already ( look at work by Enrico Pontelli for instance ) , but a lot more is needed .
The Prolog language and its implementation assimilated constraint programming with so much grace , and also the concept of tabling .
It would be a great if Prolog could also embrace ASP without sacrificing its own spirit .
I consider that the most important challenge for Prolog implementors at this moment , and one which cannot be met without the help of theory ( I did n't say " theoreticians " on purpose :-)
Prolog has always been our most solid stepping stone from imperative to logic programming ( and back ) , so it is difficult to make the next step .
However , we need to move on : implementors can make it happen .
Maybe only a new generation of Prolog implementors can do it .
CIUDAD JUÁREZ , Mexico 
One sign of the desperation to end organized crime in this border town is that the good guy on the police recruitment posters is not a clean - cut youth in a smart police cap , but a menacing soldier in a black mask and helmet carrying a heavy machine gun .
The poster is the government ’s answer to a different sort of sign left in late January at the bottom of a monument honoring fallen police officers : a hand - scrawled list of 22 officers , 5 of whom had already been gunned down in the street .
The sign warned that the others would also be killed “ unless they learn . ”
In all , eight police officers have been assassinated here this year and three are missing .
Even by the Wild West standards of this dusty desert town , where drug dealers have long smuggled their cargo across the Rio Grande and the unsolved killings of women drew international attention , the last three months have been a blood bath , officials say .
A turf war among drug cartels has claimed more than 210 lives in the first three months of this year .
Many of those killed were young gunmen from out of town .
The number of homicides this year is more than twice the total number of homicides for the same period last year .
Several mass graves hiding 36 bodies in all have been discovered in the backyards of two houses owned by drug dealers .
Begin in farm country , late last summer , no particular day .
Carmi , Illinois — a town on the Little Wabash River , down in the southern tip of the state , twenty - five miles from Kentucky , population about fifty - five hundred .
A group of twelve farmers — burly white men with ruddy complexions and very short hair — sitting around a rectangle of pushed - together tables in a nondescript room , talking with their junior senator , Barack Obama .
It was long before Obama decided to run for President , and he was n’t in a rush .
He sat at one end of the tables , leaning back in his chair , his knee propped against the table edge .
He wore a tie but had removed his jacket and rolled up his shirtsleeves .
A young farmer complained about the Jones Act , a 1920 law that he felt was partly responsible for a detrimental consolidation in the barge market .
Another farmer had a question about ethanol .
“ My question first arose in my mind during the State of the Union address , ” the farmer said .
“ President Bush said I ’m all for biofuels , and then he started talking about switchgrass .
And I ’m , like , now wait a minute , we ’ve got a system where we can make ethanol out of corn .
I guess cellulosic ethanol ” — which can be made from switchgrass — “ is more efficient .
But we do n’t know how to do it , and we do n’t know if farmers are ever going to grow switchgrass , and we do n’t know if we would even want to grow switchgrass , so why so much emphasis on cellulosic ethanol ? ”
“ Well , I ’m not a scientist , ” Obama said , in a leisurely way , “ so I gotta be careful when I start getting into this stuff that I do n’t wade too deep and then ca n’t get back to shore .
Right now cellulosic ethanol is potentially eight times more energy - efficient than corn- based ethanol , because you eliminate the middle step of converting it into sugar before you convert it into ethanol .
That ’s my understanding .
I know you ’re attached to corn , but if somebody came to you and said , you know what , if you take half your fields and grow switchgrass you ’ll make the same amount of money or more , then — ”
“ Not really , ” the farmer interjected .
“ Because I had a guy come to me before wheat harvest and said do you wanna sell your straw and I said no .
I said , ‘ Do n’t even talk to me , I do n’t wanna sell my straw . ’ ”
“ Now that ’s interesting , ” Obama said .
“ Why would n’t you want to sell your straw ? ”
“ Organic matter ! ” the farmer said , triumphantly .
“ Well , but if it ’s economical to you , if it ’s a good business decision , you ’ll be interested . ”
“ If you paid me enough , ” the farmer conceded .
“ If you were paid enough .
Now , you know the economics of it better than I do .
So we ’ve got to sit down with farmers who are growing the crops and figure out what would make sense .
Because , look , I ’m not a farmer , and what you just described , I want to keep my straw because it ’s important , uh — ”
“ I thought I was the only person who had this idea , ” the farmer broke in , “ and then in FarmWeek the guest editorial he said wait a minute , he said what we ’re talking about is against everything we ’ve preached for the last twenty or thirty years , where we return organic matter to the soil . ”
“ Exactly , ” Obama said in a soothing tone .
“ And all of a sudden we ’re talking about denuding the ground — ”
“ Which we should n’t do .
And so , ” he said , returning to the topic , “ the way to think about this is not to impose ideas on farmers that are n’t gonna work , by people who do n’t farm .
But we have to create more efficient ethanol if we want to see a significant growth in the market .
The fact of the matter is that Brazilian ethanol is substantially cheaper than U.S. ethanol .
Now , George Bush wanted to go ahead and let that come in , and myself and Durbin ” — Richard Durbin , Illinois ’s senior senator — “ said no , we would continue to support the existing tariff so that we can have the development of a homegrown ethanol market .
I want to make sure that whatever is being done is utilizing the fact that we ’ve got some of the richest soil on earth and the best farmers on earth .
But the flip side is that farmers need to be engaged and not just put out a hand and say I ’m not interested because I ’m used to growing corn and beans . ”
There are three things that Democratic political candidates tend to do when talking with constituents : they display an impressive grasp of the minutiae of their constituents ’ problems , particularly money problems ; they rouse indignation by explaining how those problems are caused by powerful groups getting rich on the backs of ordinary people ; and they present well - worked - out policy proposals that , if passed , would solve the problems and put the powerful groups in their place .
Obama seldom does any of these things .
He tends to underplay his knowledge , acting less informed than he is .
He rarely accuses , preferring to talk about problems in the passive voice , as things that are amiss with us rather than as wrongs that have been perpetrated by them .
And the solutions he offers generally sound small and local rather than deep - reaching and systemic .
Take a recent forum in Las Vegas on health care .
Here are Hillary Clinton and Obama speaking about the same subject , preventive care .
“ We have to change the way we finance health care , and that ’s going to mean taking money away from people who make out really well right now , so this is going to be a big political battle , ” Clinton said .
“ The insurance companies make money by employing a lot of people to try to avoid insuring you and then , if you ’re insured , to try to avoid paying for the health care you received . ”
She stood at the front of the stage , declining an invitation to sit down next to the moderator .
She spoke energetically but composedly , conveying the impression that she had spent a great deal of time preparing for the event because it was extremely important to her .
“ A lot of insurance companies will not pay for someone who ’s pre-diabetic or been diagnosed with diabetes to go to a nutritionist to find out how better to feed themselves , or to go to a podiatrist to have their feet checked , ” she said .
“ The insurance companies will tell you this : they do n’t want to pay for preventive health care because that ’s like lost money because they ’re not sure that the patient will still be with them .
But if they ’re confronted with the doctor saying we ’re going to have to amputate the foot they ’re stuck with it .
That is upside down and backwards ! ”
Now here is Obama .
“ We ’ve got to put more money in prevention , ” he said .
“ It makes no sense for children to be going to the emergency room for treatable ailments like asthma .
Twenty per cent of our patients who have chronic illnesses account for eighty per cent of the costs , so it ’s absolutely critical that we invest in managing those with chronic illnesses like diabetes .
If we hire a case manager to work with them to insure that they ’re taking the proper treatments , then potentially we ’re not going to have to spend thirty thousand dollars on a leg amputation . ”
A young man asked about health care for minorities .
“ Obesity and diabetes in minority communities are more severe , ” Obama said , “ so I think we need targeted programs , particularly to children in those communities , to make sure that they ’ve got sound nutrition , that they have access to fruits and vegetables and not just Popeyes , and that they have decent spaces to play in instead of being cooped up in the house all day . ”

In a 2004 survey by Cornell university , almost half of the national respondents favored curtailing the civil liberties of Muslims .
40 percent of Republicans wanted American Muslims to register their whereabouts .
There are some Americans who recognize the demonization for what it is ... but we all need to look fairly at religious discrimination .
As Ali Eteraz 's article points out , even Mitt Romney , a Presidential candidate who comes from a marginalized religious background , cannot accept the idea of a Muslim in the cabinet .
Why ?
There is resistance among many Americans to the obvious truth that Muslims are a diverse group : 1.2 billion humans , living in virtually every nation on the planet cannot possibly be less diverse than , say , the registered Republicans in the USA .
When all Republicans can agree on an issue then we can ask the question again .
Meanwhile , Congressman Keith Ellison 's faith raises eyebrows ( except in his Minnesota district , that is , where he is highly regarded , ) and the suggestion that Illinois Senator Barack Obama who has attended a Christian church for decades might be a Muslim is circulated - the very fact that this can be seen as a potential way to undermine his bid for the Democrats nomination to run for the Presidency of the U.S.A. speaks volumes about the mindset of those who repeat it ( never mind those who generated the emails . )
Who is the real Barack Obama - and why in a country founded in part to insure religious freedom for its citizens should it even matter what faith he - or anyone else - practices ?
Those words are attributed to Reverend Martin Niemoeller , who had been a German U - boat commander in the first World War .
They were his explanation of why he spoke out against the Nazis .
He spent eight years in concentration camps for leading Protestant church opposition to Adolph Hitler .
The Nazis imprisoned him at Sachsenhausen in 1937 for criticizing the Third Reich .
He was freed from Dachau in 1945 by US troops .
He died at the age of 92 on March 6 , 1984 .
The very first amendment to the U.S. Constitution forbade , expressly , government interference in matters religious :
Can we , the people of the United States of America , now hold ourselves to a lower standard ?
Can we accept religious intolerance ?
If we let them come for the Muslims , if we let it happen here , now , as it did in Germany decades ago ,

Ah , my son , my son . . . .
He 's 40 years old , and really needs to change careers .
When he was 20 , he joined the Ku Klux Klan , because he was concerned that the Klan was getting too big , too aggressive .
In those days , they were lynching some poor man every week , which he felt was wrong .
He felt that the Klan should limit itself to a lynching every month , and that things were getting waaaay out of hand .
I 've spent my life arguing that the Klan should be abolished , so I had mixed feelings about his decision .
Without a doubt , I would rather the Klan lynch someone once a month rather than once a week , so I was somewhat tempted by his ' work from the inside ' approach , but I had some significant doubts that it could work .
' But dad , ' he said , those many years ago , ' I can get the word out that the Klan should only be lynching someone once a month , rather than once a week , which will be a step in the right direction , right ? '
' Well , I 'm not sure , ' I said uneasily .
' Wo n't people be getting the message that lynching is good , rather than that lynching is bad ?
You 're legitimizing the principle . '
' But I want to reduce the number of lynchings , dad ! ' he replied .
' In an ideal world , sure , there should be no lynchings at all , but I 'm going to bring that number down , which is a step in the right direction , right ?
I mean , it 's better if fewer people get lynched , right ? '
I was uneasy , because something just sort of ' seemed wrong with his approach , but I could n't put my finger on it .
For the past 20 years , my son has been notorious in the Klan .
He draws a paycheck , goes to meetings ' and has been given control over his very own district of Klan loyalists .
To his credit , whenever the Klan Council votes on whether to have a lynching , my son usually votes ' no . '
Often he 's the only one casting a negative vote .
Still , since he joined the Klan with the goal of reducing lynching , lynching has gone up and up and up .
Now , the Klan that 20 years ago only lynched a man a week is now lynching a man a day .
And my son's district ?
Has he been able to reduce the lynching in the area he has control over ?
No .
In fact , the lynching in his own district has actually gone up over the years .
When I ask him about this , his answer is always the same : ' Sure , dad , but I do n't have that much control over who gets lynched in my district .
I oppose it , of course , but there 's not a whole lot I can do . '
A few months ago , my son came over and told me he was running for Grand Wizard .
' If I become Grand Wizard , ' he said , ' I will be able to veto most of the lynchings that come up for a vote .
Then I 'll really have the power to reduce the number of people getting killed or beaten up . '
' But son ! '
I exclaimed in horror .
' People ' other than you , let 's say ' only join the Klan so they can lynch people .
If all they want to do is lynch people , why on earth would they vote you in ?
And if you somehow got in , the moment you stopped them from lynching , they 'd just toss you out !
If you stop the Klan from lynching , it 's not the Klan anymore !'
' No , ' he said earnestly , 'it 's still the Klan ' it 's just a smaller Klan that lynches less ! '
' Twenty years ago , ' I said softly , ' you said that in a perfect world , there would be no lynching at all . . . .'
' Sure , ' he said , coloring slightly .
' But I can't talk about that .
About there being no lynching at all .
I mean , that would be mad ' I 'd never get elected Grand Wizard !'
' Right , so you 're on a ' pro- lynching ' platform , you just want less lynching . '
' Yes , ' he said , nodding vigorously , immune to irony .
' So it 's wrong to lynch a lot , but it 's right to lynch a little . '
' Well , ideally , there should be no lynching at all . . . .'
' But that 's not what you 're telling people .
You 're telling people that the right thing to do is lynch less . '
' Sure ' because less lynching is better than more lynching . '
' But no lynching is better , right ? '
' Yes , in an ideal world . . . .'
' So why do n't you tell people that ?
That you want to take over the Klan in order to abolish it !'
He laughed .
' Oh , I do n't think that 's the right idea .
Right now , we need the lynchings .
We need the Klan .
It 's just gotten too big . '
Round and round we went , from pragmatism to principle , back and forth . . . .
It was most exasperating !
After a public debate where my son roused a real ruckus by openly stating that the reason that certain minorities hated whites was because of white support for the Klan that lynched them , his numbers shot up from somewhere near 0 % to around 3 % .
He came right over , ecstatic .
' I 'm really getting the message out , dad !'
I grimaced .
' Well ' I hate to say this , son , but I think you just shot yourself in the foot . '
' Wh ' what ? '
His voice hardened instantly .
' You say that minorities hate the Klan because of the lynchings , right ? '
' Right ! '
' But the number of lynchings has gone up like five or six times since you joined the Klan ' and the number of lynchings in your district has also gone up !'
' But I vote against most of the lynchings ! '
' But son !
You are in the Klan !
You support lynchings !
How can you say that the Klan is immoral ?'
' Because , as I 've said about ten thousand times over the past 20 years , dad , there 's too much lynching !'
' So you think that minorities will love you now ?
When you say they have every right to hate the lynching that you support less of ?
My God , son ' when did it happen that the best possible outcome a good man could hope for was to present himself as the lesser of two evils ? '
' Because change has to be gradual , dad ! ' he cried out .
' Has your podcasting and scribbling stopped even one lynching ?
At least I 'm out in the real world trying to get something done !'
' And what , after 20 years , have you achieved ?
You said to me , long ago , ' Dad , I 'm in this to reduce the numbers of lynchings .
And you 've been taking Klan money and hanging out with these thugs for decades , and what is the outcome ?
More lynchings .
More Klan power !
So what have you achieved ?'
He jumped up .
' Well , yeah , sure , there are more lynchings now , but can you imagine what would have happened if I had n't joined the Klan ?
Instead of just one lynching a day , there could be two or three !'
' How do you know that ?
That 's just something you tell yourself , so you do n't feel that you compromised your principles for nothing .
There 's no evidence of that !'
' I 've voted against most of the lynchings ! '
' And the lynchings happened anyway !
And still you stay with these thugs !'
Suddenly he changed tactics .
' Why do you care so much what I do ?
We 're both for less lynching , we 're both on the same side of the fence , we should n't be fighting each other . '
' But you are fighting me , ' I said softly .
' Do n't you understand that ?'
There was a long silence .
Our mutual anger was spent .
' What do you mean ? '
' Son , you think that lynching should be reformed , I think it should be abolished .
It 's like slavery . '
I sighed .
' In the 19th Century , a lot people were very uneasy about slavery .
Deep down , they knew that it was wrong .
But they also were afraid of real change .
And there were two groups : the reformers and the abolitionists .
The reformers promised people that slavery could be made more humane , that the slaves could be treated better , beaten and raped less ' and so slavery did not have to be eliminated .
They worked to pass laws against the extreme mistreatment of slaves , held rallies , raised money ' an enormous amount of time , energy and resources were wasted trying to reform slavery .
And , as they worked and worked , for decades and decades , more slaves got beaten and raped , conditions got worse and worse , and ' the worst thing in my view ' people uncomfortable with slavery were given the comforting illusion that it did not have to be abolished .
' The abolitionists , on the other hand , knew that slavery could not be reformed , that it was evil through and through , and that it had to be abolished .
And their most dangerous opponents were not those who were unabashedly pro-slavery .
Their most dangerous opponents were the reformers . '
He rolled his eyes .
' So ' you 're saying that I 'm your enemy now ? '
' No , because we 've never had this conversation .
And for that I 'm sorry .
But what you 're doing , what you 've been doing for 20 years , is telling people that the Klan can be good if only the right person is in charge .
You 're giving people false hope , because the Klan can never be good .
And so they shrink back from abolishing the Klan , because that seems extreme , because here 's this smart , well - spoken person who 's been in the Klan for 20 years , who 's saying that the Klan is good and necessary , and all we have to do is put him in charge of it .
So when I come along and say that the Klan is immoral , and needs to be abolished , you know what people say to me ?
They say , ' Nahhh , I 'm going to support your son , he has great plans to reform the Klan , I agree with a lot of what he says , there is too much lynching ' we do n't have to abolish the Klan , that 's too extreme . '
And that 's been going on for the last 20 years , son .
You 're giving people a false choice that helps them avoid the necessity of change , from confronting the evil in their midst .
And you legitimize the Klan by claiming to be a good man and being part of it .
I 'm telling you this from the bottom of my heart , son : if you did not exist , the Klan would have to invent you . '
There was a long pause .
' All right , dad , ' said my son eventually , raising his eyes to mine .
' I 'll drop my run for Grand Wizard .
On one condition . '
' Anything ! '
I cried out , overjoyed .
' You drop your support for Ron Paul . '

Memoir by former Bush aide faults the buildup to Iraq war
From the Washington Post
Copyright 2008 Los Angeles Times
WASHINGTON – Former White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan writes in a new memoir that the Iraq war was sold to the American people with a “ political propaganda campaign ” led by President Bush and aimed at “ manipulating sources of public opinion ” and “ downplaying the major reason for going to war . ”
McClellan includes the charges in a 341 - page book , “ What Happened : Inside the Bush White House and Washington ’s Culture of Deception , ” that delivers a harsh look at the White House and the man he served for close to a decade .
He describes Bush as demonstrating a “ lack of inquisitiveness .
“ McClellan has harsh words for many of his former colleagues .
He accuses former White House advisor Karl Rove of misleading him about his role in the CIA leak case .
He describes Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice as being deft at deflecting blame .
He calls Vice President Dick Cheney “ the magic man ” who steered policy behind the scenes .
McClellan , who resigned in April 2006 , stops short of saying Bush purposely lied about his reasons for invading Iraq , writing that he and his subordinates were not “ employing out - and - out deception . ”
But in a chapter titled “ Selling the War , ” he alleges that the administration repeatedly shaded the truth and that Bush “ managed the crisis in a way that almost guaranteed that the use of force would become the only feasible option . ”
McClellan , once a staunch defender of the war , comes to a stark conclusion : “ What I do know is that war should only be waged when necessary , and the Iraq war was not necessary . ”
McClellan ’s criticisms are striking , given that they come from a man who followed Bush to Washington .
The White House declined to comment .
McClellan also has kind words for Bush , calling him “ a man of personal charm , wit and enormous political skill . ”

Former press secretary ’s book bashes Bush

WASHINGTON ( AP ) – Former White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan writes in a new memoir that President Bush relied on an aggressive “ political propaganda campaign ” instead of the truth to sell the Iraq war , it has been reported .
The Bush White House made “ a decision to turn away from candor and honesty when those qualities were most needed ” – a time when the nation was on the brink of war , McClellan writes in the book entitled “ What Happened : Inside the Bush White House and Washington ’s Culture of Deception . ”
The way Bush managed the Iraq issue “ almost guaranteed that the use of force would become the only feasible option , ” the book contends , according to accounts Wednesday in The New York Times and Washington Post .
“ In the permanent campaign era , it was all about manipulating sources of public opinion to the president ’s advantage , ” McClellan writes .
White House aides seemed stunned by the scathing tone of the book , and Bush press secretary Dana Perino issued a statement that was highly critical of their former colleague .
“ Scott , we now know , is disgruntled about his experience at the White House , ” she said .
“ For those of us who fully supported him , before , during and after he was press secretary , we are puzzled .
It is sad – this is not the Scott we knew . ”
Perino said the reports on the book had been described to Bush , and that she did not expect him to comment .
“ He has more pressing matters than to spend time commenting on books by former staffers , ” she said .
McClellan called the Iraq war a “ serious strategic blunder , ” a surprisingly harsh assessment from the man who was at that time the loyal public voice of the White House .
“ The Iraq war was not necessary , ” he concludes .
McClellan admits that some of his own words from the podium in the White House briefing room turned out to be “ badly misguided . ”
But he says he was sincere at the time .
“ I fell far short of living up to the kind of public servant I wanted to be , ” McClellan writes .
He also blames the media whose questions he fielded , calling them “ complicit enablers ” in the White House campaign to manipulate public opinion toward the need for war .
The book is scheduled to go on sale June 1 .
Quotes from the book were reported Tuesday night by the Web site Politico , which said it found McClellan ’s memoir on sale early at a bookstore .
McClellan draws a portrait of his former boss as smart , charming and politically skilled , but unwilling to admit mistakes and susceptible to his own spin .
Bush “ convinces himself to believe what suits his needs at the moment , ” McClellan writes .
He also faults Bush for a “ lack of inquisitiveness . ”

One wonders what Ms. Perino will be writing about her time inside the White House once her term as press secretary ends and she learns that nobody wants to hire a paid liar with no conscience , the bills are coming due , and a lucrative book contract is in the offing if she has anything really noteworthy to write about …
Donna Norton , Sonoma County PDA —
On January 25th , I had a telephone conversation ( 40 mins + ) with a legislative assistant in Conyers ’ office regarding impeachment .
He had obviously been well - instructed on how to express their current policy .
Our conversation included both Bush and Cheney , and took some strange turns , but this is basically the stand they ’re taking :
Impeachment ’s not necessary .
The next election will take care of EVERYTHING .
Just ELECT DEMOCRATS .
( This chorus was repeated throughout our discussion . )
A sitting President is not subject to court actions .
Nothing in the Constitution says a President is subject to the law .
He finally conceded this remains an “ unsettle ” question in the courts .
( I insisted on documentation to support his statements , and he emailed me a Congressional report , 1978 “ CRS Report for Congress ” # 98 - 186 A , on impeachment , about 30 pgs. )
Congress does not have an OBLIGATION or duty to investigate or take any action to prevent a President from breaking the law or abusing his powers .
It ’s totally up to THEIR DISCRETION .
It ’s okay for their decision to be based on party politics rather than Constitutional considerations because the decision is solely theirs to make .
The courts can follow up with any illegal acts of the President or Vice - President AFTER they ’re out of office , and all will be fine .
Correcting power - abuse really has no meaning because power is what it ’s all about .
They all abuse it .
So what ?
It ’s just politics .
We both agreed that according to what he was telling me , it boils down to the following :
A sitting President is not subject to the law as long as he remains in office .
He can CONTINUE to break laws as long as he remains in office .
He can only be removed DURING his term of office ( and therefore become subject to the law ) through impeachment .
Only Congress can impeach , and it ’s solely up to their DISCRETION .
So , as long as Congress successfully blocks the impeachment process , they are willfully allowing the President to remain completely outside the law , condoning that principle , and , in effect , shielding him from being removed from office so that he will be subject to the law and can be prosecuted .
Congress has no OBLIGATION to intervene .
The aide seemed not the least bit disturbed by the gravity or import of my conclusions .
It is , after all , just politics .
And , by the way , electing Democrats to office will take care of everything ( just in case I forgot to mention that ) .
According to Wikipedia , caching is a method of storing a collection of data for which the time it takes to compute said data is longer than the time it takes to retrieve from the cache .
Also , the concept of caching was invented by Mr. T. I suspect that last part may have been added by Wikipedia vandals , though ...
One of Eli A.'s predecessors took Mr. T.'s concept and ran with it .
He cached everything he could get his hands on — configuration values , event dates , phone numbers , everything .
Why tax the hardware with an expensive lookup when everything 's right at your fingertips in a giant , hideous blob of a cache ?
Eli's predecessor 's tenure did n't last terribly long ; he left ( or was fired , maybe ) after a couple of months of adding caching to virtually every aspect of the application .
One of his last changes was adding a singleton to store the current year :
public class CommonVars { private final static CommonVars instance = new CommonVars ( ) ; public static CommonVars getInstance ( ) { return instance ; } private CommonVars ( ) { currentYear = Calendar.getInstance().get ( Calendar.YEAR ) ; } ... public int getCurrentYear ( ) { return currentYear ; } ... }
With this , Eli's predecessor was able to avoid the taxing the system with a date lookup .
He missed out on some of the fun that this change caused later , though , since he had n't stayed long enough for the year to roll over .
Every January 1 , a user would report some weird problems in the system recording dates in the wrong year .
The complaints came from a different user each year , because for some reason users never stuck around for more than a few months .
And every year , the poor guy would take several hours tracking down someone in IT to explain the problem and have them reboot the server , then the value would be re-initialized whenever the fist new user session started .
Oh well , just 244 days until the next reboot ...
Keyword Space
Cubit is a scalable peer - to - peer system that can efficiently find theclosest data items to any search key .
The central insight behind Cubit is to create a keyword metric space that captures the relative similarity of keywords , to assign portions of this space to nodes in a light - weight overlay and to resolve queries by efficiently routing them through this space .
The system comprises a protocol for object and node assignment , a gossip - based protocol for maintaining the overlay , and a routing protocol to efficiently route queries .
Figure 1 : The edit - distance between keywords .
The five keywords create a keyword space that cannot be accurately embedded into a plane .
is any word that appears in the title of an object stored in Cubit .
In order to fully specify the problem of approximate string matching , we need to choose a notion of distance between two keywords , or more generally between two text strings .
Such distance should correspond to our intuition on which strings are similar and which strings are very different .
Cubit uses the most common notion of distance on strings , the edit - distance .
It is equal to the minimum number of insertions , deletions and substitutions needed to transform one string to another .
The keywords then lie in the keyword space , illustrated in Figure 1 , a metric space induced on keywords by the edit - distance .
Node ID Assignment
Cubit nodes are distributed in the same space as keywords .
Each node in Cubit is assigned a unique string ID chosen from the set of keywords associated with previously inserted objects in the system .
Specifically , at join time each node independently selects a random keyword , ensuring uniqueness by detecting ID collisions .
The ID of a node determines its " position " in the keyword space .
This position determines how a given node is used in Cubit .
First , each Cubit node is responsible for storing the set of keywords for which it is the closest node .
Second , Cubit implements a distributed protocol which navigates through nodes in the keyword space , gradually zooming in on a neighborhood of a given ( possibly misspelled ) keyword , and thus locates nodes that store possible matches .
Navigation
Figure 2 : In this example , the solid circles represent peers in node A's peer - set , the empty circles represent other peers , and the squares represent object keywords in the system .
The shaded region depicts the sub - space that is closer to A than any other node .
The navigation protocol is the core component of Cubit .
To support this protocol , Cubit creates and maintains a multi-resolution overlay network on nodes such that each node has several peers at every distance from itself ; the peers at a given distance are chosen to maximize the coverage of that region .
This is illustrated in Figure 2 .
Such overlay design is inspired by the small - world construction in which a grid is augmented by a sparse set of randomly chosen edges , with roughly the same number of edges for each distance scale .
In the resulting graph a simple greedy routing algorithm ( which on each step minimizes the distance to target ) succeeds in finding short routes to any given target .
The desired property of the search protocol is to obtain the k closest objects to the set of keywords , as measured by the phrase distance metric .
For each keyword in the search phrase , the protocol obtains the k closest objects from each node which meets the following edit distance criterion : its ID is within an edit - distance of q from the keyword , where q is the product of the keyword length and the expected number of perturbations per character ( which is a parameter in the system ) .
The protocol selects m closest nodes if fewer than m nodes meet edit - distance criterion , where m is called the search fan - out .
The keyword search protocol is illustrated in Figure 3 .
Figure 3 : The Cubit search protocol operates iteratively to collect more and more information of the target region .
In this example , x is the location of the search term in the keyword space , the solid circles are node A's peers , empty circles are additional nodes in the space , and the circle around x are all nodes within edit - distance q of x .
Node A first finds the m = 2 closest nodes to x from its peer - set , and request their m closest nodes .
In this example , two new closer nodes are discovered and subsequently sent the same query .
The protocol terminates when all nodes within the circle around x , or the m closest nodes have been discovered .
These nodes are queried for their closest objects to x .
Load Balancing
Figure 4 : In this example , the keyword " love " is closest to node A and is generating a high degree of load .
Node A creates a virtual node centered around the keyword love , which includes its leaf set and all objects in the region within p edit - distance from love .
This virtual node is sent to A 's nearest neighbors .
Queries that arrive at these neighbors for keywords within an edit - distance p of love can be answered without node A .
Since search terms tend to follow a Zipf distribution , the resulting skewed load distribution can lead to excess routing load on nodes within the vicinity of popular keywords .
In Cubit , if the load generated by queries for a popular keyword w overwhelms the available resources of node i , the node can send an off - loading request to its closest neighbors requesting them to create a synthetic node located at w .
Nodes receiving such a request create a synthetic node at w whose IP address and port correspond to their own , thus enabling queries for that portion of the keyword space to be terminated at any one of the moff neighbors .
The original requester is then tasked with keeping the virtual nodes updated with changes to objects in the off - loaded region as well as changes to its leaf - set .
This off - loading operation disperses hot - spots in keyword popularity without requiring global information or coordination .
Figure 4 illustrates the protocol .
I just found out about Google 's Treasure Hunt Challenge .
They say that " it 's a puzzle contest designed to test yer problem - solving skills in computer science , networking , and low - level UNIX trivia . "
Apparently I have missed the first three puzzles ( first , second and third ) but I 'll give the fourth puzzle a shot .
The fourth problem is about prime numbers and it's formulated as following :
Find the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of 7 consecutive prime numbers , the sum of 17 consecutive prime numbers , the sum of 41 consecutive prime numbers , the sum of 541 consecutive prime numbers , and is itself a prime number .
For example , 41 is the smallest prime number that can be expressed as the sum of 3 consecutive primes ( 11 + 13 + 17 = 41 ) and the sum of 6 consecutive primes ( 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 = 41 ) .
The Solution
Here 's how I approached and solved this problem .
I had no desire to generate lists of prime numbers myself as it's been done thousands of times already .
I did n't even want to copy any existing prime generating code .
I decided to just use a publicly available list of prime numbers .
Here is a list of first fifty million primes that I found .
Next , I used my Unix - fu to find the solution .
I noticed that the primes are zipped and split into chunks of million primes per file .
The file names were like " primes1.zip " , ... " primes50.zip " .
A quick loop from 1 to 50 and wget got all these files to my hard drive :
$ for i in $ ( seq 50 ) ; do wget " http://primes.utm.edu/lists/small/millions/primes$i.zip " ; done
Next , I unzip 'ped all these files , and removed those zips to save disk space :
$ for i in $ ( seq 50 ) ; do unzip " primes$i.zip " && rm -f " primes$i.zip " ; done
After doing that and looking at what I got , I realized that they were in some strange format , 8 primes per line , space padded and with some text on the first two lines .
Here is an example of how the first five lines in primes1. txt file looked like :
The First 1,000,000 Primes ( from primes.utm.edu ) 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71 73 79 83 89
This is not great .
I wanted all my primes to be in one file and one prime per line so I could extract N - th prime by looking at N - th line .
I used the following command to merge all the files into a single file :
for i in $ ( seq 50 ) ; do ( awk ' BEGIN { OFS = "
" } NR > 2 { print $ 1, $ 2, $ 3, $ 4, $ 5, $ 6,$ 7,$ 8} ' primes$i.txt >> primes.txt ) && rm -f primes $i.txt ; done
A quick verification that I did n't lose any primes :
$ wc -l primes .
txt 50000000 primes.txt
Now I created four files which contain sums of 7 , 17 , 41 and 541 consecutive primes , not exceeding the biggest prime in primes .
txt file .
I did that with the following AWK one - liner :
$ last =$ ( tail - 1 primes.txt ) $ for N in 7 17 41 541 do awk ' BEGIN { prev [ 0 ] = 0 } NR < ' $ N ' { prev [ NR ] = $ 1 ; sum += $ 1 } NR >= ' $ N' { psum += prev[ NR - '$ N ' ] ; delete prev[ NR - '$ N ' ] ; prev[ NR ] = $ 1 ; sum += $ 1 ; if ( sum - psum > ' $ last ' ) { exit } printf " %d
" , sum - psum }' primes .
txt > primes $ N.txt done
The command created primes7.txt , primes 17.txt , primes 41.txt and primes 541.txt files .
These files contained sums of prime numbers but only some of them were primes .
The solution , if it existed in the given data set , was the intersect of all these files .
If there were multiple items in the intersect , the smallest should be chosen and checked if it really was a prime .
$ sort - nm primes 541.txt primes 41.txt | uniq -d | sort - nm primes 17. txt - | uniq -d | sort - nm primes7.txt - | uniq -d 7830239 $ grep -m1 7830239 primes.txt 7830239
And I found the solution !
It was 7830239 .
I submitted the answer and after a few minutes it was confirmed to be correct .
Your question : [ 7 , 17 , 41 , 541 ]
Your answer : 7830239 Time received : 2008-06-06 23:33:26.268414 UTC
Correct answer : 7830239
Your answer was : Correct
Awesome !
Now tell me how you solved this problem .
They 're mad as hell , and Hillary Clinton 's supporters are n't going to take it anymore .
Some Clintonites are so mad about Barack Obama 's Tuesday victory that they 've launched a web site to build support to launch a lobbying group to support Republican John McCain .
" We 're going to run campaign ads to defeat Obama , " says Ed Hale , a 63 - year - old rancher and a Clinton supporter from Wellington , Texas .
" We have doctors , lawyers , CPAs , the blue bloods , and then we have rednecks like me .
It 's a very diversified organization . "
The apparent peeling off of a portion of Clinton 's supporters from the Democratic party illustrates the difficult task party officials now face in rallying the troops behind Obama .
Open dissent within party ranks provides Republicans with openings to exploit .
Hale launched the " Hillary Clinton Supporters for John McCain " group last
Saturday .
The campaign claims to have 5,000 supporters , and its website visitor counter says that it has already attracted 37,807 visitors .
" Last night , when they crowned Obama king , that 's when I sent my e-mails out to people , and since then , we 've gotten thousands of hits , " he says .
Hale , a Vietnam veteran and a long - time Democrat , says that many of the group 's supporters are Reagan
Democrats , and their primary concern is foreign policy and defense .
A call to the Texas Democratic Party confirmed that he was supposed to have been a delegate to the state convention this week .
He says that he would n't vote for Obama even if Clinton were vice president .
In addition , he says that he will not sign an online petition that former Clinton White
House special counsel Lanny Davis sent out on the web Tuesday night – calling for Obama to choose Clinton as vice president .
Former Clinton White House Special Counsel Lanny Davis has launched an online petition calling on Obama to choose Clinton for VP .
Photo : Associated Press / Manuel Balce CenetaRickie Banning , president of " Hillary Clinton Supporters Count Too , " a website , says that she 's received hundreds of e-mails from Clinton supporters who are angry at the Democratic National Committee , and who are registering as independent .
Some of them say that they will vote for John McCain .
A sampling of the e-mails that she sent along show that many of the supporters feel cheated .
" If you ask me , I feel sad in my heart , and I think a lot of people do , but some people are really angry , " Banning says .
" People feel upset , and not listened to , and a lot of people feel like they 're being thrown under the bus .
"
Statistics compiled by Real Clear Politics show that in terms of the popular vote ,
Democratic voters split evenly between Clinton and Obama , though Obama reached the delegate count necessary to win the nomination on Tuesday .
For its part , the Republican National Committee is capitalizing on Democratic party leaders ' criticisms of Obama in a new web video posted to its site Wednesday .
And Matt Burns , a spokesman for the Republican National Convention , says that he 's received voice mail from Clinton supporters offering to help him .
He says he sent them to McCain 's website .
__Update : __To be clear , Hale built the Hillary Clinton Supporters Count Too web site before launching the McCain site , which is a separate effort .
In an interview , Banning said that she 's now the primary person running the Hillary Clinton Supporters Count Too site .
DIGG THIS
Perhaps you saw the photo .
It showed Barack Obama with a group of his supporters holding signs bearing the word " change . "
And news analysts informed us that one reason the Clinton campaign faltered ( they apparently do n’t consider the possibility that the people simply did n’t want her ) was that she underestimated the public ’s desire for " change . "
I doubt it .
In the first place , the last thing any establishment - approved politician would desire is change .
In the second , if the people actually wanted change , they could have picked Ron Paul , who would bring about real , not simply rhetorical , change .
For instance , what " change " has Obama proposed , which would not be likely to occur under a Clinton presidency ?
Can his supporters actually cite specific significant changes that he would effect when elected ?
Would he , for example , abolish the Federal Reserve ?
Would he " privatize " social security ?
Would he , in contrast to Clinton ’s proposal to broaden Medicare , recommend its abolition ?
Would he do away with myriad alphabet agencies ?
Of course not .
Neither would she .
Moreover , the idea that the people can bring about some change in government by voting is mistaken , if not downright false .
Is it reasonable to believe that the largest corporation in the country , if not the world , is going to put its leadership positions up for grabs every few years ?
I realize that the shareholders of corporations are occasionally asked to vote for members of the board of directors , but in my ( admittedly very limited ) experience , the candidates are simply shown to us , with a brief biographical note .
I ca n’t recall any instance of a candidate indicating what , if anything , he was going to change if elected .
And if a newly elected CEO were to take the company in a direction that shareholders disliked , they could sell their shares .
If the President takes the country in a direction that I dislike , can I sell my shares ?
And , of course , I became a shareholder ( in the " private sector " ) in the first place voluntarily , and can dispose of my shares at any time .
If I vote for a candidate who promises change , but fails to provide it , can I call for a vote to oust him ?
If , once in office , he lies to us , and makes us think the situation vis–vis the corporation is rosier than it actually is , can we indict him , la Enron ?
The only change we can expect from any new president is a continuation , perhaps at an accelerated rate , toward totalitarianism .
The people who make changes in government policy and basic philosophy are behind the scenes .
We are treated ( if that ’s the word ) to the spectacle of political campaigns as part of a psychological exercise whose purpose is to provide the illusion of choice .
This culminates in an election in which people pick a president , senator , etc .
But the outcome is unimportant , in almost all cases , because any of the candidates is acceptable to the government ’s owners and operators .
If people want change , let them stay home on election day .
The outcome will be no different , but the rulers might get the message that people no longer want to participate in the charade of voting .
Perhaps — and would n’t this be wonderful !! — they might even get the idea that the people have become fed up with the very concept of government !

In a new study , scientists question the sustainability of nuclear power because of anticipated declines in high - grade uranium ore .
Above is Australia 's Ranger uranium mill .
Credit : Gavin M. Mudd
Rising energy and environmental costs may prevent nuclear power from being a sustainable alternative energy source in the fight against global warming , according to a study in the April 1 issue of ACS ’ Environmental Science & Technology .
In the article , Gavin M. Mudd and Mark Diesendorf investigate the “ eco-efficiency ” of mining and milling uranium for use as fuel in nuclear power plants .
Advocates of nuclear power claim it has the potential to mitigate global warming .
Detractors , however , link it to dangers such as proliferation of nuclear weapons and problems such as permanent disposal of nuclear waste .
The study points out that supplies of high - grade uranium ore are declining , which may boost nuclear fuel 's environmental and economic costs , including increases in energy use , water consumption and greenhouse gas emissions .
In addition , newly discovered uranium deposits may be more difficult to extract in the future — a further drain on economic and environmental resources .
“ The extent of economically recoverable uranium , although somewhat uncertain , is clearly linked to exploration effort , technology and economics but is inextricably linked to environmental costs , such as energy , water , and chemicals consumption , greenhouse gas emissions and broader social issues , ” the authors say .
“ These issues are critical to understand in the current debate over nuclear power , greenhouse gas emissions , and climate change , especially with respect to ascribing sustainability to such activities as uranium milling and mining . ”

Some U.S. military personnel appears to have launched an initiative to covert thousands of Iraqi citizens to Christianity by distributing Bibles and other fundamentalist Christian literature translated into Arabic to Iraqi Muslims .
A recent article published on the website of Mission Network News reported that Bible Pathway Ministries , a fundamentalist Christian organization , has provided thousands of a special military edition of its Daily Devotional Bible study book to members of the 101st Airborne Division of Fort Campbell , Kentucky , currently stationed in Iraq , the project “ came into being when a chaplain in Iraq ( who has since finished his tour ) requested some books from Bible Pathway Ministries ( BPM ) . ”
“ The resulting product is a 6 ″ x9 ″ 496 - page illustrated book with embossed cover containing 366 daily devotional commentaries , maps , charts , and additional helpful information , ” the Mission Network News report says .
Chief Warrant Officer Rene Llanos of the 101st Airborne told Mission Network News , “ the soldiers who are patrolling and walking the streets are taking along this copy , and they ’re using it to minister to the local residents . ”
“ Our division is also getting ready to head toward Afghanistan , so there will be copies heading out with the soldiers , ” Llanos said .
“ We need to pray for protection for our soldiers as they patrol and pray that God would continue to open doors .
The soldiers are being placed in strategic places with a purpose .
They ’re continuing to spread the Word . ”
Karen Hawkins , a BPM official , said military chaplains “ were trying to encourage [ soldiers ] to be in the Word everyday because they ’re in a very dangerous situation , and they need that protection . ”
That would appear to violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment prohibiting government officials , including military personnel , from using the machinery of the state to promote any form of religion .
The book ’s cover includes the logos of the five branches of the armed forces giving the impression that it ’s a publication sanctioned by the Pentagon .
The distribution of the Bibles and Christian literature comes on the heels of a report published Wednesday by McClatchy Newspapers stating that U.S. Marines guarding the entrance to the city of Fallujah have been handing out “ witnessing coins ” to Sunni Muslims entering the city that read in Arabic on one side : “ Where will you spend eternity ? ” and “ For God so loved the world , that He gave His only begotten Son , that whoever believes in Him shall not perish , but have eternal life .
John 3:16 ” on the other .
A Pentagon spokesman said he was unaware of the issue involving the distribution of coins and Bibles and declined to comment .
The issue comes at a particularly sensitive time for Sunnis who recently clashed with U.S. military in an area west of Baghdad week after an American soldier was found to have used a Koran , the Islamic holy book , for target practice .
Following a daylong protest by Iraqis that threatened to turn violent , Maj. Gen. Jeffery Hammond issued a public apology to Sunnis in the area .
“ I come before you here seeking your forgiveness , ” Hammond said .
“ In the most humble manner I look in your eyes today and I say please forgive me and my soldiers . ”
The soldier who shot up the Koran was disciplined and removed from duty in Iraq .
Mikey Weinstein , founder and president of the government watchdog agency The Military Religious Freedom Foundation ( MRFF ) , said the religious intolerance among U.S. military personnel calls for a federal investigation .
“ The shocking actions revealed just last week of American soldiers in the combat zones of Iraq and Afghanistan callously using the Koran for automatic weapons “ target practice ” is absolutely connected to the same issues of national security breach wrought by our United States armed forces proselytizing the local populations via the distribution to them of fundamentalist Christian coins , bibles , tracts , comics and related religious materials written in Arabic , ” Weistein said .
“ The Military Religious Freedom Foundation has been acutely aware of such astonishing unconstitutional and illicit proselytizing in Iraq and Afghanistan for over three years now and knows how massively pervasive it really is .
These proselytizing transgressions are all blatant violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice ( UCMJ ) and MRFF is now demanding that any and all responsible military personnel be immediately prosecuted under Failure to Obey an Order or Regulation , ” Weinstein added .
Members of the U.S. military first started actively proselytizing Iraqi Muslims soon after the U.S. invaded Iraq in March 2003 .
In a newsletter published in 2004 by the fundamentalist group International Ministerial Fellowship ( IMF ) , Capt .
Steve Mickel , an Army chaplain , claimed that Iraqis were eager to be converted to Christianity and that he personally tried to convert dozens of Iraqis , which is also an apparent constitutional violation .
“ I am able to give them tracts on how to be saved , printed in Arabic , ” Mickel said , according to a copy of the IMF newsletter .
“ I wish I had enough Arabic Bibles to give them as well .
The issue of mailing Arabic Bibles into Iraq from the U.S. is difficult ( given the current postal regulations prohibiting all religious materials contrary to Islam except for personal use of the soldiers ) .
But the hunger for the Word of God in Iraq is very great , as I have witnessed first - hand . ”
Mickel evangelized Iraqis while delivering leftover food to local residents from his unit ’s mess hall .
He handed out Bibles translated into Arabic in the village of Ad Dawr , a predominantly Sunni territory where Saddam Hussein was captured .
“ Such fundamentalist Christian proselytizing DIRECTLY violates General Order 1A , Part 2 , Section J issued by General Tommy Franks on behalf of the United States Central Command ( USCENTCOM ) back in December of 2000 which strictly prohibits “ proselytizing of any religion , faith or practice , ” said Weinstein , a former Reagan administration White House counsel and former Air Force Judge Advocate General ( JAG ) .
In addition to coins and Bibles , there have been reports of the distribution to Iraqi children of Christian comic books published by companies such as Chick Publications .
These inflammatory comic books , published in English and Arabic , not only depict Mohammed , but show both Mohammed and Muslims burning in hell because they did not accept Jesus as their savior before they died
Chick Publications states on its website that its literature “ is desperately needed by Muslims , but getting it to them without endangering our soldiers or enflaming the Muslim leadership will not be easy . ”
Postal regulations prohibit sending bulk religious materials contrary to Islam into Iraq , but allow religious materials to be sent to an individual soldier for their personal use .
Sending more of these materials than would be necessary for an individual ’s personal use , but not a large enough quantity to risk being flagged by the postal service , is one way that these materials are making their way into Iraq .
Chick Publications advises those wanting to send their literature to military personnel to first find out “ just what tracts would be most useful and how many they can effectively use , ” and “ to find out whether the tracts can be drop shipped from Chick Publications or if they should be sent as personal mail from the soldiers ’ families . ”
A spokesman for Chick refused to comment for this story about the comics handed out to Iraqis .
Meanwhile , members of the 101st Airborne stationed in Iraq will continue their work evangelizing Iraqis unless it is told otherwise .
Llanos , the division ’s chief warrant officer , said about 2,000 copies of the military edition of the Bible provided to the 101st Airborne will soon be distributed to Iraqis .
However , reports on the Bible Pathway Ministries website up to 30,000 of the Christian books have been distributed to military personnel , some of which will presumably end up in the hands of Iraqis .
Turmeric , an Asian spice found in many curries , has a long history of use in reducing inflammation , healing wounds and relieving pain , but can it prevent diabetes ?
Since inflammation plays a big role in many diseases and is believed to be involved in onset of both obesity and Type 2 diabetes , Drew Tortoriello , M.D. , an endocrinologist and research scientist at the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center at Columbia University Medical Center , and his colleagues were curious what effect the herb might have on diabetic mice .
Dr. Tortoriello , working with pediatric resident Stuart Weisberg , M.D. , Ph.D. , and Rudolph Leibel , M.D. , fellow endocrinologist and the co-director of the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center , discovered that turmeric - treated mice were less susceptible to developing Type 2 diabetes , based on their blood glucose levels , and glucose and insulin tolerance tests .
They also discovered that turmeric - fed obese mice showed significantly reduced inflammation in fat tissue and liver compared to controls .
They speculate that curcumin , the anti-inflammatory , anti-oxidant ingredient in turmeric , lessens insulin resistance and prevents
Type 2 diabetes in these mouse models by dampening the inflammatory response provoked by obesity .
Their findings are the subject of a soon - to - be published paper in Endocrinology and were presented at ENDO 2008 , the Endocrine Society ’s annual meeting in San Francisco this week .
Turmeric ( Curcuma longa ) has no known dose - limiting toxicities in doses of up to at least 12 grams daily in humans .
The researchers tested high - doses of a dietary curcumin in two distinct mouse models of obesity and Type 2 diabetes : high - fat - diet - fed male mice and leptin - deficient obese female mice , with lean wild - type mice that were fed low - fat diets used as controls .
The inflammation associated with obesity was shown several years ago by researchers in the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center to be due in part to the presence of immune cells called macrophages in fat tissues throughout the body .
These cells produce “ cytokine ” molecules that can cause inflammation in organs such as the heart , and islets of the pancreas , while also increasing insulin resistance in muscle and liver .
Researchers hypothesized that by suppressing the number and activity of these cells , with turmeric or a drug with similar actions , it may be possible to reduce some of the adverse consequences of obesity .
Curcumin administration was also associated with a small but significant decline in body weight and fat content , despite level or higher calorie consumption , suggesting that curcumin beneficially influences body composition .
“ It ’s too early to tell whether increasing dietary curcumin [ through turmeric ] intake in obese people with diabetes will show a similar benefit , ” Dr. Tortoriello said .
“ Although the daily intake of curcumin one might have to consume as a primary diabetes treatment is likely impractical , it is entirely possible that lower dosages of curcumin could nicely complement our traditional therapies as a natural and safe treatment . ”
For now , the conclusion that Dr. Tortoriello and his colleagues have reached is that turmeric – and its active anti-oxidant ingredient , curcumin – reverses many of the inflammatory and metabolic problems associated with obesity and improves blood - sugar control in mouse models of Type 2 diabetes .
In addition to exploring novel methods of curcumin administration to increase its absorption , they are also interested in identifying novel anti-inflammatory processes invoked by curcumin and in adapting those processes in the development of more potent curcumin analogues .
The two reports were the final parts of the committee ’s so - called “ phase two ” investigation of prewar intelligence on Iraq and related issues .
The first phase of the inquiry , begun in the summer of 2003 and completed in July 2004 , identified grave faults in the Central Intelligence Agency ’s analysis of the threat posed by Mr. Hussein .
The report was especially critical of statements by Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney that linked Iraq to Al Qaeda and raised the possibility that Mr. Hussein might supply the terrorist group with weapons of mass destruction .
“ Representing to the American people that the two had an operational partnership and posed a single , indistinguishable threat was fundamentally misleading and led the nation to war on false premises , ” Mr. Rockefeller wrote .
Mr. Bond and four other Republicans on the committee sharply dissented from the report ’s findings and suggested the investigation was a partisan smokescreen to obscure the real story : that Central Intelligence Agency failed the Bush administration by delivering intelligence assessments to policymakers that have since been discredited .
In a detailed minority report , four of those Republicans accused Democrats of hypocrisy and their own campaign of cherry - picking  namely , refusing to include misleading public statements by such top Democrats as Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Mr. Rockefeller .
As an example , they pointed to an October 2002 speech by Mr. Rockefeller , who declared to his Senate colleagues that he had arrived at the “ inescapable conclusion that the threat posed to America by Saddam ’s weapons of mass destruction is so serious that despite the risks , and we should not minimize the risks , we must authorize the president to take the necessary steps to deal with the threat . ”
The report about the Bush administration ’s public statements does shed some new detail about the intelligence information available to policymakers as they built a case for war .
In September 2002 , for instance , Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld told the Senate Armed Services Committee that “ the Iraq problem cannot be solved by airstrikes alone ” because Iraqi chemical and biological weapons were so deeply buried that they could not be penetrated by American bombs .
Two months later , however , the National Intelligence Council wrote an assessment for Mr. Rumsfeld concluding that the Iraqi underground weapons facilities identified by the intelligence agencies “ are vulnerable to conventional , precision - guided , penetrating munitions because they are not deeply buried . ”
On Thursday , Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon , a Democratic member of the Intelligence Committee , said Congress was never told about the National Intelligence Council assessment .
These guys have gone deep into old Soviet uranium mines .
In these mines Russian prisoners have dug for radioactive materials for the Soviet Army .
As you can see on the top picture the Geiger counter shows that there is still some radioactive pollution .
This is a very interesting battle :
The Bush administration on Friday urged a federal appeals court to stop meatpackers from testing all their animals for mad cow disease , but a skeptical judge questioned whether the government has that authority .
The government seeks to reverse a lower court ruling that allowed Kansas - based Creekstone Farms Premium Beef to conduct more comprehensive testing to satisfy demand from overseas customers in Japan and elsewhere .
But Creekstone attorney Russell Frye contended the Agriculture Department 's regulations covering the treatment of domestic animals contain no prohibition against an individual company testing for mad cow disease , since the test is conducted only after a cow is slaughtered .
He said the agency has no authority to prevent companies from using the test to reassure customers .
Larger meatpackers have opposed Creekstone 's push to allow wider testing out of fear that consumer pressure would force them to begin testing all animals too .
Increased testing would raise the price of meat by a few cents per pound .... read on
How to Deconstruct Almost Anything -- My Postmodern Adventure
Chip Morningstar , Electric Communities
" Academics get paid for being clever , not for being right . " -- Donald Norman
This is the story of one computer professional 's explorations in the world of postmodern literary criticism .
I 'm a working software engineer , not a student nor an academic nor a person with any real background in the humanities .
Consequently , I 've approached the whole subject with a somewhat different frame of mind than perhaps people in the field are accustomed to .
Being a vulgar engineer I 'm allowed to break a lot of the rules that people in the humanities usually have to play by , since nobody expects an engineer to be literate .
Ha.
Anyway , here is my tale .
It started when my colleague Randy Farmer and I presented a paper at the Second International Conference on Cyberspace , held in Santa Cruz , California in April , 1991 .
Like the first conference , at which we also presented a paper , it was an aggressively interdisciplinary gathering , drawing from fields as diverse as computer science , literary criticism , engineering , history , philosophy , anthropology , psychology , and political science .
About the only relevant field that seemed to lack strong representation was economics ( an important gap but one which we do n't have room to get into here ) .
It was in turn stimulating , aggravating , fascinating and infuriating , a breathtaking intellectual roller coaster ride unlike anything else I 've recently encountered in my professional life .
My last serious brush with the humanities in an academic context had been in college , ten years earlier .
The humanities appear to have experienced a considerable amount of evolution ( or perhaps more accurately , genetic drift ) since then .
Randy and I were scheduled to speak on the second day of the conference .
This was fortunate because it gave us the opportunity to recalibrate our presentation based on the first day 's proceedings , during which we discovered that we had grossly mischaracterized the audience by assuming that it would be like the crowd from the first conference .
I spent most of that first day furiously scribbling notes .
People kept saying the most remarkable things using the most remarkable language , which I found I needed to put down in writing because the words would disappear from my brain within seconds if I did n't .
Are you familiar with the experience of having memories of your dreams fade within a few minutes of waking ?
It was like that , and I think for much the same reason .
Dreams have a logic and structure all their own , falling apart into unmemorable pieces that make no sense when subjected to the scrutiny of the conscious mind .
So it was with many of the academics who got up to speak .
The things they said were largely incomprehensible .
There was much talk about deconstruction and signifiers and arguments about whether cyberspace was or was not " narrative " .
There was much quotation from Baudrillard , Derrida , Lacan , Lyotard , Saussure , and the like , every single word of which was impenetrable .
I 'd never before had the experience of being quite this baffled by things other people were saying .
I 've attended lectures on quantum physics , group theory , cardiology , and contract law , all fields about which I know nothing and all of which have their own specialized jargon and notational conventions .
None of those lectures were as opaque as anything these academics said .
But I captured on my notepad an astonishing collection of phrases and a sense of the overall tone of the event .
We retreated back to Palo Alto that evening for a quick rewrite .
The first order of business was to excise various little bits of phraseology that we now realized were likely to be perceived as Politically Incorrect .
Mind you , the fundamental thesis of our presentation was Politically Incorrect , but we wanted people to get upset about the actual content rather than the form in which it was presented .
Then we set about attempting to add something that would be an adequate response to the postmodern lit crit - speak we had been inundated with that day .
Since we had no idea what any of it meant ( or even if it actually meant anything at all ) , I simply cut - and - pasted from my notes .
The next day I stood up in front of the room and opened our presentation with the following :
The essential paradigm of cyberspace is creating partially situated identities out of actual or potential social reality in terms of canonical forms of human contact , thus renormalizing the phenomenology of narrative space and requiring the naturalization of the intersubjective cognitive strategy , and thereby resolving the dialectics of metaphorical thoughts , each problematic to the other , collectively redefining and reifying the paradigm of the parable of the model of the metaphor .
This bit of nonsense was constructed entirely out of things people had actually said the day before , except for the last ten words or so which are a pastiche of Danny Kaye 's " flagon with the dragon " bit from The Court Jester , contributed by our co-worker Gayle Pergamit , who took great glee in the entire enterprise .
Observing the audience reaction was instructive .
At first , various people started nodding their heads in nods of profound understanding , though you could see that their brain cells were beginning to strain a little .
Then some of the techies in the back of the room began to giggle .
By the time I finished , unable to get through the last line with a straight face , the entire room was on the floor in hysterics , as by then even the most obtuse English professor had caught on to the joke .
With the postmodernist lit crit shit thus defused , we went on with our actual presentation .
Contrary to the report given in the " Hype List " column of issue # 1 of Wired ( " Po- Mo Gets Tek - No " , page 87 ) , we did not shout down the postmodernists .
We made fun of them .
Afterward , however , I was left with a sense that I should try to actually understand what these people were saying , really .
I figured that one of three cases must apply .
It could be that there was truly some content there of value , once you learned the lingo .
If this was the case , then I wanted to know what it was .
On the other hand , perhaps there was actually content there but it was bogus ( my working hypothesis ) , in which case I wanted to be able to respond to it credibly .
On the third hand , maybe there was no content there after all , in which case I wanted to be able to write these clowns off without feeling guilty that I had n't given them due consideration .
The subject that I kept hearing about over and over again at the conference was deconstruction .
I figured I 'd start there .
I asked my friend Michael Benedikt for a pointer to some sources .
I had gotten to know Michael when he organized the First International Conference on Cyberspace .
I knew him to be a person with a foot in the lit crit camp but also a person of clear intellectual integrity who was not a fool .
He suggested a book called On Deconstruction by Jonathan Culler .
I got the book and read it .
It was a stretch , but I found I could work my way through it , although I did end up with the most heavily marked up book in my library by the time I was done .
The Culler book lead me to some other things , which I also read .
And I started subscribing to alt .
postmodern and now actually find it interesting , much of the time .
I can't claim to be an expert , but I feel I 've reached the level of a competent amateur .
I think I can explain it .
It turns out that there 's nothing to be afraid of .
We engineers are frequently accused of speaking an alien language , of wrapping what we do in jargon and obscurity in order to preserve the technological priesthood .
There is , I think , a grain of truth in this accusation .
Defenders frequently counter with arguments about how what we do really is technical and really does require precise language in order to talk about it clearly .
There is , I think , a substantial bit of truth in this as well , though it is hard to use these grounds to defend the use of the term " grep " to describe digging through a backpack to find a lost item , as a friend of mine sometimes does .
However , I think it 's human nature for members of any group to use the ideas they have in common as metaphors for everything else in life , so I 'm willing to forgive him .
The really telling factor that neither side of the debate seems to cotton to , however , is this : technical people like me work in a commercial environment .
Every day I have to explain what I do to people who are different from me -- marketing people , technical writers , my boss , my investors , my customers -- none of whom belong to my profession or share my technical background or knowledge .
As a consequence , I 'm constantly forced to describe what I know in terms that other people can at least begin to understand .
My success in my job depends to a large degree on my success in so communicating .
At the very least , in order to remain employed I have to convince somebody else that what I 'm doing is worth having them pay for it .
Contrast this situation with that of academia .
Professors of Literature or History or Cultural Studies in their professional life find themselves communicating principally with other professors of Literature or History or Cultural Studies .
They also , of course , communicate with students , but students do n't really count .
Graduate students are studying to be professors themselves and so are already part of the in -crowd .
Undergraduate students rarely get a chance to close the feedback loop , especially at the so called " better schools " ( I once spoke with a Harvard professor who told me that it is quite easy to get a Harvard undergraduate degree without ever once encountering a tenured member of the faculty inside a classroom ; I do n't know if this is actually true but it's a delightful piece of slander regardless ) .
They publish in peer reviewed journals , which are not only edited by their peers but published for and mainly read by their peers ( if they are read at all ) .
Decisions about their career advancement , tenure , promotion , and so on are made by committees of their fellows .
They are supervised by deans and other academic officials who themselves used to be professors of Literature or History or Cultural Studies .
They rarely have any reason to talk to anybody but themselves -- occasionally a Professor of Literature will collaborate with a Professor of History , but in academic circles this sort of interdisciplinary work is still considered sufficiently daring and risquÝ as to be newsworthy .
What you have is rather like birds on the Galapagos islands -- an isolated population with unique selective pressures resulting in evolutionary divergence from the mainland population .
There 's no reason you should be able to understand what these academics are saying because , for several generations , comprehensibility to outsiders has not been one of the selective criteria to which they 've been subjected .
What 's more , it 's not particularly important that they even be terribly comprehensible to each other , since the quality of academic work , particularly in the humanities , is judged primarily on the basis of politics and cleverness .
In fact , one of the beliefs that seems to be characteristic of the postmodernist mind set is the idea that politics and cleverness are the basis for all judgments about quality or truth , regardless of the subject matter or who is making the judgment .
A work need not be right , clear , original , or connected to anything outside the group .
Indeed , it looks to me like the vast bulk of literary criticism that is published has other works of literary criticism as its principal subject , with the occasional reference to the odd work of actual literature tossed in for flavoring from time to time .
Thus it is not surprising that it takes a bit of detective work to puzzle out what is going on .
But I 've been on the case for a while now and I think I 've identified most of the guilty suspects .
I hope I can spare some of my own peers the inconvenience and wasted time of actually doing the legwork themselves ( though if you have an inclination in that direction I recommend it as a mind stretching departure from debugging C code ) .
The basic enterprise of contemporary literary criticism is actually quite simple .
It is based on the observation that with a sufficient amount of clever handwaving and artful verbiage , you can interpret any piece of writing as a statement about anything at all .
The broader movement that goes under the label " postmodernism " generalizes this principle from writing to all forms of human activity , though you have to be careful about applying this label , since a standard postmodernist tactic for ducking criticism is to try to stir up metaphysical confusion by questioning the very idea of labels and categories .
" Deconstruction " is based on a specialization of the principle , in which a work is interpreted as a statement about itself , using a literary version of the same cheap trick that Kurt Gðdel used to try to frighten mathematicians back in the thirties .
Deconstruction , in particular , is a fairly formulaic process that hardly merits the commotion that it has generated .
However , like hack writers or television producers , academics will use a formula if it does the job and they are not held to any higher standard ( though perhaps Derrida can legitimately claim some credit for originality in inventing the formula in the first place ) .
Just to clear up the mystery , here is the formula , step - by - step :
Step 1 -- Select a work to be deconstructed .
This a called a " text " and is generally a piece of text , though it need not be .
It is very much within the lit crit mainstream to take something which is not text and call it a text .
In fact , this can be a very useful thing to do , since it leaves the critic with broad discretion to define what it means to " read " it and thus a great deal of flexibility in interpretation .
It also allows the literary critic to extend his reach beyond mere literature .
However , the choice of text is actually one of the less important decisions you will need to make , since points are awarded on the basis of style and wit rather than substance , although more challenging works are valued for their greater potential for exercising cleverness .
Thus you want to pick your text with an eye to the opportunities it will give you to be clever and convoluted , rather than whether the text has anything important to say or there is anything important to say about it .
Generally speaking , obscure works are better than well known ones , though an acceptable alternative is to choose a text from the popular mass media , such as a Madonna video or the latest Danielle Steele novel .
The text can be of any length , from the complete works of Louis L'Amour to a single sentence .
For example , let 's deconstruct the phrase , " John F. Kennedy was not a homosexual . "
Step 2 -- Decide what the text says .
This can be whatever you want , although of course in the case of a text which actually consists of text it is easier if you pick something that it really does say .
This is called " reading " .
I will read our example phrase as saying that John F. Kennedy was not a homosexual .
Step 3 -- Identify within the reading a distinction of some sort .
This can be either something which is described or referred to by the text directly or it can be inferred from the presumed cultural context of a hypothetical reader .
It is a convention of the genre to choose a duality , such as man / woman , good / evil , earth / sky , chocolate / vanilla , etc .
In the case of our example , the obvious duality to pick is homosexual / heterosexual , though a really clever person might be able to find something else .
Step 4 -- Convert your chosen distinction into a " hierarchical opposition " by asserting that the text claims or presumes a particular primacy , superiority , privilege or importance to one side or the other of the distinction .
Since it 's pretty much arbitrary , you do n't have to give a justification for this assertion unless you feel like it .
Programmers and computer scientists may find the concept of a hierarchy consisting of only two elements to be a bit odd , but this appears to be an established tradition in literary criticism .
Continuing our example , we can claim homophobia on the part of the society in which this sentence was uttered and therefor assert that it presumes superiority of heterosexuality over homosexuality .
Step 5 -- Derive another reading of the text , one in which it is interpreted as referring to itself .
In particular , find a way to read it as a statement which contradicts or undermines either the original reading or the ordering of the hierarchical opposition ( which amounts to the same thing ) .
This is really the tricky part and is the key to the whole exercise .
Pulling this off successfully may require a variety of techniques , though you get more style points for some techniques than for others .
Fortunately , you have a wide range of intellectual tools at your disposal , which the rules allow you to use in literary criticism even though they would be frowned upon in engineering or the sciences .
These include appeals to authority ( you can even cite obscure authorities that nobody has heard of ) , reasoning from etymology , reasoning from puns , and a variety of word other games .
You are allowed to use the word " problematic " as a noun .
You are also allowed to pretend that the works of Freud present a correct model of human psychology and the works of Marx present a correct model of sociology and economics ( it 's not clear to me whether practitioners in the field actually believe Freud and Marx or if it 's just a convention of the genre ) .
You get maximum style points for being French .
Since most of us are n't French , we do n't qualify for this one , but we can still score almost as much by writing in French or citing French sources .
However , it is difficult for even the most intense and unprincipled American academician writing in French to match the zen obliqueness of a native French literary critic .
Least credit is given for a clear , rational argument which makes its case directly , though of course that is what I will do with our example since , being gainfully employed , I do n't have to worry about graduation or tenure .
And besides , I 'm actually trying to communicate here .
Here is a possible argument to go with our example :
It is not generally claimed that John F. Kennedy was a homosexual .
Since it is not an issue , why would anyone choose to explicitly declare that he was not a homosexual unless they wanted to make it an issue ?
Clearly , the reader is left with a question , a lingering doubt which had not previously been there .
If the text had instead simply asked , " Was John F. Kennedy a homosexual ? " , the reader would simply answer , " No. " and forget the matter .
If it had simply declared , " John F. Kennedy was a homosexual . " , it would have left the reader begging for further justification or argument to support the proposition .
Phrasing it as a negative declaration , however , introduces the question in the reader 's mind , exploiting society 's homophobia to attack the reputation of the fallen President .
What 's more , the form makes it appear as if there is ongoing debate , further legitimizing the reader 's entertainment of the question .
Thus the text can be read as questioning the very assertion that it is making .
Of course , no real deconstruction would be like this .
I only used a single paragraph and avoided literary jargon .
All of the words will be found in a typical abridged dictionary and were used with their conventional meanings .
I also wrote entirely in English and did not cite anyone .
Thus in an English literature course I would probably get a D for this , but I already have my degree so I do n't care .
Another minor point , by the way , is that we do n't say that we deconstruct the text but that the text deconstructs itself .
This way it looks less like we are making things up .
That 's basically all there is to it , although there is an enormous variety of stylistic complication that is added in practice .
This is mainly due to the genetic drift phenomenon I mentioned earlier , resulting in the intellectual equivalent of peacock feathers , although I suspect that the need for enough material to fill up a degree program plays a part as well .
The best way to learn , of course , is to try to do it yourself .
First you need to read some real lit crit to get a feel for the style and the jargon .
One or two volumes is all it takes , since it's all pretty much the same ( I advise starting with the Culler book the way I did ) .
Here are some ideas for texts you might try to deconstruct , once you are ready to attempt it yourself , graded by approximate level of difficulty :
Beginner :
Ernest Hemingway 's The Old Man and The Sea
Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers
this article
James Cameron's The Terminator
issue # 1 of Wired
anything by Marx
Intermediate :
Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn
the Book of Genesis
Francois Truffaut 's Day For Night
The United States Constitution
Elvis Presley singing Jailhouse Rock
anything by Foucault
Edmund Spenser 's The Faerie Queene
the Great Pyramid of Giza
Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa
the Macintosh user interface
Tony Bennett singing I Left My Heart In San Francisco
anything by Derrida
Tour de Force :
James Joyce 's Finnegans Wake
the San Jose , California telephone directory
IRS Form 1040
the Intel i486 DX Programmer 's Reference Manual
the Mississippi River
anything by Baudrillard
So , what are we to make of all this ?
I earlier stated that my quest was to learn if there was any content to this stuff and if it was or was not bogus .
Well , my assessment is that there is indeed some content , much of it interesting .
The question of bogosity , however , is a little more difficult .
It is clear that the forms used by academicians writing in this area go right off the bogosity scale , pegging my bogometer until it breaks .
The quality of the actual analysis of various literary works varies tremendously and must be judged on a case - by - case basis , but I find most of it highly questionable .
Buried in the muck , however , are a set of important and interesting ideas : that in reading a work it is illuminating to consider the contrast between what is said and what is not said , between what is explicit and what is assumed , and that popular notions of truth and value depend to a disturbingly high degree on the reader 's credulity and willingness to accept the text 's own claims as to its validity .
Looking at the field of contemporary literary criticism as a whole also yields some valuable insights .
It is a cautionary lesson about the consequences of allowing a branch of academia that has been entrusted with the study of important problems to become isolated and inbred .
The Pseudo Politically Correct term that I would use to describe the mind set of postmodernism is " epistemologically challenged " : a constitutional inability to adopt a reasonable way to tell the good stuff from the bad stuff .
The language and idea space of the field have become so convoluted that they have confused even themselves .
But the tangle offers a safe refuge for the academics .
It erects a wall between them and the rest of the world .
It immunizes them against having to confront their own failings , since any genuine criticism can simply be absorbed into the morass and made indistinguishable from all the other verbiage .
Intellectual tools that might help prune the thicket are systematically ignored or discredited .
This is why , for example , science , psychology and economics are represented in the literary world by theories that were abandoned by practicing scientists , psychologists and economists fifty or a hundred years ago .
The field is absorbed in triviality .
Deconstruction is an idea that would make a worthy topic for some bright graduate student 's Ph.D. dissertation but has instead spawned an entire subfield .
Ideas that would merit a good solid evening or afternoon of argument and debate and perhaps a paper or two instead become the focus of entire careers .
Engineering and the sciences have , to a greater degree , been spared this isolation and genetic drift because of crass commercial necessity .
The constraints of the physical world and the actual needs and wants of the actual population have provided a grounding that is difficult to dodge .
However , in academia the pressures for isolation are enormous .
It is clear to me that the humanities are not going to emerge from the jungle on their own .
I think that the task of outreach is left to those of us who retain some connection , however tenuous , to what we laughingly call reality .
We have to go into the jungle after them and rescue what we can .
Just remember to hang on to your sense of humor and do n't let them intimidate you .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Paying people a compliment appears to activate the same reward center in the brain as paying them cash , Japanese researchers said on Wednesday .

They said the study offers scientific support for the long - held assumption that people get a psychological boost from having a good reputation .
“ We found that these seemingly different kinds of rewards -- a good reputation versus money -- are biologically coded by the same neural structure , the striatum , ” said Dr. Norihiro Sadato of the Japanese National Institute for Physiological Sciences in Okazaki , Japan .
“ This provides the biological basis of our everyday experience that personal reputation is felt as rewards , ” Sadato said in an e-mail .
Sadato ’s team studied 19 healthy people using a brain imaging technique known as functional magnetic resonance imaging , or fMRI .
In one set of experiments , people played a gambling game in which they were told one of three cards would yield a payout .
The researchers then monitored the brain activity triggered when the subjects got a cash reward .
In a second set of experiments , people were told they were being evaluated by strangers based on information from a personality questionnaire and a video they had made .
The researchers then monitored reactions to these staged evaluations -- including when the subjects thought strangers had paid them a compliment .
‘ NEED TO BELONG ’
Both kinds of rewards triggered activity in a reward - related area of the brain .
Sadato said the finding represents an important first step toward explaining complex human social behaviors such as altruism .
The fact that the social reward is biologically coded suggests that “ the need to belong ... is essential for humans , ” said Sadato , whose study appears in the journal Neuron .
A similar study in the same journal by Caroline Zink of the National Institute of Mental Health and colleagues found the same brain region was active when people were processing information about social status .
They said the finding might have implications on how social standing affects behavior and health .
The researchers created an artificial social hierarchy in which 72 participants played an interactive computer game for money .
Participants were assigned a social status they were told was based on their playing skill .
Researchers monitored their brain activity as the participants were shown pictures of inferior and superior players who were supposedly playing the game in different rooms .
Zink and colleagues saw increased activity in the brain ’s reward center when people won money or saw their social standing rise .
“ The processing of hierarchical information seems to be hard - wired ... underscoring how important it is for us , ” Zink said in a statement .

Japanese scientists can now clone human embryos , according to a proposal that was approved by a team of experts at the education and science ministry .
It is worth mentioning that scientists will be able to clone human embryos in order to perform studies on incurable diseases .
The proposal that comes under the cloning technology control law is to be analyzes by the end of current year .
This is going to make Japan the second country after Britain where cloning human embryos is legal .
Due to the fact that the criteria are set high , there are currently no institutions in Japan that meet the necessary standards to perform the research .
Because of the development of the induced pluripotent stem cells , researchers are able to make the use of human embryos less significant in regenerative medicine .

John
Yoo is one of the prime -- if not the prime -- formulators of the blatantly inadequate and outrageous legal opinions that justified the Bush administration 's use of torture .
His opinions were not just idle academic theories :
They helped further the actual practice of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
Why is he still allowed to teach at Berkeley ?
Why has n't or does n't the Berkeley faculty senate or law - school senate demand his dismissal ?
Why have n't or are n't disbarment proceedings being brought against him ?
Scott Horton today quotes an article in Vanity Fair excerpted from Philippe Sands ' new expose of Bush 's torture lawyers :
" Addington , Bybee , Gonzales , Haynes , and Yoo became , in effect , a torture team of lawyers , freeing the administration from the constraints of all international rules prohibiting abuse . "
Horton then himself writes :
" They ( Yoo et al ) also missed the established precedent I have cited repeatedly here , namely United States v. Altstoetter , under the rule of which the conduct of the torture lawyers is a criminal act not shielded by any notions of government immunity . "
Why is Berkeley providing employment to a likely war criminal ?
Why are n't thousands of people gathering at the Law School , demanding Yoo 's ouster ?

The Democratic Party risks the defection of many supporters of Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton unless it settles the Florida and Michigan primary fracas to their satisfaction , said protesters at pro-Clinton rallies in Washington yesterday .
“ I refuse to be associated with a party that is stupid , self - destructive and undemocratic , and now , I ’m beginning to realize , is misogynistic , ” said Norma Broude , an American University professor who was among more than 1,000 Clinton supporters at a “ count the vote ” rally at Rock Creek Park .
Friend and fellow American University professor Mary Garrard agreed , saying that she will not vote for Mrs. Clinton ’s rival , Sen. Barack Obama , if he receives the party ’s presidential nomination .
“ The Democratic Party has disdained the female demographic , they have demeaned Hillary Clinton , and this time we ’re not going to roll over , ” Ms. Garrard said .
As the pro-Clinton contingent , which was largely female but racially and generationally mixed , rallied in the park , Democratic leaders were gathered a few blocks away at the Marriott Wardman Park Hotel to decide the fate of the combined 313 disqualified delegates from Florida and Michigan , and , in turn , the fate of Mrs. Clinton ’s long - shot chance of overcoming Mr. Obama ’s delegate lead .
Democratic leadership disqualified the delegates and barred them from attending the party ’s August convention in Denver as punishment for the states moving their primaries ahead of Feb.
5 - a violation of party rules .
They decided last night to award half - votes to each state ’s delegates and apportion the delegates to the two candidates in a ratio that did not satisfy the Clinton team .
Mrs. Clinton , who has virtually no chance of winning the nomination without major boosts from those states , has pushed hard for full delegations to be reinstated .
She won both contests , although her rival removed his name from the Michigan ballot .
Both candidates also agreed not to campaign in either state .
As the committee announced its decisions , Clinton supporters in the room angrily shouted “ Count all the votes ! ” and “ This is n’t fair ! ”
“ This is not the Democratic Party .
The Republicans are the ones that disenfranchise the voters , ” shouted one man while thrusting his fist in the air .
“ You stripped me of my vote .
How dare you , ” shouted a woman from the balcony .
After the meeting adjourned , Clinton backer Michele Thomas accused Democratic leaders of “ fixing ” the primary results in favor of Mr. Obama , and said she will leave the party .
“ The Democratic Party turned its back on us , and now we ’re going to turn our backs on them , ” said Ms. Thomas , who traveled from her home in Los Angeles to attend the hearing .
Polls of Democratic primary voters also suggest that many Clinton supporters would not support Mr. Obama in November against the Republican nominee - in - waiting Sen. John McCain .
Surveys of Clinton voters in recent primary states have shown that 26 percent to 36 percent , depending on the state , say they would back Mr. McCain over Mr. Obama in the general election , while just 10 percent to 18 percent of Obama supporters say they would prefer the Republican to the other Democrat in November .
Gallup tracking reports from May 23 through May 28 showed Mrs. Clinton consistently running three to five percentage points ahead of Mr. McCain .
Over the same period , Mr. Obama fared no better than a tie with the Republican senator .
“ Hillary is obviously better positioned to beat McCain than Obama , ” Ms. Garrard said .
Constanta Nour - Hinkle of Reading , Pa. , who was one of a few hundred Clinton supporters who protested outside the Marriott , said she is a lifelong Democrat , but would not vote for Mr. Obama for president .
“ It would be the first time in my life I would vote Republican for president , ” said Mrs. Nour - Hinkle , 35 .
“ I think Obama is an empty shirt , the same as [ President ] George W. Bush , but only a Democrat . ”
John Overton , who shouted pro-Clinton slogans outside the hotel , said he would leave the party if Mr. Obama receives the Democratic nomination for president .
“ I ca n’t stand for the Democratic Party if they do n’t stand for voters ’ rights , ” said Mr. Overton , who traveled from his home in Chapel Hill , N.C. , to attend the rally .
The party “ would no longer exist to me as a party . ”
“ I do n’t scream like this normally .
I ’m a rational guy , but I ’ve never felt like this before , ” he added .
“ This has been a travesty of democracy . ”
But Johnnie Mae Collins , who traveled from Jacksonville , Fla. , to attended the protests , said that while she is upset the Democratic Party disqualified her state ’s primary results , she wo n’t leave the party .
“ Why would we abandon what we are ?
McCain is not for us , ” Ms. Collins said .
“ Some people say if Obama wins they ’re not going to vote for the party , but I ’m not going that way .
Those people who say that were never a true Democrat , that ’s for sure , because for me , you ’re going to stand with [ the party ] . ”
T - shirt vendor Charles Greer of Washington said he brought his stash of Obama shirts and hats to the Rock Creek rally because he said he thought it was going to be a Democratic rally for “ recounting the vote . ”
“ But all I ’ve heard them talk about was Hillary , Hillary , Hillary , ” Mr. Greer said .
Mr. Greer said that while some protests cursed him and waved obscene hand gestures , he still sold about 30 to 40 Obama shirts and hats .
“ Hillary shirts do n’t sell well in Washington .
If they did , we ’d have Hillary shirts too , ” he said .

“ THERE were so many expectations , ” Morgan Spurlock says about his new documentary , “ Where in the World Is Osama Bin Laden ? , ” which opens in Los Angeles on Friday .
“ I ’m flattered that people had so much faith in me , but now audiences can just go and enjoy the movie . ”
Spurlock wants to get this out of the way :
No , he was n’t secretly trained by a special ops unit .
And no , he did n’t actually find Osama bin Laden .
On a sunny April morning , the director , 37 , sipping a cup of coffee while sitting in the Tea Lounge around the corner from his home in Park Slope , Brooklyn , is happy to dispel the more extreme Internet rumors about his latest filmmaking adventure , largely because he thinks they inhibited the audience ’s appreciation of the movie when it premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January .
He did , however , go to Pakistan , Afghanistan and several other nations of the Muslim world .
But he went as the Average American , as if your curious , indefatigable , risk - loving brother - in - law got it in his head to try to track down the chief of Al Qaeda .
Not that he really was expecting to smoke out Bin Laden ; his real target was the culture of fear he saw plaguing his fellow Americans .
And although there is great irony in the greatest superpower in the world ’s inability to track down a man supposedly hiding in caves , Spurlock ’s mission was not so much to criticize but to examine and explore the mystique behind America ’s Public Enemy No. 1 .
And when he says , “ Enjoy the movie , ” he means it , because he is the sort of documentary director who believes nonfiction filmmaking and fun can be synonymous .
After all , Spurlock managed that feat very successfully in his debut , 2004 ’s “ Super Size Me , ” in which he put himself on a diet of only McDonald ’s food for a month as a way to illuminate America ’s addiction to unhealthful fast food .
Much has happened for Spurlock since “ Super Size Me . ”
His trademark handle - bar mustache gets him recognized often ( he says when he occasionally shaves it off , he becomes invisible ) ; and he has spun his clout into a television show on the FX network , “ 30 Days ” ( the third season airs in June ) , and his own documentary distribution shingle , called “ Morgan Spurlock Presents , ” which has backed six films .
He also married Alex , his vegan girlfriend who was featured in “ Super Size Me , ” and the couple has a 16 - month - old son , Laken .
Spurlock says his new status as a family man helped propel “ Where in the World Is Osama Bin Laden ? , ” which he had already been working on for several months in early 2006 .
But then his impending fatherhood captured his imagination , so the tone of the film shifted to “ what kind of world am I bringing a kid into ? ” he says .
“ I knew where we would start , but I did n’t know where we ’d end , ” Spurlock adds .
“ What we knew was that I ’d come home and hopefully everything would be fine .
And we ’d have a baby . ”
MOST of the filming occurred in late 2006 , over five months ; Spurlock hopped on a plane , then hit the streets and sand dunes , talking with journalists and intellectuals .
But he found himself gravitating mostly toward conversations with carpet salesmen and street vendors .
“ What I am trying to do post -' Super Size Me ’ is to really have an experiential journey , ” says Spurlock , who also filmed his emotional phone conversations with his pregnant wife for the movie .
“ So I have to show you what is impacting me .
And as you see things affecting me emotionally , they ’ll affect you emotionally .
I hope . ”
This methodology , which places him on screen for pretty much the entire film , comes effortlessly to Spurlock .
“ Morgan has to understand something before he gets it , ” says Alex .
“ He has to experience something in order to make it real for him .
So what you see on the screen is not an act . ”
That impulse conveniently has him following in the footsteps of successful documentarians , such as Nick Broomfield and Michael Moore , to whom Spurlock gives much respect .
“ He blew the doors open for the rest of us , ” Spurlock says of Moore .
However , being a director who ’s also on screen , as well as a writer , producer and his own all - around gofer , makes for a frenetic lifestyle .
“ It ’s pretty ridiculous .
In the last three years , if he ’s been in one time zone for more than three months I ’d be shocked , ” says Jeremy Chilnick , a writer and producer on “ Where in the World . ”
“ Morgan does everything . ”
( Chilnick notes that Spurlock ’s speedy pace can be highly beneficial , especially when shooting in countries such as Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia .
Spurlock and his team -- a producer , a cameraman and one security advisor -- would film for 15 minutes at a time , at which point a crowd would begin to congregate , creating more of “ a target . ”
They ’d then pick up and leave . )
SPURLOCK , raised in Beckley , W.Va. , was the sort of kid in school who did everything -- student government , football , baseball , track and . . . ballet .
Spurlock ’s dance classes , which he took through childhood , made him the target of teasing , but he kept at it , largely because he had two older brothers who danced , and made it “ cool . ”
( Both brothers eventually danced professionally before taking on more conventional careers . )
It was all part of his parents ’ plan to get their children to find ways to express themselves .
Spurlock eventually applied to USC ’s film school .
After getting rejected five times , he went to New York University .
His professional career was a series of baby steps over 10 years -- stand - up comic , production assistant , spokesman for Sony Electronics , announcer for the Sony - sponsored beach volleyball league .
He began directing industrial films for corporations and created an online reality show for MTV called “ I Bet You Will ” ( a precursor to “ Fear Factor ” ) before coming up with the idea for “ Super Size Me ” in 2003 .
Now his sophomore effort , with its grandiose title , grand scope ( shooting in 15 countries ; elaborate animated sequences that include Spurlock having a full - on video - game battle with a 9 - foot , bionic Bin Laden ) and a far - larger budget than his previous film ( “ Super Size Me ” cost $ 300,000 ) , brings increased expectations .
But the director maintains that the key to his filmmaking remains the same .
It ’s something his mother used to always tell him : Just listen .
That dictum is apparent in the film , as he literally breaks bread with people who might see him as a threat but who seem to genuinely like him .
It ’s also evident in how Spurlock responded to distributor Weinstein Co. 's penchant for test - marketing its films , which it did for “ Where in the World ” after Sundance .
Spurlock made two significant changes because of audience response : entirely cutting an elaborate , animated sequence and changing a pivotal closing song , from the goofy “ Why Ca n’t We Be Friends ? ” to the more thoughtful , " ( What ’s So Funny ‘ Bout ) Peace , Love and Understanding . ”
Heeding test screenings is just another form of listening , according to Spurlock .
“ The one thing I know is that I do n’t know everything , ” he says .
“ Far from it . ”
( CNN ) --
A man and a woman have been charged by police in Italy after they were found having sex in a confession box , it was reported Wednesday .
The Italian ANSA news agency said the young man and woman were taken into custody by police in the northern city of Cesena following a telephone complaint from a man attending morning Mass in the city 's cathedral .
Authorities were alerted after a parishoner heard " rustling and groaning " coming from inside the confession box and pulled back the curtains to reveal a goth - rock couple engaged in oral sex , ANSA said .
The agency said the pair -- a 31 - year - old laborer and a 32 - year - old teacher -- defended their conduct saying : " We are atheists and for us , having sex in church is like doing it any other place . "
However , Bishop Antonio Lanfranchi of Cesena - Sarsina took said the couple 's behavior was " an outrage of notable proportions which bespeaks unutterable squalor . "
He added that a special ceremony would be held to purify the confession box .
The number of white Democratic voters who said that race influenced their choice on Tuesday was among the highest recorded in voter surveys in the Clinton - Obama nomination fight .
Two in 10 white West Virginia voters said that race was an important factor in their vote , and more than 8 in 10 of them backed Mrs. Clinton , according to surveys of voters leaving the polls .
With Mr. Obama still solidly ahead of Mrs. Clinton in the delegate fight , the West Virginia results are unlikely to adversely affect Mr. Obama ’s chances of winning the nomination .
Yet a strong Clinton victory in another general election battleground state  like her wins in Ohio and Pennsylvania this spring  could raise fresh questions about Mr. Obama ’s ability to carry swing states in a contest against Senator John McCain in the fall .

The voter surveys showing a strong racial component to the West Virginia voting suggest that Mr. Obama would still face pockets of significant Democratic resistance if he does become the party ’s first black nominee .
While he has argued that he could broaden the Democratic base in the fall , given his popularity with independents and his strong showing in traditionally Republican states like Colorado and Virginia , the Clinton camp has pointed to his modest support from white voters and blue - collar workers as weak links in his coalition .
Obama supporters accused Mrs. Clinton of playing the race card last week when she explicitly said that she had more support among “ white Americans ” than he did .
Yet however blunt she may have been , white and financially struggling voters in West Virginia  and in Kentucky , which votes next week and which Mr. Obama has all but conceded to Mrs. Clinton  have become a major force keeping her in the presidential race at this late stage .

Start a Fire Without Matches
By Steven Gillman
Have you ever tried making a fire without matches or a lighter ?
It looks easy on television .
Recently , on an episode of “ Man Versus Wild , ” the host / survivor simply spun a stick between his hands for a few minutes , with one end on a fire board ( a piece of wood with a hole and a notch in it ) , and soon had a burning coal .
He easily blew this into a flame .
Easily ?
We do n’t see the whole process in one camera shot of course .
It would be boring , because it takes a long time to make a fire using primitive means .
Also – unlike on
television , it ’s easy to fail at any one of the six crucial steps , and that means no fire .
The six steps to making a fire without matches or a lighter :
1. Gather the right kind of tinder .
2. Gather firewood and lay a good fire .
3 . Make fire - starting tools .
4 . Use the tools the right way to create an ember .
5 . Blow the ember into a flame using the tinder .
6 . Start a fire with the burning tinder .
Making A Fire
Steps 4 and 5 are by far the toughest .
Anyone can quickly learn how to gather dry wood and lay it in a way that allows air into it , with tinder at the center , kindling around that , and small pieces of firewood ready to be added .
Fire starting tools , whether a hand - spun spindle or a bow and drill setup , are relatively easy too make too , once you ’ve seen how and try it a few times .
Knowledge helps .
Tinder , for example , needs to have very specific qualities when you do n’t have matches .
Paper is a good tinder for starting a fire with matches , but it wo n’t easily take and hold a spark or ember and allow you to blow it into a flame .
Good tinder materials when you do n’t have matches include lint from your pocket , cattail seed head down , fine dry grass , cotton twine , cotton cloth , and dry - rotted wood .
A few types of dry funguses that grow on trees work as well .
You can experiment with these .
You can also scrape the outside of western cedars and some other trees , to get a small pile of fuzzy bark for tinder .
Place the tinder in a nest or ball of dry grass .
When you get your spark or coal , you ’ll drop it into the center and blow into it gently , hopefully blowing this ember into a flame within a minute or so .
If it does n’t work , try other tinder materials , and even mix several , like lint , cattail fuzz , and finely shredded soft bark .
The basic routine , whether using a bow and drill , a fire plow or a simple spindle and fire board , is to create enough friction to get a small burning ember .
You drop this into the tinder you have prepared , and blown into a flame , then transfer the flame to the kindling and firewood you have prepared .
Soon you have a blazing fire in front of you .
Now it ’s time for my confession .
I ’ve worked on every element of this process .
I lay a good fire , collect great tinders , and I can blow them into a flame from an ember .
I even make a decent bow and drill fire starter .
However , I ’ve never created an ember from friction .
I can make clouds of smoke and a lot of sweat , but I have never started a fire using primitive tools .
I have always had matches , which may have limited my motivation .
The lesson ?
Step number four is tough .
Practice all the others to get your confidence up .
You can light a small stick and blow out the flame to get an ember for practicing .
Or maybe the lesson is that if you think you might be making a fire , bring matches or a lighter .

For much of last year , McCain had difficulty distancing himself from President Bush , conceded aide Mark Salter .
As McCain emerged as the favorite of the Republican establishment , media coverage focused on how the two former rivals , Bush and McCain , had moved closer , particularly over Iraq .
" McCain wants to do the war right - in a way that 's principled , and that functions as a positive example of the differences between us and the terrorists , " said Jeremy Varon , a historian at Drew University who has studied past antiwar movements .
" This is the way in which people on the left see him as somewhat admirable : because principles seem to matter to him . "
Yet McCain has managed to establish a third position in a previously two - sided debate that has allowed him to draw supporters from among the war 's boosters and skeptics .
By criticizing both the Bush administration 's wartime management and Democratic opponents he said wanted to " set a date for surrender , " McCain was able to present himself as a candidate who both supported the war and best understood the costs of what he calls " our failure in Iraq . "
For much of last year , McCain 's support for the war in Iraq appeared to threaten his prospects among independents , Democrats , and moderate Republicans .
McCain has repeatedly said then he would " much rather lose a political campaign than lose a war . "
On the day of the Michigan primary , he raised the stakes .
" I would rather lose a career than lose a war , " he said in Traverse City .
The unlikely base of support for McCain , who once summarized his unyielding resistance to the antiwar cause with the slogan " No Surrender , " has been central to his campaign 's resurgence .
Both analysts and staffers acknowledge it is evidence of how much McCain has succeeded in winning over voters on the basis of his personal qualities while often failing to convince them of his policy positions - even on an issue McCain has made his campaign 's signature cause .
" People know this is someone who knows the possibilities and limits of military action and would not take those steps lightly , " said Steve Duprey , McCain 's New Hampshire vice chairman , explaining the senator 's appeal to antiwar voters .
In New Hampshire , McCain overwhelmingly won the votes of the one - third of Republican - primary voters who told exit pollsters they " strongly " or " somewhat " oppose the war , and trailed Mitt Romney by over 20 points among those who strongly support it .
In Michigan , where McCain lost to Romney , the Arizona senator also carried antiwar voters while losing among those backing the conflict .
DEERFIELD BEACH , Fla . - John McCain , the Republican Party 's most relentless and unapologetic guardian of an enduring American presence in Iraq , has become the favored candidate of antiwar voters in the Republican primaries , according to exit polls .
" Because we were viewed as the frontrunner , we got into this absurd narrative that was hard to break , even on Iraq , " Salter said .
Bush 's belated adoption last winter of the " surge " McCain had long championed brought greater stability to Iraq and pacified some political opposition at home .
But its success enabled McCain to remind voters that he had wanted such a strategy all along - and had routinely berated Bush for failing to go along with it .
Throughout his career , McCain has articulated a simple lesson from Vietnam - wars should be waged to win at any cost , or not fought at all .
That all or nothing approach has pushed him , at various times , to both dovish and hawkish extremes .
In 1983 , as a freshman congressman , McCain said he was " prepared to accept the consequences of our withdrawal " of Marines from Lebanon for fear of ending up in an unwinnable conflict .
Sixteen years later , he pushed the Clinton administration to extend its role in the Balkans to include ground troops to ensure success .
An absolutist streak still runs through McCain 's attitude toward war .
When a young woman at a town hall in Bedford , New Hampshire , asked McCain how he could support the war given a poll showing that soldiers ' families were opposed , McCain stormily dismissed her assertion - and the possibility that any reputable survey could demonstrate such a finding .
" But it 's a poll that was taken , " she protested .
" I do n't care if it 's a banana , " McCain responded .
Today , McCain often ends his speeches with a story about an encounter last summer with a New Hampshire mother who pleaded with McCain to make sure her son's death outside Baghdad was n't " in vain . "
McCain now wears a black bracelet featuring his name and lifts his wrist to show it to crowds , emphasizing that the experience put the debate in the " right perspective " for him .
" It 's a metaphor for not forgetting the price we pay for entering the war , " said Duprey , the McCain campaign aide .
The notion that McCain could be wrong about the war but fully grasps its gravity is a recurring theme in newspaper endorsements , which McCain has won in far greater numbers than any other Republican contender .
This week , the Daily Herald of Arlington Heights , Ill. , cited McCain 's " courage " in noting that " we disagree with McCain 's endorsement of the war in Iraq , but his early criticism of its execution - that the Bush administration failed to send in enough troops to complete the mission - has been proven accurate . "
In the early states , McCain has emerged as the candidate for Republican voters who dislike Bush .
McCain overwhelmingly won among New Hampshire voters who described themselves as " angry " about the Bush administration .
In South Carolina , where pollsters did not ask about voters ' stance on the war , McCain carried those who disapprove of Bush while losing narrowly among those who support him .
" McCain does much better among those Republicans described as moderate and liberal , and they are the ones who would be most likely to take a dissident view on the war , " said Caroll Doherty of the Pew Research Center .
" Moderates are supporting McCain despite , rather than because of , his war position . "
McCain has found a similar forbearance from conservative Republicans who disagree with his liberal attitudes on immigration .
Over half of South Carolina Republican voters said they were in favor of deporting illegal immigration - a position McCain , who supports a legalization scheme , has strenuously rejected - but McCain carried 26 percent of them , running only eight points behind Mike Huckabee .
" Issues are somewhat secondary in terms of how people are making up their minds , " Doherty said .
Polls have shown that McCain does best with voters drawn to his character and leadership more than his record or ideology .
" Most voters , especially as concerns the Iraq war , are probably reacting to the perceived persona and temperament of the candidates , " said Andrew J. Bacevich , a professor of international relations at Boston University and a strong critic of the war .
" McCain is of a toughmindedness - not of the sort that said , ' we 're going to be in Iraq come hell or highwater , ' but of the toughmindedness of facing the facts whatever the facts may be . "

BONN , Germany ( Reuters ) - The United States will tell a July meeting of the Group of Eight rich nations that it cannot meet big cuts in emissions of planet - warming gases by 2020 , its chief climate negotiator Harlan Watson said .

“ It ’s frankly not do - able for us , ” he told Reuters on Tuesday , referring to a goal for rich countries to curb greenhouse gases by 25 - 40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels .
A draft summit declaration , dated May 5 and seen by Reuters , showed Washington is blocking efforts to get the summit to agree targets for cutting carbon emissions , insisting that responsibility be shared by big emerging economies .
The European Union says it will cut emissions by 30 percent if other rich countries do and supports a goal of 25 - 40 percent for all industrialized nations .
But the candidates running to replace U.S. President George W. Bush , and who all support action to stem climate change , were only talking about returning to 1990 or 2000 U.S. emissions levels by 2020 , Watson said .
“ And I think most analysis of whether we could do that ( say ) it would be a heavy lift for the United States given our current infrastructure . ”
U.S. power production is about 50 percent reliant on high carbon - emitting coal , Watson added .
Watson was speaking on the sidelines of U.N. - led climate talks in Germany .
He held out hope for agreement in the July G8 meeting on a global goal to halve emissions by 2050 .
“ We ’d certainly like to get agreement on that , I ’m not going to say specific numbers .
We ’re seriously considering this 50 by 50 , ” he said , referring to a halving of global greenhouse gases by mid-century , supported by Japan and the EU .
CLIMATE FIGHT
The United States wants all major economies -- code for including big developing countries such as China -- to agree to contribute more to the climate fight , for example funding R&D into clean energy technologies .
Financing such research was currently dominated by the United States and Japan , Watson said .
Talks this week in Bonn are meant to dovetail with the upcoming G8 meeting and a U.S. initiative on the fringes of the G8 involving all major economies , into a U.N. process to agree a new global climate pact by the end of next year in Copenhagen .
A key sticking point in talks is how to split the cost of re-deploying the world ’s entire energy system away from fossil fuels , and how soon emerging economies adopt emissions caps .
The present Kyoto Protocol caps the greenhouse gases of some 37 industrialized countries , but not the world ’s top two emitters -- the United States and China .
Scientists say that the world must brake and reverse annual increases in greenhouse gas emissions to avoid dangerous climate change including rising seas and more extreme weather .
A 26 - year - old woman has been jailed for four - and - a - half years after a video of her abusing a four - month - old baby girl was found on a paedophile 's computer .
Christopher Oxtoby , 27 , filmed a clip on his mobile phone involving his partner Katie Scott , 26 .
Both live in Northampton .
Oxtoby was given an indeterminate jail sentence when the pair admitted the offences at Northampton Crown Court .
The judge said they had " a totally distorted perception of sexuality . "
FBI tip - off
Oxtoby will not be released until a parole board considers him safe .
The couple 's abuse of the child was uncovered in a global operation by the FBI .
They tracked down the paedophile in America and also found online conversations he had had with Oxtoby , the court heard .
The FBI tipped off Northamptonshire police who raided the couple 's home in Ashbrow Road , Briar Hill , on 2 November last year and seized 13 computers .
Oxtoby and Scott both pleaded guilty to sexual assault of a child .
Oxtoby also admitted taking indecent photographs of a child , five offences of making indecent photographs of children and one of possessing indecent photographs of children .
' Test of sexuality '
In addition , Oxtoby pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting a girl aged under 11 , between 1994 and 1996 .
In a letter to Judge Thomas Corrie he explained his abuse of the child as a " test " or " experiment " into his sexuality .
He also claimed he did not know how the clip came to be in the United States but Judge Corrie said : " You are not suggesting it was by some mystic force . "
He then described the couple as " having a thoroughly distorted perception of sexuality " .
Steven Evans , for Scott , said she was vulnerable , had a low IQ and had played only a secondary role .
For Oxtoby , Makkon Shokkar said he showed " remorse , regret and shame " .

IT WAS Greg Mankiw 's turn in the New York Times ' rotation of weekend economic columnists on Sunday , and Mr Mankiw used his column space to take on the unenviable job of defending John McCain 's economic policies .
Specifically at issue was Mr McCain 's plan to reduce the corporate tax rate from 35 % to 25 % .
It 's an idea with strong support from economists on the right , who note that America 's corporate tax rate is high relative to many other nations , and who argue , correctly , that the distortionary impact of the corporate tax is high relative to other means of raising revenue .
But Mr Mankiw makes a number of errors — of omission and commission — in making his case .
First and foremost , as Mark Thoma points out , Mr Mankiw suggests that a cut in the corporate tax rate might be self - financing .
This is a highly dubious proposition which lacks the support of most academic economists .
Following closely from this goof , Brad DeLong sagely notes that while a corporate tax rate cut might be good for economic growth , an unfunded one will not .
The long - term budget constraint applies , and while Mr McCain has promised to rein in spending , his actual policy proposals are rather quiet on just where these cuts would come ( with the exception of earmarks , which offer too little excess to close the gap ) .
Finally , there is the matter of progressivity in the tax cut .
Mr Mankiw does cite research showing that much of burden of the corporate tax is passed on to labour , and that is no doubt the case .
But much of it is not , and as Mr Thoma notes , European nations generally combine their low corporate tax rates with generous redistribution of revenues .
There can be little doubt that a move away from taxation of income and capital , and toward taxation of consumption and negative externalities ( like congestion and carbon emissions ) would greatly improve the efficiency of the tax code .
Politically , that 's a difficult case to make .
While Mr Mankiw 's proposal is likely music to the ears of scholars at the American Enterprise Institute , he 'll have to do more to acknowledge its drawbacks if he hopes to win converts from a broader audience .

I 'm certain most of you readers here would have lots of exciting chess games , whether it involves a dramatic greek gift sacrifice , or a brilliant zugwang in an endgame .
However , have you ever played a game with such a massive attack where queens are left en prise and kings are in the open with mating threats hanging in the air ?
A game where the defender gets back into play and an endgame with pieces left hanging and passed pawns being rushed down the board ensues ?
The game about to revealed to you is one which will change your chess life forever - Topalov vs. Kramnik World Championship Match in Elista , 2006 .
Let me first provide a short overview and context under which this bloodbath game took place .
Vladmir Kramnik , being the World Champion of the PCA , played a Unification World Championship match against the then World Champion of FIDE Veselin Topalov .
This was Game 2 of the match .
Topalov , having blundered away Game 1 to Kramnik , whose mastery of the endgame is awesome , opted for a complicated game , hoping to avenge his first round loss .
Watching the game on playchess.com , I was a firm supporter of Topalov , applauding his great fighting spirit and mentally egging him on .
Indeed , having followed many of the top level tournaments , it was always Topalov which gave the audience something to cheer about .
Taking massive risks invariably , he never went for a quick draw and delivered quite a few eye openers .
This game was no different , perhaps only that it was not destined to be a piece of cake .
Topalov 's opponent was the formidable Kramnik , who had ousted Kasparov out in 2 consecutive matches !
Well , enough for background .
Here 's the game .
Sit back and enjoy , and see if you can guess whether Kramnik can defuse the brunt of Topalov 's attack .
Indeed , will Topalov succeed in this crucial bid for success , or will he be hitting his head against a rock ?
** Sidenote :
Do open the movelist and scroll from there for I have included some sidelines .
( You 'll miss out quite a bit if you do n't ! )
Well , thats it !
Impressed ?
Hope my analysis helped out a bit !
For the more advanced players , sorry for the trivial details , but I wanted to cater it so as to allow even the layman a chance of understanding this wonderful game !

This second edition features deeper analysis .
I hope more people will get to enjoy it !

( CNN ) --
A teenager has been formally charged in the killings of her mother and two young brothers , a crime that has left the family 's tiny Texas town of Alba reeling .
Police are not releasing the daughter 's name because she is a juvenile , but said they believe she was angry because her parents would not let her date one of three other suspects .
Authorities say the girl took part in the slayings , The Associated Press is reporting .
She was found hiding in a mobile home where one of the suspects lived , said Rains Sheriff David Traylor .
Also arraigned on three counts each of capital murder are : Charlie James Wilkinson , 19 ; Charles Allen Waid , 20 ; and Bobbi Gale Johnson , 18 , who is female .
Bond was set at $ 1.5 million for each of the four , said Traylor .
Traylor said the teenage daughter had been dating Wilkinson .
" Early on in the investigation it was revealed that the juvenile and one of the suspects were dating and made to break up , " Traylor said in a statement .

The Caffey family was sleeping when the pre-dawn attack on Saturday began , he said .
According to Traylor , the mother , Penny Caffey , 37 , was shot and stabbed .
Tyler Caffey , 8 , was stabbed .
Mathew Caffey , 13 , was shot and stabbed .
Authorities said they found the family in the ashes of their home , which had been set on fire .
The teenage girl 's father , Terry Caffey , was shot in the head but was able to crawl 300 yards to a neighbor 's home where 911 was called .
Caffey helped police identify one of the suspects , said Traylor .
The sheriff told reporters late Sunday that Terry Caffey was on his way to surgery to have four slugs removed .
Carl Johnson , a family friend , told the AP he saw the bloody trail the father left as he dragged himself to a neighbor 's house .
Johnson told AP the family members were musicians and that the boys played guitar and harmonica and the mother is a church piano player .
" I just thought the whole world of the family , " said Johnson , 75 .
" They were good Christian people .
[ The father ] was like a son of my own . "
The killings shocked many in the small east Texas town , the town 's mayor said Sunday .
" There has n't been a murder here in 18 years , " said Orvin Carroll , longtime mayor of Alba -- a town of about 430 people east of Dallas .
" We are all just a little shocked .
This is a place where people do not lock their doors .
But that is changing , " Carroll added .
" We can't believe this could happen to a mother and her children .
Not here . "

" The situation is very bad , the situation is getting worse , and the risks are that it could get very bad , " Feldstein said in a speech at the Futures Industry Association meeting in Boca Raton , Florida .
NBER is a private sector group that is considered the arbiter of U.S. business cycles .
Feldstein said the federal funds rate is headed for 2 percent from the current 3 percent .
He added that lower short - term rates from the Federal Reserve would not have the same impact in the current downturn , in terms of reviving economic activity .
" There is n't much traction in monetary policy these days , I 'm afraid , because of a lack of liquidity in the credit markets , " he said .
The Fed 's new credit facility , announced on Tuesday , " can help in a rather small way ... but the underlying risks will remain with the institutions that borrow from the Fed , and this does nothing to change their capital , " Feldstein noted .
Feldstein noted " powerful forces ( that ) will continue to drive inflation higher . "
And while inflation expectations are still relatively well contained , " you wonder how long that 's going to last , " he said .

Suicides of Houston Army recruiter and his wife leave questions of struggle that endured after Iraq
Nils Aron Andersson married Cassy Walton on March 5 , 2007 .
Walton killed herself the day after her husband 's suicide .

Army recruiter Nils Aron Andersson sat behind the wheel of his brand - new Ford F - 150 , firing round after round into the truck 's CD player and radio with a . 22 - caliber semiautomatic pistol .
Spent cartridges littered the seats and floorboards , along with a paper pharmacy bag holding a prescription for the antidepressant Lexapro .
Andersson 's wife , Cassy Walton , had been trying to reach the 25 - year - old sergeant on his cell phone for hours .
He finally picked up about 2 a.m. and told her he wanted to kill himself .
Walton begged him to keep talking to her .
Andersson told her he was on the top floor of a downtown Houston parking garage and ended the call .
Then he put the pistol to his head , just above his right ear .
Minutes later , Walton raced up the stairs of the garage to find her husband of less than 24 hours slumped on the driver 's side of his truck , bleeding from a single bullet wound to his right temple .
Sobbing , she unlocked the truck with her own key , climbed onto his lap , and started CPR .
" Why did you do this ? " she screamed .
When Andersson killed himself on March 6 , 2007 , he became one of at least 16 Army recruiters to commit suicide nationwide since 2000 .
Five of those suicides occurred in Texas , including three at the Houston Recruiting Battalion , where Andersson worked after serving two tours of duty in Iraq .
Roughly one in five U.S. troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan reports symptoms of post - traumatic stress disorder or major depression , but only slightly more than half have sought treatment , according to a recently published Rand Corp. study .
Of those who did seek care , only about half received minimally adequate treatment , the study found .
Amid increasing concerns about failure to screen , diagnose and treat soldiers with mental health problems adequately , Andersson 's story raises questions about the pressures faced by the growing number of veterans who return from multiple combat deployments to high - stress recruiting assignments back home .
Leaving for Iraq
A quiet , skinny kid who loved to fish , hunt and ride ATVs along the Oregon coast , where he was born , Andersson — who preferred his middle name Aron — joined the Army 's 82nd Airborne Division in 2002 , three years after graduating high school .
In 2003 , he left to fight in the initial U.S. - led invasion of Iraq .
It was the first time he'd been abroad in his life .
" I probably prayed more in the first six months than I had in a long while , " said his father , Bob Andersson , 53 , who works for the city parks department in Eugene , Ore .
" Every time the phone rings , you panic .
I 'm not kidding you there ; for months , I 'd come home and I 'd stop at the end of the street and go , ' God , I hope there 's not a car with military plates in front of my house . ' "
Andersson earned a Bronze Star with valor for saving the lives of two other soldiers during a firefight .
But when he came home , the soldier avoided his family 's questions about the war .
Relieved to have him back , they did n't press him .
" When I asked him how he 'd earned his Bronze Star , he just said , ' Doing my job , Dad , ' " Bob Andersson said .
The father remembers looking at photographs taken during his son's service in Iraq and feeling helpless to understand what the young man had been through .
" You can't imagine what was going on , " he said .
" You can see the pictures , but you still were n't there to smell it , or feel the heat , or see the cars burning or what was left of someone after a bomb went off . "
The only thing the father knew for sure was that his son had changed .
He was more frustrated , less patient and harder to talk to .
" Did he come back different ?
Yeah , " Bob Andersson said .
" I do n't think there 's anybody who goes over there and fights on the front lines who ever comes back the same . "
The soldier once told his father about working a barricade in Iraq when a white van barreled toward U.S. troops , ignoring warning shots and orders to stop .
" It was definitely a suicide mission , and he said this van full of people came in and they had to , quote , ' light it up , ' " Bob Andersson said .
" And he said there were children in there and everything .
I could tell that really , really , bothered him . "
Life as a recruiter
When Andersson transferred to the Houston Recruiting Battalion , his father hoped that he would be able to put the past behind him .
Instead , he became more depressed .
" He had a heart of gold and that , I think , is what killed him .
Because he got into something so outrageously different than his basic makeup , and he just could n't get over it . "
As a recruiter stationed in River Oaks and Rosenberg , Andersson often worked six days a week , routinely got home after 11 p.m. , and would sometimes weep from despair and exhaustion , said his ex-girlfriend Marsha Maxey , a mortgage banker who dated the soldier before he met Cassy Walton .
Maxey met Andersson in August 2005 at an Irish pub in Columbia , S.C. , where he was attending recruiter school at Fort Jackson .
" He was a good - looking man — tall , blue eyes , blond hair , smart , funny and kind .
A sensitive guy and a man in uniform , that whole thing , " Maxey said .
" He swept me off my feet . "
Their 14 - year age difference was never a problem , said Maxey , who is 40 .
" It worked out very well because he was an old soul , " she said .
" He 'd seen a lot of things for his young age . "
Two months into a whirlwind romance , she moved to Texas to be with him when Andersson began his new job with the Houston Recruiting Battalion .
" It was instantly an incredibly stressful job , " Maxey said .
" From the beginning since I met him , he cried very easily and I thought , ' Oh , he 's just sensitive , ' but then it got worse . "
Occasionally , Andersson talked to Maxey about his time in Iraq .
The details slipped out in bits and pieces — like a story about surviving a deadly helicopter crash , or carrying a wounded buddy to safety after his unit was ambushed .
" He told me he kicked down over 1,000 doors , " Maxey said .
" He was the lead guy , the first one to go in , and most of the time it was the wrong place .
There would be terrified old people and little kids sitting there . "
Andersson suffered from dramatic mood swings .
He got nervous in big crowds and would wake up in the middle of the night " just screaming , " Maxey said .
Andersson also developed a low self - esteem and an extreme fear of abandonment , she said .
A few months before he committed suicide , he sent Maxey a text message saying he was " going to get rid of himself because he was a monster like Saddam , " she recalled .
" He would just get so distraught over his job and the things he 'd seen , " Maxey said .
" It was more than he could take . "
Mounting pressure
Making matters worse , Andersson felt uncomfortable in the role of salesman for the Army .
He was painfully honest with prospective recruits , even if his candor turned them off , she said .
" He was morally opposed to putting more young men into that situation , where they could be injured or killed or see the things he 'd seen , " Maxey said .
His superiors repeatedly criticized him for failing to meet his goal of signing two new recruits a month and assigned him five - page essays or extra duty as punishment , she said .
In February 2006 , he was passed up for promotion to staff sergeant .
" It was n't that he was lazy or not working .
It 's just that he was not getting recruits and being punished for it , constantly , " she said .
" It was just not the job for him . "
Andersson was proud to be a soldier , but he was n't cut out for recruiting , said his friend Chris Rodriguez .
Long hours , few days off and mounting pressure to deliver fresh volunteers made life " truly awful , " Rodriguez said in a series of e-mails and a telephone interview with the Houston Chronicle from Anbar Province in Iraq , where he was serving a tour of duty at the time of Andersson 's death .
'' In the recruiting station I was at , a good third of the people went on antidepressants while working there , " said Rodriguez , who met Andersson in Texas while assigned to the Houston Recruiting Battalion .
" You could come to work as motivated as you wanted , but as soon as you passed the threshold of the doorway , it 'd suck the life away from you .
Looking around , you 'd see miserable people . "
If recruiters failed to sign up enough prospects , their commanders told them they were failures , Rodriguez said .
" They tell you , ' That 's why your buddy in Iraq does n't have a full battalion , because you 're letting him down , ' " he said .
The stress took its toll .
Back in Iraq , Rodriguez had nightmares about his time recruiting in Houston .
" The pressure recruiting puts on you wears you down so badly , " he said .
" We often said that we 'd rather be in Iraq than recruiting .
It 's true . "
Threats of suicide
By October 2006 , Andersson 's problems had become too serious to ignore .
When he put a gun in his mouth during an argument with Maxey , she called Andersson 's father , who contacted the Army .
When he heard what his father had done , Andersson was furious .
" He said , ' Thanks for ruining my career , Dad , ' " his father said .
" And I said , ' Well , I 'm sorry about that , Aron . '
And he goes , ' Why did you do it ? '
I just told him , ' You know , if something happened to you and I could 've done anything at all to prevent it and I did n't , I could never live with myself .
Because the only thing I 'm sure of in this world is the father 's supposed to die before the children . ' "
The next day , an officer took Andersson to Brooke Army Medical Center at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio , where he underwent three days of tests and counseling .
A psychiatrist determined he was " clinically depressed but no immediate danger to himself , " Army records show .
" The psychiatrist told him he had depression and PTSD ( post - traumatic stress disorder ) and said he would send him a referral for a psychiatrist and therapist in Houston , but he never did , " Maxey said .
" Aron never received any follow - up . "
Medical records from Brooke Army Medical Center show that Andersson was prescribed medication for depression and anxiety after doctors evaluated him for potential self - harm on Oct. 23 , 2006 .
Records also show at least two subsequent appointments were canceled by the facility and one by Andersson .
Meanwhile , Andersson 's commanders at the Houston Recruiting Battalion directed his station in Rosenberg to keep an eye on him and ordered his weapons to be taken away .
But Andersson managed to keep the .22 - caliber pistol he 'd used to threaten suicide .
His parents say their son's commanders and doctors should have monitored him more closely to ensure he was getting the help he needed .
" Obviously , they did not take it seriously enough , " said Andersson 's mother , Charlotte Porter .
" He needed to have a break period .
He needed to be removed from his position and get treatment . "
As a soldier who served his country honorably , Andersson deserved the best possible care , regardless of whether his wounds were physical or mental , his father said .
" I do n't think Aron let the Army down , I think the Army let him down , " he said .
" I think that the care was n't there that he really needed . "
A new relationship
By December 2006 , Andersson still had n't started regular therapy .
As his relationship with Maxey fell apart , he met Cassy Walton , a vivacious investment banker who also struggled with severe depression .
He eventually would leave the Texas Avenue apartment he shared with Maxey at Lofts at the Ballpark to move into Walton 's loft in the old Rice Hotel building , a dozen blocks away .
The day before New Year 's Eve , Andersson threatened suicide again , this time in front of Walton .
In January , Walton sent an e-mail addressed to Andersson and a handful of other people , announcing she planned to kill herself .
Neither went through with their threats , but their deadly brinksmanship worried those around them .
" It 's amazing that two people so volatile could get together like that , " Maxey said .
" I do n't know if they were trying to rescue each other , to keep each other from committing suicide , but it turned out to be the worst combination .
They both needed help so badly . "
Walton had bipolar disorder , commonly known as manic depression , said her sister , Cindy Walton .
It was a condition she shared with their mother , who killed herself in October 2003 by setting her car on fire .
" Cassy was never the same after that , " her sister said .
" She was a real mama 's girl . "
A short , tragic marriage
It was n't until the day the couple married , March 5 , 2007 , that Andersson finally had an appointment with a psychiatrist in Houston .
Afterward , Andersson sent his friend Chris Rodriguez an online message : " I went to the wizard today , she told me that I need to get out of the army and my job sucks .
I could have told her that ... but anyhow .
I will be alright . "
He told Rodriguez he 'd replaced his old Jeep Wrangler with a Ford F - 150 , but he never mentioned he 'd married Cassy Walton in a brief civil ceremony at 8:30 that morning .
Andersson did n't tell his parents or younger brother , John , either .
The newlyweds had agreed to meet up after work , but Andersson came home around 8:45 p.m. to an empty apartment .
His bride was celebrating their marriage with friends at Shay McElroy 's Irish Pub downtown on Main .
Walton later told police Andersson " seemed to be upset because she was not paying as much attention to him as he thought she should be . "
The couple argued .
Andersson stormed out and drove to Maxey 's apartment , where the recruiter told his ex-girlfriend he feared he'd made a big mistake .
Then Walton arrived .
" She was beating on the door like she was going to knock it down , " Maxey said .
" I just thought , ' This is crazy .
I can't put up with this kind of stuff . ' "
Maxey told Andersson she 'd had enough .
" As much as I loved him , I knew I should n't be in that relationship , " she said .
He left about 1:30 a.m. but called her again on his cell phone .
" He said , ' I do n't know what to do , I do n't know what I 'm going to do . ' " Andersson finally agreed to go spend the night with a friend .
Instead , he locked himself inside his new Ford pickup on the top floor of Maxey 's parking garage with the same . 22 - caliber pistol he 'd put in his mouth in October .
Less than an hour later , he was dead .
The phone call
A phone ringing at 3 a.m. jarred Bob Andersson from sleep to the news that his son had killed himself .
He was n't surprised .
" It was really surreal , " he said .
" I 'd been hoping and praying , of course , that it would never happen , and then when it did , there was n't any shock .
I mean , it was n't shock , it was just your worst nightmare . "
He called his son's commanders at the recruiting battalion to tell them Aron had committed suicide .
A sergeant answered the phone .
" He said , ' Oh my God ! Oh my God ! '
Then he called up a major and said , ' I 've got Sgt. Andersson 's dad on the phone , and he says Aron shot himself , ' " Bob Andersson recalled .
" And that 's when I overheard the major ask him , ' How in the hell could he shoot himself ?
We confiscated all his guns . ' "
New threats of suicide
Three hours after Houston police called Andersson 's mother to report her son's suicide , the phone rang again .
On the other end of the line , a woman named Cassy Walton identified herself as Andersson 's wife .
Charlotte Porter , who is divorced from Andersson 's father , knew Walton had been dating her son for about three months .
She had no idea the couple had married less than 24 hours before her son's death .
" I knew about her and that he had moved in with her , " said Porter , 51 , a staffing representative with a temp agency in Eugene .
" I had never met her .
And I 'd never talked to her before , either . "
Police had found Walton sobbing and screaming as she tried to perform CPR on Andersson 's body .
Now , on the phone with her mother - in - law , Walton told Porter she wanted to join him .
" I said , ' Cassy , are you alone ?
You can't be alone , ' " Porter said .
Walton gave her a friend 's phone number to call in Houston .
Porter hung up and immediately dialed the number .
" You need to go to Cassy right now , " she said .
Walton 's friends took her to nearby St. Joseph Medical Center for psychiatric care .
She still wore clothes drenched in her husband 's blood when she voluntarily committed herself .
Her younger sister , Cindy Walton , was relieved to hear her sibling had been hospitalized .
She worried her sister might try to hurt herself now that she 'd lost both her mother and her husband to suicide .
" I understood the hospital was going to hold her for 24 hours because she had mentioned suicide , " she said .
About 8:30 p.m. , however , Cassy Walton checked herself out and asked one of Andersson 's commanders , Maj .
Bruce Finklea , to drive her home .
Finklea dropped Walton off at her apartment with a friend , Amanda Powell .
Later , Powell called Finklea back and asked him to return Walton to the hospital .
But Walton refused to go .
Finklea called 911 .
When police arrived , Walton told them she was not suicidal , just tired .
Police said they saw nothing wrong with her and left .
The next morning , the Houston Recruiting Battalion 's commander , Lt. Col .
Troy Reeves , visited Walton at her apartment , where she also met with a casualty assistance officer .
At some point , however , Walton was left alone again .
She went to a sporting goods store and bought a 9 mm handgun .
Then she started drinking .
A few hours later , Walton called Andersson 's younger brother , John , in Oregon .
Walton said she had a gun and did not want to live .
The Anderssons alerted Houston police , but as officers tried to talk to her through the door of her apartment at Post Rice Lofts , Walton pulled the trigger .
Police found her sprawled on her bed wearing Andersson 's fatigue jacket and dog tags .
She was pronounced dead at 7:45 p.m. March 7 , 2007 — one day after Andersson killed himself , and two days after their wedding .
Mourning a soldier
During a yearlong review of the couple 's suicides by the Chronicle , Army officials declined to answer questions about the circumstances of their deaths , instead referring the newspaper to documents obtained by family members and a reporter through the Freedom of Information Act .
In a written statement , Lt. Col .
Reeves praised Andersson as " an outstanding fallen comrade . "
Although he said privacy laws prevented him from discussing Andersson 's diagnoses , treatment or death , Reeves stressed that the well - being of the battalion 's soldiers is " a priority . "
Whenever commanders become aware of the need for a recruiter or his family to obtain mental health treatment , they " seek recommendations from medical professionals and work diligently to implement these recommendations , " Reeves wrote .
The entire battalion was hit hard by Andersson 's death , he added .
Fellow recruiters held a memorial in Houston , and some traveled to Oregon for his funeral .
" We still feel and grieve the loss of Sgt. Andersson , a brother in arms , whose tragic death still causes us ... to ask questions to which we may never know or fully understand the answers . "
Two families in grief
For Bob Andersson and others left to mourn the young couple , grief is sharpened by regret .
Months after his son's suicide , the father found himself sorting through photographs at his dining room table in Springfield , Ore. , peering at the features of his older child as though he might read some message in his face — a warning , a plea for help , an explanation .
" This is the first thing I think of every morning when I wake up , " he said recently .
" I 've cried more since Aron died than I have the 52 years behind me . "
It took Walton 's sister months to get over her anger toward Andersson .
She had met him only once or twice before her sister suddenly announced they were getting married .
She thought the soldier seemed " cold " and emotionally disconnected .
" I blamed him for a long time .
I actually told his dad I wanted to burn his stuff because I thought my sister just did n't need to meet somebody with such mental problems , " said Cindy Walton , who lives with her 7 - year - old son , Randy , in Humble .
" Now , learning about his sickness , I do n't blame him .
I feel bad for his family because his family 's in pain . "
Two months ago , the 28 - year - old Realtor received a surprise care package from Andersson 's mother , Charlotte Porter .
The box held a snow globe inscribed in memory of her sister .
A few days later , the two women spoke on the phone for the first time and wept , Porter said .
" I suffer , too , every day , and there 's a bond there , " she said .
Porter recently joined a support group for parents with soldiers in Iraq .
Sometimes a parent worried about a son or daughter suffering from post - traumatic stress disorder or depression will ask Porter what they should do .
She 's not sure what to tell them .
Whenever she had asked her son how he was doing , he'd told her he was fine , that she worried too much , that he was trying to get help .
She 'd wanted to believe him .
He was proud , and she did n't want to pry .
Now she wishes she had .
" I feel bad I did n't get to know sooner what was going on , " Porter said .
" I just wish I had walked right into that recruiting office , grabbed him by the collar and said , ' You 're not getting him back until he 's straightened out . ' "

Beef is roasted on a barbecue at in Lobos , 100 km ( 62 miles ) south - east of Argentina 's capital Buenos Aires in this file photo from September 22 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Enrique Marcarian
MONTEVIDEO ( Reuters ) - More than a thousand barbecue fanatics in Uruguay grilled up 12 metric tonnes ( 26,400 lbs ) of beef on Sunday , setting a new Guinness world record while promoting the country ’s succulent top export .
Army personnel set up a grill nearly 1 mile long and firefighters lit six tonnes of charcoal to kick off the gargantuan cookout .
Some 1,250 people grilled the beef and about 20,000 spectators cried with joy when a Guinness judge confirmed the barbecue record had been broken .
“ I ’m very proud to be Uruguayan .
We have the best beef and now we have the world ’s biggest barbecue , ” said one of the volunteer cooks , sporting an apron and chef ’s hat .
The South American country bested a Mexican grilling record from 2006 by a resounding 4 tonnes .
The barbecue was organized by the National Meats Institute , or INAC in Spanish , which tracks beef sales abroad .
Beef exports raked in $ 817 million last year for Uruguay , a laid - back country of some 3.2 million people squeezed between larger neighbors Argentina and Brazil , also major cattle producers .
“ Uruguay is very small , it ’s not known for other events so we have to use these kinds of gimmicks so people find out where Uruguay is and what it has to offer , ” said INAC ’s vice president , Fernando Perez Abella .
LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- David Crane is a man who is n't afraid of a challenge .
When he took the helm at NRG Energy in the winter of 2003 , the company was mired in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings -- just one of many companies caught in the meltdown of the U.S. power generation industry , instigated by the scandalous collapse of Texan power giant Enron in 2001 .
Simulated nuclear reactor controls at British Energy 's Nuclear Power Academy , England .
But five years on , not only are NRG making healthy profits again , they 're facing up to the next challenge -- leading the renaissance of nuclear power in the United States .
In September 2007 , NRG submitted an application for a license to build a nuclear power plant -- the first in the U.S. in almost 30 years .
The proposed new units at the South Texas Project ( STP ) plant in Bay City , Texas will sit alongside two units already housed there .
" Like a lot of other power plants built in the 1970s , the site was originally planned to house multiple units to be built in sequence , " Crane told CNN .
" There is a considerable economic benefit of developing nuclear plants at existing sites . "
NRG -- whose headquarters are in Princeton , New Jersey -- hope to bring the first new STP unit online by 2015 .
It 's estimated that when both units are completed they will provide a further 2700 megawatts of power .
Nuclear power currently contributes just five percent to NRG 's energy portfolio -- 1175 megawatts out of a total of 24,000 megawatts .
Non-renewable sources -- natural gas , coal and oil -- create the lion 's share , and a small but growing list of renewables -- a hydro-electric plant in Brazil and two wind farms under construction -- are also beginning to make an impact .
Since NRG led the way with their license application , the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has received a further six applications for nine more nuclear plants .
But Crane is pessimistic about how quickly new units will actually be built .
" The U.S. Government needs to focus on encouraging the build up of the supply chain in order to get 20 new power plants by 2025 or 30 by 2030 .
Currently , the infrastructure 's just not in place for that .
But we 're moving as fast as we can , " he said .
Crane has over a decade 's worth of expertise in energy economics .
Before he became President and CEO of NRG , he served as Senior Vice President of Lehman Brothers Global Power Group from 1996 to 2000 before moving to International Power , a UK - domiciled wholesale power generation company .
Whilst Crane thinks that the U.S. Government could be doing more to invigorate the sector , private money is beginning to flow into the industry .
In March 2008 , Nuclear Innovation North America ( NINA ) -- a company formed by NRG -- received $ 300 million worth of investment from Toshiba to help build new power plants , in return for a 12 percent equity stake .
Crane hopes the investment will help NRG realize their goal of expanding their portfolio of nuclear units across the country .
" There are attractive opportunities in the North East of the United States where coal is a non-starter , " Crane told CNN .
" And then there is California , which is interesting because Governor Schwartzenegger -- one of the leaders of the global warming movement in the U.S. -- is very pro-nuclear . "
Under existing Californian law , construction of new nuclear plants is banned .
But Crane envisages high - voltage transmission lines taking the power from a nuclear plant in a neighboring state and into California .
NRG 's plans have received plenty of attention in the financial pages but what has been the response , if any , from the American public ?
Crane says opinion polls have proved inconclusive .
Support for nuclear power has ranged from just 30 percent to as much as 80 to 90 percent .
" People want to be reassured , " Crane argues .
" There is basically a lack of understanding as to how civil nuclear power plants do or do not contribute to nuclear proliferation .
But essentially , people who care about the environment realize that nuclear is the only reliable baseload alternative to coal and is a zero carbon emitting source .
" Surprisingly , more criticism has come more from public interest groups who complain that the nuclear industry is the beneficiary of too much government largesse , in the shape of loan guarantees .
Critics argue that this money should go more towards things like wind and solar .
But the government is supporting those as well , " he said .
And he 's convinced that technology has advanced so much that the prospect of another disaster like Chernobyl or Three Mile Island is highly unlikely .
" No one thinks that the U.S. is building nuclear plants the way the Soviets were .
And even at Three Mile Island , no one was killed or seriously injured .
And the area surrounding the plant has n't turned into some sort of cancer alley . "
NRG is a member of the Climate Action Partnership -- a group of business and environmental organizations which is pushing the U.S. Government to impose a carbon regulatory regime .
It 's an issue that Crane has spent a lot of time campaigning for .
He accepts that nuclear power has no chance of impacting global emissions now but says it is more ready for deployment than clean coal -- something NRG are also working hard to achieve .
In the interim , David Crane believes an enormous amount can be accomplished with conservation and efficiency programs , and he 's confident that nuclear power will have a big part to play in climate change mitigation in the future .
Uncertainties remain about how U.S. Government legislation is going to affect the trajectory of carbon emissions over the next 20 years , but Crane says : " By 2050 , people in our industry are going to be making power in a very different way than we do now .
But we need to innovate at a pace that this industry has never done .
That 's where we are trying to be a leader at NRG .
" To solve global warming we need both nuclear and clean coal .
I just can't imagine anyone throwing their hands up and saying ; ' forget nuclear ' .
That , to me , is defeatism of the worst kind . "

Melbourne has more than a million Catholics , up 7 % over the decade to 2006 .
Pentecostals grew 36 % to 30,000 and Baptists 10 % to 51,000 .
Dr Hughes found there was a move away from identifying with particular churches , but this was n't always a movement to no religion .
The " Christian , not further defined " category rose 79 % .
A key finding of Dr Hughes ' analysis , which draws on several other surveys as well as the census , is that agnostics tend to cope less well with personal crises than either religious people or atheists , and that the rise of individualism means people want to work out answers for themselves rather than accept an authority , religious or atheist .
" We are finding that people who do n't know what to believe about life and the world tend to have lower levels of resilience .
They do n't cope as well when the crises of life come , they have a weaker sense of purpose .
" The challenge for our society is to help people come to some sense of clarity about what life is about , whether humanistic or religious .
Without that , people fall into the immediate , the here and now , and often that 's a very consumeristic way of living . "
Dr Hughes said that of the 712,000 ( 19.8 % ) who said they had no religion , 34 % still believed in a higher being and 4 % in a personal God , 22 % did not know , and 40 % were atheist .
" Other surveys suggest many people believe there 's some sort of life force in the universe , some sort of creative power , but a personal God who came to us in Jesus does n't make much sense to them , " he said .
" Younger people , but even those in their 40s and 50s , are not going to just accept the authority of a community , whether atheist or religious .
They want to work it out for themselves , but some feel they do n't have the capacity to work it out . "
Monash University demographer Bob Birrell said the figures reflected the changing nature of Australia 's migration program .
" We 're now drawing large numbers from the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent as well as east Asia , and as far as the no-religion side of the coin is concerned , they reflect the secular trend in Australian society , " he said .
" We have two ends of the spectrum , that migration is fuelling the ranks of religious groups , and yet at the other end , the secular trends are diminishing the ranks of people committed to religious faith . "
MUSLIM Nisa Terzi , 19 BEING born and raised Muslim and being able to practise it freely in Australia , it 's almost natural .
Islam allows me to know my creator and it allows me to live in accordance with the standards that make me a good human being .
And it teaches me to respect others because we 're all God 's creation , irrespective of faith , race and nationality .
It helps me in a social way as well ; it teaches me to be a contributing citizen to make Australia a better place .
This is basically what my sacred text the Koran and Hadiths  ( sayings and accounts of ) the life of the Prophet  tell me to do and this is what I value most .
It gives me a great sense of identity too .
Who am I ?
I 'm an Australian - born Muslim with a Turkish background .
HINDU Adhiti Bhide , 21 IT 'S difficult for me to pinpoint exactly where my religion fits into my life , because it 's so densely intertwined into every aspect of my daily routine , whether it be just removing your shoes when you enter the house , or using only your right hand to give and receive gifts , or making an offering to the deities every time my mum cooks something sweet in the house .
For me Hinduism focuses on fairly simple and basic values like respect and honesty and often I cannot even tell that I act a certain way because of my religion , or because that 's all I 've ever known .
JEWISH Michael Shafar , 17
PERSONALLY , I am not a very devout or religious Jew so my religion appeals to me from a more traditional sense .
My Judaism gives me a strong sense of connectedness with my parents and grandparents because Judaism is a very family - oriented religion and much emphasis is placed on promoting a strong family environment .
Judaism also connects me to the Jewish community around the world , especially in Israel where I have family and to which I will always feel a strong connection .
CATHOLIC James Whelan , 12 I JUST think you should treat others like you want to be treated .
Being Catholic means that if something bad is going on I can pray , or just maybe be nice to that person or help them .
Most Catholics feel a connection to God .
We do n't go to church every week , but I think it 's a place where you just get a bit closer to God and Jesus .
It 's like their home .
It 's like reflecting .
Praying is like taking a step forward and hoping that person does well , and hoping that something comes to them .
I think God and Jesus taught us to do good things for others .
BUDDHIST
Sumudu Perera , 15 I WAS born into a Buddhist family , and since I was young I started going to the temple .
But once I started getting older I started learning about it and making my own decisions .
The good thing about Buddhism is it 's a little bit of a religion but it 's more like a philosophy .
Buddhism gives you freedom to think , query and question , so it 's more like a scientific approach .
To me , it 's better to believe in something after you 've proved it than to just believe it as a faith , and that 's what 's really interesting to me about Buddhism .

McCain to rely on Rove protege for opposition research
From time to time , we ’ve seen reports about John McCain ’s heartfelt intention to run an honorable , above - board campaign , focused on substance .
McCain , we ’re told , has no appetite for ugly campaigning , nasty attacks , guilt by association , and all of the untoward tactics that have come to dominate every election cycle .
It ’s curious , then , that McCain has hired Tim Griffin .
Bob Novak reports :
Indicating what lies ahead is the McCain campaign ’s plan to bring in Tim Griffin , a protege of Karl Rove , who is a leading practitioner of opposition research — the digging up of derogatory information about political opponents .
Although final arrangements have not been pinned down , Griffin would work at the Republican National Committee , as he did during Bush ’s 2004 reelection campaign .
Griffin ’s name may sound familiar .
There ’s a good reason for that .
First , Griffin was a key player in the White House ’s U.S. Attorney purge scandal .
Second , remember “ vote caging ” ?
Griffin sure does .
If you put aside the Republicans ’ law - breaking , cynicism , racism , and assault on democracy , caging is fairly clever .
They target eligible voters for disenfranchisement , send them mail knowing it ’ll be returned , and then use the “ caged ” mail to limit those voters ’ access to the polls .
This is particularly easy for the GOP when targeting soldiers — remember , that ’s the pro-military party — who ca n’t check their mailboxes .
What does this have to do with Griffin and the prosecutor purge scandal ?
Well , Griffin was the research director for the RNC in 2004 and sent a series of confidential emails to Republican Party higher - ups with the suggestive heading “ RE : caging . ”
The emails contained spreadsheets with the heading , “ Caging , ” with lists of homeless men and soldiers deployed in Iraq .
From the point of view of the ongoing DoJ scandal , perhaps what ’s most urgent about the vote - caging claims is that they go a long , long way toward explaining why Karl Rove and Harriet Miers were so determined to get Griffin seated in the Arkansas U.S. Attorney ’s office , and to do so without a confirmation hearing .
If , as the Justice Department has continued to insist , Griffin was eminently qualified for the position , why did he need to be spared the hearing at all costs ?
And once it became clear that he would undergo a hearing , why did Griffin sideline himself with the colorful observation that undergoing Senate confirmation would be “ like volunteering to stand in front of a firing squad in the middle of a three - ring circus ? ” Griffin — who is now in job talks with the Fred Thompson campaign — sure looks like a guy hiding something , and if vote caging is that something , it becomes even more interesting that the White House was pushing him forward .
And now Griffin is going to help McCain out with opposition research .
Just another day in the honorable Republican presidential campaign .
Update : Greg Sargent has more , including a reminder of Griffin digging up old footage that wound up in an ad by the Swift Boat Vets .
Christie ’s auction house in Paris announced last week that an American collector purchased the rare skeleton of a 65 - million - year - old Triceratops .
The three - horned vegetarian was unearthed in the badlands of North Dakota in 2004 and has spent its latest years hidden away in a European collector ’s private museum .
The unnamed buyer , who paid nearly $ 1 million , has given no clue about where this huge fossil will now reside .
Here ’s a suggestion : a public museum , say in Bismarck , N.D. , where scientists , students and thousands of ordinary dinosaur lovers would be allowed to see it .
The last public auction of a dinosaur was more than a decade ago , when Sotheby ’s put Sue , a massive Tyrannosaurus rex ( definitely not a vegetarian ) , on the block .
Sue went for a whopping $ 8.3 million , but the buyer was not someone who planned to keep her hidden in the family chateau .
The Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago purchased Sue with help from a few big corporations , including McDonald ’s and Disney .
John Hoganson , the state paleontologist of North Dakota , says that it would be a “ tragedy ” if this North Dakota skeleton is not available to the public somewhere and that the best of all places would be in its native North Dakota .
How ’s everyone doing amidst this shitty pandemic ?
Me ?
I ’m still here , contemplating about far more important things in my life as if I should reupholster my car seats or simply get new ones .
As I ’ve said before , uncomfortable seats is probably the top problem I ’ve been dealing with my Geo Metro .
My smallish ass has been uncomfortable on these seats for far too long , and it ’s time for some action .
Maybe you too have been contemplating updating the seats cushioning or re-upholstery , and thought to yourself : “ Why the f would I spend any more money on this tin shitbox ? ”
Let me take you down the very logical steps on why , at least for me , it just made sense …
Think About The Car Value
When it comes to the value of a classic car , the car seats are best restored than swapped for new ones .
If it is a rare one , you better think twice because you ’ll certainly decrease the value if you swap it with any other seats .
You can also reupholster the seats to maintain the stock appearance .
In that way , the style of the seat remains the same but is just more comfortable because of the new foam .
However , you should carefully select the materials to use especially if you want to make sure its value does n’t degrade .
If it ’s not that rare , then you can change seats for comfort and practicality ’s sake .
However , you should remember that replacing the seats with non-genuine products will greatly devalue the car whether it is a rare one or not .
Your best bet when it comes to replacement is sourcing original and top condition seats .
It may take you quite some time to find them but if you really want to retain the value of your car , then that is exactly what you should do .
Where To Buy Classic Car Seats ?
If you decide to replace the seats with original classic car seats , you need to find them first .
You can start your search online but be careful because there can be fakes out there .
You can also try your local car shops .
They might have some or they might know someone who has a stash and is willing to part with it at a price .
Reupholstering Car Seats
If you choose to take the reupholstering route , you can either have it reupholstered in a specialty shop or do it yourself .
The good thing about hiring a professional is their experience and knowledge in various techniques like the stitching to use .
They also help ensure that the form of the seats is even and similar to the original .
How damaged the car seats are will greatly affect the cost of the repair , restoration , and reupholstery .
Those that have a few rips are naturally going to cost cheaper than those that need the reshaping of the seats because they have already been disfigured .
The best way to figure out the actual cost it ’s going to take is to ask for a quote .
Some ask questions and give estimates while others will require you to bring the car to the shop to quote the price of the reupholstery service .
On the other hand , you could also take on this as a DIY job .
If you ’ve got plenty of time stuck at home , might as well make yourself busy and useful .
You just might learn a thing or two .
Who knows you might even make a profession out of it .
With my research , I ’ve also come across some people who suggest getting custom car seat covers instead .
This is an option if you do n’t want to spend a lot on reupholstering your car seats but I think it is just like putting a band - aid over a wound .
In some cases , it can work but in others , it ’ll just look good but wo n’t feel as good as reupholstered or replaced car seats .
As for me , I ’m still contemplating on what to do .
I ’ve got the time .
Fourteen years in the making , the Constitution is formulated to keep power in the hands of military officers , even if they change to civilian clothes .
It would guarantee the military 25 percent of the seats in Parliament and control of crucial cabinet posts , along with the right to suspend democratic freedoms at any time .

But while the state - run newspaper urged people on Friday to approve the Constitution , little help was reaching them .
To date , Myanmar has allowed 11 airborne deliveries of aid , which experts say is a fraction of the relief needed if the scale of the disaster is even close to what the Burmese government has claimed .
Much of that has come from the United Nations World Food Program , which said Friday that the aid it had delivered  and intended to distribute to hard - hit regions along the coast  had been seized .
“ All the food aid and equipment that we managed to get in has been confiscated , ” said Paul Risley , a spokesman for the United Nations World Food Program in Bangkok .
After initially saying it would halt deliveries , the agency said later Friday that flights would continue Saturday while the issue is worked out .
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon urged the Myanmar authorities to let aid into the country “ without hindrance ” and said the effect of further delay could be “ truly catastrophic . ”
His spokeswoman , Marie Okabe , said Mr. Ban had been trying for two days without success to get in touch by telephone with Than Shwe , the junta ’s senior general .
“ We have been told that the phone lines are down , ” she said .
Myanmar ’s military junta said in a statement on Friday that it was willing to receive disaster relief from the outside world but would distribute supplies itself rather than allowing in relief workers .
Aid agencies want to coordinate and control their own aid .
Learn HOW it works
The cylindrical shaft driver , forced by the air pressure on its outer wall , moves eccentrically , thereby driving the engines shaft by means of two rolling elements mounted on bearings on the shaft .
The rolling motion of the shaft driver inside the stator is cushioned by a thin film of air .
Timing and duration of the air inlet and exhaust is governed by a slotted timer which is mounted on the output shaft and rotates at the same speed as the engine .
Variation of performance parameters of the motor is easily achieved by varying the time during which the air is allowed to enter the chamber :
A longer air inlet period allows more air to flow into the chamber and therefore results in more torque .
A shorter inlet period will limit the air supply and allows the air in the chamber to perform expansion work at a much higher efficiency .
In this way compressed air ( energy ) consumption can be exchanged for higher torque and power output depending on the requirements of the application .
Engine speed and torque are simply controlled by throttling the volume or pressure of air into the engine .
The Di Pietro engine gives instant torque at zero RPM and can be precisely controlled to give soft start and acceleration control .
If this were n’t so sad , it would be funny :
The problem with federal air marshals ( FAM ) names matching those of suspected terrorists on the no-fly list has persisted for years , say air marshals familiar with the situation .
One air marshal said it has been “ a major problem , where guys are denied boarding by the airline . ”
“ In some cases , planes have departed without any coverage because the airline employees were adamant they would not fly , ” the air marshal said .
“ I ’ve seen guys actually being denied boarding . ”
A second air marshal says one agent “ has been getting harassed for six years because his exact name is on the no-fly list . ”
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
With $ 100 - a- barrel here for now , Goldman Sachs says $ 200 a barrel could be a reality in the not - too - distant future in the case of a " major disruption . "
Goldman on Friday also boosted by $ 10 the low end of its 2008 - 2012 projected range for crude to $ 60 a barrel -- significantly lower than current prices , to be sure , but a possible mark for oil if " normalized " trends return to the marketplace .
With the dollar 's fall continuing and financial markets roiled by the credit crunch , commodities like oil have been drawing the fancy of increasing numbers of investors .
Accordingly , Wall Street firms have been eager to adjust forecasts to incorporate fresh data on the global economy and energy supplies .
Goldman analysts Arjun Murti , Kevin Koh and Michele della Vigna said prices have advanced more quickly than Goldman had forecast back in 2005 , when it predicted a range of $ 50 to $ 105 a barrel as part of its " super - spike " oil theory .
" We characterized the upper end of the band as more likely to be driven by geopolitical turmoil and that recession was a key risk to our view , " the analysts said .
" In fact , oil prices have reached $ 100 a barrel without extraordinary turmoil , and the U.S. currently appears to be in recession . "
Tacking on $ 15 a barrel to all of its oil estimates , Goldman now sees average selling prices of $ 95 a barrel for 2008 , $ 105 a barrel for 2009 and $ 110 a barrel for 2010 .
The high end of its range is now $ 135 a barrel -- but Goldman hinted that prices could be headed even higher .
" As the lack of supply growth and price - insulated non-OECD demand suggest a future rebound in U.S. gross domestic product growth or a major oil supply disruption could lead to $ 150 - $ 200 a barrel oil prices , " Goldman said .
While saying it has a bullish long - term outlook , Goldman acknowledged that oil prices could correct from recent highs .
Favorite picks among energy stocks include Frontier Oil FTO , , Cabot Oil & Gas COG , - 2.38 % and Pride International PDE in the U.S. as well as Eni E , - 2.26 % , Repsol REP , - 3.16 % and Gazprom overseas .
Goldman also reiterated its view that oil prices could fall as normal market conditions return over the next four years .
" The core of our ' super - spike ' view is that oil prices will keep rising until demand declines globally on a multiyear basis , resulting in the return of excess capacity and a lower cost structure , " Goldman 's analysts said .
" Given this view , once excess capacity returns , we think prices can move sharply lower . "
The analysts reiterated their " attractive " view on the European energy sector , but kept a neutral view on the Russian sector due to costs .
It upgraded Transneft and Sibir Energy to neutral from sell after underperformance , and cut Imperial Energy to sell from neutral on capital - spending requirements .
Sometimes an event appears that one crystallizes as totally correct , a justifiable result based on correct application of the facts .
Such a result occurred with the announcement this week that George Bush ’s support figure has plummeted to yet another calamitous low .
Bush ’s rating stands at 25 percent according to the current NBC Poll .
When Dan Abrams , an NBC commentator , spoke about this development on his Friday , June 6 edition on MSNBC , he spoke with justifiable surprise .
As Abrams indicated , generally , even with a record the vast majority of Americans rate as thoroughly abysmal , as has been the case with Bush for some time now , such unfortunate chief executives can at least squeak out a 30 to 35 percent figure .
Richard Nixon represents such an example .
Even in the doldrums of his drowning presidency , when Barry Goldwater , on behalf of a Republican Party frightened that it faced potential extinction , Nixon never plummeted below 30 percent .
With Bush reaching a cataclysmic 25 percent figure this means that he has been deserted by certain members of that seemingly intractable element of Republican permanent support , Rush Limbaugh Dittoheads and Fox News Zombies .
This element constituted such a seemingly immovable force that many of us never dreamt that , in the present political environment , Bush or any other Republican would nosedive to as precipitous a level as 25 percent .
After George Bush ’s forces stole the 2000 presidential election through the combination of the Jeb Bush - Katherine Harris partnership in Florida and a Supreme Court majority in Washington , D.C. , the newly designated chief executive declared that he would end partisan political division in the nation ’s capital .
With Bush ’s two term era of slash and burn with a war launched on lies in Iraq and total fealty to wealthy corporate interests at home to the point where the national debt will soon stand at $ 10 trillion , he has indeed brought us a government the existence of which many never imagined .
As for ending partisan division in Washington , to that extent let us pay Bush his due and consider this one of those occasions when he did not lie to the American people .
Partisan division did end .
The Democratic leadership of Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi , even after the 2006 congressional elections ended the Republican reign in the Senate and House , saw to it that no impeachment proceedings were initiated .
In other words , even after international law is flouted through rushing the country to war predicated on lies , the Bill of Rights has been sacked , and the Geneva Conventions have been brutally abrogated by sanctioning widespread torture , the Democratic leadership disgracefully tiptoed away .
They tiptoed rather than proceeding toward impeachment when the U.S. Constitution mandates such action whenever federal public officials commit “ high crimes and misdemeanors . ”
So never let it be said that George W. Bush along with Dick Cheney did not end division .
With the Democratic leadership rolling over , the Project for the New American Century along with the most rabid elements of the New World Order had the dream world they had long envisioned , albeit a nightmare scenario for Americans caught in their brutal vise .
The part of the scenario that those who have suffered during a corrupt , unethical rule of corporate dictatorship can now enjoy is that , given they got what they wanted , the Bush - Cheney team along with their greedy corporate fellow travelers cannot do what Republicans have done in past years .
They are no longer in a tenable position to blame Democrats .
Hence , the McCain campaign can run on the Bush - Cheney record .
As loyal Republicans , should they not proudly do so ?

The Chinese ambassador was yesterday on the brink of pulling out of the Olympic torch relay through London as MPs condemned her decision to participate in the showpiece event .
Fu Ying had been officially confirmed as one of the 80 torchbearers for Sunday 's relay , which will be policed by thousands of officers amid threats of violent protests against China 's human rights record and its recent crackdown in Tibet .
The Olympic flame is traditionally lit in Olympia , Greece , several months before the opening of the Games .
After the ceremony last month , the torch was flown to Beijing - venue for the 2008 games - and is now on a journey through 130 countries before returning to the Chinese capital for the Games in August .
Yesterday the Chinese embassy appeared to be paving the way for the ambassadors withdrawal by announcing she would probably be needed for other duties on the day .

Spokesman Zhao Shangsen said : " Beijing requires the ambassador to be with the [ Beijing Olympic ] delegation .
She does not know whether she can meet the two demands . "
The news came as MPs debating the situation in Tibet made clear their anger over her participation in Wembley to North Greenwich relay .
Kate Hoey , MP for Vauxhall and the former Labour sports minister told the packed debate at Westminster Hall : " It is quite outrageous that the Chinese ambassador in London is going to be carrying the Olympic torch , the torch of harmony through the streets of London . "
She called for peaceful protests at the event .
Norman Baker , Liberal Democrat MP for Lewes , added : " For the Chinese ambassador to take up that action on Sunday is really to stoke up the flames quite unnecessarily and will add insult to injury " and called for her to reconsider .

The Metropolitan Police will throw a ring of steel around the torch for Sunday 's relay , expected to attract 80,000 spectators .
Police on the ground will be supported by mounted police , police boats on the Thames and a force helicopter , in a massive security operation triggered by fears the relay could be hijacked by anti-Chinese groups .
At least six groups are organising demonstrations along the route .
Officers fear three other Chinese VIPs lined up to carry the torch could also come under threat , while campaigners have been warned that pro-Chinese protesters are planning a counter - attack .
Gordon Brown is due to greet the torch at Downing Street , but Whitehall is expected to be a flashpoint for clashes between the two groups .
Celebrities taking part in the showpiece relay - the longest of its kind in Olympic history - could also embarrass organisers with a protest .
Some are expected to wear " free Tibet " t- shirts and wave pro-Tibet flags .

Fu Ying , the Chinese ambassador , may pull out of Sunday 's Beijing Olympics torch event in London
Former Blue Peter presenter Konnie Huq , one of those taking part , said she had considered pulling out of the relay over China 's crackdown in Tibet , but will use her status as an official torchbearer to protest .
Commander Bob Broadhurst , in charge of the security operation , said : " We will deal with anything swiftly and properly .
I am confident the police will act appropriately . "
Ann Holmes , acting director of the Free - Tibet campaign said that pro-Chinese groups could be violent and warned that in 1999 , during a state visit by the Chinese leader Jiang Zemin , " there was an aggressive response from some members of the Chinese community to Free Tibet 's protest .. and it did get unpleasant . "
She also revealed that a number of celebrity torchbearers have approached the group privately with a view to making a pro-Tibet statement during the relay .
The torch will this year be carried 85,000 miles by 21,880 torch bearers , with the London leg starting at 10.30 am on Sunday morning from Arena Square , next to Wembley Stadium with Sir Steve Redgrave .
Broadcaster Sir Trevor McDonald , newly - retired tennis player Tim Henman and Arsenal and England footballer Theo Walcott will be among the 80 people carrying the torch past street parties , live performances and street performers .
The relay will end at 6 pm at the O2 Arena in North Greenwich , where double Olympic champion Dame Kelly Holmes will use it to ignite a cauldron .
After London , the torch will move on to Paris .
People searching the Internet for information about suicide methods are most likely to come across sites that encourage suicide rather than sites offering help and support , finds a study in the British Medical Journal .
Media reporting of suicide and its portrayal on television are known to influence suicidal behaviour , particularly the choice of method used , but little is known about the influence of the internet .
Recent reports in the popular press have highlighted the existence and possible influence of internet sites that promote suicide and web forums that may encourage suicide in young people .
But despite these recent controversies , the ease with which these sites may be found on the internet has not been systematically documented nor the kind of information they contain been described .
Researchers from the Universities of Bristol , Oxford and Manchester set out to replicate a typical search that might be undertaken by a person looking for instructions and information about methods of suicide using the four most popular search engines -- Google , Yahoo , MSN , and Ask - - and 12 simple search terms .
They analysed the first ten sites from each search , giving a total of 480 hits .
Altogether 240 different sites were found and just under half of these provided some information about methods of suicide .
Almost a fifth of hits ( 90 ) were for dedicated suicide sites , of which half were judged to be encouraging , promoting , or facilitating suicide .

Sixty - two ( 13 % ) sites focused on suicide prevention or offered support and 59 ( 12 % ) sites actively discouraged suicide .
Almost all dedicated suicide and factual information sites provided information about methods of suicide .
But , a fifth ( 21 % ) of support and prevention sites and over half ( 55 % ) of academic or policy sites , and all news reports of suicides also provided information about methods .
Overall , Google and Yahoo retrieved the highest number of dedicated suicide sites , whereas MSN had the highest number of prevention or support sites and academic or policy sites .
In addition , the three most frequently occurring sites were all pro-suicide , whereas the information site Wikipedia was fourth .
All top four sites evaluated methods of suicide including detailed information about speed , certainty , and the likely amount of pain associated with each method .
However , there is currently no regulation of suicide sites in the UK because they are not illegal .
Self - regulation by internet providers and use of filtering software by parents to block sites are the main approaches to reducing potential harm from suicide sites .
However , efforts to remove some of the most detailed technical descriptions of suicide methods may be easily circumvented , say the authors .
They conclude that service providers might pursue website optimisation strategies to maximise the likelihood that sites aimed at preventing suicide are preferentially sourced by people seeking information about suicide methods rather than potentially harmful sites .

Technology reporter , Silicon Valley
Doron Swade is behind the creation of the famed Difference Engine No 2
The world of computing could have been very different to that of today had a machine that was designed over 150 years ago been built at the time .
That is the view of Doron Swade , the man who is behind realising the creation of the famed Difference Engine No 2 which has just gone on display in Silicon Valley .
The reason the machine is so highly regarded is because it is seen as the first attempt at automated computing and viewed as something of a missing link in technology history .
Designed by the 19th Century computer pioneer Charles Babbage , the Difference Engine No 2 is a piece of Victorian technology meant to compute mathematical expressions called polynomials and return results to more than 31 digits , knocking the socks off your souped up pocket calculator .
Added to that it has a printer which stamps the results of its calculations on paper and on a plaster tray .
" You can stand in front of this monster of a machine as a Victorian would have done and still have the sense of wonder a Victorian would have had at that time , " marvels Mr Swade .
" It takes you back 150 years to a branching point in history and allows you to speculate what might have been had this engine been built . "
Personal mission Regardless of the obvious beauty of the machine , Babbage 's vision for it was very practical .
To eliminate human error in tabulation .
Everyone from financiers to scientists and from engineers to astronomers " relied on printed mathematical tables and the fear was that these tables were riddled with errors because they were produced by humans and by hand , " explains Mr Swade .
The machine is viewed as something of a missing link in technology history Despite Babbage 's reputation and government backing , the machine was never manufactured .
The plans were consigned to the dustbin of history until they were fished out by Mr Swade when he was working at the Science Museum in London .
While there he went on to create the world 's first Difference Engine No 2 . which was completed in 1991 .
He says he was driven by a personal mission .
" Babbage failed because of the limitations of the technology of the time , " he says .
" I was staggered to discover that no - one ever tried to prove it could work and I became plagued with the questions , could he have built it then and had he , would it have worked ? " 100 dark years Mr Swade believes Babbage 's failure was a great loss to the world .
It is a calculator by modern standards but in Babbage 's day it would have been called a computer
Doron Swade " Had Charles Babbage been able to build this machine and had he been able to convey this extraordinary vision to his contemporaries , they would have been inspired not to drop the ball , " he says .
" There would not have been what has been called the 100 dark years between his death and the beginning of the electronic era in the 1930s where pioneers of the electronic computer age reinvented all the essential principles of computing largely in ignorance of Babbage 's designs . "
The second Difference Engine No 2 took six years to build , weighs five tonnes and uses 8,000 bronze , iron and steel parts .
When cranked by hand , it performs a balletic symphony as the various bronze columns crunch the numbers .
There is some debate as to whether or not it is a supercomputer or a super calculator .
Mr Swade does nothing to quell the controversy .
" It is a calculator by modern standards but in Babbage 's day it would have been called a computer .
" In his time a human was called a computer .
The people who did the low - level repetitive arithmetic operations were called computers and this machine was designed to replace that labour . "
Early tech industry
The project was bankrolled by Microsoft 's former chief technology officer Nathan Mhyrvold for an unconfirmed $ 1 m .
As an avid collector of old computers , Mr Mhyrvold says he hopes the Difference Engine No 2 will provide the technology industry with a sense of history .
" It is the intellectual origin of the industry I 've been in and the way I 've made all my money . "
" Silicon Valley is a society that drives without rear view mirrors , " he claims .
" There 's an obsession with speed and moving forward and moving fast .
There 's a feeling there 's no point in looking backwards .
I think that is wrong . "
For the next year , the Difference Engine No 2 will be on display at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View , California .
After that it will reside in Mr Mhyrvold 's home along with his other computer artefacts and a dinosaur .
And even though Babbage failed to realise what some describe as his greatest invention , he did not sit back and throw in the towel .
This 19th Century pioneer has left his mark on the world in a myriad of other ways .
He is also credited with inventing the dynamometer , standard railroad gauge , the heliograph ophthalmoscope , occulting lights for lighthouses , uniform postal rates , Greenwich time signals and the cowcatcher , which was mounted on the front of locomotives to push cows off the tracks to help prevent trains being derailed .

Voting is arguably one of the greatest tools society has for change .
Though there are undeniable problems with the current voting system , including voter suppression and barriers in registering , voting is a necessary part of democracy , giving power to the people in critical ways .
Encouraging and empowering those who can vote to show up to the polls is essential — especially given past voter statistics .
For example , only 56 percent of the voting - age population cast ballots in the 2016 presidential election .
Not only that , but only 46 percent of voters ages 18 to 29 actually voted in the 2016 election , the lowest turnout of any age group .
To encourage voting among Gen Z and millennials this election cycle , many fashion brands are releasing voting merch to highlight the importance of political action .
And for consumers , intertwining your personal style with a political message is , well , pretty darn cool .
That ’s especially true when it comes to rocking pieces that actually benefit organizations working to educate and empower voters nationwide .
While any brand can make a necklace or shirt featuring the word “ vote , ” some are using the voting merch trend for good .
For example , brands like Tory Burch , Baublebar , Madewell and many others recently released vote pieces that give back to advocacy organizations and political action nonprofits .
By purchasing and wearing this voting merch , not only are you effectively donating to an organization working on the frontlines of voting education and empowerment , but you are helping to highlight the importance of voting to those around you .
Check out some voting merch that actually gives back to organizations making a difference below .
But before you buy , get registered to vote if you are n’t already .

People were making ethanol at home long before there were cars .
They called it moonshine .
With gas prices going through the roof and everyone worried about global warming , a California company is betting people will jump at the chance to use the same technology to turn sugar into fuel for less than a buck a gallon .
E - Fuel Corporation has unveiled its EFuel 100 MicroFueler , a device about the size of a stacking washer - dryer that uses sugar , yeast and water to make 100 percent ethanol at the push of a button .
" You just open it like a washing machine and dump in your sugar , close the door and push one button , " company founder Tom Quinn told us .
" A few days later , you 've got ethanol . "
Is it really that easy ?
According to Quinn , it is .
The MicroFueler weighs about 200 pounds and hooks up to a water and 110 or 220 volt power supply and wastewater drain just like a washing machine .
It uses raw sugar ( not the refined white stuff ) and a proprietary time - release yeast mixture as feedstock .
You can also use left - over booze if you 've got any lying around .
Toss it all into the fermenting tank , turn on the machine and in seven days you 've got 35 gallons of ethanol .
The MicroFueler has its own pump and hose - just like the pump at your corner gas station - so you can easily fill up your car .
" It 's so simple , anyone can make their own fuel , " Quinn says .
Depending upon the cost of electricity and water , he says , the MicroFueler can produce ethanol for less than $ 1 a gallon .
Quinn likens the MicroFueler to the personal computer and says it will cause the same sort of " paradigm shift . "
" Just as the PC brought desktop computing to the home , E - Fuel will bring the filling station to the home , " he says .
Maybe .
Maybe not .
Making ethanol at home is not as easy as Quinn might have you believe , says Daniel Kammen , director of the Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory at UC - Berkeley .
Making a lot of ethanol has generally required a lot of equipment , he told the New York Times , and quality control can be uneven .
“ There ’s a lot of hurdles you have to overcome .
It ’s entirely possible that they ’ve done it , but skepticism is a virtue , ” Kammen says .
Quinn is not some moonshiner trying to make a quick buck on the alt - fuel craze .
He 's a longtime entrepreneur who patented the motion - control technology Nintendo uses in the Wii .
His partner in the E - Fuel venture is Floyd Butterfield , who has been distilling ethanol for more than 25 years and in 1982 won a California Department of Food and Agriculture contest for best design of an ethanol still .
They say they 've overcome many of the hurdles to making ethanol at home cheaply , easily and efficiently .
Quinn says the biggest breakthrough is the MicroFueler 's membrane distiller , which uses an extremely fine filter to separate water from alcohol at lower temperatures and in fewer steps than conventional methods .
Using sugar as a feedstock makes the process virtually odorless , he says , and leaves the wastewater so clean you can drink it .
It also avoids the food - for - fuel debate that plagues corn - based ethanol because we 're in the midst of a worldwide sugar glut .
A permit from the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms will allow you to make ethanol legally , but running 100 percent ethanol in your car is against the law .
No problem , Quinn says .
Mix it with gasoline to create E - 85 .
Just put a few gallons of gas in your car , then drive home and top it off with ethanol .
Quinn says running sugar - based ethanol will produce about 85 percent fewer carbon emissions than using gasoline .
You 're all set if you 've got a flex - fuel vehicle .
It 's an open question whether switching to home - brewed ethanol will save you much money .
The MicroFueler costs $ 9,995 , although federal tax credits can cut the price to $ 6,998 .
Another $ 16 buys you enough yeast to make about 560 gallons of ethanol , and you 'll have to pay for the sugar and water .
You 'll need as many as 4 gallons of water to make 1 gallon of ethanol .
The sugar is where the math could break down - it currently sells for about 20 cents a pound in the United States , and you need 10 to 14 pounds of it to make a gallon of ethanol .
Factor in the cost of electricty and water and you may not be coming out ahead .
But Quinn says changes in the North American Free Trade Agreement allows the importation of inedible or " ethanol - grade " sugar from Mexico for as little as 2.5 cents a pound and E - Fuel is creating a distribution network to sell it to consumers .
That same distribution network will deliver and install MicroFuelers when E - Fuel begins delivering them at the end of the year , he says .

Thoinot Arbeau , in his 16th century dance manual , first introduces rhythm as it relates to military marching .
That is to say , the beat corresponds to the footfalls of the soldiers .
To spice things up a bit , the period before each bit may be divided into lesser periods , each ending with lesser drum beats .
Similarly , dance steps may be elaborated by introducing extra footfalls before the main footfall .
So rhythm , from the standpoint of dancing , has as its fundamental unit a delay followed by a beat .
During the delay we step , hop , leap , or somesuch , and on the beat one or other foot hits the floor .
Note that this is opposite to how we notate music , in which the fundamental unit is an attack followed by a period of sustain .
Take a single unit :
| | ------
We may divide it into two :
| | | ------
or three :
| | | | ------
The resulting units may then be further subdivided to produce complex rhythms .
Dividing a unit by larger numbers does n't produce as pleasing results as dividing by two or three .
Here is an example demonstrating progressively deeper divisions :
Here is the code I used to generate it :
You will need python , abc2midi and timidity ( or whichever MIDI player you prefer ) .
( Yes this is an ungainly way to generate MIDI , I 'd love to find a less painful way . )
Update :
One still needs to think about what comes after a beat , lest the beat interfere with following beats .
Here 's an example that does this ( and with some further refinements ) :
From a recent Post artice :
Looking at data from every trade made by all investors in Taiwan from 1995 to 1999 , Odean discovered that the " aggregate portfolio of individual investors suffers an annual performance penalty of 3.8 percentage points , " which includes trading costs .
If investors had simply bought the index and not traded at all , they would have done about 3.5 percent better .
The amount of money lost was equivalent to 2.2 percent of Taiwan ’s gross domestic product .
BERLIN ( Reuters ) -
The first screen portrayal of Dracula was so eerie , some critics asked whether the actor himself could be a vampire .
But since his death , little has been done to resurrect Max Schreck ’s reputation -- until now .
Max Schreck as Count Orlok in a scene from F.W. Murnau 's 1922 silent classic " Nosferatu : A Symphony of Horror " .
The first screen portrayal of Dracula was so eerie , some critics asked whether the actor himself could be a vampire .
But since his death , little has been done to resurrect Schreck 's reputation -- until now .

Schreck is best remembered for playing the cadaverous vampire Count Orlok in F.W. Murnau ’s 1922 silent classic “ Nosferatu : A Symphony of Horror , ” the first , unauthorized cinematic adaptation of Bram Stoker ’s novel “ Dracula . ”
The rest of his career has been largely forgotten -- unjustly , in the view of German author Stefan Eickhoff , who has written what he says is the first biography of Schreck .
“ Whoever hopes to discover a vampire will be disappointed , but they will find an actor of real skill and versatility , ” said Eickhoff .
“ Yet he himself remains somewhat shrouded in mystery . ”
“ Nosferatu ” failed to make its lead a star , but achieved such cult status that some film scholars speculated his name -- Schreck means “ fear ” or “ fright ” in German -- was a pseudonym .
In 1953 , Greek - born critic Adonis Kyrou mischievously asked in his book “ Le Surrealisme au Cinema ” whether the actor was a vampire .
The idea caught hold and later inspired a film .
Despite years of research , Eickhoff found there were virtually no anecdotes featuring Schreck , nor any references to him in the memoirs of the many people he had worked with .
Instead , Eickhoff ’s biography provides a detailed chronicle of the career of Schreck , a civil servant ’s son who appeared in around 800 stage and screen roles .
Glimpses into the man behind the actor ’s mask remain few and far between .
Only in death does Schreck ’s character begin to come alive .
The most revealing descriptions of the Berliner come from tributes paid to Schreck after he died suddenly in 1936 .
Eickhoff ’s biography , “ Max Schreck -- Gespenstertheater ” ( Ghost theatre ) is due to be published later this year .
LONER
Contemporaries remembered Schreck , who was married but had no children , as a loyal , conscientious loner with an offbeat sense of humor and a talent for playing the grotesque .
One recalled how he lived in “ a remote and strange world ” and would spend hours walking through dense , dark forests .
“ Nosferatu ” helped propel Murnau to a brief but successful Hollywood career , but Schreck faded from the limelight .
The haunting film , which critics later saw as a metaphor for the collective trauma Germany suffered after defeat in World War One , changed the names of Bram Stoker ’s characters because the filmmakers failed to get permission to adapt his novel .
After the release , Stoker ’s widow sued the production company for breach of copyright , and won a court order to have all prints of the film destroyed .
Since it had already been distributed worldwide , this ultimately proved impossible .
Over time , “ Nosferatu ” became seen internationally as a landmark of early German film and the horror genre -- while Schreck ’s other work has languished in relative obscurity .
Schreck died of heart failure aged 56 , and was buried in an unmarked grave near Berlin , where he was born in 1879 .
In the years that followed , his name has lived on in filmlore , thanks to the undying appeal of his most famous role .
In the 1992 sequel “ Batman Returns , ” Christopher Walken plays a villain called Max Shreck , while in 2000 , E. Elias Merhige ’s movie “ Shadow of the Vampire ” cast Willem Dafoe as Schreck the real - life bloodsucker hired to star in “ Nosferatu . ”
Unlike Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee , stars of later Dracula adaptations , Schreck never reprised the role and spent most of his subsequent film career in small , non -horror parts .
But as an actor , he was the equal of both , said Eickhoff .
“ Their Draculas were refined creatures , whereas Schreck ’s was a more ancient , nightmarish vision , ” he said .
“ In a way , he resembled Lee a bit in that he tested himself in the most varied of roles .
And funnily enough , both of them sang too . ”

Noellee Mowatt has vowed never to call police again – in any situation , even if she 's suffering .
Through choking sobs yesterday morning , Mowatt , 19 , made the pact from a pay phone at a Milton jail , where she 's spending the last few days of her pregnancy .
Due to deliver next Tuesday , the teenager has been detained at Vanier Centre for Women since Thursday , when a justice of the peace denied her bail .
Mowatt , who faces no criminal charges in this case , wo n't be let out until she testifies at her boyfriend 's domestic assault trial on Friday .
" I only made a mistake by calling the cops , " she said .
" This is what I get .
... I 'm never calling the police again – even if I 'm dying , I 'm not going to call them . "
Mowatt , is worried that the stress of being in prison will affect the health of her baby , a girl , and is struggling to understand why she 's being " punished . "
She called police in December to report that her boyfriend Christopher Harbin , 25 , had assaulted her .
Harbin is facing eight charges : four counts of assault , including assault with a weapon , forcible confinement and three counts of breaching probation .
Toronto police said they tried several times to serve the expectant mother with a subpoena to show up in court .
When she was n't present March 20 , a judge issued a material warrant for her arrest .
According to Mowatt 's defence lawyer Lydia Riva , a judge can issue such a warrant if there is evidence someone wo n't respond to a subpoena or is evading a subpoena .
Mowatt , who lived in shelters and a rooming house before her arrest April 1 , said that while she had several conversations with detectives , no one ever asked her to pick up a subpoena or tried to drop one off .
" They 're treating me like I 'm a murderer , " she said .
" I did n't kill anybody .
I did n't do anything wrong . "
Sheamus Murphy , spokesperson for Ontario's Attorney General Chris Bentley , said that he can't comment on the case because it is before the courts , but he did say the facts in this matter have been reviewed by two independent judicial officers – the judge who issued the warrant and the justice of the peace who denied Mowatt bail .
Murphy added that even though it is the job of police to collect evidence , and protecting the victim is always a first priority , " they ca n't always avoid having the complainant testify . "
Mowatt 's incarceration has created a stir within the women 's advocacy community in Toronto .
Several groups said yesterday they can't remember the last time a victim of domestic violence was held in jail on a material warrant .

However , it is not the first time , Murphy confirmed .
Amanda Dale of the YWCA is baffled that such means , which are usually employed to compel other criminals to testify , would be used on someone so vulnerable .
She 's worried about the precedent set by Mowatt 's jail time .
" It 's counterproductive to the broader goal of getting women to leave violent situations , " she said .
" It will have a chilling effect on anyone coming forward and reporting to the police . "
Riva said her client was denied bail last Thursday , despite offers of putting Mowatt under house arrest , having her report daily to police and promising to appear in court for Harbin 's trial .
Mowatt , who immigrated to Canada in 2006 to live with her father , who died last summer , said she sends money , when she has it , back to Jamaica , where her 2 - year - old daughter lives with Mowatt 's mother .
Mowatt said she 's worried about being in jail with women who have hepatitis and HIV .
She 's also anxious about testifying at her boyfriend 's trial .
Harbin supported her , she said , and the two plan to take correspondence courses , raise a family and marry .
She regrets calling the police in December after she and Harbin had an argument and he was " kicking her out . "
" He 's my best friend , " she said .
" He 's a good person .
He 's a good man .
And now they want me to testify .
I 'm going to be way too emotional to say anything . "
IN COMPUTING , buzzwords are in most cases just that .
But the latest , “ cloud computing ” , stands for a real trend : computing is increasingly being supplied as a service over the internet ( depicted as a “ cloud ” in many charts ) .
Still , there is something wrong with the term .
It implies that by moving into the ether , computing is becoming weightless , with no connection to the resource - constrained real world .
In fact the opposite is true .
The corollary of more computing in the sky is more and bigger data centres on earth .
These are warehouses packed with humming electronic gear , and in particular thousands of servers , the powerful computers that crunch and dish up data .
The biggest facilities are the size of half a dozen football pitches and house as many as 80,000 servers ( see article ) .
They are huge energy hogs : in America alone , according to the country 's Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , data centres already account for 1.5 % of electricity consumption .
And this figure is growing .
Data centres consumed 0.6 % of the world 's electricity in 2000 , and 1 % in 2005 .
Globally , they are already responsible for more carbon - dioxide emissions per year than Argentina or the Netherlands , according to a recent study by McKinsey , a consultancy , and the Uptime Institute , a think - tank .
If today 's trends hold , these emissions will have grown four - fold by 2020 , reaching 670 m tonnes .
By some estimates , the carbon footprint of cloud computing will then be larger than that of aviation .
Yet the industry 's attitude towards its growing environmental impact is rather unusual : computer - makers actually seem to enjoy drawing attention to it .
Not for them the defensive approach favoured by the airlines , which is to emphasise the economic benefits of flying , note what a small share of overall emissions it releases and promise that some wondrous technology will lead to reductions in the distant future .
Instead , computer - makers prefer to emphasise the scale of the problem — since that leads naturally to a sales pitch for the various technologies they have devised to mitigate it .
The firms that run data centres are less forthcoming .
A research programme set up by the EPA to establish best practice for data centres has signed up only 54 volunteers , the EPA said this week , which suggests that many companies would rather not reveal how inefficient they are .
On average , McKinsey and the Uptime Institute found , a third of servers run idle .
In most data centres , administrators do not even know which programs run on which servers .
“ Let 's pull the plug and see who calls ” is not just a joke .
This has prompted industry chatter that data centres risk having regulations imposed upon them if they do not pull their socks up .
That would be just fine for vendors , since it would spur sales .
Technologies including multi-core processor chips , more efficient power supplies and smart cooling systems are already available .
So too is software that allocates computing resources more efficiently .
Where they once boasted about performance , computer - makers now talk about performance - per- watt , and emphasise their energy - saving credentials .
“ Slash energy consumption up to 45 % , ” screams an advertisement for Dell , in green type .
“ Virtualise servers to help maximise performance and reduce energy usage .
Implement best practices to enhance efficiency and lower cooling costs . ”
( It makes a change from talk of gigahertz and terabytes . )
Deploying the latest kit could cut the power consumption of data centres in half , according to the EPA .
Doing well by doing good
It is easy to be cynical about all this .
However energy - efficient computers become , the bigger task will be to generate electricity using technologies that do not emit carbon dioxide .
Yet this is one case when market forces and environmentalism align .
A cap - and - trade system or a carbon tax , of course , would make such alignments more commonplace .
But even without putting a price on carbon , there are already plenty of examples , as in computing , where adopting more efficient technology would both save money and help the environment .
Greenery does not have to be motivated by altruism ; and it is far more likely to be effective when it is not .
If it helps to reduce carbon - emissions , self - serving greenery is as good as any other kind .
The planet cannot tell the difference .

Modern human brain .
Image source : Univ. of Wisconsin- Madison Brain Collection .
Scientists at Carnegie Mellon University have taken an important step toward understanding how the human brain codes the meanings of words by creating the first computational model that can predict the unique brain activation patterns associated with names for things that you can see , hear , feel , taste or smell .
Researchers previously have shown that they can use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) to detect which areas of the brain are activated when a person thinks about a specific word .
A Carnegie Mellon team has taken the next step by predicting these activation patterns for concrete nouns — things that are experienced through the senses — for which fMRI data does not yet exist .
The work could eventually lead to the use of brain scans to identify thoughts and could have applications in the study of autism , disorders of thought such as paranoid schizophrenia , and semantic dementias such as Pick ’s disease .
The team , led by computer scientist Tom M. Mitchell and cognitive neuroscientist Marcel Just , constructed the computational model by using fMRI activation patterns for 60 concrete nouns and by statistically analyzing a set of texts totaling more than a trillion words , called a text corpus .
The computer model combines this information about how words are used in text to predict the activation patterns for thousands of concrete nouns contained in the text corpus with accuracies significantly greater than chance .
The findings are being published in the May 30 issue of the journal Science .
“ We believe we have identified a number of the basic building blocks that the brain uses to represent meaning , ” said Mitchell , who heads the School of Computer Science ’s Machine Learning Department .
“ Coupled with computational methods that capture the meaning of a word by how it is used in text files , these building blocks can be assembled to predict neural activation patterns for any concrete noun .
And we have found that these predictions are quite accurate for words where fMRI data is available to test them . ”
Just , a professor of psychology who directs the Center for Cognitive Brain Imaging , said the computational model provides insight into the nature of human thought .
“ We are fundamentally perceivers and actors , ” he said .
“ So the brain represents the meaning of a concrete noun in areas of the brain associated with how people sense it or manipulate it .
The meaning of an apple , for instance , is represented in brain areas responsible for tasting , for smelling , for chewing .
An apple is what you do with it .
Our work is a small but important step in breaking the brain ’s code . ”
In addition to representations in these sensory - motor areas of the brain , the Carnegie Mellon researchers found significant activation in other areas , including frontal areas associated with planning functions and long - term memory .
When someone thinks of an apple , for instance , this might trigger memories of the last time the person ate an apple , or initiate thoughts about how to obtain an apple .
“ This suggests a theory of meaning based on brain function , ” Just added .
In the study , nine subjects underwent fMRI scans while concentrating on 60 stimulus nouns — five words in each of 12 semantic categories including animals , body parts , buildings , clothing , insects , vehicles and vegetables .
To construct their computational model , the researchers used machine learning techniques to analyze the nouns in a trillion - word text corpus that reflects typical English word usage .
For each noun , they calculated how frequently it co-occurs in the text with each of 25 verbs associated with sensory - motor functions , including see , hear , listen , taste , smell , eat , push , drive and lift .
Computational linguists routinely do this statistical analysis as a means of characterizing the use of words .
These 25 verbs appear to be basic building blocks the brain uses for representing meaning , Mitchell said .
By using this statistical information to analyze the fMRI activation patterns gathered for each of the 60 stimulus nouns , they were able to determine how each co-occurrence with one of the 25 verbs affected the activation of each voxel , or 3 - D volume element , within the fMRI brain scans .
To predict the fMRI activation pattern for any concrete noun within the text corpus , the computational model determines the noun ’s co-occurrences within the text with the 25 verbs and builds an activation map based on how those co-occurrences affect each voxel .
In tests , a separate computational model was trained for each of the nine research subjects using 58 of the 60 stimulus nouns and their associated activation patterns .
The model was then used to predict the activation patterns for the remaining two nouns .
For the nine participants , the model had a mean accuracy of 77 percent in matching the predicted activation patterns to the ones observed in the participants ’ brains .
The model proved capable of predicting activation patterns even in semantic areas for which it was untrained .
In tests , the model was retrained with words from all but two of the 12 semantic categories from which the 60 words were drawn , and then tested with stimulus nouns from the omitted categories .
If the categories of vehicles and vegetables were omitted , for instance , the model would be tested with words such as airplane and celery .
In these cases , the mean accuracy of the model ’s prediction dropped to 70 percent , but was still well above chance ( 50 percent ) .
Plans for future work include studying the activation patterns for adjective - noun combinations , prepositional phrases and simple sentences .
The team also plans to study how the brain represents abstract nouns and concepts .

According to the Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz the war in Iraq will cost 3 trillion dollars .
That 's enough to buy over 130 million hybrid cars like a fuel efficient Toyota Prius .
There are about 17 million vehicles sold in the US every year so in theory the American government could give away hybrids for over 7 years .
By that time more than half of the cars on the roads would be fuel efficient and demand for oil in the USA would fall by over 20 % .
That 's the amount this country imports from the Persian Gulf .
Giving a hybrid to every American family is not possible of course but it shows how dear our mistakes can be .
The war has cost the lives of 4000 US soldiers so far .
The estimates for Iraqis vary and death toll might have reached one million ( Guardian :
What is the real death toll in Iraq ? )
So you would think that 1 million dead later we should have learnt something .
But when you look at the energy policy of the USA and European Union one thing becomes clear .
The trouble is far from over .
We are in for more price hikes , food shortages , political unrest and probably more dead .
The high cost of oil ( partly the result of invasion ) is raising the price of fertilisers .
In addition , the drought in Australia and floods in Argentina certainly affected two major food exporters but there is a worse plague on the horizon .
It 's our apetite for biofuels .
In 2005 12 % of American corn was diverted to ethanol production .
In 2006 it was over 16 % and last year 20 % .
The US government wants to see 7.5 billion of gallons of biofuels at the pumps by 2012 - up from 4 billion in 2005 .
By 2017 it is to reach ... 35 billion gallons .
EU leaders agreed to get 10 % of fuels from ethanol & biodiesel to ... fight the climate change .
This noble goal ignores the studies which prove that biofuels , in fact , increase the emissions of CO2 .
When EU declared that it would not buy biofuels grown on land recently cleared from the rainforest Indonesians found a simple solution .
They grow energy plants in places used earlier for food production and then clear the rainforest to make room for rice .
If we do care about the poor and the environment we can find other solutions .
Here are some of them :
As suggested by Gordon Brown and Nicolas Sarkozy EU should lower VAT on hybrids and small , fuel efficient cars to just 5 % .
Invest in research to make biofuels from algea & waste .
Support the development of plug - in hybrids and fully electric vehicles .
Stop subsidising dirty coal & oil and support renewable energy instead as this would not only benefit the environment but would also create hundreds of thousands of green collar jobs .

1. Addressing Someone , Respect
Bowing is nothing less than an art form in Japan , respect pounded into children ’s heads from the moment they enter school .
For tourists , a simple inclination of the head or an attempt at a bow at the waist will usually suffice .
The duration and inclination of the bow is proportionate to the elevation of the person you ’re addressing .
For example , a friend might get a lightning - fast 30 - degree bow ; an office superior might get a slow , extended , 70 - degree bow .
It ’s all about position and circumstance .
In addition to bowing , addressing someone properly is key .
Just as a “ Dr. Smith ” might feel a little insulted if you were to refer to him as “ Smith ” , so would a Japanese if you do not attach the suffix “ san ” to their last name , or “ sama ” if you are trying to be particularly respectful .
Usually children are content with just their first names , but you can add the suffix “ chan ” for girls and “ kun ” for boys if you like .
2. Table Manners
Some simple bullet points here :
If you ’re with a dinner party and receive drinks , wait before raising the glass to your lips .
Everyone will be served , and someone will take the lead , make a speech , raise his drink , and yell “ kampai ! ” ( cheers ) .
You will receive a small wet cloth at most Japanese restaurants .
Use this to wash your hands before eating , then carefully fold it and set it aside on the table .
Do not use it as a napkin , or to touch any part of your face .
Slurping noodles or making loud noises while eating is OK !
In fact , slurping hot food like ramen is polite , to show you are enjoying it .
You may raise bowls to your mouth to make it easier to eat with chopsticks , especially bowls of rice .
Just before digging in , whether it be a seven - course dinner or a sample at a supermarket , it ’s polite to say “ itadakimasu ” ( I will receive ) .
3. No Tipping
There is no tipping in any situation in Japan — cabs , restaurants , personal care .
To tip someone is actually a little insulting ; the services you ’ve asked for are covered by the price given , so why pay more ?
If you are in a large area like Tokyo and ca n’t speak any Japanese , a waiter or waitress might take the extra money you happen to leave rather than force themselves to deal with the awkward situation of explaining the concept of no tipping in broken English .
Just remind yourself : a price is a price .
4. Chopsticks
Depending on the restaurant you decide upon for that evening , you may be required to use chopsticks .
If for some reason you are n’t too adept with chopsticks , try to learn before passing through immigration .
It ’s really not that hard .
One false assumption among many Japanese that ’s slowly being dispelled by time is the “ uniqueness ” of Japan .
Japan is an island nation ; Japan is the only country that has four seasons ; foreigners ca n’t understand Japan ; only Japanese can use chopsticks properly .
I cannot count the number of times I ’ve been told I use Japanese chopsticks with skill and grace , despite the fact I ’ve seen three - year - olds managing just as well .
If you ’re dining with a Japanese , do n’t be surprised if you receive a look of amazement at your ability to eat like a Japanese .
5. Thresholds
Take off your shoes at the entrance to all homes , and most businesses and hotels .
Usually , a rack will be provided to store your shoes , and pair of guest slippers will be sitting nearby ; many Japanese bring a pair of indoor slippers just in case , though .
Never wear slippers when you need to step onto a tatami mat ( used in most Japanese homes and hotels ; the standard unit of measurement for area even today ) , and be careful to remove the toilet slippers waiting for you in the bathroom .
It is extremely bad form , for example , to reenter the main room of a house wearing slippers that have been running across dirty linoleum .
6. Masks
SARS is long gone , though I did happen to see a “ SARS Preparation Kit ” during my brief stay in a Japanese hospital .
Nevertheless , sterilized masks , like the ones you ’d see in the emergency room , are commonly used by salarymen , office ladies , and municipal workers to protect other people from their germs .
Rather sensible when you think about it , as masks do not protect the wearer so much as the ones around him .
The reason could be anything from a slight cold to simply being worried about exposing other people ; do n’t let it concern you on your Japanese vacation .
7. Conformity
When groups of high school students in Japan were asked to identify the dangers facing children today , the majority agreed on the number one threat : individualism .
Japanese society is focused on the group .
Western cultures are focused on the individual .
Does this mean that the Japanese are nothing more that worker bees in a vast hive of steel and concrete ?
Certainly not , but their presentation of such individual qualities are carefully calculated and given in doses .
Drawing attention to yourself as an individual is a huge no - no : do n’t blow your nose in public , try to avoid eating while on the go , and do n’t speak on your cell phone in crowded public areas like trains or buses .
The main problem with this is that foreigners simply can’t avoid standing out ; we stick out like sore thumbs no matter how long we ’ve been here , or how much we know about Japanese culture and society .
As a result , being in Japan gives foreigners the status of D - level celebrities : you ’ll get glances , shouts for attention , calls to have pictures taken with people , requests for autographs ( happened once to me on a southern island ) , and overall just more awareness of being a “ stake that sticks out ” .
8. Bathing
Public bathhouses are alive and well in Japan .
Sento , or neighborhood bathhouses , can be found from the largest area in Shinjuku to a small town on the island of Shikoku .
Onsen , or hot springs , are very popular as weekend excursion resorts .
Unlike in western cultures , the Japanese bath is used after you have washed and rinsed , and feel like soaking in extra - hot water for 10 , 20 , 30 minutes .
It ’s an acquired taste to be sure , but can be very relaxing .
If you happen to be invited into a Japanese household , you will be given the honor of using the bath first , usually before dinner .
Be extra careful so as to not dirty the water in any way ; the sanctity of the ofuro ( bath ) is of utmost importance .
Take the time to visit a sento if you have the opportunity .
These are places without barriers , without regard to skin color , age , or language … well , they are separated by gender with the exception of some mixed - bathing areas .
Lying in the hot water and slowly listening to my heart beat slow down is a time when I feel most attuned to Japanese culture .
9. Speaking English
Japanese will generally assume you are a native English speaker until you prove otherwise .
Even during a short visit , you ’ll see :
A group of schoolchildren in neatly pressed Prussian uniforms walking across the intersection , shouting “ Hello ! Hello ! Hello ! ” as they assess your foreign features
A random person just walking up to you and asking “ Where are you from ? ”
Friendly ?
Certainly .
But I can see how constant celebrity status might get confusing or frustrating for travelers who do n’t speak English .
Although you may speak some or fluent Japanese , the default language of choice is English .
Many Japanese will insist on using their own English language ability , however limited , to converse with foreigners , in spite of the fact that the person on the opposing end may have more knowledge of the local tongue .
10 . Safety
Every Japanese person
I have met warns me to be safe in my travels , to take care of my belongings .
Every foreigner tells me not to worry , nothing can go wrong , nothing will be stolen .
This may be based on individual experience , but there are other issues :
The fear of crime in Japan is high , especially among Japanese citizens .
Murders happen .
I repeat , murders happen .
People are attacked , robbed , assaulted , raped , beaten , and swindled .
However , Japan ’s low crime rate is evident when you see businessmen who have missed the last train sleeping outside on a park bench , or a group of 5 - year - old boys walking by themselves for over a kilometer to make the starting bell at school .
Russian X - ray girl Natasha Demkina still uses her gift to help common people
Natasha Demkina ( born in 1987 , in the city of Saransk ) is hailed in Russia as " the girl with X - ray eyes " .
The girl claims to have the gift of second sight , which enables her to see internal organs of the human body .
She describes her phenomenal abilities it as follows :
Russian X - ray girl Natasha Demkina still uses her gift to help common people
“ I have two sights .
I can switch any minute without reason , should I want to see the state of health of a person , ” Natasha said .
“ This switching makes no difficulty to me ; I just need to think about it .
I can see the full structure of a human body – how internal organs are positioned and how they function .
It ’s hard to explain how I identify diseases .
Afflicted organs produce a kind of radiation .
The second sight is active only in the daytime ; it does not work at night . ”
At the same time Natasha is unable to see her own internal organs .
According to the media , Demkina ’s diagnoses are sometimes more accurate than those made by doctors with the help of up - to - date medical equipment .
However , she did not manage to confirm her abilities during the experiment organized by Discovery Channel on May 1 , 2004 .
She found herself under unfavourable conditions which had been created deliberately during the experiment , Natasha said .

According to Natasha and her parents , she discovered her unusual abilities at the age of ten .
At first Natasha scanned her acquaintances and relatives .
This phenomenon was widely covered by television in the winter of 2003 - 2004 .
At that time Natasha was about to finish school .
In January of 2004 Natasha with her mother were invited to London by the English press and she demonstrated her abilities live on the British television .
She also participated in an experiment organized by The Sun .
The girl demonstrated her extraordinary powers on The Sun reporter Briony Warden , who had suffered multiple injuries in a car accident .
The girl contrived to describe all the fractures of the woman .
In March of 2004 the Discovery Channel got interested in Demkina ’s phenomenon .
This time the test was prepared by the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal ( CSICOP ) and the Commission for Scientific Medicine and Mental Health ( CSMMH ) which took interest in the girl .
The program of experiments was made by the following scientists : Doctor Ray Hyman , the authoritative professor of the University of Oregon , and Doctor Richard Wiseman , Professor of Psychology at the University of Hertfordshire , as well as Andrew Skolnick who has worked as a reporter and editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association for over ten years .
The experiment was as follows : Natasha had to scan seven volunteers .
Six of them had abnormalities shown by X - rays , and one person was healthy .
She had to indicate the number of participant with abnormalities on special cards with description of abnormalities in Russian and English .
If she had guessed five cases out of seven , the commission would have acknowledged that her phenomenon was worthwhile further study .
The terms of the experiment had been coordinated with Natasha and her mother beforehand .
They completely agreed with them .
Volunteers had the following peculiarities : remote vermiform appendix , ablated gullet bottom , metal surgical staples on the chest after a heart operation , artificial joint of the thigh , ablated upper lobe of left lung and a metal plate to cover the skull defect .
Within the experiment the girl gave four correct answers , although her mother had stated that her daughter was never wrong .
Thus , the result was acknowledged as unsatisfactory .
Besides , it took her four hours to establish the diagnoses , though she had said it would take her several minutes .
The test had six rounds .
Before every test they explained to Natasha in detail ( using English and Russian texts and illustrations ) what defect she was to discover .
Her most terrible mistake was her inability to find the metal plate in the skull of one participant .
There were also several violations of the protocol of the tests .
For instance , Natasha arrived earlier than agreed and saw two volunteers going up a long flight of stairs on their way to the building where the experiment was to take place .
In the test room there was Natasha ’s mother , which also breached the original protocol .
Natasha ’s friend who acted as an interpreter during the tests was constantly receiving and sending text messages .
The experiment organizers associated Natasha ’s correct answers with patients whose appearances clearly revealed the state of their health .
For instance , the volunteer without defects was the youngest and the most healthy - looking person in the group .
The man who had undergone a heart operation was the oldest one .
In addition , Natasha chose the only man in a baseball cap as the one who had undergone a skull operation .
Despite the above - mentioned violations , the commission conducted the test and took into consideration that it was not aimed to expose Natasha ’s abilities .
The results were to show whether her abilities deserve further studying .
Natasha Demkina disagreed with conclusions of the committee .
She said she had no experience in scanning several patients at a time .
She also mentioned the hostile atmosphere during theexperiment .
Britain ’s
The Sun obtained an opportunity to conduct their own experiment to confirm unbelievable abilities of the Russian X - ray girl .
At first Natasha Demkina astonished doctors in her own country .
The prodigy child arrived in London together with employees of the British newspaper .
The newspaper published the results of the experiment in one of its issues ( click here to read ) .
The editorial staff was unanimous to choose reporter Briony Warden to test the girl ’s abilities .
The reporter had suffered numerous injures when she was knocked down by a car in October of 2003 .
The woman had not recovered from her injuries at the time when the experiment was held .
Before Natasha appeared in the reporter ’s house in North London , Briony had removed a plate from her leg and concealed all the visible traces of her injures .
As the blonde reporter ( who bears her age well , the editorial staff said ) came to the place of the experiment , she was immediately questioned .
Briony , 36 , said that she had been fully dressed and let the girl scan her .
This is how she described her meeting with the Russian wunderkind :
“ Her pupils dilated and she seemed to have fallen into a trance . ”
“ At first she started scanning the injured part of my back that she called “ a lockout ” .
In fact I have four healing fractures of the back and slight nerve damage . ”
“ She described my pelvis as asymmetrical and pointed to the right side with several fractures .
She pointed at my jaw and said she saw “ some foreign body ” there ” .
Later Briony said that she had a titanic plate there to support bones .
“ The most wonderful moment was when she discovered damage in my left leg . ”
“ In fact both my shin and spellbone are broken .
I was surprised because she found two separate fractures and said that I had problems with bending a knee joint . ”
“ Then she said she saw “ the traces of several metal pins and screws that dinted in the bone ” .
Without seeing the scars she could not know that a fortnight ago my leg was fastened with several pins and screws . ”
“ She even said that the scars left by pins and screws were covered with a new tissue , which was absolutely true , for my last X - ray photography had showed it . ”
Dumbfounded Briony added : “ Natasha is an amazing person .
I was very skeptical until she concentrated on my major fractures .
I was strongly impressed by that .
It seemed that she was looking at my X - ray image .
My consulting orthopaedist alone might know more . ”
After the examination The Sun reporters described the accident that had happened to Briony .
Natasha said that she could see that “ all her injuries would close up well ” .
Natasha understood that she had a gift at the age of ten .
One day she told her mother about the structure of the human body .
The little girl did not know the actual medical terms and she described kidneys as beans and bowels as a goffered hose .
Her mother was scared and she decided to consult experts .
At the doctor ’s Natasha described the structure of his organism .
Doctors were at a loss .
The girl can scan organs , determine their condition , and detect cells , bacteria or viruses in the organism .
She can switch to the second sight at will , but she has terrible headaches after long sessions .
However , she can neither scan nor heal herself .
Tatyana Demkina ( the mother ) tried to conceal the daughter ’s anomaly , but their apartment soon became the place where many sick people would come for help .
Once came a woman who could not become pregnant for nine years .
Natasha agreed to help her and the woman gave birth to a boy in due time .
But the happy family did not even invite Natasha to see the baby .
Natasha dreams of becoming a doctor to do her work legally and save patients .
Her mother consulted experts several times to confirm her daughter ’s gift .
“ We ’ve been hiding our daughter ’s gift for a long time , ” said Nikolai Demkin , Natasha ’s father .
“ But her uniqueness became public property , and after that our family was haunted by reporters .
Local newspapers also wrote about her and some articles brought us much sorrow , ” the man said .
In 2004 Natasha finished school and entered the Medical Department of the Moscow State Medical Stomatological University .
She currently works at the Moscow Center for Special Human Diagnostics .

Three astonishing facts about brand - name pharmaceuticals
How China could poison half the U.S. population
Drugs are n't safe just because they 're not contaminated
The top ten disturbing facts about the pharmaceutical industry 's quality control problem
( NaturalNews ) Remember a couple of years ago how the FDA warned Americans not to buy prescription drugs from Canada because they might be " contaminated by terrorists ? "
I 'm not making that up :
That was the official announcement of an FDA spokesperson , and it was part of their fear strategy for enforcing a monopoly on U.S. consumers so that Big Pharma could continue engaging in rampant price fixing .
The implication in that warning is that drugs purchased in the United States are therefore safer , correct ?
What the FDA did n't tell anyone , however , is that .
So they 're not even made in the U.S. anyway , and drug companies are simply importing them from other countries just like a consumer might do if she drove across the border and bought her medications in Canada or Mexico .
But hold on :
The FDA actually used to run full - page magazine ads warning consumers about the dangers of drugs beingif they were bought from Mexico , Canada or -- God forbid -- the Internet !
Those drugs were dangerous , the FDA warned us , because they were not subjected to rigorous quality control requirements .
The implication in that warning , of course , is that brand - name pharmaceuticals sold in the U.S. at U.S. pharmacies must therefore NOT be contaminated .
Enter the blood - thinning drug Heparin .
This blood - thinning drug , made by Baxter International , was recently discovered by consumers to have been manufactured in China .
Worse yet , the quality controls in China were so low that this FDA approved , brand - name prescription drug was apparentlythat has now resulted in the death of dozens of consumers in the United States .
Sound familiar ?
It 's precisely the scenario dreamed up by the FDA to warn consumers away from pharmaceuticals purchased in Canada , Mexico or elsewhere .
But guess what ?
It turns out that brand - name , FDA - approved prescription drugs sold at monopoly prices right here in the United States are adulterated too !
So far , then , there are three astonishing facts that have come out of this recent news about Heparin : Most U.S. prescription drugs are n't even made in the U.S.
Many U.S. prescription drugs are made in China , a country widely known to have the lowest quality control standards in the world .
U.S. drug companies do n't even run quality control checks on the drugs they import from China !
That third fact should send a chill up your spine .
What it means is that U.S. drug companies contract with cheap , low - end Chinese chemical factories to manufacture their drugs at something like two cents a pill ( which they can mark up to $ 20 a pill or more ... ) , and thenIf it was n't for the fact that so many Americans have now died from this , the whole thing would be quite hilarious .
Why ?
Because the FDA and Big Pharma are always running around touting how " safe " their products are while screaming about how dangerous herbs and supplements are .
And yet .
That Heparin contamination flap would never have happened to an honest nutritional supplement company because they 're always testing their raw materials -- if they buy materials from China , which is known all over the world as the Capitol of Contamination !
Big Pharma , it seems , just skips that step .
Whatever the Chinese throw into their pill bottles , U.S. drug companies just buy it and pass it on to patients and consumers .
Wow .
Talk about trading safety for profits ... So much for the " safety " of Big Pharma 's drugs sold in the United States , huh ?
This is n't something you hear in Big Pharma 's TV ads , is it ?
" Buy Vytorex .
Made in China !
Never tested for contaminants !
Take at your own risk !
" Did you know that You can read more details on that in my article entitledat https://www.naturalnews.com/022654.html
As it turns out , many of the pharmaceuticals manufactured for U.S. drug companies are contaminated with bizarre things like , flecks of paint from factory walls , and who knows what else .
The safety standards are so incredibly low for pharmaceuticals that cheap , low - cost manufacturers in China and elsewhere can apparently put almost anything in the drugs , and .
These drugs are rushed right from the cheap Chinese factories to pharmacy shelves in the United States where gullible consumers -- comforted by the FDA 's proclamations of quality and safety -- swallow these pills and die .
Now , remember the fictional terrorist plot I mentioned above that the FDA used to try to scare Americans away from buying pharmaceuticals from Canada ?
Well what if we someday have a military conflict with China , and the Communist leaders of that country decide to attack the American people through their pharmaceuticals ?
It would be a very simple matter for Chinese authorities to intentionally adulterate the drugs with mildly toxic ingredients or even biological agents ( infectious diseases ) that would sicken American consumers and start to spread through the population .
Since , nobody in America would even have a clue !
People would just pop their antidepressants , erection drugs , cholesterol drugs , heart medications and other pills , only to find that a few days later they were either sick or dead .
With so many " American " drugs manufactured in China , our nation is vulnerable to a massive contamination attack .
Think about that the next time you pop a pill from Big Pharma .
Do you really know where that pill came from ?
Do you really know whether it was ever tested ?
Chances are , it was made in China or Puerto Rico , under highly unsanitary factory conditions , and was never even tested before you bought it .
You know what 's really hilarious in all this news about contaminated drugs like Heparin ?
These drugs are n't even safe when they 're NOT contaminated !
Even if you remove all the adulterated chemicals that are killing people , and even if you get rid of all the factory machine parts being found in pills , and the paint and other physical contaminants from the factory floor , then you 're still left with a pill made withthat can kill you anyway !
Blood thinners , for example , are literally made with .
That 's the proper recipe !
Yes , rat poison .
It 's a chemical that 's been used for over a hundred years to kill rats by causing them to bleed to death internally .
Reduce the dosage to a non-fatal amount , pop it into a capsule , then get the FDA to approve the deadly chemical as " safe " and you know have a medication suitable for humans !
People who take blood thinners are literally poisoning themselves with rat poison .
That is no exaggeration .
So -- here 's the funny part -- if Big Pharma starts checking its drugs for contaminants , it has to be very careful because
There are certain chemical contaminants that they do n't want in the drugs ( chemicals that will kill you overnight ) , but other chemical contaminants that they DO want in the drugs ( chemicals that will keep you in a state of disease for decades ) .
Virtually all pharmaceuticals , technically speaking , are chemical contaminants .
If you really remove all the dangerous chemicals from most pharmaceuticals , you 'd be left with empty capsules .
In summary , be sure to remember these ten facts about the pharmaceutical industry and its quality control failures :
Fact # 1 : Most pharmaceuticals sold in America are NOT made in America .
Drug companies routinely try to hide this fact .
Fact # 2 : Many brand - name pharmaceuticals are contaminated with adulterated chemicals , metal shavings from factory machine parts , or other undesirables .
Fact # 3 : Many brand - name drugs are NOT tested for contaminants before being sold to consumers in the U.S. , Canada and other countries .
Fact # 4 : The FDA does not inspect most factories that make drugs outside the U.S. ( 93 % are never inspected ) Fact # 5 :
There is no law requiring drug companies to state their drugs are " Made in China . " Fact # 6 : Even when pharmaceuticals are not contaminated with deadly chemicals , they 're still often made with other deadly chemicals that are intentionally part of the recipe !
Fact # 7 : The FDA 's response to the Heparin contamination discovery reveals the agency to be a pack of bumbling idiots who have no grasp whatsoever on quality control .
They only discovered the drug contamination AFTER people started dropping dead .
Fact # 8 : If you take pharmaceuticals , you are playing a form of Big Pharma 's Russian Roulette with your life .
There is no guarantee that any pill you take is safe or that it has ever been tested for contamination .
Fact # 9 : The pharmaceutical industry has deceived consumers by implying that drugs bought in the U.S. are somehow safer than drugs purchased in Canada , Mexico or elsewhere .
Fact # 10 : There are fewer inspections required for imported pharmaceuticals than there are for imported orchids !
Remember , too : Nobody in the drug industry -- not the FDA , not Big Pharma , nobody ! -- has ever tested the long - term safety of using multiple prescription drugs .
These chemical cocktails of two , five or a dozen prescription drugs are extremely toxic to the liver , kidneys and other organs , and there is zero scientific evidence showing them to be safe for long - term combined consumption by consumers .
And finally , consider this : , a move that would immediately lift any and all testing requirements and quality control measures since the drug companies would no longer be liable for what 's in their pills !

What 's cute about racist kitsch ? / Are ' Mammy ' and ' Uncle ' replicas OK just because similar antique figurines have become popular ?
1 / 5 Back to Gallery
From an ad found through eBay : " Take a look at this BRAND NEW Pappy Black Chef , 3 - dimensional Table Set. Included in the set are Salt and Pepper shakers and a napkin holder .
This beautiful table set matches one of our Pappy and Mammy design lines .
The chef is so cute with smiles sampling their own recipe !
The set is really beautiful with plenty of detail , vibrant colors and gorgeous design ! "
When I flipped to the page in the catalog , I was n't sure I was seeing right .
It showed exclusive replicas of antique Mammy figures : cookie jars , salt and paper shakers , and tea towels decorated with pictures of pickanniny - like children eating watermelon .
I read the copy , waited for my feelings to settle and looked again .
Perhaps I was taking this too personally ; perhaps enough time has passed since the Urban League and the NAACP campaigns of the 1950s that made it politically incorrect to market these stereotypical images of the caretaking Mammy and the subservient butler .
No one had ever told me that these images were demeaning .
In post -World War II urban areas , in the heyday of the Freedom Marches leading up to the black militant era , I never heard anyone talk about them .
But I knew it when I saw it .
Viewing the catalog , my stomach pitched and clutched while I tried to get a grip on my reason .
But no rationalization allowed me to deny what I saw and what went whirling through my head .
I did n't think of Mammy in " Gone With the Wind , " or Uncle Tom in " Uncle Tom 's Cabin . "
I thought of Vyry in Margaret Walker 's " Jubilee , " the " Gone With the Wind " for black folks that I read in my 20s .
Vyry was not thick and dark - skinned , but a mulatto with long hair and a trim figure .
She took up with a free man ( marriage was not permitted ) who eventually wanted her to go away with him , and she was caught while trying to escape , brought back and whipped , leaving scars she bore the rest of her life .
I look at the pictures of these Mammies and Uncles and I see pain , healed scars from lashes , scars from branding and the unseen scars of rape and loss .
A few months later , I was in a Bay Area flea market walking the aisles , scanning for brightly colored batik shawls , when my eyes snapped to antique figurines of Mammy and Uncle .
The booth was about memorabilia : old Coca Cola signs , chastity belts , old daggers and knives .
All were placed helter - skelter , except the figurines , which were carefully arranged on a curio shelf .
On the table in front were chains and locks and handcuffs , paraphernalia of slavery .
My eyes fell out .
If I had been able to accept the rationale I had heard in the months between what I saw in the catalog and what I saw on that table , it was unacceptable now .
The spokesman for the catalog said the replicas were made because collecting African Americana , one of the terms to describe the phenomena , had become very popular in recent years .
I was never able to talk to the owner of the company despite numerous phone calls and messages , including a visit to the company store on the East Coast .
Oprah has a collection , and so do Whoopi Goldberg and Bill Cosby , the spokesman said .
Oh .
Black people were collecting it , so it was OK now .
Digging a little further , I learned that a lot of the collecting , especially among black people , was not because these images reminded them of what had been in their childhood homes .
On the contrary , it was to preserve it as history that otherwise could be easily forgotten .
The chains and handcuffs as memorabilia are straightforward links to slavery .
More insidious are the things that came afterward .
In the decades after slavery , black people were reviled in this country and yet , in a strange way , loved .
The images -- beautiful and cruel , horrifying and patronizing -- reflected that .
Those images horrify me .
There was Nigger Hair Tobacco , Darkie Toothpaste , Aunt Jemima ( who looked nothing like the way she does now ) and other ads that used Mammies , pickaninnies , Uncles .
Some got updates and name changes ( Bigger Hair , Darlie Toothpaste ) and are still sold today , according to longtime collector Janette Faulkner , who has exhibited memorabilia in a show and book called " Ethnic Notions . "
But these replica cookie jars and postcards from blatantly racist ads are not updates .
They are of their time and speak of the mind - set of that time .
For white entertainers , it was minstrel shows , Al Jolson in blackface , Amos ' n '
Andy on the radio .
For us , it was the foul legacy of Jim Crow , redolent of colored and white drinking fountains , chain gangs , lynchings , the Ku Klux Klan and the day - to - day small and large attacks on black people 's dignity .
Both Faulkner and her antiquing sales partner , Renita Pines , have cultivated a certain emotional distance about the pieces .
Pines , an Oakland teacher , said that the owner of the catalog company , who refused to talk to me , had had Mammy and Uncle figures like those in her house when she was growing up .
Rare now , Pines said , the owner had had them replicated to share them with the public .
Pines herself bought some .
" I did n't have any in my collection , " she said .
And even these replicas will become old sometime , increasing their value .
I followed her reasoning :
At some point even the replicas will fold themselves in with the history from which they had emerged .
But is it the history the manufacturers of replicas are focusing on ?
I do n't think so .
And however nostalgic it might be to some , sharing that nostalgia is n't free .
It takes money .
And the intent is to make money .
By comparison , would it be all right to profit from memorabilia of the Holocaust in Europe ?
Would you pay for the armbands or the yellow stars ?
A client of Faulkner 's , who has been trying to sell those items , has learned that the idea of selling Holocaust memorabilia is very unpopular .
The U.S. Holocaust Museum in Washington , D.C. , has a policy that encourages the donation of such items .
On occasion , the press officer said , an item may be purchased because of its rarity or historical value .
Take it one step further .
Would anyone replicate those armbands for sentimental reasons ?
And make a profit as well ?
Faulkner tells me that stereotypical images of black people are not the only ones around :
Other minorities , including Jews , are targeted .
For new and old collectibles , there is a market for lazy Mexicans , their faces unseen under huge sombreros ; grinning Chinese ; and relics of World War II - era anti- Japanese propaganda .
An essay by Teresa Whitener in Faulkner 's book makes it clear just what the psychological impact is .
" Not all of the objects depicting black people from this period were violent or ugly .
...
For decades after Emancipation , these things enabled their white users to experience the psychological satisfaction of holding blacks in a kind of symbolic slavery .
Indeed these gentler images may have been the most damaging of all , for their message was insidious -- couched in " harmless " humor that invariably reduced blacks to generalized stereotypes .
The black images were intended to amuse , serve and entertain ; they were never shown as intelligent , competent , autonomous humans , equal to whites and worthy of respect . "
In Germany , Russia , China , places where the people making these things are unlikely to have any real acquaintance with the African American experience , Faulkner said , factories are turning out the products that are exported here .
On a trip to New Orleans in May , I was looking for items that conveyed more positive images because my aunt had once brought back a napkin holder that was a doll dressed in gingham .
It spoke of another time , but its features were normal .
But that was hardly what I found .
In shops that stocked manufactured busts of musicians from John Coltrane to Louis Armstrong , figures of African kings and queens , Masai warriors and knickknacks of boys fishing , or a woman reading a Bible , there were also cheap replicas of Mammies and Uncles for household use and decoration .
None of the white clerks would talk to me about them .
Finally , a Cuban woman brought it up as I purchased a Mammy creamer .
" Some people find this offensive , " she ventured .
How long had they been selling it , I asked .
She consulted the shop manager in Spanish : at least since the manager had been there , since 1982 .
Who buys it ?
I was finally able to ask .
Older white tourists from the South , she answered .
" People said they do n't take them up North . "
" Why are you buying it ? " she asked me .
" I am going to break them , " I said .
A few blocks away , a gallery specializing in African and African American prints and sculptures had postcards made from racist advertising posters on a rack between postcards of famous African Americans such as W.E.B. Du Bois , Harriet Tubman and Malcolm X .
I could not understand how they could share the same viewing space .
" I sell it because black people , the people who come in here , ask me for it , " said the proprietor , Khaliq Siddiqi , a Pakistani man who was aware of the historical contradiction .
" Eighty percent want it .
Twenty percent think it 's offensive . "
His father had opened the store as an art gallery like many in the quarter , but began specializing in black works because of requests from black tourists .
I appreciated his honesty , and I bought a poster from him that combined images of the Middle Passage and lynchings and Emmett Till 's ruined body in his casket .
I went back to the Bay Area flea market the next week .
The owners of the booth where I first encountered the slavery paraphernalia were immigrants .
The Mammy figures carefully placed above the chains , locks and handcuffs were no accident .
They knew enough of American history to know what those things represented .
I told the man that I respected his feelings , and I would not try to dissuade him from his request that no pictures be taken .
He would answer no questions about where any of the items had come from or how old they were .
He was curt .
You want it , you buy it , he said .
He had two more hours to make money that day , he said .
This time , like the last time , black people came in and out of his booth , sometimes picking up items from between the handcuffs ( $ 65 ) or right in front of the Mammies , apparently oblivious to what was wrenching my emotions .
Maybe their complacency accounted for the merchant 's ability to sell these things without flinching .
Perhaps that was the case of the white clerks in New Orleans as well .
But the defensiveness of the immigrant flea market seller and the avoidance of the New Orleans clerks is the attitude of people who are not proud of what they are doing .
Perhaps they know that there 's something a little bit wrong here , even if they can't name it .
" I am amazed at how many non -black people bring their children to the Mammy and Uncle displays ( at antique shows ) and say to them , ' Is n't this cute ? ' " Faulkner said .
" That 's why we still deal with oppression -- people teach it to their children . "
In those same shows , she says , there are samples of derogatory figures of Mexicans , Jews , and Asians that she 's never witnessed anybody describing to children as " cute . "
These figures are neither cute nor retro nor nostalgic .
They are racist .
It is time to see them and call them -- no matter which ethnic group they malign -- what they were and are : insulting images of hate .
There are places in Texas and Arkansas , Faulkner said , little truck stops along the highway , where you can find nasty images of Middle Eastern people .
These have all cropped up since Sept. 11 , 2001 .
They sell well , she said .
I stare at her , my naivete showing all over my face .
A Yoruba proverb enters my mind : " Nobody will buy your head if you do n't sell it . "
If it is n't there to sell , it wo n't be bought .
But that choice is up to us .
Hate and money , I think , fear and greed .
They do sell well .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China ’s preparations to launch its first lunar orbiter are on schedule for lift - off later this week , a Chinese official said on Monday , as the country steps up efforts in a new international race for the moon .
The launch of the Chang’e One orbiter is set for Wednesday at 1000 GMT but could take place on the two days after then , depending on conditions , spokesman for the China National Space Administration , Li Guoping , told a news conference .
Li said the orbiter would circle the moon for over a year , mapping and analyzing its surface .
“ It ’s implementation will lay a technological foundation for our country ’s development of deep space exploration activities , ” Li said of the launch .
The United States , Japan and India are also seeking to mark their interest in the moon with fresh exploration efforts .
In 2003 , China became only the third country -- after the United States and the former Soviet Union -- to launch a man into space aboard its own rocket .
In October 2005 , it sent two men into orbit and it plans a space walk by 2008 .
Beijing plans to follow the Chang’e One orbiter -- named after a mythical Chinese goddess who flew to the moon -- with a moon rover mission , probably in 2012 .
Last month , Japan launched its first lunar probe .
India is planning its first unmanned mission to orbit the moon in 2008 .
The United States plans to launch a lunar orbiter next year .
Olbermann special comment slams Bush 's golf ' sacrifice ' RAW STORY
Published : Thursday May 15 , 2008

Print This Email This MSNBC's Keith Olbermann offered a " special comment " Wednesday on President George W. Bush 's remarks during an online interview the day before .
Olbermann explained that his comment would include " two topics a lot of us had foolishly thought , and naively hoped , we would not again have to address .
And a third topic nobody thought a president would ever seriously mention in public ... how he expressed his empathy with the families of the dead in Iraq by giving up golf . "
Olbermann began by singling out Bush 's suggestion that he is concerned that if a Democratic administration pulls out of Iraq , " extremists throughout the Middle East would be emboldened , which would eventually lead to another attack on the United States . "
" The biggest issue we face , " claimed Bush , " is this ideological struggle against cold - blooded killers who will kill people to achieve their political objectives . "
" Has it not dawned on you that the America you have now created now includes cold - blooded killers ? "
Olbermann asked .
" There are those in or formerly in your employ who may yet be charged some day with war crimes .
...
Do you still have no earthly clue that this nation has laid waste to Iraq to achieve your political objectives ?
... Terrorism in Iraq is your creation . "
Olbermann next took issue over Bush 's response to a question about whether he felt he was " misled on Iraq " by inadequate intelligence .
" ' Mislead ' is a strong word , " Bush replied , but he claimed that " intelligence communities all across the world shared the same assessment .
And so I was disappointed to see how flawed our intelligence was . "
" You , Mr. Bush , are responsible for how intelligence communities all around the world shared the same assessment , " Olbermann noted angrily .
" You and the sycophants you dredged up .
...
You , Mr. Bush , threw under the bus all of the subsequent critics .
...
The fiasco of pre-war intelligence , sir , is your fiasco . "
But it was a third remark which , Olbermann stated , " makes the rest of us question not merely his leadership or his judgment but his very suitability to remain in office ... perhaps the most startling reply of this nightmarish blight on our lives as Americans . "
In response to a leading question , Bush explained that he had given up golf in August 2003 because of the growing violence in Iraq .
" I do n't want some mom whose son may have recently died to see the Commander - in - Chief playing golf .
I feel I owe it to the families to be as -- to be in solidarity as best I can with them . "
" Do you think these families , Mr. Bush , their lives blighted forever , care about you playing golf ? "
Olbermann asked indignantly .
" Do you think , sir , they care about you ?
...
You did n't give up your pursuit of this ... morally bankrupting war .
...
You did n't even give up talking about Iraq .
...
You did n't give up your presidency .
...
Four thousand Americans give up their lives and your sacrifice was to give up golf ? "
" The war in Iraq is not about you , " Olbermann concluded .
" It is not , Mr. Bush , about your grief .
...
Your war is about how you accomplished the derangement of two nations .. and about how you sent 4000 Americans to their deaths -- for nothing ! "
" This last piece of advice .
When somebody asks you , sir , about Democrats who must now pull this country back from the abyss ... about the cooked books and fake threats .. about your gallant , self - abnegating sacrifice of your golf game ... shut the hell up ! "

Top hedge fund managers made money in many ways last year , from investing in overseas stock markets to betting that prices of commodities like oil , wheat and copper would rise .
Some , like Mr. Paulson , profited handsomely from the turmoil in the mortgage market ripping through the economy .
As early as 2005 , Mr. Paulson began betting that complex mortgage investments known as collateralized debt obligations would decline in value , much as Wall Street traders bet that shares will drop in price .
In that case , known as shorting , they borrow shares and sell them , wait for the price to fall , buy the shares back at a lower price and return them , pocketing the profit .
Then , over the next two years , Mr. Paulson established two funds to focus on the credit markets .
One of those funds returned 590 percent last year , and the other handed back 353 percent , according to Alpha .
By the end of 2007 , Mr. Paulson sat atop $ 28 billion in assets , up from $ 6 billion 12 months earlier .
Mr. Soros , one of the world ’s most successful speculators and richest men , leapt out of retirement last summer as the market turmoil spread  and he won big .
He made $ 2.9 billion for the year , when his flagship Quantum fund returned almost 32 percent , according to Alpha .
Mr. Simons , a mathematician and former Defense Department code breaker who uses complex computer models to trade , earned $ 2.8 billion .
His flagship Medallion fund returned 73 percent .
Image James H. Simons , once a code breaker , made $ 2.8 billion .
Credit ... Hiroko Masuike for The New York Times
Like Mr. Paulson , Philip Falcone , who founded Harbinger Partners with $ 25 million in June 2001 , cast a winning bet against the mortgage market .
He pulled in returns of 117 percent after fees in 2007 and made $ 1.7 billion .
The trade thrust him from relative obscurity to hedge fund heavyweight : he now manages $ 18 billion .
Harbinger recently won agreement from The New York Times Company to add two members to its board .
Hedge fund managers share their success with their investors , which include wealthy individuals , pension funds and university endowments .
They typically charge annual fees equal to 2 percent of their assets under management , and take a 20 percent cut of any profits .
Obama 's North Carolina Victory Speech
Raleigh , NC | May 06 , 2008
You know , some were saying that North Carolina would be a game - changer in this election .
But today , what North Carolina decided is that the only game that needs changing is the one in Washington , DC .
I want to start by congratulating Senator Clinton on her victory in the state of Indiana .
And I want to thank the people of North Carolina for giving us a victory in a big state , a swing state , and a state where we will compete to win if I am the Democratic nominee for President of the United States .
When this campaign began , Washington did n't give us much of a chance .
But because you came out in the bitter cold , and knocked on doors , and enlisted your friends and neighbors in this cause ; because you stood up to the cynics , and the doubters , and the nay - sayers when we were up and when we were down ; because you still believe that this is our moment , and our time , for change - tonight we stand less than two hundred delegates away from securing the Democratic nomination for President of the United States .
More importantly , because of you , we have seen that it 's possible to overcome the politics of division and distraction ; that it 's possible to overcome the same old negative attacks that are always about scoring points and never about solving our problems .
We 've seen that the American people are n't looking for more spin or more gimmicks , but honest answers about the challenges we face .
That 's what you 've accomplished in this campaign , and that 's how we 'll change this country together .
This has been one of the longest , most closely fought contests in history .
And that 's partly because we have such a formidable opponent in Senator Hillary Clinton .
Tonight , many of the pundits have suggested that this party is inalterably divided - that Senator Clinton 's supporters will not support me , and that my supporters will not support her .
Well I 'm here tonight to tell you that I do n't believe it .
Yes , there have been bruised feelings on both sides .
Yes , each side desperately wants their candidate to win .
But ultimately , this race is not about Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama or John McCain .
This election is about you - the American people - and whether we will have a president and a party that can lead us toward a brighter future .
This primary season may not be over , but when it is , we will have to remember who we are as Democrats - that we are the party of Jefferson and Jackson ; of Roosevelt and Kennedy ; and that we are at our best when we lead with principle ; when we lead with conviction ; when we summon an entire nation around a common purpose - a higher purpose .
This fall , we intend to march forward as one Democratic Party , united by a common vision for this country .
Because we all agree that at this defining moment in history - a moment when we 're facing two wars , an economy in turmoil , a planet in peril - we can't afford to give John McCain the chance to serve out George Bush 's third term .
We need change in America .
The woman I met in Indiana who just lost her job , and her pension , and her insurance when the plant where she worked at her entire life closed down - she can't afford four more years of tax breaks for corporations like the one that shipped her job overseas .
She needs us to give tax breaks to companies that create good jobs here in America .
She can't afford four more years of tax breaks for CEOs like the one who walked away from her company with a multi-million dollar bonus .
She needs middle - class tax relief that will help her pay the skyrocketing price of groceries , and gas , and college tuition .
That 's why I 'm running for President .
The college student I met in Iowa who works the night shift after a full day of class and still can't pay the medical bills for a sister who 's ill - she can't afford four more years of a health care plan that only takes care of the healthy and the wealthy ; that allows insurance companies to discriminate and deny coverage to those Americans who need it most .
She needs us to stand up to those insurance companies and pass a plan that lowers every family 's premiums and gives every uninsured American the same kind of coverage that Members of Congress give themselves .
That 's why I 'm running for President .
The mother in Wisconsin who gave me a bracelet inscribed with the name of the son she lost in Iraq ; the families who pray for their loved ones to come home ; the heroes on their third and fourth and fifth tour of duty - they can't afford four more years of a war that should 've never been authorized and never been waged .
They can't afford four more years of our veterans returning to broken - down barracks and substandard care .
They need us to end a war that is n't making us safer .
They need us to treat them with the care and respect they deserve .
That 's why I 'm running for President .
The man I met in Pennsylvania who lost his job but can't even afford the gas to drive around and look for a new one - he can't afford four more years of an energy policy written by the oil companies and for the oil companies ; a policy that 's not only keeping gas at record prices , but funding both sides of the war on terror and destroying our planet in the process .
He does n't need four more years of Washington policies that sound good , but do n't solve the problem .
He needs us to take a permanent holiday from our oil addiction by making the automakers raise their fuel standards , corporations pay for their pollution , and oil companies invest their record profits in a clean energy future .
That 's the change we need .
And that 's why I 'm running for President .
The people I 've met in small towns and big cities across this country understand that government can't solve all our problems - and we do n't expect it to .
We believe in hard work .
We believe in personal responsibility and self - reliance .
But we also believe that we have a larger responsibility to one another as Americans - that America is a place - that America is the place - where you can make it if you try .
That no matter how much money you start with or where you come from or who your parents are , opportunity is yours if you 're willing to reach for it and work for it .
It 's the idea that while there are few guarantees in life , you should be able to count on a job that pays the bills ; health care for when you need it ; a pension for when you retire ; an education for your children that will allow them to fulfill their God - given potential .
That 's the America we believe in .
That 's the America I know .
This is the country that gave my grandfather a chance to go to college on the GI Bill when he came home from World War II ; a country that gave him and my grandmother the chance to buy their first home with a loan from the government .
This is the country that made it possible for my mother - a single parent who had to go on food stamps at one point - to send my sister and me to the best schools in the country on scholarships .
This is the country that allowed my father - in - law - a city worker at a South Side water filtration plant - to provide for his wife and two children on a single salary .
This is a man who was diagnosed at age thirty with multiple sclerosis - who relied on a walker to get himself to work .
And yet , every day he went , and he labored , and he sent my wife and her brother to one of the best colleges in the nation .
It was a job that did n't just give him a paycheck , but a sense of dignity and self - worth .
It was an America that did n't just reward wealth , but the work and the workers who created it .
Somewhere along the way , between all the bickering and the influence - peddling and the game - playing of the last few decades , Washington and Wall Street have lost touch with these values .
And while I honor John McCain 's service to his country , his ideas for America are out of touch with these values .
His plans for the future are nothing more than the failed policies of the past .
And his plan to win in November appears to come from the very same playbook that his side has used time after time in election after election .
Yes , we know what 's coming .
We 've seen it already .
The same names and labels they always pin on everyone who does n't agree with all their ideas .
The same efforts to distract us from the issues that affect our lives by pouncing on every gaffe and association and fake controversy in the hope that the media will play along .
The attempts to play on our fears and exploit our differences to turn us against each other for pure political gain - to slice and dice this country into Red States and Blue States ; blue - collar and white - collar ; white and black , and brown .
This is what they will do - no matter which one of us is the nominee .
The question , then , is not what kind of campaign they 'll run , it 's what kind of campaign we will run .
It 's what we will do to make this year different .
I did n't get into race thinking that I could avoid this kind of politics , but I am running for President because this is the time to end it .
We will end it this time not because I 'm perfect - I think by now this campaign has reminded all of us of that .
We will end it not by duplicating the same tactics and the same strategies as the other side , because that will just lead us down the same path of polarization and gridlock .
We will end it by telling the truth - forcefully , repeatedly , confidently - and by trusting that the American people will embrace the need for change .
Because that 's how we 've always changed this country - not from the top - down , but from the bottom - up ; when you - the American people - decide that the stakes are too high and the challenges are too great .
The other side can label and name - call all they want , but I trust the American people to recognize that it's not surrender to end the war in Iraq so that we can rebuild our military and go after al Qaeda 's leaders .
I trust the American people to understand that it 's not weakness , but wisdom to talk not just to our friends , but our enemies - like Roosevelt did , and Kennedy did , and Truman did .
I trust the American people to realize that while we do n't need big government , we do need a government that stands up for families who are being tricked out of their homes by Wall Street predators ; a government that stands up for the middle - class by giving them a tax break ; a government that ensures that no American will ever lose their life savings just because their child gets sick .
Security and opportunity ; compassion and prosperity are n't liberal values or conservative values - they 're American values .
Most of all , I trust the American people 's desire to no longer be defined by our differences .
Because no matter where I 've been in this country - whether it was the corn fields of Iowa or the textile mills of the Carolinas ; the streets of San Antonio or the foothills of Georgia - I 've found that while we may have different stories , we hold common hopes .
We may not look the same or come from the same place , but we want to move in the same direction - towards a better future for our children and our grandchildren .
That 's why I 'm in this race .
I love this country too much to see it divided and distracted at this moment in history .
I believe in our ability to perfect this union because it 's the only reason I 'm standing here today .
And I know the promise of America because I have lived it .
It is the light of opportunity that led my father across an ocean .
It is the founding ideals that the flag draped over my grandfather 's coffin stands for - it is life , and liberty , and the pursuit of happiness .
It 's the simple truth I learned all those years ago when I worked in the shadows of a shuttered steel mill on the South Side of Chicago - that in this country , justice can be won against the greatest of odds ; hope can find its way back to the darkest of corners ; and when we are told that we cannot bring about the change that we seek , we answer with one voice - yes we can .
So do n't ever forget that this election is not about me , or any candidate .
Do n't ever forget that this campaign is about you - about your hopes , about your dreams , about your struggles , about securing your portion of the American Dream .
Do n't ever forget that we have a choice in this country - that we can choose not to be divided ; that we can choose not to be afraid ; that we can still choose this moment to finally come together and solve the problems we 've talked about all those other years in all those other elections .
This time can be different than all the rest .
This time we can face down those who say our road is too long ; that our climb is too steep ; that we can no longer achieve the change that we seek .
This is our time to answer the call that so many generations of Americans have answered before - by insisting that by hard work , and by sacrifice , the American Dream will endure .
Thank you , and may God Bless the United States of America .

Zach Feinstein is the dark horse in this years NBA Draft , the dark horse because he ’s managed to register himself despite having no serious basketball playing experience .
Zach explains :
“ The short story is that I , Zachary Feinstein , have declared for the 2008 NBA Draft .
As a 5 ’ 8 ” 130 pound Caucasian , I am the perfect candidate for professional basketball .
Also , I do not play basketball .
You see , I am not currently on my college ’s basketball team ( Division 3 just for reference ) nor did I try out to be .
I was at no point on my high school ’s basketball team nor did I try out to be .
I was at no point on my middle school ’s basketball team nor did I try out to be .
The last time I was on a basketball team was before Bill Clinton got caught with his pants down .
So there you have it , I , Zach Feinstein , am in the 2008 NBA Draft . ”
Cops in Washington DC could soon be compelled to fit their pistols with cameras that would record gunsight video in every situation in which the weapons were drawn , according to reports .
According to US network NBC , District of Columbia council member Harry " Tommy " Thomas has introduced a draft local bill which would compel city plods to fit their shooters with under - barrel cam modules .
The bill is under consideration by the DC judicial committee .
Gun camera technology is relatively simple to make , and is already available off the shelf .
Most modern semi-automatic pistols have mounting rails beneath the frame allowing accessories such as tactical lights or laser sights to be attached , and cameras can easily be fitted to these .
Typically the camera is set to start recording both sound and video as soon as the weapon is drawn from its holster - a rare event for most American police officers , other than on the firing range .
Such cameras are on trial with US cops , but are n't yet in routine use .
The idea is that they could safeguard police from malicious accusations of wrongful shooting - and also , of course , make it much easier to penalise police in the case of mistakes or trigger - happiness .
Pistol - cams are being tried out at the moment by cops in Orange County , New York , following a controversial shooting by plods in the city of Newburgh .
In the case of Antonio Bryant , shot dead by police in 2006 , the street version of the story differs massively from the one told by the cops .
Local politicians - and some senior police officers - believe that gun cameras could enhance community relations in future cases by providing solid proof that cops have acted reasonably .
Presumably this would involve making shooting footage public in some way - perhaps via YouTube , the favoured channel for the plods ' enemies to distribute their propaganda .
This would be technically simple , current gun-cam models being fitted with mini-USB connections .
Others reckon that the knowledge of being recorded will ensure that officers stick more strictly to their rules of engagement .
Newburgh top cop Eric Paolilli said : " We believe it is a cutting edge technology that will enhance police officer training and it will enable us to better our cooperation and interaction with the City of Newburgh community . "
However , he also suggested that shoulder or head - mouted cams of the type sometimes used by British cops , parking - enforcement people and even lollipop crossing guards would also be good .
This would prevent harassed plods from drawing their guns simply to get a situation on video .
Police officers ' union representatives in Newburgh , on the other hand , have predicted stiff resistance from their membership to the idea of gun-cams .
Though presumably only the guilty cops would have anything to fear .
In Orange County , anyway , there is no roadmap toward the kit being routinely deployed .
But in Washington DC , if Thomas gets his way , things could move faster .
The US capital has serious community - vs - police issues and a high rate of gun violence .
A camera option is also available for the Taser electric stungun , which tends to get a lot more attention when used than ordinary firearms - certainly in countries where police are routinely armed , anyway .
This has meant that the Taser - cam has actually been available for longer than the pistol - cam . ®
Mike Shroepfer , Mozilla VP of Technology announced today a draft plan for Firefox and the Mozilla platform beyond the upcoming Firefox 3 ( and attached Mozilla platform 1.9 ) release next June .
Most notable is Firefox 3.1 , the next update to the Firefox 3 branch .
It would add a few features that were not ready to ship in Firefox 3 development time frame .
Among the most relevant :
Support for the < video > as defined in the HTML 5 specification .
Chris Double has been working on this for about a year now and there are even a few experimental Firefox builds featuring it with native Theora ( Ogg ) support .
Whether or not a certain codec must be part of the specification was the subject of a lengthy discussion last year .
Sadly , one of the reasons to oppose Theora as a mandatory codec is the fear of a submarine patent that could make browser vendors vulnerable to a patent lawsuit .
Support for cross-site XMLHttpRequests ( XHR ) which would allow more powerful web applications and an easier way to implement mashup .
Support for cross site XHR was pulled out of Firefox 3 code due to ate changes to the specification .
More power for Firefox 3 ’s location bar .
Mike Beltzner , Firefox 3 lead , talked recently about how the search and location bars could be merged .
In an intuitive way .
SeaMonkey - and the Mozilla suite before - already does this but the implementation is not the most discoverable .
More performance tuning , better system integration .
Native JSON DOM binding , a powerful feature for web developers .
It would branch from the Mozilla2 code ( known as mozilla - central , in the works for eight months already ) sometime this summer , in Mercurial , the new version control system Mozilla is moving to from CVS .
Firefox 3.1 would be targeted for this year ’s to intentionally coincide with Firefox Mobile ( Fennec ) development and release , making it the fastest update in Firefox history .
It usually takes about a year between releases .
Firefox 4 is targeted for late 2009 ( back to year long development cycles ) and would introduce Mozilla2 , an extensive update to the Mozilla platform to feature highlights like ActionMonkey , the merge of Mozilla ’s JavaScript engine ( SpiderMonkey ) and Tamarin , Adobe ’s JavaScript virtual machine open - sourced in late 2006 .

This A protester has been charged with disorderly conduct after yelling at former President Bill Clinton during a campaign stop .
The Corpus Christi Caller - Times says that the man was holding a sign saying the Sept. 11 attacks were an inside job as Clinton spoke .
The man yelled at Clinton later as the former president shook hands with the crowd .
Police were approaching the man when someone in the crowd grabbed his sign and tore it in half .
The paper says the unidentified man screamed at officers to protect his First Amendment rights .
Police handcuffed the man and took him to a patrol car and said he would be charged with disorderly conduct .
Campaigning for his former first lady , Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton , he spoke Monday to fewer than 1,000 people in a gym at the University of Texas - Pan American in Edinburg , touching on his wife 's plans to reinvigorate the economy , provide health insurance and make college affordable .
In his 17 - minute speech , Clinton did not mention his wife 's rival , Barack Obama .
Obama spoke to more than 5,000 on the campus two weeks ago .
Last month , the former president had an angry response to another 9/11 protester , as RAW STORY reported .
" 9/11 was not an inside job , it was an Osama Bin Laden job , " Clinton said at a campaign event in Denver .
" We look like idiots , folks , denying that the people who murdered our fellow citizens did n't when they are continuing to murder people all around the world , " he added .
" So we heard from you , you go away . " ( with wire reports )

I upgraded the engine to a double cam setup and voila , promptly got 440 rpms more .
For now i'm running the engine completly unlubed .
If i optimize it a bit further i think i can make it to 1600 rpms .
I wonder how an inline 4 would go ..... ( insert manical evil scientist laughter here ... ) :)
Is Wireless Power Closer Than We Think ?
May 2nd , 2008 by Timothy B. Hurst
Tesla Would Be Proud
A few years back , Marin Soljačić was driven from bed by the insistent beeping of his mobile phone .
But it was n’t beeping for him to answer it , it was beeping for him to plug it in .
Since that night , the assistant professor of physics at MIT , has been thinking about ways to start his phone charging as soon as he enters his home – without the need for plugs or wires .
Jennifer Chu at Technology Review writes that Soljačić considered using radio waves , but found that most of their energy would be lost in transmission .
Targeted methods like lasers require a clear line - of - sight and could be dangerous for anything in their way .
According to Chu , he eventually settled on a phenomenon called magnetic resonance coupling , in which two objects tuned to the same frequency exchange energy strongly but interact only weakly with other objects .
“ A classic example is a set of wine glasses , each filled to a different level so that it vibrates at a different sound frequency .
If a singer hits a pitch that matches the frequency of one glass , the glass might absorb so much acoustic energy that it will shatter ; the other glasses remain unaffected . ”
Now , Soljačić and his team have successfully demonstrated the use of magnetic resonance coupling to power a 60 watt light bulb from a distance of roughly two meters – and through a thin wall .
The most effective setup , thus far , transfers power over a distance of two meters with about 50 percent efficiency .
The team is looking at other materials to decrease coil size and boost efficiency .
“ While ideally it would be nice to have efficiencies at 100 percent , ” says Soljačić .
“ So realistically , 70 to 80 percent could be possible for a typical application . ”
While some wireless power technologies have emerged in the marketplace , Soljačić ’s technique differs in that it might one day enable devices to recharge automatically , whenever they come within range of a wireless transmitter .

Modern democratic politics sometimes seems to have been reduced to a game of hunt the hypocrite .
Politicians who do not practise what they preach are an affront to democratic sensibilities , because they seem to be setting themselves apart from the rest of us , obeying their own private rules .
The same goes for politicians who do not tell us what they really believe ( which is the classical definition of a hypocrite - someone who " masks " the real person underneath ) .
We want our politicians to be sincere , so that we can know they are not hiding anything from us .
So all politicians are ceaselessly probed for the little inconsistencies , double standards , concealments and obfuscations that indicate a hypocrite , by opponents who know what damage that label can do .
Almost all negative political advertising is essentially an attempt to show that a rival candidate for office is not as good as he or she pretends to be .
And that 's why negative advertising works .
This obsession with sincerity , and loathing of bogus sentiment , has benefited some politicians and damaged others .
George W Bush , Tony Blair , John McCain and Barack Obama have all taken advantage of the premium we place on politicians who seem to be comfortable in their own skin , and with their own values ; Al Gore , John Kerry , Gordon Brown and Hillary Clinton have all suffered from appearing to hold something back , so that we can never be sure who it is we are dealing with .
Brown in particular is paying the price for his inability to come to terms with the new confessional politics .
People want to know who he really is , but if what he is really is a cautious and reserved politician who plays the percentages , then the public do n't want to know .
So he is forced to tour the daytime - TV sofas trying to show his human side , and ends up revealing only how uncomfortable he is with the politics of self - revelation .
His caution and his constant calculation make him look like a man in a mask - the classic hypocrite with something to hide .
But there are n't really any winners here .
The sincere politicians soon find that they too look like people with something to hide , since no one can withstand the scrutiny of the 24 - hour news cycle .
They also discover that no one can survive without chipping away at the sincerity of their opponents .
McCain and Obama want to offer a truth - telling politics that stands above partisan bickering , but they also have to make sure that no one is fooled by the fake versions on offer elsewhere .
So the straight - talking politicians , as they allow their proxies to rubbish their rivals , end up looking like hypocrites too .
This dance of hypocrisy and anti-hypocrisy , the endless round of masking and unmasking that is electoral politics , can be profoundly frustrating and debilitating , not just for the politicians , but for all the political commentators who want to escape from it .
Most journalists long to take politics to some higher plane of argument , where the truth can be told , yet find themselves reduced to reporting on the name - calling that passes for political debate .
Looking for a way out from all this double - talk , they often start looking back , nostalgically , to the one writer who retains a reputation for never having compromised in telling it like it is .
Enter George Orwell , the great scourge of political hypocrisy and cant , whose name now acts as a kind of shorthand for integrity in the face of the temptations of hypocrisy .
Orwell has become the patron saint of all those journalists who think most other journalists are no longer up to the job of wading through the bullshit of contemporary political life .
" To see what is in front of one 's nose needs a constant struggle , " Orwell wrote , and this is the dictum that stands at the head of Andrew Sullivan 's influential ( and passionately pro-Obama ) blog , " The Daily Dish " , where he lays into anyone ( particularly anyone called Clinton ) who does n't match up to Orwell 's standards of straight - talking .
What writers such as Sullivan love about Orwell is his apparently limitless contempt for obfuscation , euphemism and deceit .
Orwell believed that good prose should be like a window - pane , allowing you to see through to the world behind .
He also believed that most people talking about politics were simply smearing the window with grimy clichés .
Orwell 's loathing of certain kinds of hypocrisy has also made him the patron saint of those journalists who want to defend the war on terror against what they see as the grotesque double standards of its critics .
During the second world war , Orwell used to excoriate leftists who would happily criticise Roosevelt and Churchill but would n't say a word against Stalin .
Replace the first two with Bush and Blair , and Stalin with Bin Laden or Saddam , and Orwell - lovers such as Christopher Hitchens think you have history repeating itself .
The leading American neoconservative William Kristol recently wrote an article in which he says that browsing Orwell in an airport store reminded him once again why Democrats in the US may not be fit to govern : their " sniggering " attitude to American failure in Iraq shows that " they no longer even try to imagine what action and responsibility are like " .
But using
Orwell the anti-hypocrite as a stick to beat up anyone whose political values are not entirely consistent and robust in their defence of freedom is too easy , and it is wrong .
Orwell himself was by no means a straightforward anti-hypocrite , and his attitude to hypocrisy is both more interesting , and more complicated , than his present - day champions would have us believe .
Orwell does offer us a way out , but only if we stop treating him as someone who can save us from the curse of hypocrisy .
Instead ,
Orwell shows us that the only escape from the most corrosive forms of hypocrisy is to accept that other forms of hypocrisy are unavoidable .
He wanted the language of power to be transparent , but that did not mean that he thought either people or the political systems they inhabited should be transparent as well .
He also accepted that hypocrisy in politics is invariably preferable to its opposite - an excess of sincerity .
There were many forms of politics that Orwell was prepared to countenance in which a kind of double standard , hypocrisy or deliberate concealment was being practised , so long as that concealment had an element of truthfulness about it .
What I am thinking of in particular is Orwell 's defence of the various , complicated hypocrisies of being English .
Take , for example , Orwell 's treatment of two very English writers whose political views he emphatically did not share : Rudyard Kipling and PG Wodehouse .
Orwell was willing to stick up for both of them , and in both cases it was because , whatever might be said against them , they were at least to be preferred to those who used hypocrisy as a stick to beat them with .
So , while Kipling 's imperialism was repugnant to Orwell - " it is no use pretending , " he wrote , " that Kipling 's view of life , as a whole , can be accepted or even forgiven by any civilised person " - Kipling himself was not , for a variety of different reasons .
First ,
Orwell felt that Kipling was at least open about his prejudices .
He had a world - view that he was willing to defend for what it was , and as such he stood in obvious contrast to those " humanitarian " hypocrites who condemned empire while relying on its fruits to sustain their comfortable lifestyles .
As Orwell puts it , in a characteristically belligerent passage from The Road to Wigan Pier
It is so easy to be witty about the British Empire .
The White Man's Burden and " Rule Britannia " and Kipling 's novels and Anglo - Indian bores - who could even mention such things without a snigger ? . . .
That is the attitude of the typical left - winger towards imperialism , and a thoroughly flabby , boneless attitude it is . . .
For apart from any other consideration , the high standard of life we enjoy in England depends upon our keeping a tight hold on the Empire .
Under the capitalist system , in order that England may live in comparative comfort , a hundred million Indians must live on the verge of starvation - an evil state of affairs , but you acquiesce in it every time you step into a taxi or eat a plate of strawberries and cream .
Second , Kipling 's prose chimed with a truth about the world , even though it also represented a failure to face up to certain truths :
" He dealt largely in platitudes , " Orwell says , " and since we live in a world of platitudes , much of what he says sticks . "
But perhaps most importantly , Orwell felt that Kipling always kept something of his own personal character in reserve , and that there was therefore always more to Kipling than the views with which he was associated .
Orwell described this extra something as his essential " personal decency " , and he said on Kipling 's death : " It is worth remembering that he was the most widely popular English writer of our time , and yet that no one , perhaps , so consistently refrained from making a vulgar show of his personality . "
Kipling was saved , in Orwell 's eyes , by the fact that his writing , for all its robustness ( and not least its robustness about power ) , was not fully self - revealing , in that it did not allow one to see all the way through to the man underneath .
Wodehouse , by contrast , was saved by the fact that the writing was the man - Orwell accepts that Wodehouse was " his own Bertie Wooster " .
This is why Orwell believed it was absurd to pillory Wodehouse for the mildly treacherous radio broadcasts he made while interned by the Nazis during the second world war .
Wodehouse was what Orwell called " a political innocent " , someone whose essential stupidity about politics - " his mild facetiousness covering an unthinking acceptance [ of the world he inhabited ] " - rescued him from the charge of the worst sorts of hypocrisy .
Instead , the worst of the hypocrites were Wodehouse 's critics after the war , who saw in him " an ideal whipping boy " , and used him as a distraction from any attempt to expose the far more extensive collaborations and deceptions that underpinned their own war efforts .
" All kinds of petty rats are hunted down , " Orwell wrote in his defence of Wodehouse , " while almost without exception the big rats escape . "
What Kipling and Wodehouse had in common for Orwell was that there was a kind of integrity to their double standards , though of very different kinds .
Kipling deliberately concealed something of himself , but did not seek to conceal the truth about the nature of imperial power ;
Wodehouse exposed himself , and thereby inadvertently exposed something of the double standards of the system of power in which he unthinkingly believed .
But it is also true that what rescued Kipling and Wodehouse in Orwell 's eyes was that they did not share the other 's vice .
The easiest way to illustrate this is to consider what would have happened if their positions had been reversed .
It is inconceivable that if Kipling had found himself in Wodehouse 's position , broadcasting for the Nazis for the sake of a quiet life , then Orwell would have defended him ; there was nothing innocent about Kipling , and therefore there was no way of imagining that he might have been self - deceived in such circumstances .
Stupidity might just retain its integrity in the face of totalitarianism , but knowingness never could .
Equally , it is impossible to imagine Orwell defending a PG Wodehouse view of British imperialism , because there was nothing innocent about imperialism , and political naivety in that context was always culpable .
Kipling could write about empire because he was in no sense naive about it ; what made Orwell despair of British imperialism was that it was not on the whole staffed by Kiplings , but by Bertie Woosters .
It is this complicated attitude to hypocrisy that underpins Orwell 's most famous discussion of what it means to be English , in the essays published in 1941 as The Lion and the Unicorn , including the one entitled " England , Your England " .
There are two sorts of hypocrisy described in that essay .
The first is the relatively innocent hypocrisy of democracy , which is underpinned in the English case by the sentimentality of the working classes and the stupidity of those who rule them .
This innocent stupidity is exemplified for Orwell by the " morally sound " willingness of the English upper classes to get themselves killed in wartime .
Even the Woosters of this world , who can't be relied on for much , can be relied on for this : " Bertie , a sluggish Don Quixote , has no wish to tilt at windmills , but he would hardly think of refusing to do so when honour calls . "
Democracy , for Orwell , is a charade , but the innocence of the English version is what saves it from being a total fraud .
" It follows , " Orwell writes , " that British democracy is less of a fraud than it sometimes appears .
A foreign observer sees only the huge inequality of wealth , the unfair electoral system , the governing - class control over the press , radio and education , and concludes that democracy is simply a polite name for dictatorship . "
But democracy is more than just a name in England , because the hypocrisy is more pervasive than that would suggest .
It shapes and conditions the way that people behave .
" Public life in England , " Orwell declares , " has never been openly scandalous .
It has not reached the pitch of disintegration at which humbug can be dropped . "
The image Orwell uses to capture the essence of English public life is of " a society which is ruled by the sword , no doubt , but a sword which must never be taken out of its scabbard " .
He goes on : " An illusion can become a half - truth , a mask can alter the expression of a face . . .
The sword is still in the scabbard , and while it stays there corruption cannot go beyond a certain point . "
So , he concludes , " even hypocrisy is a powerful safeguard " .
But there is another sort of hypocrisy at work in English life , beyond that of democratic solidarity .
That is the hypocrisy of empire , and here Orwell tends to side with the foreign observers who detect in English attitudes to their empire a culpable double standard .
In relation to their domestic affairs , Orwell believes that foreigners are wrong to write off the English hatred of " militarism " as merely a " decadent " form of hypocrisy .
But it is impossible to ignore that , in relation to the politics of empire , English innocence cannot be what it appears .
After all , it is in the essence of imperial power that the sword does not remain in the scabbard .
The recurring images in Orwell 's work that seek to capture the essence of the imperial experience are of the weapon , however blunt and however crude , being unsheathed .
Orwell himself described his personal awakening to the true nature of imperial power as occurring in Colombo harbour , during his trip out to Burma to begin his career as a military policeman .
There , he witnessed a native servant , who had dropped a trunk that was being taken on board the ship , being viciously kicked on the backside by a white police sergeant , to the obvious approval of the onlookers .
This , for Orwell , was in essence what empire meant : unthinking brutality .
But the most memorable of all Orwell 's images of imperialism in action comes in perhaps the most celebrated of all his shorter pieces of writing , " Shooting an Elephant " .
Orwell , in Burma , is called upon to shoot an elephant that is said to have killed a man , in front of a crowd of eager Burmese onlookers .
This event , Orwell says , offers a glimpse of " the dirty work of empire at close quarters " .
And what it shows is that the agents of imperial authority do n't know what they are doing ; they are merely acting out a part over which they have lost control .
" I was seemingly the leading actor in the piece , " Orwell writes , " but in reality I was only an absurd puppet pushed to and fro by the will of those yellow faces behind . "
Orwell did not wish to shoot the elephant , but he felt he had no choice .
The white man on imperial duty " wears a mask and his face grows to fit it .
I had got to shoot the elephant . "
The hypocrisy of empire is revealed here as the unsheathing of the weapon by someone who does not wish to use it , and has lost all control of what can be done with it , or even of what it is for , but must go through with his part anyway .
In " Shooting an Elephant " , Orwell does n't exactly come across as Bertie Wooster - he is far too reflective for that - but he is not a million miles away from the world of PG Wodehouse either .
Wooster would also shoot the elephant , and though , in his case , it might not cause him any great pangs of conscience , it would also be because he was the puppet , not the puppeteer .
The stupidity of the British ruling class , which was their saving grace so far as democracy was concerned , was catastrophic in the context of empire .
Kipling , who was neither stupid , nor strictly speaking a member of the British ruling class ( he was , essentially , a journalist ) at least did not try to pretend that the empire was something it was not .
But not even Kipling was able to tell the basic truth about the British empire : that democratic hypocrisy and imperial hypocrisy simply do not mix .
Democratic hypocrisy , in Orwell 's terms , is saved by the element of self - deception on which it rests , which is what turns the illusion into a half - truth , and keeps the sword in its scabbard .
Imperial hypocrisy is rendered self - defeating by that same self - deception , since the sword cannot remain in the scabbard , and will be deployed for the supposed benefit of the people it is being used to coerce , by people who are unable to be honest with themselves about the nature of that coercion .
In a way , it is easy to see what the solution is to this clash of hypocrisies : democracy needs to abandon imperialism , as Orwell was convinced that Britain needed to divest itself of its empire , and to face up to the sacrifices which that would involve .
But it is important to recognise that the democracy that abandons imperialism does not abandon hypocrisy : rather , it preserves its own sustainable hypocrisy by ditching the form of power that makes a mockery of it .
There is an alternative remedy , of course , which is to abandon hypocrisy altogether .
This is what would happen if imperialism jettisoned democracy , rather than the other way around .
An imperial order unconstrained by democratic or liberal hypocrisies , in which power can be called by its proper name , in which the sword is always unsheathed because there is never any need to conceal it , is certainly possible .
Indeed ,
Orwell believed , it was not just possible , but prevalent in the world he had come to know , and would be all - pervasive in one possible future world that he was to imagine .
Imperialism without hypocrisy is called fascism , and it is one of the distinguishing marks of fascism , as of other totalitarian regimes , that it does not need to be hypocritical .
Totalitarians can afford to be sincere about power .
It is out of this sincerity that we get a third quintessentially Orwellian image , to place alongside that of the unsheathed sword , and that of the young military policeman stumbling along a road in Burma , armed only with his elephant - gun .
The third image is of a boot , stamping on a human face .
Yet it is not only the sincerity of fascism that poses a threat to English hypocrisy in Orwell 's eyes ; there is also the dangerous sincerity , or anti-hypocrisy , of anti-fascism .
Orwell gives an extended glimpse of what this sincerity might look like in a passage in the novel Coming Up for Air , in which the hero George Bowling attends a political meeting , in the period before the outbreak of hostilities between England and Germany , and listens to a speech :
[ He was ] a rather mean little man , with a white face and a bald head , standing on a platform , shooting out slogans .
What 's he doing ?
Quite deliberately , and quite openly , stirring up hatred .
Doing his damnedest to make you hate certain foreigners called Fascists .
It 's a queer thing , I thought , to be known as " Mr So - and - so , the well - known anti-Fascist " .
A queer trade , anti-Fascism . . .
But the grating voice went on and on , and another thing struck me .
He means it .
Not faking at all - feels every word he is saying .
He 's trying to work up hatred in his audience , but that is nothing compared to the hatred he feels himself .
Every slogan 's gospel truth to him .
If you cut him open all you 'd find inside would be Democracy - Fascism - Democracy .
Interesting to know a chap like that in private life .
But does he have a private life ?
Or does he only go round from platform to platform , working up hatred ?
Perhaps even his dreams are slogans .
This scene foreshadows a better - known scene in a better - known book : the hate session in Nineteen Eighty - Four , in which the crowd is required to vent its fury at the hate figure of Emmanuel Goldstein , and does so in all sincerity , even Winston Smith , who feels the hatred wash through him ( " the horrible thing about the Two Minutes Hate was not that one was obliged to act a part , but that it was impossible to avoid joining in .
Within 30 seconds any pretence was always unnecessary " ) .
The scene from Coming Up for Air also foreshadows a theme of that later book , which is what it might mean not to have a private life , not to have anything held back or reserved , but simply to be the slogans that one is forced to spout through and through .
In such a world , hypocrisy would not simply be valuable , it would in a sense represent the ultimate value , because its precondition is having something to hide .
Nineteen Eighty - Four is a description of a world in which hypocrisy has become impossible .
What , though , of Orwell 's greatest book , Animal Farm ?
Is n't this an exercise in the exposure of hypocrisy , rather than the exposure of a world where hypocrisy is impossible ?
Certainly , Animal Farm seems , at its most literal , to be a litany of hypocrisies : from the double standards of the pigs ( changing the commandment from " No animal shall drink alcohol " to " No animal shall drink alcohol to excess " , the day after they have discovered the joys of whisky ) to the false promises of Napoleon , their Stalin - like leader , and the sanctimony of his speechifying .
But at its end , Animal Farm also points towards the end of hypocrisy , as the criteria by which hypocrisy might be judged themselves become unsustainable .
The final scene in the book describes the moment when the leading pigs play cards with the humans , with whom they are now happy to do business , and drink whisky , and fight .
Their faces ,
Orwell says , began " melting and changing " .
He goes on :
Twelve voices were shouting in anger and they were all alike .
No question , now , what had happened to the faces of the pigs .
The creatures outside looked from pig to man , and from man to pig , and from pig to man again : but already it was impossible to say which was which .
Throughout his life , Orwell was obsessed with masks , including the various masks of power , and the masks worn by those who sought to hide the truth about power .
It is this preoccupation with masks that makes sense of one of Orwell 's most famous lines , and one of his most misunderstood .
In perhaps the last thing he ever wrote , Orwell declared : " At 50 , every man has the face he deserves . "
This does not mean that we deserve our physical appearance ; what it means is that we deserve our mask , the face we choose to show to the world , because having lived with it for so long we can no longer claim that it is merely a façade .
Here , though , at the end of Animal Farm , is a scene in which no one is wearing a mask , because it is no longer possible to see what there is to mask .
Once again , no one has anything to hide , and that is where the terror lies .
Orwell was an anti-hypocrite for whom there were worse things than hypocrisy .
He was also an anti-hypocrite who understood how anti-hypocrisy could itself become the vice it was supposed to be rescuing us from .
Democrats who sought to confront fascism on its own terms , like " Mr So- and - So the well - known anti-Fascist " in Coming Up for Air , were succumbing to the temptations of sincerity that ideological conflict offers to all its participants .
These are the temptations that it continues to offer to this day - no doubt many neoconservatives are entirely sincere in their crusade to unleash the weapons of democracy against Islamofascism , which is what makes their attempts to corral Orwell into that all - or - nothing struggle so unconvincing .
As Orwell said in March 1940 of the war then only just begun : " For Heaven 's sake , let us not suppose we go into this war with clean hands .
It is only while we cling to the consciousness that our hands are not clean that we retain the right to defend ourselves . "
And as he said in February 1944 of the war whose end was still nowhere in sight : " In the last analysis , our only claim to victory is that if we win the war , we shall tell fewer lies about it than our adversaries . "
This is not truth versus lies ; it is fewer lies versus more lies , or democratic hypocrisy versus the total lie .
Indeed , for Orwell , it was the hypocrisy of the English that served to ensure that they were not entirely self - deceived about the moral compromises entailed in confronting a totalitarian ideology ; they at least still knew what it meant to have something to hide .
Orwell is an excellent guide to the problem of political hypocrisy , but not in the way he is usually taken to be .
He shows us that politics is not about , and should not be reduced to , a choice between sincerity and fakery - seeing it in these terms opens the door to the worst sorts of hypocrisy , or worse still , raw power without the kind of hypocrisy that can keep it in check .
The real choice is between different kinds of hypocrisy , and in this context it is democratic hypocrisy , not sincerity , that needs defending .
It is all too easy to get frustrated with the messy and murky compromises of domestic politics - as Bush , Blair and their many sincere cheerleaders in the press have done over the past few years - and to look for escape in the cleaner and crisper air of a new liberal imperialism , where politicians and journalists can open their hearts about all the good they want to do .
But as Orwell shows us , imperial politics and democratic hypocrisy do not mix and , as Orwell makes clear , this is the point where we have to choose .

The Third World War Why NATO Troops Can't Deliver Peace in Afghanistan
Forty nations are embroiled in an unwinnable war in Afghanistan .
Anyone who travels through the country with Western troops soon realizes that NATO forces would have to be increased tenfold for peace to be even a remote possibility .
Von Ullrich Fichtner
A naked Pinson man claiming to be Jesus Christ and George Bush was shot four times with a stun gun by Jefferson County sheriff 's deputies this morning after he repeatedly refused to heed their commands .
Richard Scott Odell , 30 , was treated on the scene by paramedics and taken to the Jefferson County Jail .
A motorist called deputies about 4 a .m. to alert them that the man was standing nude in the middle of Alabama 79 at Bradford Road .
As the motorist approached the man , he stumbled toward the car and was struck by the car 's mirror , sheriff 's authorities said .
The man then ran away .
The motorist summoned deputies .
Armed with their X26 Tasers , they ordered Odell to the ground , but he refused .
He was struck in the chest by the Taser but did n't go down .
He was struck a second time and fell to the ground , but would n't roll over to his stomach .
When he was struck a third time , the man yanked the Taser wires out of chest .
After being shot a fourth time , Odell complied with deputies and was secured with handcuffs and leg irons .
Odell stated that he was Jesus Christ and George Bush and that he could break the handcuffs .
Authorities said he appeared to be intoxicated .
Center Point Fire and Rescue came to the scene to remove the remaining Taser wires from his chest and back .
He is charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrested .
" This guy must have been to quite a party or he is quite a party himself , " said sheriff 's spokesman Sgt. Randy Christian said .
" It is n't every day our deputies run into a naked man standing in the middle of the highway .
I guess they have truly seen it all now , no pun intended . "
It 's easy to build a blog , but hard to build a successful blog with significant traffic .
Over the years , we 've grown the Moz blog to nearly a million visits each month and helped lots of other blogs , too .
I launched a personal blog late last year and was amazed to see how quickly it gained thousands of visits to each post .
There 's an art to increasing a blog 's traffic , and given that we seem to have stumbled on some of that knowledge , I felt it compulsory to give back by sharing what we 've observed .
NOTE : This post replaces a popular one I wrote on the same topic in 2007 ( and updated again in 2012 ) .
This post is intended to be useful to all forms of bloggers - independent folks , those seeking to monetize , and marketing professionals working an in - house blog from tiny startups to huge companies .
Not all of the tactics will work for everyone , but at least some of these should be applicable and useful .
# 1 - Target Your Content to an Audience Likely to Share
When strategizing about who you 're writing for , consider that audience 's ability to help spread the word .
Some readers will naturally be more or less active in evangelizing the work you do , but particular communities , topics , writing styles and content types regularly play better than others on the web .
For example , great infographics that strike a chord ( like this one ) , beautiful videos that tell a story ( like this one ) and remarkable collections of facts that challenge common assumptions ( like this one ) are all targeted at audiences likely to share ( geeks with facial hair , those interested in weight loss and those with political thoughts about macroeconomics respectively ) .
If you can identify groups that have high concentrations of the blue and orange circles in the diagram above , you dramatically improve the chances of reaching larger audiences and growing your traffic numbers .
Targeting blog content at less - share - likely groups may not be a terrible decision ( particularly if that 's where you passion or your target audience lies ) , but it will decrease the propensity for your blog 's work to spread like wildfire across the web .
# 2 - Participate in the Communities Where Your Audience Already Gathers
Advertisers on Madison Avenue have spent billions researching and determining where consumers with various characteristics gather and what they spend their time doing so they can better target their messages .
They do it because reaching a group of 65 + year old women with commercials for extreme sports equipment is known to be a waste of money , while reaching an 18 - 30 year old male demographic that attends rock - climbing gyms is likely to have a much higher ROI .
Thankfully , you do n't need to spend a dime to figure out where a large portion of your audience can be found on the web .
In fact , you probably already know a few blogs , forums , websites and social media communities where discussions and content are being posted on your topic ( and if you do n't a Google search will take you much of the way ) .
From that list , you can do some easy expansion using a web - based tool like Google 's Display Planner :
Once you 've determined the communities where your soon - to - be- readers gather , you can start participating .
Create an account , read what others have written and do n't jump in the conversation until you 've got a good feel for what 's appropriate and what 's not .
I 've written a post here about rules for comment marketing , and all of them apply .
Be a good web citizen and you 'll be rewarded with traffic , trust and fans .
Link - drop , spam or troll and you 'll get a quick boot , or worse , a reputation as a blogger no one wants to associate with .
# 3 - Make Your Blog 's Content SEO - Friendly
Search engines are a massive opportunity for traffic , yet many bloggers ignore this channel for a variety of reasons that usually have more to do with fear and misunderstanding than true problems .
As I 've written before , " SEO , when done right , should never interfere with great writing . "
In 2014 , Google will see over 6 billion daily searches from around the world , and that number is only growing :
sources : Comscore +
Google
Taking advantage of this massive traffic opportunity is of tremendous value to bloggers , who often find that much of the business side of blogging , from inquiries for advertising to guest posting opportunities to press and discovery by major media entities comes via search .
SEO for blogs is both simple and easy to set up , particularly if you 're using an SEO - friendly platform like Wordpress , Drupal or Joomla .
For more information on how to execute on great SEO for blogs , check out the following resources :
Do n't let bad press or poor experiences with spammers ( spam is not SEO ) taint the amazing power and valuable contributions SEO can make to your blog 's traffic and overall success .
20 % of the effort and tactics to make your content optimized for search engines will yield 80 % of the value possible ; embrace it and thousands of visitors seeking exactly what you 've posted will be the reward .
# 4 - Use Twitter , Facebook and Google+ to Share Your Posts & Find New Connections
Twitter has 271 million active users every month .
Facebook has over 1 billion active users .
Google + has over 300 million .
LinkedIn is over 300 million .
Together , these networks are attracting vast amounts of time and interest from Internet users around the world , and those that participate on these services fit into the " content distributors " description above , meaning they 're likely to help spread the word about your blog .
Leveraging these networks to attract traffic requires patience , study , attention to changes by the social sites and consideration in what content to share and how to do it .
My advice is to use the following process :
If you have n't already , register a personal account and a brand account at each of the following - Twitter , Facebook , Google + and LinkedIn ( those links will take you directly to the registration pages for brand pages ) .
For example , my friend Dharmesh has a personal account for Twitter and a brand account for OnStartups ( one of his blog projects ) .
He also maintains brand pages on Facebook , LinkedIn and Google + .
Fill out each of those profiles to the fullest possible extent - use photos , write compelling descriptions and make each one as useful and credible as possible .
Research shows that profiles with more information have a significant correlation with more successful accounts ( and there 's a lot of common sense here , too , given that spammy profiles frequently feature little to no profile work ) .
Connect with users on those sites with whom you already share a personal or professional relationships , and start following industry luminaries , influencers and connectors .
Services like FollowerWonk and CircleCount can be incredible for this :
Start sharing content - your own blog posts , those of peers in your industry who 've impressed you and anything that you feel has a chance to go " viral " and earn sharing from others .
Interact with the community - use hash tags , searches and those you follow to find interesting conversations and content and jump in !
Social networks are amazing environment for building a brand , familiarizing yourself with a topic and the people around it , and earning the trust of others through high quality , authentic participation and sharing
If you consistently employ a strategy of participation , share great stuff and make a positive , memorable impression on those who see your interactions on these sites , your followers and fans will grow and your ability to drive traffic back to your blog by sharing content will be tremendous .
For many bloggers , social media is the single largest source of traffic , particularly in the early months after launch , when SEO is a less consistent driver .
# 5 - Install Analytics and Pay Attention to the Results
At the very least , I 'd recommend most bloggers install Google Analytics ( which is free ) , and watch to see where visits originate , which sources drive quality traffic and what others might be saying about you and your content when they link over .
If you want to get more advanced , check out this post on 18 Steps to Successful Metrics and Marketing .
Here 's a screenshot from the analytics of my wife 's travel blog , the Everywhereist :
As you can see , there 's all sorts of great insights to be gleaned by looking at where visits originate , analyzing how they were earned and trying to repeat the successes , focus on the high quality and high traffic sources and put less effort into marketing paths that may not be effective .
In this example , it 's pretty clear that Facebook and Twitter are both excellent channels .
StumbleUpon sends a lot of traffic , but they do n't stay very long ( averaging only 36 seconds vs. the general average of 4 minutes ! ) .
Employing analytics is critical to knowing where you 're succeeding , and where you have more opportunity .
Do n't ignore it , or you 'll be doomed to never learn from mistakes or execute on potential .
# 6 - Add Graphics , Photos and Illustrations ( with link - back licensing )
If you 're someone who can produce graphics , take photos , illustrate or even just create funny doodles in MS Paint , you should leverage that talent on your blog .
By uploading and hosting images ( or using a third - party service like Flickr or Niice to embed your images with licensing requirements on that site ) , you create another traffic source for yourself via Image Search , and often massively improve the engagement and enjoyment of your visitors .
When using images , I highly recommend creating a way for others to use them on their own sites legally and with permission , but in such a way that benefits you as the content creator .
For example , you could have a consistent notice under your images indicating that re-using is fine , but that those who do should link back to this post .
You can also post that as a sidebar link , include it in your terms of use , or note it however you think will get the most adoption .
Some people will use your images without linking back , which sucks .
However , you can find them by employing the Image Search function of " similar images , " shown below :
Clicking the " similar " link on any given image will show you other images that Google thinks look alike , which can often uncover new sources of traffic .
Just reach out and ask if you can get a link , nicely .
Much of the time , you 'll not only get your link , but make a valuable contact or new friend , too !
# 7 - Conduct Keyword Research While Writing Your Posts
Not surprisingly , a big part of showing up in search engines is targeting the terms and phrases your audience are actually typing into a search engine .
It 's hard to know what these words will be unless you do some research , and luckily , there 's a free tool from Google to help called the AdWords Keyword Planner .
Type some words at the top , hit search and AdWords will show you phrases that match the intent and / or terms you 've employed .
There 's lots to play around with here , but watch out in particular for the keyword filters , keyword options , and include / exclude features :
When you choose " exact match " AdWords will show you only the quantity of searches estimated for that precise phrase .
If you use broad match , they 'll include any search phrases that use related / similar words in a pattern they think could have overlap with your keyword intent ( which can get pretty darn broad ) .
" Phrase match " will give you only those phrases that include the word or words in your search - still fairly wide - ranging , but between " exact " and " broad . "
I also use and recommend Keyword Explorer , our all - in - one keyword research tool :
When you 're writing a blog post , keyword research is best utilized for the title and headline of the post .
For example , if I wanted to write a post here on Moz about how to generate good ideas for bloggers , I might craft something that uses the phrase " blog post ideas " or " blogging ideas " near the front of my title and headline , as in " Blog Post Ideas for When You 're Truly Stuck , " or " Blogging Ideas that Will Help You Clear Writer 's Block . "
Optimizing a post to target a specific keyword is n't nearly as hard as it sounds .
80 % of the value comes from merely using the phrase effectively in the title of the blog post , and writing high quality content about the subject .

# 8 - Frequently Reference Your Own Posts and Those of Others
The web was not made for static , text - only content !
Readers appreciate links , as do other bloggers , site owners and even search engines .
When you reference your own material in - context and in a way that 's not manipulative ( watch out for over - optimizing by linking to a category , post or page every time a phrase is used - this is almost certainly discounted by search engines and looks terrible to those who want to read your posts ) , you potentially draw visitors to your other content AND give search engines a nice signal about those previous posts .
Perhaps even more valuable is referencing the content of others .
The biblical expression " give and ye shall receive , " perfectly applies on the web .
Other site owners will often receive Google Alerts ( or , if they 're using Moz , they might get Fresh Alerts :-) ) or look through their incoming referrers ( as I showed above in tip # 5 ) to see who 's talking about them and what they 're saying .
Linking out is a direct line to earning links , social mentions , friendly emails and new relationships with those you reference .
In its early days , this tactic was one of the best ways we earned recognition and traffic with the Moz blog and the power continues to this day .
# 9 - Participate in Social Sharing Communities Like Reddit + StumbleUpon
The major social networking sites are n't alone in their power to send traffic to a blog .
Social community sites like Reddit ( which now receives more than 2 billion !
with a " B " ! views each month ) , StumbleUpon , Pinterest , Tumblr , Care2 ( for nonprofits and causes ) , GoodReads ( books ) , Ravelry ( knitting ) , Newsvine ( news / politics ) and many , many more ( Wikipedia maintains a decent , though not comprehensive list here ) .
Each of these sites have different rules , formats and ways of participating and sharing content .
As with participation in blog or forum communities described above in tactic # 2 , you need to add value to these communities to see value back .
Simply drive - by spamming or leaving your link wo n't get you very far , and could even cause a backlash .
Instead , learn the ropes , engage authentically and you 'll find that fans , links and traffic can develop .
These communities are also excellent sources of inspiration for posts on your blog .
By observing what performs well and earns recognition , you can tailor your content to meet those guidelines and reap the rewards in visits and awareness .
My top recommendation for most bloggers is to at least check whether there 's an appropriate subreddit in which you should be participating .
Subreddits and their search function can help with that .
# 10 - Guest Blog ( and Accept the Guest Posts of Others )
When you 're first starting out , it can be tough to convince other bloggers to allow you to post on their sites OR have an audience large enough to inspire others to want to contribute to your site .
This is when friends and professional connections are critical .
When you do n't have a compelling marketing message , leverage your relationships - find the folks who know you , like you and trust you and ask those who have blog to let you take a shot at authoring something , then ask them to return the favor .
Guest blogging is a fantastic way to spread your brand to new folks who 've never seen your work before , and it can be useful in earning early links and references back to your site , which will drive direct traffic and help your search rankings ( diverse , external links are a key part of how search engines rank sites and pages ) .
Several recommendations for those who engage in guest blogging :
Find sites that have a relevant audience - it sucks to pour your time into writing a post , only to see it fizzle because the readers were n't interested .
Spend a bit more time researching the posts that succeed on your target site , the makeup of the audience , what types of comments they leave and you 'll earn a much higher return with each post .
Do n't be discouraged if you ask and get a " no " or a " no response . "
As your profile grows in your niche , you 'll have more opportunities , requests and an easier time getting a " yes , " so do n't take early rejections too hard and watch out - in many marketing practices , persistence pays , but pestering a blogger to write for them is not one of these ( and may get your email address permanently banned from their inbox ) .
When pitching your guest post make it as easy as possible for the other party .
When requesting to post , have a phenomenal piece of writing all set to publish that 's never been shared before and give them the ability to read it .
These requests get far more " yes " replies than asking for the chance to write with no evidence of what you 'll contribute .
At the very least , make an outline and write a title + snippet .
Likewise , when requesting a contribution , especially from someone with a significant industry profile , asking for a very specific piece of writing is much easier than getting them to write an entire piece from scratch of their own design .
You should also present statistics that highlight the value of posting on your site - traffic data , social followers , RSS subscribers , etc. can all be very persuasie to a skeptical writer .
Be aware that Google 's recently cracked down on guest blog posts and guest blog tools that focus exclusively on attracting links .
While links can be a nice byproduct of a relevant , useful , and high quality contribution to another site , it can look very fishy to Google if all your links are coming from guest contributions that appear to have little relevance and low quality .
Moz 's Jen Lopez wrote an excellent summation of the new rules for guest posting here .
Twitter , Facebook , LinkedIn and Google + are also great places to find guest blogging opportunities .
In particular , check out the profiles of those you 're connected with to see if they run blogs of their own that might be a good fit .
Google 's Blog Search function and services like BuzzSumo or Fresh Web Explorer are also solid tools for discovery .
# 11 - Incorporate Great Design Into Your Site
The power of beautiful , usable , professional design can't be overstated .
When readers look at a blog , the first thing they judge is how it " feels " from a design and UX perspective .
Sites that use default templates or have horrifying , 1990 's design will receive less trust , a lower time - on - page , fewer pages per visit and a lower likelihood of being shared .
Those that feature stunning design that clearly indicates quality work will experience the reverse - and reap amazing benefits .
These threads -
1 , 2 , 3 and 4 - feature some remarkable blog designs for inspiration
If you 're looking for a designer to help upgrade the quality of your blog , there 's a few resources I recommend :
Dribbble - great for finding high quality professional designers
Forrst - another excellent design profile community
Behance - featuring galleries from a wide range of visual professionals
Sortfolio - an awesome tool to ID designers by region , skill and budget
99 Designs - a controversial site that provides designs on spec via contests ( I have mixed feelings on this one , but many people find it useful , particularly for budget - conscious projects )
This is one area where budgeting a couple thousand dollars ( if you can afford it ) or even a few hundred ( if you 're low on cash ) can make a big difference in the traffic , sharing and viral - impact of every post you write .
# 12 - Interact on Other Blogs ' Comments
As bloggers , we see a lot of comments .
Many are spam , only a few add real value , and even fewer are truly fascinating and remarkable .
If you can be in this final category consistently , in ways that make a blogger sit up and think " man , I wish that person commented here more often ! " you can achieve great things for your own site 's visibility through participation in the comments of other blogs .
Combine the tools presented in # 10 ( particularly FWE ) and # 4 ( especially FollowerWonk ) for discovery .
The feed subscriber counts in Google Reader can be particularly helpful for identifying good blogs for participation .
Then apply the principles covered in this post on comment marketing .
Do be conscious of the name you use when commenting and the URL ( s ) you point back to .
Consistency matters , particularly on naming , and linking to internal pages or using a name that 's clearly made for keyword - spamming rather than true conversation will kill your efforts before they begin .
# 13 - Participate in Q+A Sites
Every day , thousands of people ask questions on the web .
Popular services like Yahoo !
Answers , Answers.com , Quora , StackExchange , Formspring and more serve those hungry for information whose web searches could n't track down the responses they needed .
The best strategy I 've seen for engaging on Q+A sites is n't to answer every question that comes along , but rather , to strategically provide high value to a Q+A community by engaging in those places where :
The question quality is high , and responses thus far have been thin
The question receives high visibility ( either by ranking well for search queries , being featured on the site or getting social traffic / referrals ) .
Most of the Q+A sites will show some stats around the traffic of a question
The question is something you can answer in a way that provides remarkable value to anyone who 's curious and drops by
I also find great value in answering a few questions in - depth by producing an actual blog post to tackle them , then linking back .
This is also a way I personally find blog post topics - if people are interested in the answer on a Q+A site , chances are good that lots of folks would want to read it on my blog , too !
Just be authentic in your answer , particularly if you 're linking .
If you 'd like to see some examples , I answer a lot of questions at Quora , frequently include relevant links , but am rarely accused of spamming or link dropping because it 's clearly about providing relevant value , not just getting a link for SEO ( links on most user - contributed sites are " nofollow " anyway , meaning they should n't pass search - engine value ) .
There 's a dangerous line to walk here , but if you do so with tact and candor , you can earn a great audience from your participation .
# 14 - Enable Subscriptions via Feed +
Email ( and track them ! )
If someone drops by your site , has a good experience and thinks " I should come back here and check this out again when they have more posts , " chances are pretty high ( I 'd estimate 90 % + ) that you 'll never see them again .
That sucks !
It should n't be the case , but we have busy lives and the Internet 's filled with animated gifs of cats .
In order to pull back some of these would - be fans , I highly recommend creating an RSS feed using Feedburner and putting visible buttons on the sidebar , top or bottom of your blog posts encouraging those who enjoy your content to sign up ( either via feed , or via email , both of which are popular options ) .
If you 're using Wordpress , there 's some easy plugins for this , too .
Once you 've set things up , visit every few weeks and check on your subscribers - are they clicking on posts ?
If so , which ones ?
Learning what plays well for those who subscribe to your content can help make you a better blogger , and earn more visits from RSS , too .
# 15 - Attend and Host Events
Despite the immense power of the web to connect us all regardless of geography , in - person meetings are still remarkably useful for bloggers seeking to grow their traffic and influence .
The people you meet and connect with in real - world settings are far more likely to naturally lead to discussions about your blog and ways you can help each other .
This yields guest posts , links , tweets , shares , blogroll inclusion and general business development like nothing else .
I 'm a big advocate of Lanyrd , an event directory service that connects with your social networks to see who among your contacts will be at which events in which geographies .
This can be phenomenally useful for identifying which meetups , conferences or gatherings are worth attending ( and who you can carpool with ) .
The founder of Lanyrd also contributed this great answer on Quora about other search engines / directories for events ( which makes me like them even more ) .
# 16 - Use Your Email Connections ( and Signature ) to Promote Your Blog
As a blogger , you 're likely to be sending a lot of email out to others who use the web and have the power to help spread your work .
Make sure you 're not ignoring email as a channel , one - to - one though it may be .
When given an opportunity in a conversation that 's relevant , feel free to bring up your blog , a specific post or a topic you 've written about .
I find myself using blogging as a way to scalably answer questions - if I receive the same question many times , I 'll try to make a blog post that answers it so I can simply link to that in the future .
I also like to use my email signature to promote the content I share online .
If I was really sharp , I 'd do link tracking using a service like Bit.ly so I could see how many clicks email footers really earn .
I suspect it 's not high , but it 's also not 0 .
# 17 - Survey Your Readers
Web surveys are easy to run and often produce high engagement and great topics for conversation .
If there 's a subject or discussion that 's particularly contested , or where you suspect showing the distribution of beliefs , usage or opinions can be revealing , check out a tool like SurveyMonkey ( they have a small free version ) or PollDaddy .
Google Docs also offers a survey tool that 's totally free , but not yet great in my view .
# 18 - Add Value to a Popular Conversation
Numerous niches in the blogosphere have a few " big sites " where key issues arise , get discussed and spawn conversations on other blogs and sites .
Getting into the fray can be a great way to present your point - of - view , earn attention from those interested in the discussion and potentially get links and traffic from the industry leaders as part of the process .
You can see me trying this out with Fred Wilson 's AVC blog last year ( an incredibly popular and well - respected blog in the VC world ) .
Fred wrote a post about Marketing that I disagreed with strongly and publicly and a day later , he wrote a follow - up where he included a graphic I made AND a link to my post .
If you 're seeking sources to find these " popular conversations , " Alltop , Topsy , Techmeme ( in the tech world ) and their sister sites MediaGazer , Memeorandum and WeSmirch , as well as PopURLs can all be useful .
# 19 - Aggregate the Best of Your Niche
Bloggers , publishers and site owners of every variety in the web world love and hate to be compared and ranked against one another .
It incites endless intrigue , discussion , methodology arguments and competitive behavior - but , it 's amazing for earning attention .
When a blogger publishes a list of " the best X " or " the top X " in their field , most everyone who 's ranked highly praises the list , shares it and links to it .
Here 's an example from the world of marketing itself :
That 's a screenshot of the AdAge Power 150 , a list that 's been maintained for years in the marketing world and receives an endless amount of discussion by those listed ( and not listed ) .
For example , why is SEOmoz 's Twitter score only a " 13 " when we have so many more followers , interactions and retweets than many of those with higher scores ?
Who knows .
But I know it 's good for AdAge . :-)
Now , obviously , I would encourage anyone building something like this to be as transparent , accurate and authentic as possible .
A high quality resource that lists a " best and brightest " in your niche - be they blogs , Twitter accounts , Facebook pages , individual posts , people , conferences or whatever else you can think to rank - is an excellent piece of content for earning traffic and becoming a known quantity in your field .
Oh , and once you do produce it - make sure to let those featured know they 've been listed .
Tweeting at them with a link is a good way to do this , but if you have email addresses , by all means , reach out .
It can often be the start of a great relationship !
# 20 - Connect Your Web Profiles and Content to Your Blog
Many of you likely have profiles on services like YouTube , Slideshare , Yahoo ! , DeviantArt and dozens of other social and Web 1.0 sites .
You might be uploading content to Flickr , to Facebook , to Picasa or even something more esoteric like Prezi .
Whatever you 're producing on the web and wherever you 're doing it , tie it back to your blog .
Including your blog 's link on your actual profile pages is among the most obvious , but it 's also incredibly valuable .
On any service where interaction takes place , those interested in who you are and what you have to share will follow those links , and if they lead back to your blog , they become opportunities for capturing a loyal visitor or earning a share ( or both ! ) .
But do n't just do this with profiles - do it with content , too !
If you 've created a video for YouTube , make your blog 's URL appear at the start or end of the video .
Include it in the description of the video and on the uploading profile 's page .
If you 're sharing photos on any of the dozens of photo services , use a watermark or even just some text with your domain name so interested users can find you .
If you 're having trouble finding and updating all those old profiles ( or figuring out where you might want to create / share some new ones ) , Know Em is a great tool for discovering your own profiles ( by searching for your name or pseudonyms you 've used ) and claiming profiles on sites you may not yet have participated in .
I 'd also strongly recommend leveraging Google 's relatively new protocol for rel=author .
AJ Kohn wrote a great post on how to set it up here , and Yoast has another good one on building it into Wordpress sites .
The benefit for bloggers who do build large enough audiences to gain Google 's trust is earning your profile photo next to all the content you author - a powerful markup advantage that likely drives extra clicks from the search results and creates great , memorable branding , too .
# 21 - Uncover the Links of Your Fellow Bloggers ( and Nab 'em ! )
If other blogs in your niche have earned references from sites around the web , there 's a decent chance that they 'll link to you as well .
Conducting competitive link research can also show you what content from your competition has performed well and the strategies they may be using to market their work .
To uncover these links , you 'll need to use some tools .
Link Explorer is my favorite , but I 'm biased ( it 's made by Moz ) .
However , it is free to use - if you create a registered account here , you can get unlimited use of the tool showing up to 1,000 links per page or site in perpetuity .
There are other good tools for link research as well , including Majestic , Ahrefs and , I 've heard that in the near - future , SearchMetrics .
Finding a link is great , but it 's through the exhaustive research of looking through dozens or hundreds that you can identify patterns and strategies .
You 're also likely to find a lot of guest blogging opportunities and other chances for outreach .
If you maintain a great persona and brand in your niche , your ability to earn these will rise dramatically .
Bonus # 22 - Be Consistent and Don't Give Up
If there 's one piece of advice I wish I could share with every blogger , it 's this :
The above image comes from Everywhereist 's analytics .
Geraldine could have given up 18 months into her daily blogging .
After all , she was putting in 3 - 5 hours each day writing content , taking photos , visiting sites , coming up with topics , trying to guest blog and grow her Twitter followers and never doing any SEO ( do n't ask , it 's a running joke between us ) .
And then , almost two years after her blog began , and more than 500 posts in , things finally got going .
She got some nice guest blogging gigs , had some posts of hers go " hot " in the social sphere , earned mentions on some bigger sites , then got really big press from Time 's Best Blogs of 2011 .
I 'd guess there 's hundreds of new bloggers on the web each day who have all the opportunity Geraldine had , but after months ( maybe only weeks ) of slogging away , they give up .
When I started the Moz blog in 2004 , I had some advantages ( mostly a good deal of marketing and SEO knowledge ) , but it was nearly 2 years before the blog could be called anything like a success .
Earning traffic is n't rocket science , but it does take time , perseverance and consistency .
Do n't give up .
Stick to your schedule .
Remember that everyone has a few posts that suck , and it 's only by writing and publishing those sucky posts that you get into the habit necessary to eventually transform your blog into something remarkable .
Good luck and good blogging from all of us at Moz !

Back in the U.S.S.R .
Last October , we gathered a group of experts together to find out what U.S. air travel will look like ten years from now .
If you want to remember what air travel looked like twenty years ago , try booking a flight to Russia on American Airlines ’s website , which appears to give you the option of flying to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( and Yugoslavia , too , for good measure ) .
How many other extinct countries are still on this list ?
And what about newborn countries — like Kosovo — that do n’t appear at all ?
( Hat tip : Wonkette )
The drumbeat to " do something " about Pakistan  preferably of a military nature  has been going on for some time , and the assassination of Benazir Bhutto is the perfect catalyst for such an enormous blunder .
As far back as this last summer , the administration has been sending out signals that a direct assault on Waziristan , where Osama bin Laden and his top lieutenants are reputed to be holed up , is not out of the question .
It was almost embarrassing to hear the pleading tone in Pakistani Foreign Minister Kurshid Kasuri ’s voice , as he questioned the rationale for intervention and warned CNN ’s Wolf Blitzer that the U.S. had better not go there :
“ If you have superiority in technical intelligence , please share that with us .
And then you talk of going after targets  you will lose the war , the battle for hearts and minds .
It is much better to rely on Pakistan [ ‘s ] army .
Pakistan [ ‘s ] army can do the job much better , and the result will be that there will be far , far less collateral damage . ”
The irony is that , when it comes to actually capturing and / or killing al - Qaeda ’s top guns , the Pakistanis hold the world record , bar none : yet the mantra from Washington , getting increasingly loud and insistent as the American elections approach , is that it is n’t enough .
To which Kasuri replied :
" People in Pakistan get very upset when , despite all the sacrifices that Pakistan has been making , you know , you have the sort of questions that are sometimes asked by the American media . "
These days , the question being asked by the Western media and some Western politicians ( such as Hillary Clinton ) is : did the regime of Gen. Pervez Musharraf , by neglecting to provide ample security for Bhutto , become complicit in her murder ?
This whole thing is beginning to resemble the media narrative in the aftermath of the assassination of Rafik Hariri in Lebanon , where the supposedly ubiquitous Syrian intelligence service was said to wield near - absolute power .
Ipso facto , the Syrians did it ( this in spite of evidence pointing to other possible perpetrators ) .
All sorts of elaborate conspiracy theories are being thrown together by the West ’s best fantasists , which suggest rather strongly that Musharraf is less than sincere in his condemnation of the killing , and hinting broadly at his indirect cooperation with Bhutto ’s killers  in spite of the fact that al - Qaeda has taken direct responsibility for the murder .
An e-mail from Bhutto , released by the aforesaid Blitzer , is being touted as " evidence " that Musharraf ’s men deliberately left Bhutto vulnerable .
Potentially more destabilizing is the emerging dispute over how Bhutto was killed .
The Pakistani government ’s official report specifies that she died as the result of a blow to the head : when the attack occurred , she was standing with her upper body through the sun roof of her bulletproof vehicle .
Her bodyguards tried to pull her into the vehicle , hitting her skull on a lever in the car roof  that ’s what killed her .
Other witnesses , however , attest to having supposedly seen bullet wounds .
All this is part and parcel of the typically simplistic Western media narrative of Bhutto , the martyred " democrat , " a woman who stood up against the Islamists and the unsympathetic Musharraf , Pakistan ’s Pinochet .
Yet the reality , as William Dalrymple points out in the Guardian , is far more complicated .
Pakistan is in many ways a modern , developed nation , and yet the rising middle class has yet to rise up politically : power is in the hands of the large landowners .
Bhutto was the exemplar of this system , an autocrat who presided over her domain using methods that were far from democratic .
During her years in power , Amnesty International condemned the Pakistani government for presiding over extra-judicial killings , frequent torture , and one of the highest rates of prison deaths in the world .
Even her own family was n’t immune :
" Within her party , she declared herself the lifetime president of the PPP and refused to let her brother Murtaza challenge her .
When he persisted in doing so , he ended up shot dead in highly suspicious circumstances outside the family home .
Murtaza ’s wife Ghinwa and his daughter Fatima , as well as Benazir ’s mother , all firmly believed that Benazir gave the order to have him killed . "
Now that the father and the son have succeeded her as head of the Pakistan People ’s Party ( PPP ) , the royal succession is official and will be tested in the upcoming elections .
Whatever the PPP represents , however , it is n’t the spirit of liberal democracy .
As Dalrymple puts it :
" Today , Benazir is being hailed as a martyr for freedom and democracy , but far from being a natural democrat , in many ways , Benazir was the person who brought Pakistan ’s strange variety of democracy , really a form of ‘ elective feudalism ’ , into disrepute and who helped fuel the current , apparently unstoppable , growth of the Islamists . "
The corruption of the Bhutto family , including the martyred Benazir , is indisputable : they plundered the country and socked away $ 100 million in overseas bank accounts .
It ’s not for nothing that Bhutto ’s husband , Asif Zardari , is known as " Mr. 10 Percent . "
Investigators uncovered a payment of some $ 10 million made by a gold dealer into Zardari ’s Citibank account in Dubai just as the Bhutto government granted the dealer a monopoly on gold imports for Pakistan ’s jewelry - making industry .
That ’s why the PPP did n’t dare run him as the party ’s candidate for prime minister , choosing instead to make him co-chair of the PPP along with his son .
Bilawal Zardari will henceforth take his mother ’s name , although , as the father puts it , Bilawal is " of tender years , " so dad will take the helm for the time being .
( Old Mr. Ten Percent will have plenty of time to collect his cut . )
The PPP candidate for prime minister is Makhdoom Amin Fahim , formerly the vice chairman of the party , a decidedly uncharismatic party loyalist who will put a bland face on the monarchical decadence of the same old Bhutto gang .
Benazir was a personable , brave , and thoroughly Westernized woman , whose political style was nonetheless akin to that of the shah of Iran , or any of the other flamboyant despots who have ruled over that area of the world with the approval of the West .
She spoke excellent English , her first language , but her Urdu needed work , and as for her Sindhi  suffice to say that she was , in many ways , a foreigner in her own country .
Her distance from ordinary Pakistanis was underscored by the fact that she built herself a presidential palace that Dalrymple deftly described as resembling " the weekend retreat of a particularly flamboyant Latin - American industrialist "  this in a country where grinding poverty is endemic and the national debt is enormous .
Nawaz Sharif , the former prime minister deposed by Musharraf in a 1999 military coup , offers no real democratic alternative .
As I wrote at the time of the coup :
" Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was increasingly unpopular , and often accused of trying to establish a personal dictatorship : he had recently cracked down on the opposition , and made inroads on the authority of the judiciary , but the real reason for the decline of his political fortunes was his decision to withdraw support from Islamic radical rebels in Kashmir , a disputed province claimed by both Pakistan and India .
For years , the Pakistani military has been encouraging Syed Salahuddin , chief of the Hizbul Mujahideen , the pro-Pakistani Islamic rebel organization in Kashmir , arming , supplying , and training the insurgents , who want ‘ reunion ’ with Pakistan .
While Sharif tried to whip up and ride the wave of Islamic radicalism that has engulfed Pakistan , the movement he helped to create quickly decided that he was not radical enough and called for his dismissal .
Amid an economic downturn , and the ongoing humiliation in Kashmir  where a primarily Muslim population is governed by Hindu nationalists in New Delhi  it was only a matter of time before the Sharif government fell .
The only question was : who will replace him  the Islamic radicals , who invited Osama bin Laden as the guest of honor at a gigantic rally held in Islamabad last year , or the military ?
The military preempted the militants  but do n’t break out the champagne just yet . "
Nawaz was the Kerensky of Pakistan ’s Islamist revolution : if Musharraf and the army had n’t acted , al - Qaeda would have had access to nuclear weapons two years before 9/11 .
Democracy may enthrall the Democratic candidates for president and their retinue of policy wonks in search of more gainful employment , but American interests and the history of Pakistan militate mightily against that unlikely prospect .
As in Iraq , and across much of Africa , we are left in Pakistan with the legacy of British imperialism , which imposed on the region national boundaries that bear little if any correspondence to real political , ethnic , and religious allegiances .
Pakistan never was a genuine unitary state , and today , as the country comes apart at the seams , al - Qaeda is creeping into the cracks and crevices .
While bin Laden ’s minions are not even close to coming to power , the mere prospect of U.S. military intervention makes the jihadists salivate with anticipation : their ranks are already swelling , and the Islamist parties are gaining .
The idea that a sudden infusion of " democracy " is going to solve Pakistan ’s problems is a Western delusion that should have died a quick death in the sands of Iraq , and did n’t .
What ’s interesting is that , on the home front , it ’s the Democrats who are taking the lead in calling for U.S. intervention .
Proposing such a reckless course was Barack Obama ’s defining moment during the Democratic debates , dashing the hopes of some anti-interventionists , who saw , in the charismatic Iraq war critic , a potential antiwar standard - bearer .
And although Hillary Clinton has lately been touting her experience in contrast to Obama ’s steep learning curve in the foreign policy realm , she ’s not exactly been ready for prime time during this crisis .
Clinton called Musharraf an " unreliable " ally and said she doubted elections could be held in the wake of Bhutto ’s death .
This last proved to be jumping the gun , as both the PPP and Sharif ’s party have decided to contest the elections anyway , and , as for the former , it is hard to imagine that , in Musharraf ’s absence , the U.S. has any allies at all , never mind reliable ones .
Hillary clearly wants to dump Musharraf , just as her husband was at least passively complicit in the overthrow of Sharif and the installation of Musharraf as military dictator in 1999 .
Sharif was no longer useful to the United States and had to go .
Now Musharraf is useful to Mrs. Clinton only as the symbol of George W. Bush ’s failed policies .
Even worse , she is now recklessly indulging in conspiracy theories , openly speculating that Pakistan ’s military murdered Bhutto : " There are those saying that al - Qaeda did it .
Others are saying it looked like it was an inside job  remember , Rawalpindi is a garrison city . "
Will the Clintons stop at nothing in their bid to establish their dynastic claim to the Oval Office  not even the destabilization of a nuclear - armed Pakistan ?
A more disgusting opportunism would be hard to imagine  and talk about unpresidential !
If this is the voice of experience , I ’ll take a greenhorn any time .
John Edwards is n’t much more reassuring .
He reported to Wolf Blitzer that , via his contacts with Pakistan ’s ambassador , Musharraf actually called him , and Edwards was n’t shy about revealing his advice : a " transparent international investigation " into Bhutto ’s murder , democratic elections , and more action in the tribal areas where bin Laden and his followers are supposedly ensconced .
In short , he echoed Clinton and Obama , while adding that we needed to use our aid package to Pakistan as " leverage " to get " reform . "
The reality is that the panicked atmosphere surrounding this issue is completely bogus : the Pakistanis are getting their act together , and the country is not falling into chaos .
The hopped - up hysterics of our media during a very slow news cycle is closely tied up with their inherent bias in favor of yet another manufactured " crisis , " which puts pressure on political candidates to respond with what is thought to be appropriate assertiveness .
" Well , then , " David Shuster demanded of Ron Paul , during a television interview shortly after the assassination , " what would you do , what action would you take ? "
Action without thought of the consequences : that ’s the problem with the formulation of foreign policy in Western democracies  too much action and too little thought , when " doing something " is only apt to turn a crisis into a catastrophe .
That , unfortunately , is how a politically driven foreign policy is often made in Western democracies , but Paul did n’t fall for it .
Instead , he condemned the massive aid to the Musharraf regime and said that we should n’t be undermining him , either , by " stirring up the fires of civil unrest . "
We do n’t need to be " endlessly involved in these conflicts . "
We did n’t intervene when the Soviets had 40,000 nuclear weapons , and we do n’t need to intervene in Pakistan , either , under the dubious rationale that its nukes are about to fall into the hands of Islamists .
In fact , no such possibility immediately presents itself , and the " crisis " atmosphere generated by the American news media , in this instance , is biased in favor of the clumsiest sort of interventionism .
Pakistan is not now fated to fall into the hands of radical Islamists .
Such an outcome becomes more probable , however , the more determined we are to " do something . "
As Dr. Paul knows from his experience as a physician , the guiding rule of American foreign policy should be " First , do no harm . "
Taking " action "  intervening either militarily or politically  will do more harm than good .
The illusion that we can control events on the other side of the world is a dangerous one : the sooner we get over it , the more likely we are to stay out of trouble .

It was seven years ago today when everybody was getting excited about Microsoft ’s bombastic announcement of Hailstorm , promising that “ Hailstorm makes the technology in your life work together on your behalf and under your control . ”
What was it , really ?
The idea that the future operating system was on the net , on Microsoft ’s cloud , and you would log onto everything with Windows Passport and all your stuff would be up there .
It turns out : nobody needed this place for all their stuff .
And nobody trusted Microsoft with all their stuff .
And Hailstorm went away .
I tried to coin a term for the kind of people who invented Hailstorm : architecture astronauts .
“ That ’s one sure tip - off to the fact that you ’re being assaulted by an Architecture Astronaut : the incredible amount of bombast ; the heroic , utopian grandiloquence ; the boastfulness ; the complete lack of reality .
And people buy it !
The business press goes wild ! ”
The hallmark of an architecture astronaut is that they do n’t solve an actual problem … they solve something that appears to be the template of a lot of problems .
Or at least , they try .
Since 1988 many prominent architecture astronauts have been convinced that the biggest problem to solve is synchronization .
Follow the story , here .
I started picking on one company that appeared to be particularly astronautish : Groove , which was trying to rebuild Lotus Notes ( a giant synchronization machine ) in a peer - to - peer fashion .
Groove had some early success selling secure networks to the military - industrial complex , but did n’t make much of a ripple outside that niche .
Their real success was in getting bought by Microsoft , which brought Groove ’s designer and chief architecture - astronaut Ray Ozzie to the role of “ Chief Software Architect ” at Microsoft , supposedly the technical guy that would keep inventing the future after BillG left so that Steve Ballmer would have some new territory on which to build his next illegal monopoly .
And now Ray Ozzie ’s big achievement arrives and what is it ?
( drumroll … ) Microsoft Live Mesh .
The future of everything .
Microsoft is “ moving into the cloud . ”
What ’s Microsoft Live Mesh ?
Hmm , let ’s see .
“ Imagine all your devices — PCs , and soon Macs and mobile phones — working together to give you anywhere access to the information you care about . ”
Wait a minute .
Something smells fishy here .
Is n’t that exactly what Hailstorm was supposed to be ?
I smell an architecture astronaut .
And what is this Windows Live Mesh ?
It ’s a way to synchronize files .
Jeez , we ’ve had that forever .
When did the first sync web sites start coming out ?
1999 ?
There were a million versions .
xdrive , mydrive , idrive , youdrive , wealldrive for ice cream .
Nobody cared then and nobody cares now , because synchronizing files is just not a killer application .
I ’m sorry .
It seems like it should be .
But it ’s not .
But Windows Live Mesh is not just a way to synchronize files .
That ’s just the sample app .
It ’s a whole goddamned architecture , with an API and developer tools and in insane diagram showing all the nifty layers of acronyms , and it seems like the chief astronauts at Microsoft literally expect this to be their gigantic platform in the sky which will take over when Windows becomes irrelevant on the desktop .
And synchronizing files is supposed to be , like , the equivalent of Microsoft Write on Windows 1.0 .
It ’s Groove , rewritten from scratch , one more time .
Ray Ozzie just ca n’t stop rewriting this damn app , again and again and again , and taking 5 - 7 years each time .
And the fact that customers never asked for this feature and none of the earlier versions really took off as huge platforms does n’t stop him .
How on earth does Microsoft continue to pour massive resources into building the same frigging synchronization platforms again and again ?
Damn , they just finished building something called Windows Live FolderShare and I have n’t exactly noticed a stampede to that .
I ’ll bet you ’ve never even heard of it .
The 3,398th web site that lets you upload and download files to a place on the Internet .
I ’m so excited I might just die .
I should n’t really care .
What Microsoft ’s shareholders want to waste their money building , instead of earning nice dividends from two or three fabulous monopolies , is no business of mine .
I ’m not a shareholder .
It sort of bothers me , intellectually , that there are these people running around acting like they ’re building the next great thing who keep serving us the same exact TV dinner that I did n’t want on Sunday night , and I did n’t want it when you tried to serve it again Monday night , and you crunched it up and mixed in some cheese and I did n’t eat that Tuesday night , and here it is Wednesday and you ’ve rebuilt the whole goddamn TV dinner industry from the ground up and you ’re giving me 1955 salisbury steak that I just DON ’T WANT .
What is it going to take for you to get the message that customers do n’t want the things that architecture astronauts just love to build .
The people ?
They love twitter .
And flickr and delicious and picasa and tripit and ebay and a million other fun things , which they do want , and this so called synchronization problem is just not an actual problem , it ’s a fun programming exercise that you ’re doing because it ’s just hard enough to be interesting but not so hard that you ca n’t figure it out .
Why I really care is that Microsoft is vacuuming up way too many programmers .
Between Microsoft , with their shady recruiters making unethical exploding offers to unsuspecting college students , and Google ( you ’re on my radar ) paying untenable salaries to kids with more ultimate frisbee experience than Python , whose main job will be to play foosball in the googleplex and walk around trying to get someone … anyone … to come see the demo code they ’ve just written with their “ 20 % time , ” doing some kind of , let me guess , cloud - based synchronization … between Microsoft and Google the starting salary for a smart CS grad is inching dangerously close to six figures and these smart kids , the cream of our universities , are working on hopeless and useless architecture astronomy because these companies are like cancers , driven to grow at all cost , even though they ca n’t think of a single useful thing to build for us , but they need another 3000 - 4000 comp sci grads next week .
And dammit foosball does n’t play itself .
NEW DELHI 
The world ’s last Hindu king , Gyanendra of Nepal , was told to step down from his throne in 15 days , as a newly elected assembly led by former Maoist guerrillas voted late Wednesday to transform the country into a republic .
The vote by the special assembly , elected last month , formalizes the steady dissolution of the 239 - year - old monarchy in Nepal .
But exactly when and how the king would leave Narayanhity , the main palace in the capital , Katmandu , was not clear .
Gyanendra has made no public statements in recent weeks about his plans , though suspected royalists have made their disappointment known by setting off small bombs in Katmandu .
Three went off Wednesday , injuring no one .
On Tuesday a blast injured six ; a royalist organization called Ranabir Sena claimed responsibility .
Government officials in recent days have urged the king , a businessman with interests in tobacco and hotels , to move out of the pink concrete Narayanhity and into his own high - walled private residence nearby  or face eviction by force .

Learning about web - based applications will help you understand how they ’re different from websites .
When people think of apps , they think of the native apps they find in mainstream app stores .
Nonetheless , web apps ’ convenience and user - friendliness make them highly popular .
The internet is a powerful resource .
Knowing the difference between a web app and a website will make you more internet - savvy and educated .
Here ’s what you should know about web apps .
Web - Based Applications 101
What is a web application ?
A web - based application ( or web app for short ) is a software or program that uses web browsers and web technology to complete tasks through the internet .
Popular web application examples include everything from shopping carts and online forms to word processors and email programs like Gmail and Yahoo .
Web apps get stored on remote servers and delivered via the internet through a browser .
These apps are either accessible from any browser or designed with certain browsers in mind .
Web App Design
App developers design web app ’s frontend / interface using languages like Javascript , HTML , and CSS .
They create apps ’ backend / code using a programming stack such as MEAN and Lamp .
Like building a website , creating an app has its own complexities and challenges to mind .
If that sounds daunting , relax and hire professionals to take care of custom development for you .
Learn about the benefits in detail by checking out the aforementioned link .
How Web Apps Differ From Websites
A website is a collection of interconnected web pages users access through a domain .
Users can access websites from anywhere in the world .
Blogs and news sites are perfect website examples .
Websites are great for serving static content like articles paired with visual content .
They ’re also great for showcasing products and increasing brand awareness .
Google Analytics , Slack , Evernote⁠ — it does n’t take much homework to notice that the most successful web app examples come from successful websites .
Let ’s face it :
Though website application examples are often interlinked with websites , that ’s not always the case .
Control Over Functionality and Safety
Users can affect how apps function through manipulating restricted data .
They ca n’t affect a website ’s functioning , though .
Plus , web apps also require authentication for safety .
Websites do n’t require any authentication process , although it ’s possible to set up a secure https address for additional safety .
No Approval Necessary
The native apps in app stores require approval from the powers that be ( which are usually Apple , Android , and Google ) .
This means a corporation has a large say in how your app will come out .
Fortunately , web apps do n’t require an app store ’s approval .
This gives you more room for customization and creativity .
Web Apps Are Your Friends
A website with a 1 to 3 - second loading time has a probable bounce rate of 32 % .
Users abandon websites with long loading times and the same goes for web - based applications .
The probable bounce rate increases to 106 % once it reaches 6 seconds .
That same wait translates into decreased app usage .
Making your own app means equipping yourself with knowledge and avoiding certain pitfalls like long loading times .
Educate yourself by reading more of our app articles .
They ’ll enrich you with the ideas and information you need to succeed .
Graph
Description
if ( do_name ( ) != ' Home ' ) : ?> endif ?>
In mathematics and computer science , graph theory studies networks of connected nodes and their properties .
A graph can be used to visualize related data , or to find the shortest path from one node to another node for example .
Central concepts in graph theory are :
Node : a block of information in the network .
: a block of information in the network .
Edge : a connection between two nodes ( can have a direction and a weight ) .
: a connection between two nodes ( can have a direction and a weight ) .
Centrality : determining the relative importance of a node .
: determining the relative importance of a node .
Clustering : partitioning nodes into groups .
The NodeBox Graph library includes algorithms from NetworkX for betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality , Connelly Barnes ' implementation of Dijksta shortest paths ( here ) and the spring layout for JavaScript by Aslak Hellesoy and Dave Hoover ( here ) .
The goal of this library is visualization of small graphs ( < 200 elements ) , if you need something more robust we recommend using NetworkX .
For those of you looking for the old Graph library built on Boost , it can still be found here .

The library has a cool example of a visual browser for WordNet .
How to get the library up and running
Put the graph library folder in the same folder as your script so NodeBox can find the library .
You can also put it in ~/ Library / Application Support / NodeBox / .
graph = ximport ( " graph " )
Outside of NodeBox you can also just do import graph .
Creating a graph
create ( iterations = 1000 , distance= 1.0 , layout= " spring " , depth= True )
The create ( ) command returns a new graph object encompassing the drawing canvas .
The network of connected nodes will originate from the center of the canvas .
The distance parameter controls the spacing between nodes and hence the size of the graph .
By default , a spring force layout is used to visualize the graph .
Each element in the graph ( or node ) will try to get away as far as possible from the others .
This is the repulsive force in the network .
At the same time , there are connections ( or edges ) that keep nodes together .
The greater the weight of an edge the stronger it is in pulling two nodes together .
This is the attractive force in the network .
You can also set the layout parameter to " circle " to use a simple circle - based layout .
The forces in the network need to be calculated several times in order for the nodes ' positions to stabilize .
The higher the number of iterations the better ( but slower ) the layout .
When depth is set to True , the library will attempt to import the NodeBox Colors library for gradient and shadow effects .
The returned graph object has the following properties :
graph.nodes : a list of all the node objects in the graph .
: a list of all the objects in the graph .
graph.edges : a list of all the edge objects in the graph .
: a list of all the objects in the graph .
graph .leaves : a list of all the nodes with only one connection .
: a list of all the nodes with only one connection .
graph.root : the root node in the graph .
: the root node in the graph .
graph.done :
True when the graph 's layout is completely calculated .
: when the graph 's layout is completely calculated .
graph .distance : the scale of the graph when drawn ( usually a number between 0.5 and 2.0 ) .
graph.density : a number between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating the number of connections .
: a number between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating the number of connections .
graph.is_sparse :
True when there are few connections in the graph ( density is 0.35 or less ) .
: when there are few connections in the graph ( density is 0.35 or less ) .
graph.is_dense :
True when there are a lot of connections ( density is 0.65 or more ) .
: when there are a lot of connections ( density is 0.65 or more ) .
graph.is_complete :
True when all nodes are connected to all other nodes ( density is 1.0 ) .
graph.layout : the layout object used to calculate the graph .
: the object used to calculate the graph .
graph.events : the event object used to monitor mouse dragging and clicking .
: the object used to monitor mouse dragging and clicking .
graph.styles : the styles object used to colorize and draw the graph .
Adding nodes and edges
graph .
add_node ( id , radius= 8 , style= " default " , category= " " , root = False )
graph .
add_edge ( id1 , id2 , weight = 0.0 , length= 1.0 , label= " " )
You can add nodes ( e.g. blocks of information you want to connect ) to the graph with the graph.add_node ( ) method .
The id parameter uniquely identifies each node , it will appear as a label on each node once the graph is visualized .
When the root parameter is True it will set this node as the graph 's root .
The graph.add_node ( ) method returns a node object with the following properties :
node.id : the node 's unique id .
: the node 's unique id .
node.r : the node 's radius .
: the node 's radius .
node. style : the name of the style used to colorize and draw the node .
: the name of the style used to colorize and draw the node .
node .category : a category this node belongs to .
: a category this node belongs to .
node. label : displayed when the node is drawn ( by default , its id ) .
: displayed when the node is drawn ( by default , its id ) .
node.x : the horizontal position of the node on the canvas .
: the horizontal position of the node on the canvas .
node.y : the vertical position of the node on the canvas .
node.links : a list of all node objects connected to this one .
: a list of all objects connected to this one .
node.edges : a list of all edge objects this node is involved with .
: a list of all objects this node is involved with .
node.is_leaf :
True when the node has only one connection .
node . weight : a number between 0.0 and 1.0 reflecting the node 's relevance in the graph .
: a number between 0.0 and 1.0 reflecting the node 's relevance in the graph .
node. traffic : a number between 0.0 and 1.0 reflecting the amount of shortest paths .
: a number between 0.0 and 1.0 reflecting the amount of shortest paths .
node .
eigenvalue : identical to node . weight .
: identical to node .
betweenness:identical to node.traffic .
We 'll look at the details of a node 's weight and traffic in the section on graph proximity .
You can connect two nodes with the graph.add_edge ( ) method .
It takes two node id's , an optional weight ( ranging between 0.0 and 1.0 ) and an optional label to display near the edge when it is drawn .
An edge object is returned .
It has the following properties :
edge.node1 : the node object from which the connection originates .
: the object from which the connection originates .
edge.node2 : the node object in which the connection ends .
: the object in which the connection ends .
edge. weight : the weight or strength of the connection .
: the weight or strength of the connection .
edge.length : the individual length of the edge ( 1.0 by default ) .
: the individual length of the edge ( 1.0 by default ) .
edge.label : a label to display near the edge when drawn .
graph = ximport ( " graph " ) g = graph .
create ( iterations= 500 , distance= 0.8 ) g. add_node ( " NodeBox " ) g. add_node ( " Core Image " , category= " library " ) g. add_edge ( " Core Image " , " NodeBox " ) g. solve ( ) g. draw ( )
Retrieving / removing nodes and edges
The graph object has graph.nodes and graph.edges properties that list all of the nodes and connections it contains .
It also has a graph.node ( ) and a graph.edge ( ) method that returns nodes and edges based on id's :
graph .
node ( id )
graph .
edge ( id1 , id2 )
Furthermore , a graph behaves as a dictionary with node id keys linking to node object :
for id in graph : print graph [ id ] .
style
To remove nodes and edges you can use the methods below .
The graph.clear ( ) method removes all nodes and all edges and resets the graph 's layout .
This is useful when you want to dynamically reload a graph .
graph .
remove_node ( id )
graph .
remove_edge ( id1 , id2 )
graph .
clear ( )
You can get access to all the nodes connected to a given node from the node .
links list .
This list also has a fast node1.links.edge( node2 ) method that retrieves the edge between two nodes .
Drawing the graph
Before we can draw the graph to the canvas , we first need to calculate its layout .
This may take several seconds or more for graphs with many nodes .
More nodes slow down the process , as do more visual elements like edge labels .
The following methods are involved :
graph .
prune ( depth= 0 )
graph .
update ( iterations= 10 )
graph .
solve ( )
graph .
draw ( weighted =
False , directed =
False , highlight= [ ] , traffic= None )
The graph . prune ( ) method removes orphaned nodes that have no connections .
If depth is 1 it removes nodes that have one ore less connections , and so on .
Pruning is often a good idea , as the less nodes there are in a graph the faster the layout is calculated .
The graph.update ( ) method calculates a portion the total iterations .
This is useful in an animation when you want the graph to slowly unfold .
When the entire layout has been calculated , the graph . done property will be True .
The graph.solve ( ) method does all the iterations at once .
If you 're not running an animation you usually use this method before drawing the graph .
The graph.draw ( ) method draws the graph to the canvas .
It will originate from the canvas center ( although you can nudge it horizontally or vertically with optional dx and dy parameters ) .
The optional weighted parameter indicates an edge 's weight by adding a subtle shadow to it when set to True .
The optional directed parameters indicates an edge 's direction with an arrow when set to True .
The optional highlight parameter indicates a path between two nodes .
Node id's in the path are supplied as a list .
Usually this is a value returned from the graph.shortest_path ( ) method .
The optional traffic parameter can be a number , representing the amount of top - trafficked nodes to highlight .
Nodes with a high traffic have a lot of shortest paths passing through them therefore have a central role in the network .
Layout
If you 're using the graph in an animation , you can use the graph.layout.refresh ( ) method to trigger some new iterations .
This is useful when you are for example dynamically adding new nodes after the layout has stopped .
The graph.layout.reset ( ) restarts the layout from scratch .
graph .
layout .
refresh ( )
graph .
layout .
reset ( )
When using the spring - force layout , graph .
layout has a tweak ( ) method that allows you to play around with the internals of the layout algorithm :
graph .
layout .
tweak ( k= 2 , m= 0.01 , w= 15 , d= 0.5 , r= 15 )
The k parameter is the force constant by which nodes are pushed away from each other , m is a dampener for the total attractive / repulsive force , w is a weight multiplier ( so heavier edges have a bigger attraction ) , d is the maximum node movement per iterations and r is the radius of repulsive force originating from each node .
You may find the following layout properties easier to use :
graph.layout.force : the attractive / repulsive force in the layout ( 0.01 by default ) .
: the attractive / repulsive force in the layout ( 0.01 by default ) .
graph.layout .repulsion : the repulsive radius originating from each node ( 15 by default ) .
If you are using the circle layout , graph .
layout has only one property :
graph.layout.orbits : the number of circles used in the layout ( 2 by default ) .
Customizing styles and style rules
You can customize the look and feel of the graph down to the bottom .
The graph.styles dictionary has different styles for different nodes .
Each style has some color and font properties and a range of methods for drawing each element in the graph .
The styles dictionary is accompanied by a styleguide containing rules that define how and when to apply the styles .
You can easily modify existing styles , create new ones , and devise your own rules for how to apply them .
Predefined styles
Let 's have a look at the different styles in a graph :
default : this style is used for nodes that have no style defined .
Edges will always use the default stroke color .
light : a style with subtly highlighted nodes .
By default it is used for nodes directly connected to the root .
back : a style with green colored nodes and curved edges .
By default it is used to indicate a previous root node ( e.g. like a back button ) .
marked : a style that marks nodes with a dot .
By default it is used to indicate peers of the root node .
dark : a style with blue colored nodes .
By default it is used to indicate nodes with four or more connections .
important : a style with big blue colored nodes that get an extra outline .
By default it is used for nodes that have a weight of 0.75 or more .
highlight : a style that marks paths in pink .
By default it is used to indicate the highlight path supplied to graph.draw ( ) .
root : a style that marks the root node in the graph .
print graph .
styles . keys ( ) >>> [ ' default ' , ' light ' , ' back ' , ' marked ' , ' dark ' , >>> ' important ' , ' highlight ' , ' root ' ]
You can change the properties of each of the individual style objects :
graph .
styles .
root .
fontsize = 20
Or set a property on all styles :
graph .
styles .
stroke = color ( 1 )
Here 's an example of how to add your own custom style :
s = g. styles .
create ( " red " ) s. fill = color ( 1 , 0 , 0.25 , 0.75 )
Style properties
A style object has the following properties :
style .
background : graph background color ( always picked from the default style ) .
: graph background color ( always picked from the default style ) .
style .fill : fill color for nodes .
The default fill is also used as backdrop on weighted edges .
: fill color for nodes .
The default fill is also used as backdrop on weighted edges .
style .
stroke : the stroke color for node outlines .
The default stroke is used for all edges .
: the stroke color for node outlines .
The default stroke is used for all edges .
style .strokewidth : the width of node outlines and edges .
: the width of node outlines and edges .
style .
text : text color used for node and edge labels .
: text color used for node and edge labels .
style .
font : font used for node and edge labels .
: font used for node and edge labels .
style .
fontsize : fontsize for node and edge labels .
: fontsize for node and edge labels .
style .
textwidth : if the label 's width exceeds this number it gets wrapped to the next line .
: if the label 's width exceeds this number it gets wrapped to the next line .
style.align : aligns the node label either RIGHT or CENTER .
: aligns the node label either RIGHT or CENTER .
style .
depth :
True when this style uses the Colors library to render dropshadows .
Styleguide
You can assign the name of a style to node . style and then when the network is drawn the node will be visualized using the style 's properties and drawing methods .
You can assign styles by hand - for example , here 's how to make all nodes with a weight of more than 0.6 " important " :
for node in graph .
nodes : if node .
weight > 0.6 : node . style = " important "
Rules like these ( " heavy nodes are important " ) can also be bundled in the styleguide dictionary :
graph .
styles .
guide .
append ( " important " , lambda graph , node : node .
weight > 0.6 )
The default rules in the guide are :
{ " light " : lambda graph , node : graph .
root in node .
links " dark " : lambda graph , node : len ( node .
links ) > 4 " important " : lambda graph , node : node .
weight > 0.75 " root " : lambda graph , node : node == graph .
root " back " : lambda graph , node : node == graph .
events .
clicked }
nodes directly connected to the root get the light - style
nodes with four or more connections get the dark - style
nodes with a weight greater than 0.75 get the important - style
the root node gets the root - style
the node that was last clicked gets the back - style
Below is another interesting rule that keeps clusters of nodes together .
The edges of nodes that have only one connection become shorter , all others become longer .
The default styleguide uses a simpler version .
def cluster ( graph , node ) : if node == graph .
nodes [ 0 ] : for e in graph .
edges : e. length = 4.0 if len ( node .
links ) == 1 : graph .
edge ( node .
id , node .
links [ 0 ] . id ) . length = 0.2 graph .
styles .
guide .
append ( " cluster " , cluster )
To apply the styling rules to the network :
graph .
styles .
apply ( )
There 's a graph.styles.guide.order property ( which is a list of style names ) that defines the sequence in which style rules will be applied .
There 's also a graph.styles.clear ( ) method to remove all the rules .
Style drawing methods
A style has customizable drawing methods .
We will only go into this briefly here .
Developers can check the source code in the style .
py file in the library .
Here 's a quick example of how we add our own custom patch for edges :
def curly_edge ( style , path , edge , alpha= 1.0 ) : path .
moveto ( edge .
node1 . x , edge . node1 . y ) path .
curveto ( edge .
node1 . x - 40 , edge .
node1 . y , edge .
node2 . x + 40 , edge .
node2 . y , edge .
node2 . x , edge . node2 . y , ) graph .
styles .
default .
edge = curly_edge graph .
draw ( )
Interacting with the animated graph
You can use very small graphs ( < 100 nodes ) in an animation and watch them unfold fluidly .
The graph object has functionality for mouse interaction as well , bundled in the graph.events object .
It has the following properties :
graph.events.hovered :
None or the node over which the mouse hovers .
: or the node over which the mouse hovers .
graph.events.pressed :
None or the node on which the mouse is pressing down .
: or the node on which the mouse is pressing down .
graph.events.dragged :
None or the node being dragged .
: or the node being dragged .
graph.events.clicked :
None or the last node clicked .
: or the last node clicked .
graph.events.popup : when True , will display a popup window over the hovered node .
When you hover over a node the graph.events.hover ( ) method fires .
It will try to display a description of the node 's id from WordNet ( if you have the Linguistics or WordNet library installed ) .
To display your own popup text for a given node , register it in the graph.events .
popup_text dictionary : graph .
events .
popup_text [ " organism " ] = " hello "
In an animation you can also simply press down on a node and drag it around to where you want it .
The graph will stabilize by itself .
Last but not least , if you click on a node graph.events.click ( ) will fire .
This method takes one node parameter and does nothing by default , so if you want clicking behavior you 'll have to assign your own command : def click ( node ) : print node .
id + " clicked " graph .
events .
click = click
Connectivity
Finding out if two nodes are connected ( with zero or more other nodes in between them ) is easy enough with the node .
can_reach ( ) method , which returns either True or False :
node .
can_reach ( node , traversable : lambda node , edge : True )
What is intriguing about this method is the optional traversable parameter .
You can pass it a custom command .
This command takes two parameters , a node and an edge , and returns
True if the given node is allowed to travel over the given edge .
This allows for more elaborate searches .
For example , in the Perception library all edges have a type , like is - part - of or is - related - to .
Traversables are used to check if two nodes are connected using only specific types of edges : an oak is a tree only if the oak node can reach the tree node using only is - a edges ( and not , for example , is - property - of ) .
Proximity
Graphs are not only useful to visualize data , but to analyze it as well .
Knowing what the shortest path is , how to get from one node to another , can tell us something of how those nodes relate to each other .
Dijkstra 's shortest path algorithm is a way to find the closest route from one node to another in the network .
For example , if the nodes in the network represent cities and their strength represent driving distances between pairs of cities connected by a direct road , Dijkstra 's algorithm can be used to find the shortest route between two cities .
graph .
shortest_path ( id1 , id2 , heuristic= None , directed =
False )
The graph.shortest_path ( ) method returns a list of node id 's connecting the two nodes with the given id's .
If no connection can be found it will return None .
path = graph .
shortest_path ( 119 , 381 ) graph .
draw ( highlight=path , weighted =
True ) print path >>> [ 119 , 383 , 478 , 78 , 381 ]
When searching for a shortest route the edge weight becomes important .
Edges with a higher weight represent shorter routes .
You can think of an edge with a weight of 1.0 as a highway and an edge with a weight of 0.0 as a mountain trail .
So even if an edge looks longer onscreen ( because it yields a nicer layout for example ) it might still be a better candidate to travel by .
Likewise , a straight connection may be abandoned in favor of a detour on heavier edges .
Optionally you can also supply your own heuristic function to tweak the pathfinder .
It is a command that takes two node id's as its parameters and returns a number ( usually between - 1 and +1 ) .
The lower this number gets the more interesting the connection between the two nodes becomes .
For example , in a game environment you could use edge weight to represent the quality of a road through the world , and supply heuristic terrain penalties for mountains , swamps , oceans - to discourage AI - controlled characters from trying to cross the ocean or walk through walls to reach an enemy .
Centrality
How a node is connected to other nodes influences its importance in the network .
The Graph library uses two measurements to determine a node 's importance : betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality .
Betweenness centrality : nodes that occur on many shortest paths have a higher betweenness .
You can think of such nodes as being hubs , landmarks , city centers and so on .
The betweenness centrality of a node is represented in the node .
traffic property as a number between 0.0 and 1.0 .
Eigenvector centrality : nodes that ( indirectly ) connect to high - scoring nodes get a better score themselves .
In this case the edge direction plays an important role .
Ideally , everyone is pointing at you and you are pointing at no - one - meaning you are at the top of hierarchy .
The eigenvector centrality is represented in the node .
weight property as a number between 0.0 and 1.0 .
Consider a node that has eight connections to other nodes .
Consider another node that has three connections that each connect to two other nodes .
An initial naive estimate would be to say that the node in the first case is more important because it has eight connections .
However , the node in the second case has the potential to influence up to nine other nodes , and therefore it has a higher importance in the network .
The king of a country has only his advisors as direct connections , but his influence is obviously much higher than a post office secretary in the same country who may have hundreds of direct connections with his clients .
Eigenvalue centrality is what Google 's PageRank algorithm uses to rank web pages .
Read some more interesting details on the 20 bits blog .
The graph has two methods that return a list of nodes sorted according to traffic or weight :
graph .
nodes_by_traffic ( threshold= 0.0 )
graph .
nodes_by_weight ( threshold= 0.0 )
If you dynamically add new nodes to the graph the balance can shift and you may want to recalculate the proximity values :
graph .
betweenness_centrality ( directed = False )
graph .
eigenvector_centrality ( reversed = True , rating = { } , start= None , iterations = 100 , tolerance= 0.0001 )
Both methods recalculate a node 's traffic / weight property and return a dictionary of node id 's linked to a value between 0.0 and 1.0 .
You may also notice the optional rating parameter which is a dictionary of node id's linked to a score to influence it's weight ( e.g .
Google not only examines a web page 's connections but also its contents - the score of a page 's content could be reflected in the ranking dictionary ) .
Clustering
Clustering means the classification of objects into different groups , so that all the objects in a group share some common traits ( e.g. a rabbit and a bird both belong to the animal group ) .
Clustering is in part related to how you organize your graph , and in part to what analysis you can then perform on the graph .
The Graph library has some simple tools for cluster analysis .
graph .
nodes_by_category ( name )
The graph.nodes_by_category ( ) method returns a list of all nodes that have their category property equal to the given name .
graph .
fringe ( depth= 2 )
The graph. fringe ( ) method returns a list of nodes on the perimeter of the graph .
With a depth of 1 it returns all the leaf nodes , with a depth of 2 all the leaf nodes and nodes connected to leaf nodes , etc .
graph .
sub ( id , distance= 1 )
The graph.sub ( ) method returns a new graph object that is a subset of the given graph .
If distance is 0 , it will contain only the node with the given id .
If distance is 1 , it will contain the node and all nodes directly connected to that node .
If distance is 2 , it will also contain all nodes that are connected to nodes directly connected to the given node , and so on .
You can also supply a list of id's instead of a single id .
Yet another way to create a subgraph is to pass a filtering function instead of an id .
For example :
graph = ximport ( " graph " ) g = graph .
create ( iterations= 500 , distance= 0.8 ) g. add_node ( " NodeBox " ) g. add_node ( " Linguistics " , category= " library " ) g. add_node ( " WordNet " , category= " library " ) g. add_edge ( " Linguistics " , " NodeBox " , label= " related - to " ) g. add_edge ( " WordNet " , " NodeBox " , label= " related - to " ) g. add_edge ( " WordNet " , " Linguistics " , label= " part - of " ) # subgraph containing only library nodes : g = g. sub ( lambda node : node .
category == " library " , distance=
0 ) g. distance = 1.4 g. solve ( ) g. draw ( directed =
True )
Note : remember that if you want to draw a subgraph , you need to recalculate the layout with the update ( ) or solve ( ) method .
Subgraph set theory
Set theory deals with union , difference and intersection operations between sets of elements .
You can compare subgraphs to find out which nodes they have in common ( intersection ) , which nodes they do not have in common ( difference ) or which is the combined set of both subgraphs ( union ) .
Union : all elements from A and all elements from B .
: all elements from A and all elements from B. Difference : elements that appear in A but not in B .
: elements that appear in A but not in B. Intersection : elements that appear in A as well as in B .
The following methods will return a new subgraph based on set operations :
graph1 . join ( graph2 ) # union , graph1 | graph2 also works
graph1 . subtract ( graph2 ) # difference , graph1 - graph2 also works
graph1 . intersect ( graph2 ) # intersection , graph1 & graphs2 also works
Cliques
In graph theory , a clique is a graph in which each node is connected to all the other nodes .
There 's a graph .
is_clique property that returns
True when the graph is complete .
Since each node is connected to every other node in a complete graph , its density will be 1.0 .
graph .
clique ( id , distance= 0 )
graph .
cliques ( id , threshold= 3 , distance= 0 )
The graph.clique ( ) method returns a subgraph of the biggest clique around the node with the given id .
It takes an optional distance parameter which will also include other nodes connected to the nodes in the clique ( see the distance parameter for the graph.sub ( ) method ) .
The graph.cliques ( ) method returns a list of subgraphs that are cliques of at least threshold nodes .
Partitioning
Finally , there 's a powerful technique to split a graph into its unconnected subgraphs .
Sometimes your graph may contain two or more clusters of nodes without connections between them ( especially if you do n't know where the data came from ) .
The graph.split( ) method will return a list of unconnected subgraphs , sorted biggest - first :
subgraphs = graph .
split ( ) subgraphs [ 0 ] . solve ( ) subgraphs [ 0 ] . draw ( )
Known issues and limitations
Exporting a graph as a PDF may crash NodeBox on some systems .
Disabling dropshadow and gradient effects should remedy this :
g = graph .
create ( depth= False )
include ( " util/comment.php " ) ; ?>
Sometimes all it takes is a short bit of wisdom … to give you confidence , to get you through the bad times , to inspire you to greater heights .
Earlier this month I attended the latest American Express OPEN Forum in New York .
All of the Forums have been excellent , but this one stands out .
Why ?
Because I walked away with so many small yet powerful bits of wisdom that I simply can’t stop thinking about .
Like the last Forum , this particular event was kicked off by Susan Sobbott , president of American Express OPEN .
The moderator was financial columnist and author Jean Chatzky .
The featured entrepreneurs in this event were : famous chef Mario Batali , the three founders of the Blue Man Group ( Chris Wink , Matt Goldman and Phil Stanton ) , and maternity fashion designer Liz Lange .
Let me share the top ten bits of wisdom that I picked up from this American Express OPEN Forum , based on my notes during the event .
Here they are :
“ To be successful in business you do n’t just need a great idea — you have to sell it .
Do n’t be afraid to sell .
Do n’t think of yourself as anything but a marketer . ” ( Susan Sobbott ) — My Take :
For some this comes naturally .
But for others , especially those who do not have a sales or marketing background , this can seem like the hardest thing in the world .
However , most owners of successful businesses will tell you that they were their company ’s main sales representative , certainly in the beginning .
You have to be able to sell and market your business — do n’t expect to delegate this to someone else .
“ Every brand is n’t for everybody , and everybody is n’t for every brand . ” ( Liz Lange ) — My Take :
In other words , do what small businesses do best and focus on a niche — and then own that niche .
Be at the top .
“ The Web puts an exponential twist on the whole word of mouth thing , because word of mouth is now happening virally . ” ( Blue Man ) — My Take : the Web is a megaphone .
It gives you leverage and dramatically increases the spread of any talk about your business .
The Web makes it easier for word of mouth to spread , and spread more quickly and more widely .
“ An inner quality that many entrepreneurs say helps them survive is optimism . ” ( Jean Chatzky ) —
My Take : optimism is the number one essential characteristic of successful entrepreneurs .
There are so many things that can go wrong when you own your own business , especially in the early years .
Every single day is littered with stumbling blocks and reasons to call it quits .
You have to be driven by a belief that things will work out well in the end .
“ If you had to choose an address , it would be on the corner of Art and Commerce . ” ( Mario Batali ) — My Take :
This is perhaps the single most unique quote of the event .
It means , turn your business into an art form .
Being creative is at the core of successful businesses .
“ A little personality goes a long way . ” ( Jean Chatzky ) — My Take :
The theme of this Forum is “ standing out from the crowd . ”
Letting your personality show through is a way to make your business stand out .
People remember you and thus your business .
Instead of trying to be a corporate clone , be different .
For instance , Mario Batali lets his personality show through by always wearing shorts and orange clogs .
Maybe we do n’t all want to go that far , but ….
“ Be aggressive in getting media coverage . ” ( Liz Lange ) — My Take : Media coverage is free , which is a very attractive price tag for most small businesses .
But media coverage usually is not an accident .
You have to take it in your own hands to get coverage .
And as Liz ’s experience illustrated , you have to be creative in order to get media coverage .
For instance , Liz sent maternity clothes to celebrities .
The media were more likely to cover a celebrity wearing Liz ’s maternity clothes , than to write an ordinary article about maternity clothing .
“ Follow your bliss . ” ( Blue Man ) — My Take :
In a way this is like the old saying , do what you love and money will follow .
Of course the reason it is an OLD saying is that there is truth to it .
When we are passionate about what we do our passion gets translated into creativity , into the amount of effort we devote to the business , and into many other factors big and small .
“ We are all competing against mediocrity . ” ( Blue Man ) — My Take : Instead of focusing on the competition , strive for a higher level of creativity .
To create a great business create something extraordinary , instead of falling into a rut and settling for average .
“ Everyone talks about growing the business , but what you do n’t hear enough about is the importance of not growing the business too fast . ” ( Blue Man ) — My Take : Growth can bring on its own set of challenges and problems .
Grow the business at the pace that feels right to you to manage and handle .
If you are comfortable with fast change , then grow it fast .
Otherwise , keep the business smaller and more manageable for you .
Not everyone wants to grow their business .

3 Reasons Manure is Becoming a Cash Crop
May 20th , 2008 by Sarah Lozanova
You know that times are changing when farmers look to manure as a valuable commodity .
Pretty soon , manure from a herd may be more profitable than the beef itself .
Manufactured fertilizers has tripled in price in the last year , driving farmers to look for alternatives .
This is certainly an indicator of a shifting economy .
1. Energy Prices
Fertilizers are a very energy intensive product .
Nitrogen fertilizers are commonly made from petroleum or natural gas .
The potash and phosphates in the fertilizers are derived from mining , which also requires a lot of energy .
Finally , the finished product needs to be transported and we know all about high gas prices .
2. Fertilizer Demand in China and India
China and India have increasingly been depending on fertilizer , causing a spike in demand .
The price of fertilizer has climbed to $ 750 a ton .
3. Bans on U.S. Beef
In December , 2003 the U.S. beef export market saw a steep decline .
Mexico , Canada , Japan , and Korea comprise over 90 % of the beef export market in the U.S. , with all countries significantly reducing beef imports in 2004 .
Japan was the single largest importer of beef and their ban on U.S. beef continues .
This is driving cattle farmers to find other valuable uses for their cows , such as fertilizer .
A decreased reliance on manufactured fertilizers and a return to more traditional farming techniques could have its benefits .
Algal blooms caused by chemical fertilizers , like the one in the Mississippi delta can harm fish populations .
Fertilizers frequently find their way into ground water , thus contaminating drinking water supplies .
The farming industry has been undergoing significant changes from the rise in biofuels , leases for wind farms , and recent scares over food safety .
Now some farmers are returning to more traditional methods , such as the use of manure .
It makes me wonder , what is next ?

McCain :
The fact is , it ’s a classic counterinsurgency .
And you have to get areas under a secure environment , and that secure environment then allows the economic , political , and social process to move forward .
In case you missed it , New Year ’s Eve , people were out in the streets in Baghdad by the thousands for the first time in years .
That ’s because we provided them with a safe and secure environment .
Is it totally safe ?
No .
I talked earlier about the suicide bombs and the continued threats .
But then what happens is American troops withdraw to bases .
And we reach an arrangement like they have with South Korea and Japan .
We still have troops in Bosnia .
The fact is , it ’s American casualties that the American people care about .
Those casualties are on the way down , rather dramatically .
You ’ve got to consider the option .
If we had withdrawn six months ago , I can look you in the eye and tell you that Al Qaeda would have said , We beat the United States of America .
If we ’d gone along with Harry Reid and said the war is lost to Al Qaeda , then we would be fighting that battle all over the Middle East .
I ’m convinced of that and so is General Petraeus … .
I can tell you that it ’s going to be long and hard and tough .
I can tell you that the option of defeat is incredible and horrendous .
And I can look you in the eye and tell you that this strategy is succeeding .
And what we care about is not American presence .
We care about American casualties .
And those casualties will be dramatically and continue to be reduced .
Tiffany : I do not believe that one more soldier being killed every day is success .
There were three U.S. soldiers killed today .
I want to know , How long are we going to be there ?
McCain :
How long do you want us to be in South Korea ?
How long do you want us to be in Bosnia ?
Tiffany : There ’s no fighting going on in South Korea .
There ’s no fighting in Bosnia .
Let ’s come back to Iraq .
McCain : I can look you in the eye and tell you that those casualties tragically continue …
But they are much less , and they are dramatically reduced and we will eventually eliminate them .
And again , the option of setting a date for withdrawal is a date for surrender .
And we will then have many more casualties and many more American sacrifices if we withdraw with setting a date for surrender .
Now you and I have an open and honest disagreement .
But I can tell you that six months ago people like you , who believe like you do , said the surge would never succeed .
It is succeeding .
And I ’ve been there and I ’ve seen it with my very own eyes .
Do you want to follow up ?
Tiffany : President Bush has talked about our staying in Iraq for fifty years .
McCain : Make it a hundred .
How long —
We ’ve been in Japan for 60 years , we ’ve been in South Korea for fifty years or so .
That ’d be fine with me as long as Americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed .
That ’s fine with me .
I hope it would be fine with you if we maintain a presence in a very volatile part of the world where Al Qaeda is training and recruiting and equipping and motivating people every single day .
Tiffany :
By the way , I hope you kick Romney ’s butt .
That man can not lie straight in bed .
McCain : I knew there was a reason I called on you .
Tiffany : What if U.S. soldiers are being killed at the same rate , one per day , four years from now ?
McCain : I ca n’t tell you what the ratio is .
But I can tell you , I understand American public opinion , sir .
I understand American public opinion will not sustain a conflict where Americans continue to be sacrificed without showing them that we can succeed .
Tiffany : I hear an open - ended commitment , then .
McCain : I have an open - ended commitment in Asia .
I have an open - ended commitment in South Korea .
I have an open - ended commitment in Bosnia .
I have an open - ended commitment in in Europe …
( CNN ) --
The second - in - command of al Qaeda has said the terrorist group does not kill innocents and that its leader Osama bin Laden is healthy , according to a transcript of an audio tape released by radical Islamist Web sites .
An image of Ayman al - Zawahiri taken from an earlier videotape .
Ayman al - Zawahiri made his remarks in response to questions solicited on a Web site close to al Qaeda .
The questions asked his views about Egypt and Iraq as well as Hamas , the militant Islamic group that seized control of Gaza last year .
They also referred to attacks by al Qaeda and affiliated groups that have killed scores of civilians in Muslim nations , such as Algeria , Iraq and Morocco .
Al - Zawahiri , who led an Egyptian Islamic militant group that joined forces with bin Laden in the 1990s , said innocents who have been killed in attacks by al Qaeda or affiliated groups died as a result of " unintentional error " or because they were used as " human shields " by " the enemy . "
Governments worldwide have blamed al Qaeda for attacks that have killed several thousand people , including about 3,000 who died in the attacks on Washington and New York on September 11 , 2001 .
Al - Zawahiri defended a December attack in Algeria -- hospital sources said it killed 60 people -- because one of its targets was a United Nations building and the " United Nations is an enemy of Islam and Muslims , " according to the transcript .
He said " bin Laden is healthy and well , " the transcript said , but that even if he " does n't become ill , he must die one day . "
Al - Jazeera broadcast an audiotape last month on which a voice identified as bin Laden 's declared " Iraq is the perfect base to set up the jihad to liberate Palestine . "
Bin Laden , who was behind the terrorist network 's September 11 attacks , has been in hiding since the U.S. assault on Afghanistan that followed those strikes .
He is rumored to have faced health troubles or to have been wounded in an attack , although nothing conclusive has been found .
He is believed to be hiding somewhere in the mountainous region of the Pakistani - Afghan border .
The United States has posted a $ 25 million reward for his capture .

Researchers from the Howard Florey Institute in Melbourne are developing new technology to create individualised brain maps that will revolutionise diagnosis of disease and enhance the accuracy of brain surgery .
Currently researchers and neurosurgeons rely on coarse maps of the brain 's structure that are based on a small number of individuals ' brains after death .
These maps do not allow for differences that can occur between people 's brains .
The new brain mapping technology will be created by developing acquisition and analysis processes and software that will provide microscopic level investigation of individual brains .
The Florey researchers are contributing neuroscience , engineering and mathematical expertise to this project , whilst collaborators from the Neuroscience Research Institute in South Korea are providing the equipment .
It is hoped this technology will become widely available in the next two to three years .
Leader of the Neuroimaging group at the Howard Florey Institute , A / Prof Gary Egan , said his group was using one of the most powerful Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) scanners in the world -- an ultra-high field 7 Tesla -- to help develop the new brain mapping technology .

" Microscopic images inside the living brain will transform diagnosis and treatment of diseases such as multiple sclerosis , Parkinson 's disease , Alzheimer 's disease and Huntington 's disease , " A / Prof Egan said .
" This technology will allow us to look at cortical grey matter and underlying white matter at a level previously only seen before in post - mortem brains .
" Current MRI techniques cannot show specific organisation and functional patterns in the living brain .
" For example , developmental neuronal migration defects are known to cause epilepsy , but they cannot be seen with existing MRI technology .
" Ultra - high resolution imaging will allow scientists and doctors to clearly see defects in the brain and develop therapeutic strategies to address these problems , " he said .

Unfortunately , Australia does not have a 7 Tesla scanner , which is why the Howard Florey Institute and University of Melbourne scientists are collaborating with the Neuroscience Research Institute in South Korea , who own the only high resolution 7 Tesla scanner in the Asia Pacific region .
The most powerful scanners in Australia are 3 Tesla , which are accessed by the Florey scientists for other research projects .
A / Prof Egan said he hoped a 7 Tesla scanner would very soon be located in Australia as neuroimaging can assist research into all brain and mind disorders .
" Having an ultra - high field 7 Tesla in Australia would allow us to accelerate our research , which would benefit the three million Australians who experience a major episode of brain disorder every year , " he added .
This research will be presented at the 14th Annual Meeting of the Organisation for Human Brain Mapping , which opened yesterday in Melbourne .
This conference , supported by the Howard Florey Institute , will see the world 's neuroimaging experts share their latest research and develop new collaborations .

Back in the day when communism was a politically viable economic program , its capitalist enemies used to love to rail against the evils of " Marxism - Leninism " .
Interestingly , they almost always attacked it for all the wrong reasons , citing , for example , the lack of political freedom in societies where it was being practiced , the aggressive tendencies of national leaders in those countries seeking to conquer their neighbors , or the ideology 's hostility to religion .
That last one in particular was always a good one for getting Americans to rise out of their pews in disgust and anger .
Those commies do n't even have Jesus !
The fact that none of these critiques had anything at all to do with the economic system that communism actually is was always telling .
It 's not so easy to attack the idea of sharing and community , is it ?
Better to wrap it up instead inside the godless thugs - sometimes real , sometimes not - who embraced it abroad .
What could be more un -American ?
This was chiefly a marketing ploy , and probably an unnecessary one at that , as communist experiments - again , in the form of economic systems - had limited successes and some spectacular failures .
The Soviet Union did rapidly grow from an agrarian economy into a superpower ( albeit not an economic one ) in very short time , in part through a planned economy .
However , that same system later became so ossified that the country ultimately collapsed around it .
Toward the end , workers used to joke about the sham command economy in which they were stuck , saying , " We pretend to work , and the government pretends to pay us " .
Often that was n't so far from the truth .
Likewise , it would be hard to make a real compelling argument for Mao's Great Leap Forward - a collectivization program that wiped out twenty or thirty million Chinese peasants - over Deng Xiaoping 's turn to the market , which has made the Chinese economy a gale force storm for three decades now , with political and military power following closely in its wake .
We in the US are now being treated to a similar experiment in economic ideology , though it is neither new nor , at the end of the day , actually ideological .
More on that later .
For now , though , in the spirit of my good friends on the right , I propose that we give this program the name it properly deserves : Reaganism - Bushism .
While China has been growing into an economic powerhouse these last thirty years , America , under the sway of Reaganism - Bushism , has become the economic equivalent of a Midwestern town decimated by a crystal meth epidemic .
Nor are the two likely unrelated , particularly when dealing devastating drugs is the sole economic opportunity on the landscape , and doing those drugs is the sole escape from that personal blight .
In any case , that 's our national story .
We 're the country that is losing its teeth , blasting its brain cells , rotting its body , and stealing everything not bolted down in order to feed its greed habit .
Now , as credit crises explode around us and our housing bubble pops and we 've run out of foreigners and domestics to exploit and the future and the past from which we 've borrowed so heavily are both calling in their chits - now we are the crystal meth country .
Survey the economic , social , political and moral landscape and cringe .
Look what Reaganism - Bushism has wrought .
Reaganism - Bushism markets itself as a real economic ideology with real principles , but the truth is all that 's just for the consumption of the hoi polloi .
As a Madison Avenue - or P.T. Barnum - scheme it 's rather more complex than that .
As a set of economic principles , it 's far less so .
Because your education in self - destructive political foolishness is not yet complete , it remains necessary to pretend that this is a real ideology with real economic principles that are actually adhered to .
You know , stuff like ' market discipline ' and the ' invisible hand ' , which only ever seem to apply to the already vulnerable , not to the friendly rich people forever espousing these ideas .
In truth , there actually are a set of operating principles here .
Just not the ones that are advertised .
Principle Number
One is that only a fool believes that the government is an instrument whose purpose is to insure the safety and welfare of the people living within the country 's borders .
In actuality , the government is a giant cash cow - in fact , the biggest of them all .
Yes , its purpose is in fact redistribution of wealth , just not in the southerly direction favored during the more quaint times of our youth .
Now it 's all about aggregating what 's left of meager middle - class earnings through tax collections and then redistributing it to the already fabulously wealthy folks of the richest one percent of the population .
( Actually , even many of those are pikers compared to the real money in this country , the top one - tenth of a percent who have their fingers really deep into the pie . )
But , of course , since this is fundamentally an exercise in wanton societal destruction , the cash cow is probably the wrong mammalian metaphor for the crisis in question .
What we 're actually talking about here is geese , as in the kind that lay golden eggs .
Or , at least , do so until you slit open their bellies .
But even steering fat , no -bid , no supervision , secret contracts to favored corporations in order to pay for military hardware we do n't need , or services in Iraq that are n't actually provided , is not enough .
( Did you see the New York Times cover story about American soldiers being electrocuted because of shoddy contractor work ?
Or the one about the Army employee who got reassigned when he questioned Kellogg , Brown and Root 's non-performance there ? )
So Principle Number
Two is to never let economic realities that would deter mere mortals prevent you from maximum possible aggrandizement .
In short , steal from your own kids .
The only thing more amazing about regressive - created deficits to finance bloated and unnecessary government spending is the fact that conservatives have until very recently somehow still prevailed in the political marketing wars sufficiently that Americans saw them as the folks who are most fiscally responsible .
Considering the record of our most conservative presidents ( and the ideological namesakes in question ) , this is truly an astonishing feat .
Ronald Reagan , who castigated Jimmy Carter in 1980 for economic mismanagement , including excessive deficits , proceeded to quadruple the national debt when he came to office .
Anyone could see it coming , too .
In fact , George Herbert Walker Bush , when he was fighting Reagan for the nomination that year , called the latter 's patently unbalanced economic agenda of military build - up , massive tax cuts and a balanced budget , " voodoo economics " .
In one of the greatest sell - outs of all history , however , Poppy Bush put his personal interest over our national interest , and become strangely silent on the matter after Reagan put him on the ticket as vice - presidential nominee , opening the way for him to ultimately win the presidency .
Meanwhile , not to be outdone by his daddy or Saint Ron , Lil ' Bush has turned the greatest budget surplus in American history into the greatest deficit ever .
His pals in Congress , always railing about Democratic fiscal irresponsibility , broke every imaginable record for doling out the self - serving pork once they got control of the national piggy bank .
The national debt is now well over nine trillion bucks , and fast rising .
If Bush 's tax cuts ( actually tax burden transfers , from the wealthy to the middle class , and from this generation to the next ) are renewed , it will be far worse still .
If the alternate minimum tax is properly adjusted , even worse yet .
And we know about the time - bomb of entitlement benefits for retiring Baby Boomers that will soon hit us .
What most Americans do n't know is that regressives have spent the last decades using their voodoo economics to raid those funds , in order to help keep the general budget deficits from being even worse , thus turning a time - bomb into a nuclear stockpile , about to explode .
So Reaganism - Bushism Principle Number
One is use the people 's government to steal everything you can from them .
Principle Number
Two is to use deficit spending to steal from their children as well .
( Ca n't you just see the commercial : " Why wait , when you can bilk it now ? ! " )
Principle Number
Three is to destroy as much of the social safety net as you possibly can .
After all , some Honest John knuckleheads out there are still going to be fiscally responsible enough to want to pay for what we spend , and if they go looking around for potential tax revenue , guess where they might see a whole lot of it lurking about , untouched ?
So , welfare programs gotta go .
Social Security ?
Gotta go , though of course you can't just kill middle class programs like you can for the poor , so you have to pretend your privatization plan is a reform to make the program solvent .
National healthcare ?
Yeah , right .
And , if you do have to add a prescription drug benefit because of the need to pander to seniors , make sure it 's written to line the pockets of Big Pharma and Big Insurance so heavily that their pants fall down around their ankles .
Do n't worry , they have plenty of servants they can get to pull them back up .
The fourth precept of Reaganism - Bushism is an extension of the first three .
Once you 've exhausted your exploitation of the folks at home and their children , why stop ?
Americans are only five percent of the world 's population .
That leaves a whole world of nice vulnerable people to exploit economically !!
And politically .
And physically .
Can you say " Pinochet " ?
" The Shah " ?
" Apartheid " ?
" Contras " ?
" Marcos " ?
And lots more where those good old boys came from .
Regressives did n't prop up those bloody dictators because they were great lovers of democracy , or even because of some concern about communist incursions into the ' free ' world .
They did it because all you had to do was enrich these tinhorns and stroke their egos in order guarantee their assistance in the pillaging of their own people .
In Grant 's era , or even Hoover 's , all plunder was local - or at least mostly .
Reagan and Bush have taken the hunt for spoils truly global .
But why stop with people , even 6.5 billion of them ?
There 's an entire landscape to be raped !
Doing so with wanton disregard for the consequences is Principle Number Five .
When the Berlin Wall came down in 1989 , one of the surprises for people in the West , not to mention many in the East , was the degree of environmental annihilation that had taken place .
In the race to seek industrial parity with the West , the cheapest way for the Soviets and their allies to get the job done was to ignore environmental impacts of any sort .
So that 's just what they did , to devastating consequences .
The rest of the world is likely to be having a similar experience pretty soon .
Whether it 's mountain leveling , or rainforest obliteration , or gargantuan industrialized outdoor cattle toilets , or sticking the planet in the pot and leaving it there on a low boil , the world is beginning to find out what happens when the captains of industry exploit the planet 's resources while leaving the ' externalities ' for the rest of us to clean up .
And what happens when right - wing politicians who are supposed to be regulating them in the public interest instead serve the special interests .
Hint :
It ai n't pretty .
When it comes to regressive politics in America today , nothing is sacred , not even the ground you walk upon , the water you drink or the air you breathe .
Finally , Reaganism - Bushism Principle Number
Six is that war is not healthy for children and other living things , except rich people getting even richer from it .
So be sure to have lots of war .
Or , at the very least , lots of spending on war goodies .
Right now , the US not only spends more on ' defense ' than any other country , it spends more - and it's not even close - than every other country in the world , combined !
And there are 195 of them or so , if you 're keeping score .
And our great national threat is ...?
Nazi Germany ?
Nah. Stalin's Soviet Union ?
Nope .
It 's a guy with a beard holed up in the mountains of Pakistan , and a few other folks like him .
( Or , at least it used to be a few , until we had the bright idea of launching the Al Qaeda Hyperdrive Recruitment Program , aka the Iraq War . )
Meanwhile , gee , I do n't know .
Is it just me , or does this seem like a grossly disproportionate amount of money to spend on privately produced military hardware , especially when our medical , education and infrastructural systems are crumbling at home ?
I guess it 's just all a big coincidence that we spend so much on military hardware while the fat - cats bankrolling regressive politicians are getting rich from the war toys the latter then turn around and purchase from the former .
All that said , the above itemization of Reaganism - Bushism 's key ideological principles absolutely gives the creed far too much credit .
That 's because this is no ideology at all , even a bad one .
In actuality , it is a prescription for pillaging and kleptocracy , wrapped in an ideological cloak to give it legitimacy .
They need to market it that way because it's a little early yet in the Dumbification of America campaign for them to come right out and tell you that war is peace , freedom is slavery and ignorance is strength .
Only Republican voters are quite so intoxicated to believe that already , and lots of them have been falling off the wagon lately .
So , instead , they have to give you this looting of your own wallet and the tattering of your moral map all gussied up as a real , bona fide economic ideology .
You know :
Free trade raises prosperity for everyone !
Tax cuts benefit the country and even raise governmental revenues !
Government regulation is evil !
A skyrocketing wealth gap is just the natural product of entrpreneurial dynamism !
And social programs to assist the poor , elderly and the middle class sap the moral strength of the country !
Then they go find some loopy economist like Arthur Laffer to legitimate completely counter - intuitive ideas by publishing some fancy graphs in some backward academic journal .
Never mind that your wallet gets lighter every year - you 've got to stick with this economic program because it's the American Way , and anything else is some commie plot .
Marxism - Leninism may be a dead ideology ( or it may not ) , relegated to the ash heap of history , but at least it sprang from an altruistic motivation .
Marx was n't sitting in the British Museum all day long figuring out how he could get rich by exploiting the masses .
Reaganism - Bushism was always just the opposite - it 's just as non-altruistic a program as thievery always was , whatever fancy label you want to paste on it , however much lipstick you slather on the pig .
Just as evil as slavery , colonialism , worker exploitation and environmental depredation ever were .
And just as much a real ideology as any emperor 's fine set of new clothes .

The day that Lauren Quick , 11 , started at the mixed comprehensive in her Yorkshire home town , an older lad stormed into her classroom at break , shouting , " Oi , there 's a tranny in here – show me where it is ! "
Suddenly , Lauren , who had been insisting from the age of three that she had " a girl brain in a boy 's body " , was surrounded .
She was distraught and , weeks later , made her first attempt to kill herself .
Two further attempts followed in the next five months – the last in the school lavatories .
Her life , says mother Jan , had become a living nightmare .
Every day , she faced shouts of " man beast " and " tranny " from pupils , as well as calls to " get your dick out " – even , on one occasion , when she was being escorted by a teacher .
Lauren 's response was to self - harm on a regular basis .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The town 's police hate crimes unit became involved three times after several incidents , including one pupil spitting in her face and a mother who was picking up offspring shouting , " You fucking tranny " , through the car window as Lauren walked home from school .
Lauren was more often absent than in school .
Although the school supported Lauren 's desire to be accepted as a girl , and made determined efforts to stamp out the bullying – taking the perpetrator of each incident aside to explain Lauren 's circumstances – one day , everything came to a head .
Lauren was ambushed on the way home by older boys , who tried to remove her skirt in an attempt to see her genitals .
Lauren refused point - blank to return to school .
Jan obtained a transfer for her to a nearby high school , which had already successfully dealt with a transgender pupil .
Lauren lasted only a few weeks .
Now 14 , she is being educated three days a week in a unit for long - term ill and severely bullied pupils .
She would like to go back to school , but she and her mother doubt that it will ever be possible .
" There are no easy answers , but the school was just handling it on the hoof , " says Jan .
" There was no attempt to plan anything .
The school was totally unprepared for dealing with a kid like Lauren . "
The deputy head of that school , who still speaks to Lauren on the phone occasionally , agrees .
" We were dealing with things that we could not possibly ever have expected .
Who teaches you how to deal with a 13 - year - old who wants to be a girl , but is having erections in class ?
We were dealing with each incident as it came up , but perhaps we should have tackled it as a school . "
Lauren 's story reflects the difficulties experienced by British schools when faced with a pupil who does not fit neatly in to the " boy " or " girl " box .
It 's not just confusion about personal pronouns , either – even the most mundane problems , such as which lavatories a trans pupil should use and where they change for PE , become major issues .
In Lauren 's case , she was not allowed to use the girls ' loos , and felt humiliated at having to use the disabled ones , particularly as they were kept locked and she had to ask for the key .

Looking at her now , making some toast in the family kitchen , she is like any other gangly 14 - year - old girl with her dyed , shoulder - length hair , denim skirt and leggings .
But she has male genitalia and , by British law , must wait until she is 16 to have medical treatment to give her the body she feels was denied her at birth .
According to figures provided by the Gender Identity Research and Education Service ( Gires ) , one in 1,000 school children suffer from gender dysphoria – roughly one pupil for every high school – though not all of them will seek gender reassignment surgery .
Lauren is typical in that she has been the target of severe bullying .
According to research by Gires and the transgender pressure group Press For Change , more transgender pupils report being bullied than gay pupils , who themselves report rates of name - calling of 82 per cent .
Most fail to complete their school education , although they catch up later and gain more than the national average number of qualifications .
More seriously , around half of all transgender teenagers will make a suicide attempt before they turn 20 .
In February , 10 - year - old Cameron McWilliams was found hanged in Doncaster .
The inquest revealed he had expressed a desire to be a girl .
In this highly volatile atmosphere , schools must somehow act in the best interests of their most vulnerable pupils .
As Bernard Reed , trustee of Gires , says : " Schools think it is so rare that they do n't take it seriously , but when a trans child comes into a school , the effect can be seismic . "
The Home Office acknowledges the problem of transphobic bullying and has commissioned Gires to produce information for schools explaining gender variance , its medical , legal and equality aspects , which will be displayed in the Crime Reduction section of the Home Office website .
Press for Change has just produced a " toolkit " for further education and sixth form colleges , consisting of 21 five - minute lessons aimed at leaders of education institutions .
It was commissioned by the Learning and Education Council , the trade union Unison and the Centre for Excellence in Leadership .
As the deputy head at Lauren 's former school says : " We had nothing to help us , but when Lauren had been at school for a while we began getting calls from teachers at other school asking for advice with similar situations . "
Not all transgender pupils ' school experiences are negative , however .
When Pippa James explained at a parents ' evening that the reason her 15 - year - old son Tim 's grades had plummeted was because of his despair following his recent declaration that he wanted to be a girl , the school pulled around to protect the bright teenager .
Although Pippa and her husband offered to remove Tim , the year head backed his desire to " transition " to become " Becky " over a school holiday , declaring that they knew him and could " ensure his safety " .
Shortly after , Tim tried to hang himself .
Following a number of meetings between his parents and the school , Tim was told to stay home for a day while groups of pupils in his year in the mixed comprehensive were told by well - briefed teachers what was happening to Tim , what to expect and that bullying would not be tolerated .
Curious pupils asked questions , but accepted it and simply viewed him as the fastest runner in their year .
According to the family and the school , not a single case of bullying against Tim was reported – even when he came back with long hair and female clothes .
Becky , now 19 and a talented artist , has undergone gender reassignment surgery in Thailand paid for by her parents , and is intending to go to art school .
As Pippa says : " In terms of school , it was a wonderfully positive experience .
Becky 's life , apart from school at the time , was terrible and she was in utter despair .
If school had not dealt with her kindly and been accepting , it would have been the last straw and she would have ended it all . "
The despair to which Pippa alludes is because of the battles that Becky , Lauren and all young trans teenagers in the UK face in obtaining medical help for the outward signs of puberty , until they make a decision about gender reassignment .
England has only one clinic – at London 's Tavistock and Portman Trust – which offers advice on gender dysphoria to young people .
In Britain , the reversible use of drugs is banned before the age of 16 – although other EU countries and the US permit their use .
Jan Quick and the James family have re-mortgaged their homes to pay for their children 's treatment .
Lauren goes twice a year to Boston , in the United States , for puberty blockers , having been turned down by the Tavistock .
Pushing for reform of UK medical protocols is a major focus for Press For Change , but the organisation is also disturbed by the lack of protection for trans pupils in school .
Goods and services regulations just introduced by the Government 's Equalities Office do not address transphobic harassment in schools as they specifically exclude education .
" Individual schools now could choose not to educate a child , not to allow them to sing in a choir or to go on a school trip , " says Professor Stephen Whittle , an equalities lawyer and a professor at Manchester Metropolitan University , who started out female .
" The only protection for kids will be under education law – protecting the right to education as such , but not the nature of it . "
Many campaigners for transgender equality are pinning their hopes on the Single Equality Bill , which is expected next year .
The Government has been consulting on it and will report in the summer .
One of the questions is whether the Bill should extend to schools .
The Equality and Human Rights Commission is calling for explicit protection for transgender children in an equality Act , and extension of the public sector duty to promote equality for transgender people .
" All children have the right to be educated in a fair and tolerant environment , free from bullying . " said a commission spokesperson .
" At the moment , a very vulnerable group of young people are not adequately protected by the law . "
The names of transgender young people and their families have been changed to protect them

WASHINGTON  Americans are in sticker - shock over grocery prices , while people in developing countries are rioting over food shortages .
And across the heartland , American farmers are enjoying record incomes , but losing sleep over rising expenses and turbulence in the commodity futures markets .
Here on Capitol Hill , though , it is pretty much farm politics as usual .
As Congress works toward final passage of the farm bill , it is poised to continue most of the existing farmer subsidy programs , including about $ 5.2 billion a year in so - called “ direct payments ” that will be disbursed even as net farm income is projected to hit a historic high in 2008 .
The farm bill , which comes along once every five years and will cost upward of $ 300 billion , in fact will do little to address many of the most pressing concerns .
It will not change biofuel mandates that are directing more corn to ethanol and contributing to a global rise in food prices .
It will do little to ease worldwide food shortages .
And at a time of high volatility in the futures markets , it will not require tougher regulation .

Report Copyright Violation Cheney and Air Force Generals Implicated in Nuke Theft Excerpt of Part II of story at waynemadsenreport.com
Part II of a two - part series
Between August 24 and September 6 , 2007 , the U.S. Air Force 's nuclear chain - of - command was severely compromised by a rival chain established out of Vice President Dick Cheney 's office and extending through the offices of the Air Force Secretary and Chief of Staff , the Air Force 's Cyber - Warfare element , and into the strategic bombing commands located at Minot and Barksdale Air Force Bases .
In the weeks before and after this time period , there is ample evidence to suggest that the security of nuclear weapons , particularly at Minot , was placed in severe jeopardy by the rival chain - of - command .
On August 24 , 2007 , three B - 52s operating from Barksdale flew a training exercise called REX REDUX , officially billed as a commemoration of a 1938 B - 17 flight directed at the Italian luxury liner SS Rex .
The exercise , personally ordered by Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Michael Moseley , was actually testing an Israeli - developed imaging and targeting pod called LITENING II on a U.S. Navy contracted merchant vessel , the USNS Bobo , in the Atlantic east of Bermuda and several targets of opportunity along the planes ' flight paths through the southern United States .
REX REDUX also involved assets of the Air Force 's embryonic Cyber Command in Washington and Barksdale .
Four days later , on August 30 , a Barksdale - based B - 52 flew six nuclear warhead tipped AGM - 129 advanced cruise missiles from Minot to Barksdale .
The incident was later called a " mistake " by Air Force officials .
However , three high - ranking Air Force officers leaked the incident to the Air Force Times .
Air Force Secretary Michael Wynne , a key member of the rival chain - of - command , rewarded his loyalists in Barksdale by announcing the base had been selected as the preliminary headquarters for the Air Force Cyber Command .
Wynne made his announcement at a Shreveport gambling casino .
Wynne , according to a CNN report , advocated the testing of nonlethal weapons , like high - power microwave weapons , against American citizens .
Wynne said , " If we 're not willing to use it here against our fellow citizens , then we should not be willing to use it in a wartime situation . "
Minot Air Force
Base may also get a piece of the cyber - warfare pie .
Attempts by this editor to interest North Dakota Democratic Senator Byron Dorgan in the August 30 nuclear incident were unsuccessful .
Dorgan is obviously angling , along with Democratic Senator Kent Conrad , to get a chunk of the cyber - war command pie for Minot .
Far from being a mistake , the procurement of the nuclear missiles from Minot was tied to a rival chain - of - command operation that would occur on September 6 , when the Israeli Air Force struck a purported Syrian nuclear facility in eastern Syria , near the town of Dayr az Zawr .
On April 24 , 2008 , as news broke of an FBI investigation into a long - time Israeli intelligence ring that penetrated the U.S. military and intelligence communities , CIA director , Air Force General Michael Hayden , revealed further " intelligence " on the Syrian facility , said to be a joint North Korean - Syrian reactor modeled after the Yongbyon facility in North Korea .
However , the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) and American weapons experts cast doubt on the veracity of the CIA 's intelligence , including a dubious videotape said to have originated with Israeli intelligence sources .
Hayden , it appears , is part of the rival Air Force chain - of - command , taking orders directly from Cheney , to prepare and incite a U.S. military conflict with Syria and Iran .
The FBI investigation of the Israeli spy ring , which included convicted US Navy spy Jonathan Pollard ; accused Army spy Ben - Ami Kadish ; and possibly others who served in high positions in the George W. Bush administration is also reportedly looking at key members of the rival Air Force chain - of - command .
It is noteworthy that Air Force Cyber - Warfare guru Dr. Lani Kass , who had recently been an Israeli Air Force Major , first came to the United States as a defense contractor in 1981 , the halcyon period of the Israeli spy ring inside the Pentagon and Reagan administration .
Reagan National Security Council Middle East expert Douglas Feith was fired from his job after he was suspected of passing classified information to an Israeli embassy contact .
Feith was re-hired at the Pentagon by his old friend Richard Perle .
Kass now serves as the Air Force 's chief cyber - warfare guru and she also specializes in information operations deception .
Along with Air Force General Lawrence Stuztriem , Kass is involved in Operation Checkmate , operational planning for a U.S. military attack on Iran .
Two days after the Israeli spy story involving Kadish broke , the Pentagon - chartered cargo ship , SS Westward Venture , fired machine guns at approaching Iranian patrol vessels .
After the Minot nuclear incident , the Air Force 's Air Combat Command at Langley Air Force Base , Virginia ordered a stand down of all fighters and bombers in the Air Force .
Although the order was issued on September 7 , the day after the Israeli strike on the " Al Kibar " site in Syria , the stand down did not occur until September 14 .
Gates ordered an outside review of the Minot incident conducted by retired former Air Force Chief of Staff General Larry Welch .
Welch was hardly an impartial judge , having been part of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld 's favorite program , the Ballistic Missile Defense System or " Star Wars II . "
Welch led a Blue Ribbon panel that heaped praise on the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization , then led by Air Force General Ronald Kadish .
The Welch Report failed to discover the breakdown in Air Force nuclear command - and - control and the existence of the rival chain .
An indication of the worthlessness of the Welch Report was the discovery that in August 2006 , four Minuteman nose cone nuclear fuse assemblies were " mistakenly " shipped from Hill Air Force Base in Utah to Taiwan .
The fuses had originally been shipped to Hill from F. E. Warren Air Force Base , Wyoming in March 2005 .
Gates reacted to the incident by ordering an unprecedented inventory of all nuclear weapons and nuclear material in the U.S. arsenal .
On April 21 , 2008 , Gates , speaking to young Air Force officers at the Air War College at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama , criticized the Air Force for refusing his orders to get more involved in wars in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Gates ' criticisms stunned the audience and reverberated throughout the Air Force .
Here was a Secretary of Defense indicating that a subordinate service was insubordinate .
Gates was likely hinting at the existence of the rival nuclear chain - of - command directed from Cheney 's office .
The rival nuclear chain - of - command that was responsible for the Minot nuclear incident , REX REDUX , and associated events is as follows :
Vice President Dick Cheney
-- Chief of Staff David Addington
Air Force Secretary Michael Wynne
Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Michael Moseley
-- Gen. Lawrence Stuztriem , Chief of Staff of the Air Force Strategic Studies Group - CHECKMATE
-- Dr. Lani Kass , ex-Israeli Air Force , Cyber Warfare , US Air Force , CHECKMATE
Lt. Gen. Robert Elder , Commander 8th Air Force , Barksdale Air Force Base
Col .
Bruce Emig , Commander 5th Bomb Wing , Minot Air Force Base ( relieved of command after nuclear incident )
Maj . Gen. Stephen Goldfein , Commander Air Warfare Center , Nellis Air Force Base
Goldfein 's role in the chain - of - command has been exposed as a result of a Department of Defense Inspector General audit that discovered that Goldfein and Moseley helped steer a $ 50 million public relations contract for the Air Force 's elite Thunderbirds flying team to Strategic Message Solutions ( SMS ) , a firm that had been established to bid on the Thunderbirds Air Show Production Services , or TAPS .
On September 2 , 2007 , as the impact of the Minot nuclear incident was still being felt in Minot and around the Air Force , a scheduled Thunderbirds air show to help celebrate " Northern Neighbors Day " was proclaimed to be still on schedule for September 8 .
A week after the worst nuclear security command - and - control debacle in the nation 's history , Minot Air Force Base opened its gates for the public to come on to the base and watch the Thunderbirds perform .
There was even a traffic jam of civilian cars , including some from nearby Canada , waiting to drive on to the base .
Meanwhile , lower and mid- ranking Air Force nuclear security personnel were being stripped of their personnel reliability program clearances for access to nuclear weapons on the base .
The contrast could not have been more stark .
It was clear that carrying on with the scheduled Thunderbirds show at Minot was part of a public relations spin being directed from Moseley and his staff .

When you consider that we cannot control nor guaranty the security of our own nukes due to foreign agents in government and a ' rival command ' then what the hell are we doing trying to control other countries ?
The ONLY way those nukes could have moved was with orders from up top - Bush / Cheney yet it was the men on the front lines who were punished EXACTLY like the Abu Ghraib / torture fiasco that these guys ordered then masterbated while watching the videos .
Seven airmen also died ' mysteriously ' within 2 weeks of this ' accident ' .
There is more than enough evidence to try and convict these criminal leaders yet they get to remain in power .
As we are told constantly about spying on Americans ' why worry if you have nothing to hide ? ' why do these ' leaders ' not only hide everything they do but retroactively classify anything they are afraid of ?
It can only be ONE THING - they are guilty as hell .
And CONgress is complicit for helping to cover up these atrocities for fear of losing their power / positions .
Finally the fake ' terror wars ' that are simply cold war redux to continue the massive flow of tax dollars into the mil - industrial complex must be exposed for what they are - fear and intimidation tactics .
' Terrorism ' used to be directed against governments and their leaders .
Now it is directed at the populations as a means of control .
After all how many politicians have died since the start of the fake ' terror wars ' ?
Additionally border security has NOT been improved but left open .
Just about every ' terrorist ' arrest has been proven to be utterly totally false and staged for political purposes .
The cons in CONgress have made over 140 million in war based stocks for themselves , Cheney 's ' Halliburton ' was selling nuke parts to Iran as late as 2005 , Israel is buying IRANIAN oil via Europe - like that ' washes it ' yet they want us to put up a blockade .
Cheney is also up to his eyeballs in the USA CORP bankruptcy and BASEL 2 bank standards initiation and the disposition of quite literally TRILLIONS of dollars which were ' off book ' and everyone is desperately fighting for his / her piece of the pie while ignoring the current financial nightmare that threatens total collapse .
NO MEDIA is reporting on this which should be front page news .
I dream of a military coup in which allof CONgress , Pres and VP are arrested , indicted and tried as the evidence will allow - alos including any / all appointed criminals and dual nationals within government for treason / espoinage and elections held with accurate verifiable counts publicly done so there can be NO DOUBT .
When the pentagram can lose 2.7 trillion dollars and conveniently experience a ' new pearl harbor ' that allow massive amounts of money to pour in which they still cannot to this day account for ( latest is 15 Billion and something like 975 failure in contract adherence ) then it is time to string up the criminals in a very public way .
I am quite surprised that Karl Rove can walk the streets without being killed .
One can only hope and pray .

The Economics of Happiness , Part 1 : Reassessing the Easterlin Paradox
Justin Wolfers and Betsey Stevenson discussed their happiness research on CNBC today .
Arguably the most important finding from the emerging economics of happiness has been the Easterlin Paradox .
What is this paradox ?
It is the juxtaposition of three observations :
1 ) Within a society , rich people tend to be much happier than poor people .
2 ) But , rich societies tend not to be happier than poor societies ( or not by much ) .
3 ) As countries get richer , they do not get happier .
Easterlin offered an appealing resolution to his paradox , arguing that only relative income matters to happiness .
Other explanations suggest a “ hedonic treadmill , ” in which we must keep consuming more just to stay at the same level of happiness .
Either way , the policy implications of the Paradox are huge , as they suggest that economic growth may not raise well - being by much .
Given the stakes in this debate , Betsey Stevenson and I thought it worth reassessing the evidence .
We have re-analyzed all of the relevant post - war data , and also analyzed the particularly interesting new data from the Gallup World Poll .
Last Thursday we presented our research at the latest Brookings Panel on Economic Activity , and we have arrived at a rather surprising conclusion :
There is no Easterlin Paradox .
The facts about income and happiness turn out to be much simpler than first realized :
1 ) Rich people are happier than poor people .
2 ) Richer countries are happier than poorer countries .
3 ) As countries get richer , they tend to get happier .
Moreover , each of these facts seems to suggest a roughly similar relationship between income and happiness .
What explains these new findings ?
The key turns out to be an accumulation of data over recent decades .
Thirty years ago it was difficult to make convincing international comparisons because there were few datasets comparing rich and poor countries .
Instead , researchers were forced to make comparisons based on a handful of moderately - rich and very - rich countries .
These data just did n’t lend themselves to strong conclusions .
Moreover , repeated happiness surveys around the world have allowed us to observe the evolution of G.D.P. and happiness through time — both over a longer period , and for more countries .
On balance , G.D.P. and happiness have tended to move together .
There is a second issue here that has led to mistaken inferences : a tendency to confuse absence of evidence for a proposition as evidence of its absence .
Thus , when early researchers could not isolate a statistically reliable association between G.D.P. and happiness , they inferred that this meant the two were unrelated , and a paradox was born .
Our complete analysis is available here .
An excellent summary is available in today ’s New York Times , here , with a very cool graphic , and readers ’ comments .
Other commentary is available in the F.T. ( here and here ) , and Time Magazine .
Given the broad interest in this topic , I thought that I would spend the next couple of days blogging about our new findings on the links between income and happiness .
Tomorrow , I ’ll describe comparisons of rich countries and poor countries .
I ’ll follow that up with separate posts describing comparisons of rich and poor people , and then assessing how happiness changes as countries get richer or poorer .
Objective -C
This tutorial is written and illustrated by
Objective - C is the primary language used to write Mac software .
If you 're comfortable with basic object - oriented concepts and the C language , Objective - C will make a lot of sense .
If you do n't know C , you should read the C Tutorial first .
This tutorial is written and illustrated by Scott Stevenson Copyright © 2008 Scott Stevenson
1 Calling Methods
To get started as quickly as possible , let 's look at some simple examples .
The basic syntax for calling a method on an object is this : [ object method ] ; [ object methodWithInput:input ] ; Methods can return a value : output = [ object methodWithOutput ] ; output = [ object methodWithInputAndOutput:input ] ;
You can call methods on classes too , which is how you create objects .
In the example below , we call the string method on the NSString class , which returns a new NSString object : id myObject = [ NSString string ] ;
The id type means that the myObject variable can refer to any kind of object , so the actual class and the methods it implements are n't known when you compile the app .
In this example , it 's obvious the object type will be an NSString , so we can change the type : NSString * myString = [ NSString string ] ;
This is now an NSString variable , so the compiler will warn us if we try to use a method on this object which NSString does n't support .
Notice that there 's a asterisk to the right of the object type .
All Objective - C object variables are pointers types .
The id type is predefined as a pointer type , so there 's no need to add the asterisk .
Nested Messages
In many languages , nested method or function calls look like this : function1 ( function2 ( ) ) ;
The result of function2 is passed as input to function1 .
In Objective - C , nested messages look like this : [ NSString stringWithFormat : [ prefs format ] ] ;
Avoid nested nesting more than two message calls on a single line , as it easily gets unreadable .
Multi-Input Methods
Some methods take multiple input values .
In Objective - C , a method name can be split up into several segments .
In the header , a multi-input method looks like this : -( BOOL ) writeToFile :( NSString *) path atomically : ( BOOL ) useAuxiliary File ;
You call the method like this : BOOL result = [ myData writeToFile:@" /tmp/log.txt " atomically : NO ] ;
These are not just named arguments .
The method name is actually writeToFile : atomically : in the runtime system .
2 Accessors All instance variables are private in Objective - C by default , so you should use accessors to get and set values in most cases .
There are two syntaxes .
This is the traditional 1.x syntax : [ photo setCaption : @" Day at the Beach " ] ; output = [ photo caption ] ;
The code on the second line is not reading the instance variable directly .
It 's actually calling a method named caption .
In most cases , you do n't add the " get " prefix to getters in Objective -C .
Whenever you see code inside square brackets , you are sending a message to an object or a class .
Dot Syntax
The dot syntax for getters and setters is new in Objective - C 2.0 , which is part of Mac OS X 10.5 : photo.caption = @ " Day at the Beach " ; output = photo.caption ;
You can use either style , but choose only one for each project .
The dot syntax should only be used setters and getters , not for general purpose methods .
3 Creating Objects
There are two main ways to create an object .
The first is the one you saw before : NSString * myString = [ NSString string ] ;
This is the more convenient automatic style .
In this case , you are creating an autoreleased object , which we 'll look at in more detail later .
In many cases , though , you need to create an object using the manual style : NSString * myString = [ [ NSString alloc ] init ] ;
This is a nested method call .
The first is the alloc method called on NSString itself .
This is a relatively low - level call which reserves memory and instantiates an object .
The second piece is a call to init on the new object .
The init implementation usually does basic setup , such as creating instance variables .
The details of that are unknown to you as a client of the class .
In some cases , you may use a different version of init which takes input : NSNumber * value = [ [ NSNumber alloc ] initWithFloat : 1.0 ] ;
4 Basic Memory Management
If you 're writing an application for Mac OS X , you have the option to enable garbage collection .
In general , this means that you do n't have to think about memory management until you get to more complex cases .
However , you may not always be working with an environment that supports garbage collection .
In that case , you need to know a few basic concepts .
If you create an object using the manual alloc style , you need to release the object later .
You should not manually release an autoreleased object because your application will crash if you do .
Here are two examples : // string1 will be released automatically NSString * string1 = [ NSString string ] ; // must release this when done NSString * string2 = [ [ NSString alloc ] init ] ; [ string2 release ] ;
For this tutorial , you can assume that an automatic object will go away at the end of the current function .
There 's more to learn about memory management , but it will make more sense after we look at a few more concepts .
5 Designing a Class Interface The Objective - C syntax for creating a class is very simple .
It typically comes in two parts .
The class interface is usually stored in the ClassName.h file , and defines instance variables and public methods .
The implementation is in the ClassName .m file and contains the actual code for these methods .
It also often defines private methods that are n't available to clients of the class .
Here 's what an interface file looks like .
The class is called Photo , so the file is named Photo.h : #import < Cocoa / Cocoa.h > @interface Photo : NSObject { NSString * caption ; NSString * photographer ; } @end First , we import Cocoa.h , to pull in all of the basic classes for a Cocoa app .
The #import directive automatically guards against including a single file multiple times .
The @interface says that this is a declaration of the class Photo .
The colon specifies the superclass , which is NSObject .
Inside the curly brackets , there are two instance variables : caption and photographer .
Both are NSStrings , but they could be any object type , including id .
Finally , the @end symbol ends the class declaration .
Add Methods
Let 's add some getters for the instance variables : #import < Cocoa / Cocoa.h > @interface Photo : NSObject { NSString * caption ; NSString * photographer ; } - caption ; - photographer ; @end Remember , Objective - C methods typically leave out the " get " prefix .
A single dash before a method name means it 's a instance method .
A plus before a method name means it 's a class method .
By default , the compiler assumes a method returns an id object , and that all input values are id .
The above code is technically correct , but it 's unusual .
Let 's add specific types for the return values : #import < Cocoa / Cocoa.h > @interface Photo : NSObject { NSString * caption ; NSString * photographer ; } - ( NSString * ) caption ; - ( NSString * ) photographer ; @end Now let 's add setters : #import < Cocoa / Cocoa.h > @interface Photo : NSObject { NSString * caption ; NSString * photographer ; } - ( NSString * ) caption ; - ( NSString * ) photographer ; - ( void ) setCaption : ( NSString * ) input ; - ( void ) setPhotographer : ( NSString * ) input ; @end Setters do n't need to return a value , so we just specify them as void .
6 Class Implementation
Let 's create an implementation , starting with the getters : #import " Photo.h " @implementation Photo - ( NSString * ) caption { return caption ; } - ( NSString * ) photographer { return photographer ; } @end
This part of the code starts with @implementation and the class name , and has @end , just like the interface .
All methods must appear between these two statements .
The getters should look very familiar if you 've ever written code , so let 's move on to the setters , which need a bit more explanation : - ( void ) setCaption : ( NSString * ) input { [ caption autorelease ] ; caption = [ input retain ] ; } - ( void ) setPhotographer : ( NSString * ) input { [ photographer autorelease ] ; photographer = [ input retain ] ; } Each setter deals with two variables .
The first is a reference to the existing object , and the second is the new input object .
In a garbage collected environment , we could just set the new value directly : - ( void ) setCaption : ( NSString * ) input { caption = input ; } But if you can't use garbage collection , you need to release the old object , and retain the new one .
There are actually two ways to free a reference to an object : release and autorelease .
The standard release will remove the reference immediately .
The autorelease method will release it sometime soon , but it will definitely stay around until the end of the current function ( unless you add custom code to specifically change this ) .
The autorelease method is safer inside a setter because the variables for the new and old values could point to the same object .
You would n't want to immediately release an object which you 're about to retain .
This may seem confusing right now , but it will make more sense as you progress .
You do n't need to understand it all yet .
Init
We can create an init method to set inital values for our instance variables : - ( id ) init { if ( self = [ super init ] ) { [ self setCaption : @" Default Caption " ] ; [ self setPhotographer : @" Default Photographer " ] ; } return self ; }
This is fairly self - explanatory , though the second line may look a bit unusual .
This is a single equals sign , which assigns the result of [ super init ] to self .
This essentially just asks the superclass to do its own initialization .
The if statement is verifying that the initialization was successful before trying to set default values .
Dealloc
The dealloc method is called on an object when it is being removed from memory .
This is usually the best time to release references to all of your child instance variables : - ( void ) dealloc { [ caption release ] ; [ photographer release ] ; [ super dealloc ] ; }
On the first two lines , we just send release to each of the instance variables .
We do n't need to use autorelease here , and the standard release is a bit faster .
The last line is very important .
We have to send the message
[ super dealloc ] to ask the superclass to do its cleanup .
If we do n't do this , the object will not be removed , which is a memory leak .
The dealloc method is not called on objects if garbage collection is enabled .
Instead , you implement the finalize method .
7 More on Memory Management Objective - C's memory management system is called reference counting .
All you have to do is keep track of your references , and the runtime does the actual freeing of memory .
In simplest terms , you alloc an object , maybe retain it at some point , then send one release for each alloc / retain you sent .
So if you used alloc once and then retain once , you need to release twice .
That 's the theory of reference counting .
But in practice , there are usually only two reasons to create an object :
1 . To keep it as an instance variable
2 . To use temporarily for single use inside a function
In most cases , the setter for an instance variable should just autorelease the old object , and retain the new one .
You then just make sure to release it in dealloc as well .
So the only real work is managing local references inside a function .
And there 's only one rule : if you create an object with alloc or copy , send it a release or autorelease message at the end of the function .
If you create an object any other way , do nothing .
Here 's the first case , managing an instance variable : - ( void ) setTotalAmount : ( NSNumber * ) input { [ totalAmount autorelease ] ; totalAmount = [ input retain ] ; } - ( void ) dealloc { [ totalAmount release ] ; [ super dealloc ] ; } Here 's the other case , local references .
We only need to release the object created with alloc : NSNumber * value1 = [ [ NSNumber alloc ] initWithFloat : 8.75 ] ; NSNumber * value2 = [ NSNumber numberWithFloat : 14.78 ] ; // only release value1 , not value2 [ value1 release ] ;
And here 's a combo : using a local reference to set an object as an instance variable : NSNumber * value1 = [ [ NSNumber alloc ] initWithFloat : 8.75 ] ; [ self setTotal : value1 ] ; NSNumber * value2 = [ NSNumber numberWithFloat : 14.78 ] ; [ self setTotal : value2 ] ; [ value1 release ] ;
Notice how the rules for managing local references are exactly the same , regardless of whether you 're setting them as instance variables or not .
You do n't need to think about how the setters are implemented .
If you understand this , you understand 90 % of what you will ever need to know about Objective - C memory management .
8 Logging Logging messages to the console in Objective - C is very simple .
In fact , the NSLog ( ) function is nearly identical to the C printf ( ) function , except there 's an additional %@ token for objects .
NSLog ( @" The current date and time is : %@ " , [ NSDate date ] ) ;
You can log an object to the console .
The NSLog function calls the description method on the object , and prints the NSString which is returned .
You can override the description method in your class to return a custom string .
9 Properties
When we wrote the accessor methods for caption and author earlier , you might have noticed that the code is straightforward , and could probably be generalized .
Properties are a feature in Objective - C that allow us to automatically generate accessors , and also have some other side benefits .
Let 's convert the Photo class to use properties .
Here 's what it looked like before : #import < Cocoa / Cocoa.h > @interface Photo : NSObject { NSString * caption ; NSString * photographer ; } - ( NSString * ) caption ; - ( NSString * ) photographer ; - ( void ) setCaption : ( NSString * ) input ; - ( void ) setPhotographer : ( NSString * ) input ; @end Here 's what it looks like once converted to properties : #import < Cocoa / Cocoa.h > @interface Photo : NSObject { NSString * caption ; NSString * photographer ; } @property ( retain ) NSString * caption ; @property ( retain ) NSString * photographer ; @end The @property is an Objective - C directive which declares the property .
The " retain " in the parenthesis specifies that the setter should retain the input value , and the rest of the line simply specifies the type and the name of the property .
Now let 's take a look at the implementation of the class : #import " Photo.h " @implementation Photo @synthesize caption ; @synthesize photographer ; - ( void ) dealloc { [ caption release ] ; [ photographer release ] ; [ super dealloc ] ; } @end
The @synthesize directive automatically generates the setters and getters for us , so all we have to implement for this class is the dealloc method .
Accessors will only be generated if they do n't already exist , so feel free to specify @synthesize for a property , then implement your custom getter or setter if you want .
The compiler will fill in whichever method is missing .
There are many other options for the property declarations , but those are outside of the scope of this tutorial .
10 Calling Methods on Nil In Objective - C , the nil object is the functional equivalent to the NULL pointer in many other languages .
The difference is that you can call methods on nil without crashing or throwing an exception .
This technique used by the frameworks in a number of different ways , but the main thing it means to you right now that you usually do n't need to check for nil before calling a method on an object .
If you call a method on nil that returns an object , you will get nil as a return value .
We can also use this to improve our dealloc method slightly : - ( void ) dealloc { self .
caption = nil ; self .
photographer = nil ; [ super dealloc ] ; }
This works because when we set nil as an instance variable , the setter just retains nil ( which does nothing ) and releases the old value .
This approach is often better for dealloc because there 's no chance of the variable pointing at random data where an object used to be .
Note that we 're using the self .
< var > syntax here , which means we 're using the setter and picking up the memory management for free .
If we just directly set the value like this , there would be a memory leak : // incorrect .
causes a memory leak .
// use self .caption to go through setter caption = nil ;
11 Categories Categories are one of the most useful features of Objective - C. Essentially , a category allows you to add methods to an existing class without subclassing it or needing to know any of the details of how it 's implemented .
This is particularly useful because you can add methods to built - in objects .
If you want to add a method to all instances of NSString in your application , you just add a category .
There 's no need to get everything to use a custom subclass .
For example , if I wanted to add a method to NSString to determine if the contents is a URL , it would look like this : #import < Cocoa / Cocoa.h > @interface NSString ( Utilities ) - ( BOOL ) isURL ; @end
This is very similar to a class declaration .
The differences are that there is no super class listed , and there 's a name for the category in parenthesis .
The name can be whatever you want , though it should communicate what the methods inside do .
Here 's the implementation .
Keep in mind this is not a good implementation of URL detection .
We 're just trying to get the concept of categories across : #import " NSString - Utilities .h " @implementation NSString ( Utilities ) - ( BOOL ) isURL { if ( [ self has Prefix : @ " http : / / " ] ) return YES ; else return NO ; } @end Now you can use this method on any NSString .
The following code will print " string1 is a URL " in the console : NSString * string1 = @ " http://pixar.com/ " ; NSString * string2 = @ " Pixar " ; if ( [ string1 isURL ] ) NSLog ( @" string1 is a URL " ) ; if ( [ string2 isURL ] ) NSLog ( @" string2 is a URL " ) ;
Unlike subclasses , categories can't add instance variables .
You can , however , use categories to override existing methods in classes , but you should do so very carefully .
Remember , when you make changes to a class using a category , it affects all instances of that class throughout the application .
WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
The Democratic National Committee , now operating under Barack Obama 's fundraising rules , on Friday returned about $ 100,000 in money from lobbyists and political action committees .
The donations were already " in the pipeline " when Obama , the presumed Democratic presidential nominee , instituted the standards for the committee , a party official said .
FUNDRAISING CHANGES : DNC will refuse money from lobbyists , PACs Obama imposed the rules to avoid a conflict with his own ban on money from federal lobbyists and PACs , interest groups that are not obligated to abide by many campaign spending restrictions .
On Thursday he sent one of his top strategists to the DNC to help with its general election operation .
Republican John McCain does accept money from lobbyists and PACs as does the Republican National Committee and other party committees .
Obama 's ban does not apply to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee nor to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee .
Obama does accept money from lobbyists who do not do business with the federal government and he also accepts money from spouses and family members of lobbyists .
And the DNC ban is also not retroactive , which means the DNC will keep lobbyist and PAC contributions it received earlier in the election cycle .
INDEPENDENCE QUESTIONED : Obama tied to lobbyists , but boasts of not taking money According to its latest report with the Federal Election Commission , the DNC had raised $ 2 million from PACs in the past 16 months .
And according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics , the DNC raised a mere $ 53,360 from executives or associates in lobbying firms so far this election cycle .
That total , however , includes employees of lobbying firms who are not registered lobbyists .
The DNC has lagged behind the RNC in fundraising .
On Thursday , the McCain campaign announced it had raised $ 21.5 million in May and the RNC said it had collected nearly $ 24 million .
The DNC raised almost $ 5 million during the month .
The Obama camp , which has been raising at a clip of $ 1 million a day or better , has not announced its May totals .
But the Republican money advantage was the subject of a fundraising e-mail from Obama campaign manager David Plouffe to its donors .
" We need to respond quickly and show that we are ready to take on Senator McCain in the general election , " Plouffe wrote .
" We are going to compete in the general election the same way we have all along_by depending on a movement of more than 1.5 million people giving only what they can afford . "

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Alison DeLauzon thought the snapshots and home videos of her infant son were gone for good when she lost her digital camera while on vacation in Florida .
Then a funny thing happened : her camera “ phoned home . ”
Equipped with a special memory card with wireless Internet capability , DeLauzon ’s camera had not only automatically sent her holiday pictures to her computer , but had even uploaded photos of the miscreants who swiped her equipment bag after she accidentally left it behind at a restaurant .
“ I opened up the Eye - Fi manager on the computer and , lo and behold , there are the guys that stole our cameras , ” said DeLauzon , a native of New York ’s Long Island suburb .
“ Not only is it the guy who stole our camera ... but the guy took a picture of ( his accomplice ) holding our other camera . ”
DeLauzon received the Eye - Fi , a 2 - gigabyte SD memory card that fits into millions of digital cameras , as a holiday gift to go with her Canon camera .
Priced at about $ 100 , the card automatically uploads pictures to a home computer or online photosharing service as soon as the user is linked to a familiar wireless network .
Luckily , the culprits passed by an unsecured network , whose factory - installed setting matched that of DeLauzon ’s home system , and the Eye - Fi automatically shipped the photos : first baby pictures , then the snap - happy scoundrels .
Her experience reflects the rise of technology that empowers everyday gadgets to protect themselves or the priceless personal data -- from family phone numbers to business budgets -- that consumers keep on portable electronics devices .
MACS E-MAIL VIDEO TO VICTIMS
Cameras are perhaps the most common home - phoning gadget used to thwart criminals .
An eerie case occurred last month , when a Japanese man set up a hidden camera because food was disappearing from his kitchen .
While he was out , the camera sent pictures to his mobile phone of the intruder -- an unknown woman living secretly in his closet .
A few years ago , there was a well - publicized case of a Sidekick mobile phone that was first lost in a New York taxi , then found by a 16 - year - old who used it to take pictures and send instant messages .
But the device ’s mobile service provider automatically backed up such data on remote computers , allowing the owner ’s friend , Evan Guttman , to uncover a trail -- and launch an online shaming campaign against the 16 - year - old , who was eventually arrested .
While passive systems have helped reunite missing gadgets with their owners , more aggressive measures can be employed to protect everything from laptops to iPods and BlackBerrys .
GadgetTrak , of Beaverton , Oregon , sells software that can be loaded onto any of those devices .
If a BlackBerry , for example , falls into the wrong hands , the software grabs information from the new user ’s SIM data card and e-mails it to the rightful owner .
With an Apple Mac computer , the software instructs the built - in camera to take video of the thief and sends to the owner , along information about nearby wireless networks .
Some 20,000 GadgetTrack licenses have been purchased in about one year -- including 10,000 from storage company Seagate
.
“ The reason we have been so successful is that people are not expecting this kind of software to be installed , ” said Ken Westin , the company ’s founder .
“ No security solution is 100 percent -- there are always going to be work - arounds .
But your average thief is not going to be a computer expert . ”
DeLauzon did n’t want to press charges against the people who had her camera : Both were employees at the restaurant where she dined and accidentally left her photo equipment .
Sure , they were fired -- but getting justice was not as important to her as retrieving her memories of her baby boy .
“ When we finally got it back , my husband and I spent the night just sitting and watching the videos -- stupid videos , like him feeding himself for the first time or him pulling himself up in his crib for the first time .
We sat down one night and just relished it . ”

A New Way to Treat Obesity
Researchers believe that they might be able to combat obesity by blocking a nerve that helps regulate digestion .
An implantable device that uses electrical signals to block the vagus nerve , which helps regulate digestion , has shown early success in clinical trials .
The experimental therapy , developed by Enteromedics , a medical - device company based in St. Paul , MN , is part of a growing trend to develop alternatives to gastric bypass surgery , an often highly successful but invasive procedure to curb obesity .
" We need an approach to this that is safer than current alternatives and efficient to perform , " says Christopher Thompson , a surgeon at Brigham and Women 's Hospital who tests new surgical tools and methods .
As the obesity epidemic booms , so has the number of people undergoing gastric bypass surgery , a procedure in which the stomach is surgically reduced to about the size of a lemon .
The American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery estimates that gastric bypass rates have doubled in the United States in the past five years , from about 100,000 in 2003 to approximately 200,000 in 2007 .
While gastric bypass often leads to dramatic weight loss , only a small percentage of people eligible for the surgery -- those with a body mass index ( BMI ) of more than 35 - - actually choose to do it .
That may be because the procedure comes with some serious risks and is irreversible , requiring permanent dietary restrictions and nutritional supplements .
" Many people who really need the procedure do n't seek out medical attention because they 're worried about potential medical complications , " says Thompson .
" We 're only treating a small fraction of eligible patients . "
A new option is on the horizon .
At a neurotechnology conference in Boston last week , Enteromedics described positive preliminary results from a European trial of its vagal blocking therapy , called VBLOC .
The device uses an electrical stimulator to block signals from the vagus nerve , which connects the brain to the gastrointestinal organs , regulating hormones and other factors involved in satiety and hunger .
" It controls how the stomach expands when we start to eat , " says Mark Knudson , chief executive officer at Enteromedics .
" If it does n't expand , we become full after a few bites . "
In the procedure , two small electrodes are laparoscopically implanted next to vagal nerve fibers at the top of the stomach .
A regulator implanted under the skin sends high - frequency pulses of electricity to the electrodes , which are thought to block the signals coming from the vagus nerve .
While scientists do n't know exactly how it works , they theorize that the device blocks signals that would normally tell the stomach to expand to accept food , as well as trigger the release of digestive enzymes and gastric acid , potentially slowing digestion .
Many patients report feeling less hungry and feeling fuller earlier , says Knudson .
An analysis of nine patients who were among the first to receive the implant shows that they lost almost 30 percent of their excess body weight after nine months .
And preliminary data from a larger group indicates that following the procedure , patients ate an average of 500 fewer calories per day .
" That 's less than you 'd see for a lap band or a gastric bypass , but it 's still pretty good , " says Janey Pratt , a surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital , in Boston .
Violent protests in Tibet and a subsequent crackdown by the Beijing government have created a worldwide outpouring of sympathy for the Tibetan cause .
In India , where the Dalai Lama lives in exile , politicians , celebrities , and common citizens have sided with the underdogs .
But those who support the idea of an independent Tibet are misguided , and Indians who do so are hypocritical to boot .
Here 's why .
The land claimed by Tibet 's government - in - exile is far larger than the territory ruled by the Dalai Lama before he fled to India in 1959 .
Greater Tibet covers an incredible 25 percent of the entire People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) .
There is no legal or historical basis whatsoever for this claim .
Moreover , were such a nation to split from China , it would feel incomplete without Arunachal Pradesh , often referred to as Southern Tibet .
The case for an independent state composed of the smaller Tibet Autonomous Region is also questionable .
For centuries , theocratic rulers of the Roof of the World accepted the land was part of the Chinese empire .
This elite declared independence during a period of instability in the early twentieth century , but China never accepted it .
It 's true the fifties and sixties were dreadful for the region , but we must bear in mind that the Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution were disastrous for China as a whole .
Recent years have witnessed an increased tolerance of traditional culture by Chinese authorities , alongside a rise in Tibetans ' standard of living .
Thus far , the liberalisation has stopped short of negotiations with the Dalai Lama , which is unfortunate , for he is one of the great moral figures of our time and has signalled he would accept genuine autonomy instead of the complete independence he had previously sought .
Tibet 's best hope lies in the ruling party developing a respect for rights and freedoms throughout the PRC , and that 's what world leaders ought to try and influence .
However , that 's not the way most Indians appear to see the matter .
The former foreign minister Yashwant Sinha argued we should intervene to secure Tibet 's freedom : " We want good relations with China .
I am not saying let 's have war with China .
But if we reach a point of conflict over Tibet , we should be prepared for that eventuality . "
This is mind - bogglingly stupid .
Indian forces have less chance of driving the People 's Liberation Army from Lhasa than Harbhajan Singh has of scoring hundreds in each of his next fifty innings .
Sinha did n't stop there .
" We , along with the brave Tibetan activists , will not relent till we get justice from China " , he thundered .
" If need be , I am prepared to march to Lhasa in support of this movement . "
George Fernandes , former defence minister , also advocated Tibetan independence , repudiating the policy of his prime minister , Atal Behari Vajpayee .
The reason such sentiments are not just ill - informed but hypocritical is that we have our own secessionist movements to deal with , and there is no public or political pressure to resolve those .
The most prominent , the problem of Jammu and Kashmir is the elephant in the room which Indians debating Tibet are doing their darndest to ignore .
The two issues make for an interesting comparison .
No nation regards Tibet as disputed territory , while every country , India included , places J&K in that category .
( These days we are not allowed to refer to it as ���disputed ' , but the Simla Agreement as well as our commitment to the United Nations makes clear it is ) .
Though we accuse Pakistan of occupying a chunk of our turf , we do nothing about that , apart from marking every imported atlas with a stamp saying the borders of India as depicted are inaccurate .
If Pakistan brings up Kashmir at multilateral forums , we complain it is contravening the Simla Agreement .
But when it presses for bilateral talks , as recommended by that Agreement , we insist J&K is an internal matter .
We parrot the slogan about the valley being an integral part of India , in the face of the fact that all nation - states are provisional entities .
During times of terror , we insist violence must cease before talks can be held .
In periods of relative calm , we complacently conclude there 's no need to rock the houseboat .
But Kashmir exacts a toll even when it is not in the headlines .
There are hundreds of thousands of refugees displaced from their homes .
There 's the daily harassment of ordinary citizens fomenting resentment .
And there 's the expense of maintaining a massive security presence in the region .
The Siachen misadventure alone costs us some 1,500 crore rupees a year , and has led to the death of perhaps 2,000 Indian army men , most because of the climate and altitude .
Instead of paying lip service to the bravery of our soldiers , or using refugees to score political points , would it not be better to try to end the conflict , so troops can be drawn down and the displaced allowed to return ?
Pakistan , which in the past has played a largely negative role , favouring insurrection over negotiation , has altered its stance , and offered a number of creative options for the state 's future .
Our neighbour is looking beyond the binary of victory and defeat , and so should we .
It is n't within the scope of this article to outline the history of J&K and debate who has better claim to it .
What matters is that there 's a possibility of crafting a solution satisfying all sides .
A window of opportunity has opened , but wo n't stay open forever .
LAS VEGAS ( Reuters ) - Top U.S. phone companies are demanding more energy - efficient equipment from their suppliers , as the costs of maintaining networks and data centers rise due to surging Internet traffic and energy prices .
The chief technology officers of phone companies attending the NXTcomm conference in Las Vegas this week told Reuters they were looking for better power management from routers , switches and other network equipment supplied by companies like Cisco Systems Inc CSCO.O and Nortel Networks Corp NT.TO .
" We 've made it clear to them that we need breakthroughs in those areas , " said AT&T Inc T.N CTO John Donovan , estimating that Web traffic is growing 60 percent a year .
“ We ’re not going to go out and just buy features and capabilities without looking at the total cost of ownership and the environmental impacts , ” he said .
AT&T , the largest U.S. phone company , recently boosted the capacity of its backbone , or main Internet pipeline , to 40 Gigabits per second amid growing popularity for movie downloading , video streaming , Web - based voice and video calls , and mobile Web surfing .
Donovan said the company was already eyeing an upgrade to 100G and beyond , and studying the potential impact on power consumption .
“ When we sit down with the lab folks and say what happens at 400G , they come back and say , there ’s so much power consumption that everything melts , ” Donovan said .
“ We need to fundamentally rethink how routing is done on the Internet .
We have to fundamentally reshape it . ”
Verizon Communications Inc VZ.N , the second - largest U.S. phone service provider , has set a target to improve the efficiency of the equipment it procures by 20 percent starting January 2009 .
The target would apply to the two or three dozen suppliers of routers , switches , optical transporting equipment , and servers in its network data centers , Verizon said .
“ We have taken a leadership position , to put a stake in the ground with the number on it , ” Verizon CTO Mark Wegleitner said .
“ Most of this flew under the radar for decades .
But now it does n’t .
Pieter Poll , CTO of Qwest Communications International Inc Q.N , said he had not set a numerical target but was looking more closely than ever at what the industry calls the " total cost of ownership . "
He said he examines SWaP ( space , watts and performance ) metrics , often used to measure the efficiency of data centers .
This is calculated by dividing performance , or output , by space and power consumption , so an improvement would require a reduction in space or power , or an increase in performance .
“ We see , when we evaluate vendors A , B , C and D , what the environmentals look like , the cost of power , the cost of cooling , what the cost of ownership differential is , ” he said .
He and the other CTOs also said they were looking to eliminate toxic materials like lead from their networks .
TECH’S BIG FOOTPRINT
Equipment vendors are taking note .
For example , Cisco ’s Nexus 7000 switching product launched this year billed energy and space efficiency as key strengths .
By combining Ethernet switching and storage capabilities , and improving air flow , Cisco says the product helps large data centers use less power to run and cool equipment .
Nortel also highlighted energy efficiency in a recent advertising campaign , which boasts that its data networks outperform larger rival Cisco ’s kilowatt for kilowatt .
But it 's not all about rivalry .
Cisco , along with Verizon , Hewlett - Packard Co HPQ.N , Microsoft Corp MSFT.O , Sun Microsystems Inc JAVA.O and several others , jointly sponsored a study on the technology sector 's energy consumption .
The report by The Climate Group , an international nonprofit organization , shows the technology sector -- including personal computers and peripherals as well as telecom networks , devices and data centers -- accounted for around 2 percent of all emissions from human activity in 2007 .
While The Climate Group forecast the tech industry ’s emissions to grow in coming years , it also said that the sector could cut emissions by 15 percent by 2020 if it improved monitoring and accountability for energy consumption .
May 22 nd , Google China said that according the data around 2:28 pm on May 19 th , Google China 's traffic is nearly zero during the three minutes national mourning for the victims in the massive earthquake .
This shows almost all the Google users in China were in mourning at that time .
This was found by a Google engineer in China , who wrote an article on

「お問い合わせの件数が多くなっているため、お電話にお答えするまでに時間がかかっております」これは何という戯言だろう。このメッセージの本当の意味は、「われわれには顧客サービスに十分な費用をかけるつもりがないため、我慢できずに電話を切ってしまうまであなたを待ち行列で待たせるつもりだ」ということだ。私は最近、Verizonの待ち行列で45分待ったが、ついに順番は回ってこなかった。一方、T-Mobileは私の電話に20秒以下で応答した。私の取引先となり、信頼を勝ち得たのはどちらかはお分かりだろう。これは非常にばかげたことだ。新しい顧客を獲得するのにかかるコストは、電話オペレーターを何人か増やすコストを簡単に上回る。
「 電話対応をする人間は機械で置き換えることができる」
今日では、会社に電話をした際に実際の従業員に対応してもらうのは、ちょっとしたもてなしになっている。音声メールシステムは、本来そうであるべきほど賢くなく、それらの粗末なシステムが知らないところで売上げや顧客の信頼、そして善意を損なっている。私は受付係を配置するコストが、顧客の満足度の向上によって十分に埋め合わせられるという現実の証拠を多く見てきている。私のアドバイスはこうだ。他の会社に倣うのをやめて、顧客に彼らの思いを大切にしていることを示した方がいい。
「 わが社の経費の中で最大のものは人件費であり、従業員の給与を圧縮しなくてはならない」
多くの企業は、見当違いに経費の管理状況を改善しようとして、できるだけ給与の支払いを小さくしようとする。それらの多くの組織では従業員の退職率が高まり、新規雇用や新入社員の訓練により多くの経費を必要とするようになる。それに加え、このやり方では機会費用を定量化しにくい。これは、人員不足であったり、人材の訓練が不足していたりする企業では、提供するサービスの品質や配慮が不足した結果、収益や顧客を失ってしまうことが多いからだ。Circuit Cityはこのような形で費用を「管理」しようとしたことが、大きな原因の1つとなって倒産したが、その一方で他の小売業者は生き残っている。

Agenda 21 : Chapter 35 SCIENCE FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT - 35.1 .
This chapter focuses on the role and the use of the sciences in supporting the prudent management of the environment and development for the daily survival and future development of humanity .
The programme areas proposed herein are intended to be over - arching , in order to support the specific scientific requirements identified in the other Agenda 21 chapters .
One role of the sciences should be to provide information to better enable formulation and selection of environment and development policies in the decision - making process .
In order to fulfill this requirement , it will be essential to enhance scientific understanding , improve long - term scientific assessments , strengthen scientific capacities in all countries and ensure that the sciences are responsive to emerging needs .
35.2 .
Scientists are improving their understanding in areas such as climatic change , growth in rates of resource consumption , demographic trends , and environmental degradation .
Changes in those and other areas need to be taken into account in working out long - term strategies for development .
A first step towards improving the scientific basis for these strategies is a better understanding of land , oceans , atmosphere and their interlocking water , nutrient and biogeochemical cycles and energy flows which all form part of the Earth system .
This is essential if a more accurate estimate is to be provided of the carrying capacity of the planet Earth and of its resilience under the many stresses placed upon it by human activities .
The sciences can provide this understanding through increased research into the underlying ecological processes and through the application of modern , effective and efficient tools that are now available , such as remote - sensing devices , robotic monitoring instruments and computing and modelling capabilities .
The sciences are playing an important role in linking the fundamental significance of the Earth system as life support to appropriate strategies for development which build on its continued functioning .
The sciences should continue to play an increasing role in providing for an improvement in the efficiency of resource utilization and in finding new development practices , resources , and alternatives .
There is a need for the sciences constantly to reassess and promote less intensive trends in resource utilization , including less intensive utilization of energy in industry , agriculture , and transportation .
Thus , the sciences are increasingly being understood as an essential component in the search for feasible pathways towards sustainable development .
35.3 . Scientific knowledge should be applied to articulate and support the goals of sustainable development , through scientific assessments of current conditions and future prospects for the Earth system .
Such assessments , based on existing and emerging innovations within the sciences , should be used in the decision - making process and in the interactive processes between the sciences and policy - making .
There needs to be an increased output from the sciences in order to enhance understanding and facilitate interaction between science and society .
An increase in the scientific capacity and capability to achieve these goals will also be required , particularly in developing countries .
Of crucial importance is the need for scientists in developing countries to participate fully in international scientific research programmes dealing with the global problems of environment and development so as to allow all countries to participate on equal footing in negotiations on global environmental and developmental issues .
In the face of threats of irreversible environmental damage , lack of full scientific understanding should not be an excuse for postponing actions which are justified in their own right .
The precautionary approach could provide a basis for policies relating to complex systems that are not yet fully understood and whose consequences of disturbances cannot yet be predicted .
It 's lean and mean , but is it green ?
EU plans clampdown on car ads
It 's a staple of the glossy magazine : the eye - catching spread selling the latest Chelsea tractor or high - performance German road machine .
But the luxury car advert looks likely to become much less attractive under green advertising rules being drafted by the EU .
As a packet of cigarettes carries a mandatory health warning , a Mercedes C- class advert may be forced to carry a climate hazard alert within months .
Manufacturers would be forced to stop supplying pollution information in barely readable small print at the bottom of ads .
The European commission is believed to be considering a " traffic lights " system whereby red dots or stars would mark out high - emission cars , and green ones low - pollution ones .
An alternative may be an alphabetical system of A - G grades for pollution levels .
As a result , magazine publishers , advertising executives , TV bosses and car manufacturers are to protest today when they meet senior commission officials .
" The massed ranks of the media are up in arms , " said Angela Mills Wade , executive director of the European Publishers Council .
The new rules would force advertisers to leaven their creativity by including information on fuel consumption and CO2 emissions in their sales pitches .
" This will not achieve the goal , " said David Mahon of the European Federation of Magazine Publishers , whose members will be hit hardest by the proposals .
Chris Davies , a Lib Dem MEP , dismissed the protests as " nonsense " , likening them to those of the tobacco barons 20 years ago .
" The objective is to encourage a shift in consumer behaviour , " he said .
" They 're more interested in looks and appearance , speed and power , the sexy image .
If the aim is to reduce emissions , you need to change that behaviour .
Through its advertising , the car industry shapes market demand . "
Davies , who wrote a report on the issue adopted by the parliament last October , is calling for environmental data to take up 20 % of the ad space .
But the ad agencies argue their work has a minimal role in persuading people to buy a new car , raising the question of why car companies take up so much space in magazines .
The commission inaugurated a two - month period of consultations on the issue this week before unveiling its proposals .
But it is clear that regulators are to toughen the terms for trying to sell cars .
" The labelling directive in force is not working as well as it could and needs to be amended , " the commission said .
" [ We are ] ... committed to reducing CO2 emissions from cars [ and ensuring ] that consumers have sufficient information to choose fuel - efficient and low - emitting cars . "
With cars currently emitting some 12 % of total CO2 across Europe , the drive to cut road vehicle pollution is an integral part of the broader campaign to put Europe at the forefront of the global fight against climate change .
But despite the ambitious aims , the EU 's 27 governments are locked in battle over how to share out the load of reaching the greenhouse gas targets .
Environment ministers from the member countries meet today to argue over the problem .
On cars the aim is to limit CO2 emissions from new cars to 120g a kilometre by 2012 .
But governments cannot agree on the basis for calculating the emissions , how to deal with offenders or whether and what level of fines to levy .
Germany , home to BMW , Porsche and Mercedes , is pleading for special treatment .
While Davies and others in the European parliament want to extend the advertising rules to TV , radio and the internet , without quite knowing how to , it appears the new regime will initially be restricted to the print media .
Mahon argues this could be ruinous for the publishing industry , since car companies supply about 10 % of ad revenue and are threatening to halt magazine advertising if forced to make loud statements about pollution .
The UK is also drawing up new rules on advertising .
Department of Transport officials are considering new guidelines for manufacturers that would require the amount of greenhouse gas produced by a car to feature alongside branding and marketing slogans .
The biggest change would be to roadside billboards and print adverts , very few of which currently mention a vehicle 's carbon footprint .
Campaigners say such a change would close a loophole which allows the CO2 figures to be omitted from " primarily graphical " information .
The Department for Transport said : " There are already rules governing including CO2 emissions information in car adverts , for example on prominence .
The department will [ be ] reviewing whether to extend our guidance to cover outdoor media like billboards . "
Sian Berry , of the Alliance Against Urban 4x4s , said the car industry had " gleefully exploited loopholes to leave CO2 information out of as many adverts as they can " .
A survey by Friends of the Earth last year showed that more than half the car adverts in national newspapers were for the biggest polluters , which emit more than 165g of CO2 per km .
" It can be a bit of a struggle for consumers to find out about the carbon emissions of a car they 're thinking of buying , " said Berry .
" The right place for that information is in the showroom and not on the billboards or in the papers , " said Mahon .
" The fear is that there will be a reduction in the overall amount of media advertising , " said Mills Wade .

The return of real men : Ladies , get ready to meet Mr Retrosexual
Once , men were simply men .
But then feminists decided they were chauvinist pigs who did n't spend enough time doing the dishes .
So along came the guilt - ridden New Man , swiftly followed by sensitive , moisturising Metrosexual Man .
Of course , women soon missed the whiff of testosterone and were calling for the return of Real Men .
Now a new book , The Retrosexual Manual : How To Be A Real Man , has been published .
David Thomas tip - toes through the unashamedly macho details .
. .
Gone is the metrosexual man , now women have been demanding the return of the real men , like Indiana Jones
Men have to have strong arms for opening things such as bottles , just like Popeye
Who is he ?
Remember , you have a number of qualities , almost all deriving from your testosterone , which women can't help but admire .
For example :
1 . Your mind is uncluttered .
Consider the female brain , filled as it is with multiple anxieties about its owner 's hair , figure , health , diet , clothes , shoes , emotions , digestive transit , sex life , competitive female friendships , multi-tasking duties as a worker / lover / wife / mother / whatever .
Instead , your mind is focused on the important things in life : sex , beer , football .
Women secretly envy a mind like that .
2 . You can make decisions on your own .
You do n't need to talk it over for hours with all your friends , or consult a horoscope , or worry about feng shui .
3 . You have strong arms which come in handy whenever bottles need opening , cases need carrying , or a girl just feels like gazing at a strong , muscular limb .
4 . You do not clutter up the bathroom .
No woman wants a man who owns more beauty products than she does .
A man who showers , shaves , then gets out of the way is ideal .
How to treat a lady
1 . When on a date , you pay - even if she offers .
Do n't stand for any nonsense about going Dutch .
And pay in cash - retrosexuals do n't use credit cards .
2 . You open doors for women , and you stand for pregnant women on a bus , train or Tube .
You do this because you are a man , and you 're proud of it .
3 . You do not cook anything more sophisticated than Pot Noodles or baked beans .
Cooking is her job .
But when you have a Sunday roast - and you do , obviously - you carve with manly precision and flair .
4. Women like to talk , bless them .
So do n't try to stop her getting her feelings off her chest , however daft they might be .
There 's no need to actually listen , however .
Nor does she expect , or even want you to express an opinion of your own .
A nod of the head , roughly every 90 seconds , combined with a concerned frown , or a cheery laugh , where appropriate , is perfectly sufficient .
Sex and the City : But real men should avoid it like the plague
5 . Of course , you want to have sex .
Afterwards , however , it is important to avoid saying ' I love you ' or ' I 'm sorry , that 's never happened before ' .
6 . She may be interested in commitment .
You are not .
It is vitally important that you never even acknowledge the possibility that you are in a relationship .
The moment she uses a sentence that includes words such as ' wedding ' , ' children ' , or ' meet my parents ' , make your excuses and leave .
7 . No woman ever comes between you and live TV football .
Only a very special woman will come between you and the edited highlights on Match Of The Day .
8 . There is no woman on Earth for whom you will go to see Sex And The City - The Movie .
Travel
A man without a car is like a dog without a collar .
Since retrosexual men do n't believe in global warming ( apart from the notion that hotter weather = women wearing fewer clothes ) , they steer a fine line between cars that are weedy , girly excuses for a motor and flashy Italian sports cars that suggest their manhood might need a little motorised assistance .
The all - time classic retrosexual cars were all made by Ford in the golden era of retrosexuality , between 1970 and 1985 .
They were : THE FORD CORTINA , as driven by the God of Retrosexuals , DCI Gene Hunt in Life On Mars ( he exchanged it for an Audi Quattro in Ashes To Ashes ) .
THE FORD CAPRI , as driven by Bodie and Doyle , in another retrosexual TV classic , The Professionals .
THE FORD GRANADA , as driven by Arfur Daley in Minder .
THE FORD SIERRA COSWORTH , as driven by boy - racers in the Home Counties during the mid-1980s .
Rules of the road
1 . Never ask for directions , because you are never , ever lost .
You 're just taking a little longer than expected to get there .
2 . Nor do you require sat-nav .
3 . The correct speed for a retrosexual is 5 per cent above the stated limit - at all times .
A real man should never ask for directions , no matter how lost he is
4 . The correct distance between you and the car in front is 3ft .
5 . The correct answer to the question ' Should I let another driver cut in ahead of me at a junction ? ' is : ' Yes , if she 's goodlooking . '
6 . The only two occasions when it 's acceptable to use a horn are : ( i ) to alert the driver in front when the traffic lights have turned green ; ( ii ) to make a potentially attractive woman turn her face in your direction .
7 . Never bother signalling left .
Other motorists will always find out soon enough .
His mates
You have mates - but never Best Friends .
Famous buddies such as Starsky and Hutch , Butch and Sundance , Batman and Robin , and even Ant and Dec are highly suspicious relationships .
No matter how tough those men may be , nor how straight , the Retrosexual can't help thinking they 're all riding a little too close to Brokeback Mountain .
Too close : Batman and Robin who should be calling themselves mates but never best friends
When dealing with his friends , the Retrosexual sticks to basic , common - sense guidelines :
• NEVER be alone with another man for any longer than is strictly necessary .
• AVOID learning the other man 's name for as long as possible and then never , ever use it ( a humorous nickname , preferably abusive , may be permitted after many years of acquaintance , or when playing in the same sports team ) .
• NO ARRANGEMENTS for meeting again are permitted beyond a general ' See you around ' .
• HUGS , tears and kisses are acceptable only if both parties are hopelessly drunk , and provided apologies for any indiscretions are exchanged as soon as they have sobered up .
Icons
SIR WALTER RALEIGH :
He introduced the potato and tobacco into Britain , thereby giving us chips and fags .
ADMIRAL HORATIO NELSON : Defeated the French and the Spanish , while keeping his wife and Lady Hamilton happy .
BOBBY MOORE : England 's World Cup - winning captain was a supreme footballer , an absolute gentleman and could drink you under the table .
STEVEMcQUEEN : Arguably the coolest star of them all , and did n't need any tame stunt - man to jump that bike over the barbedwire fence .
BRIAN CLOUGH : Ol ' Big 'ead would n't say he was the best manager in the business .
But he was in the top one .
DI JACK REGAN : Forget Morse , this is Thaw at his best ; nicking villains , administering kickings and snarling ' Get your trousers on , you 're nicked ! ' in The Sweeney .
Look at what you 're missing girls : Retrosexual icon Gene Hunt
ROD STEWART : Blondes as far as the eye can see , never knowingly short of a drink , has his own football pitch and terrible taste in clothes .
That 's a Retrosexual !
RAY WINSTONE : He 's the daddy .
JEREMY CLARKSON : He drives cars fast , and drives Greens mad .
His opinions are sound , his voice is loud and his fashion sense is non-existent .
His only flaw is being called ' Jeremy ' .
DCI GENE HUNT : A Regan for the modern age , singlehandedly responsible for reminding women what they 're missing .
All his best quotes are winners , such as : ' Do n't move .
You 're surrounded by armed bastards ! '
Verily , the lord of all Retrosexual Men everywhere .
Home comforts
Beers in the fridge are all part of a real man 's bachelor pad
A Retrosexual does not actually have a home , as such - not unless he has woken up one day to find that he has somehow got married .
Of course , he has to have somewhere to live , but he demonstrates his inherent manliness by his absolute indifference to his physical surroundings .
So , while he may be forced to acquire chairs , tables , a bed and something to lie on while watching the telly , he pays no attention at all to what they look like .
He may , on the other hand , devote considerable care to choosing his 42in widescreen plasma TV , his DVD recorder and his surround - sound homecinema system .
No Retrosexual ever watches any propertybased TV show .
His notion of a Grand Design is a 6ft high pyramid of beer cans .
He does , however , have a number of possible decorative styles at his fingertips .
These include :
• MINIMALISM : Nothing in the place but a TV , a bed , a fridge and a pile of clothes on the floor .
• MODERNISM : Same as minimalism , only with better TV , more gadgets ( serious hi- fi , PC , video games , etc ) , and a large selection of power - tools .
• SHABBY CHIC :
In which random styles of furniture , all bought second - hand , are combined to give an eclectic , cluttered charm - or a pigsty , in other words .
The key is to tread a fine line between having such an untidy place that any women would run away , and being so clean and tidy that she questions your virility .
If in doubt , do nothing .
Bare walls , lightbulbs and an absence of girly soft furnishings ( eg. cushions , tablecloths and even curtains ) are safe options .
And never , ever light any candles .
In the biggest news since the initial concept announcement , GM vice - chairman Bob Lutz confirmed that in fact the first Chevy Volt prototype , with the full lithium - ion battery pack has hit the test track .
He said " It is reliably meeting its objectives .
Even with a rough calibration , even with the wrong drive unit , the wrong body , etc. etc. , it has been hitting its 40 miles on electric power .
"
He specifically confirmed the dynamometer tests have been successful even under various thermal conditions .
He even went so far as to say " I can almost say the battery is the least of our problems , " He further explains that much of the engineering challenge ahead has to do with software , figuring out how and when the engine should kick in for example .
He notes that he is much more confident in the November 2010 deadline .
He talks about Volt vehicle line executive Frank Weber in the following way : " Three months ago if you asked Frank Weber ' so November 2010 ? ' he'd get flustered and say he would n't answer until he knew more , now if you ask him the same question , he 's calm and relaxed and says unless we encounter some completely unforeseen obstacle - November 2010 looks good .
" Finally he confirms that CEO Wagoner is as involved in the Volt project just as much as he is , confirming extreme interest in it straight from the top .

But there have been signs that the company is serious about constructing a digital business that is less beside the point .
Soon after getting his hands on Wired.com , Steven Newhouse , chairman of Advance.net , the digital division of the parent company , moved to buy Reddit.com , a social news site along the lines of Digg , although smaller .
Last week , all the attention was focused on the $ 1.8 billion grab by CBS for eyeballs with the purchase of CNet .
But during the same week , Condé Nast bought Ars Technica , a small but very influential Web tech site ;
Webmonkey , a site for Web developers that will be restarted today ; and Hot Wired , a storied brand from early Internet days  which ran the first banner ad ever .
The price was not disclosed , but the company probably spent another $ 25 million on the acquisition , according to executives there familiar with the deal .
Between the $ 50 million already invested , and another $ 50 million that may end up being spent on discreet , small acquisitions , Condé Nast has essentially re-geeked Wired .
Much of the allure of the acquired sites is harvesting the bright young things who thought them up .
But apart from all that the brain - collecting , executives at Condé Nast said that with the new properties at Wired Digital , the company will now have a male - skewing audience of about 19 million unique visitors , which will put them in the neighborhood of Forbes.com and the various Dow Jones Web sites .
Of course , every big media company is buying digital properties  in a landgrab either for audience or bragging rights .
Condé Nast ’s tack is different .
It has a long history of financing impresarios and remaining patient , going back to Alexander Liberman , a Russian immigrant who arrived at the company in 1941 as a designer and became its protean editorial director .
Tina Brown crossed an ocean to bring Vanity Fair back from the brink and then picked up The New Yorker and gave it a good tug .
Anna Wintour , left to her own devices , turned Vogue into a behemoth , large enough to spin off Teen Vogue and Men ’s Vogue , as well .
True to form , the captains of the Condé Nast Death Star have not meddled with kids from Reddit  it was founded by a couple of students at the University of Virginia  any more than they have told Ms. Wintour what cover models to put on Vogue .
“ We did not buy these sites to dictate what they should be doing , ” said Mr. Newhouse , sitting in a borrowed office in the huge headquarters built by his father , Donald Newhouse , and his uncle , S. I. Newhouse .
“ There is a debate among big media companies about whether you achieve scale in digital businesses through big acquisitions , and all the cost and overhead that goes with it , or whether you do what we are doing , which is to lay the groundwork for a strategy that allows for real growth over time . ”
( He did n’t mention CNet , but he did n’t have to . )
David Carey , the group president with oversight over Portfolio , Wired , the company ’s golf magazines and the ad sales at Wired Digital , would like to see a digital division that helps the company , which has always leaned on fashion - oriented print publications , make money off of a business audience as well .
Deal reached on wiretap expansion , telecom immunity Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday June 19 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Wary of making the debate between liberty and security into a campaign issue , Congressional Democrats appear ready to retreat in their years - long effort to instill some sort of accountability on the Bush administration and its enablers in the telecommunications industry for their extra-legal surveillance of Americans .
Congressional leaders have reached an accord with the White House on the update to a controversial surveillance law that essentially legalizes the National Security Agency 's warrantless wiretapping program and seems likely to let off the hook the phone companies that facilitated it .
Under the bipartisan measure , a court could dismiss a suit if there is written certification that the White House asked a phone company to participate in the warrantless surveillance program Bush began shortly after the September 11 attacks and assured the company it was legal .
Sen. Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) , who has been among the most vocal critics of the administration 's apparent disdain for the Constitution , called the latest deal " a capitulation . "
 The proposed FISA deal is not a compromise ; it is a capitulation .
The House and Senate should not be taking up this bill , which effectively guarantees immunity for telecom companies alleged to have participated in the Presidents illegal program , and which fails to protect the privacy of law - abiding Americans at home .
Allowing courts to review the question of immunity is meaningless when the same legislation essentially requires the court to grant immunity .
And under this bill , the government can still sweep up and keep the international communications of innocent Americans in the U.S. with no connection to suspected terrorists , with very few safeguards to protect against abuse of this power .
Instead of cutting bad deals on both FISA and funding for the war in Iraq , Democrats should be standing up to the flawed and dangerous policies of this administration . 
A vote on the bill could come as early as Friday in the House of Representatives , which was expected to approve it .
It would then be sent to the Democratic - led Senate where even Democratic foes of the measure concede it would be passed and then be sent to Bush to sign into law .
Negotiations over the bill , which updates the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , were conducted by House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Minority Whip Roy Blunt along with the top members of the Senate Intelligence Committee , Sens. Jay Rockefeller ( D - WV ) and Kit Bond ( R - MO ) .
Telecom lobbyists also reportedly helped craft the bill .
Hoyer said the bill " balances " the needs of agencies like the NSA with Americans ' civil liberties , while he insisted it provided " critical new oversight and accountability " aimed at the administration .
" It is the result of compromise , and like any compromise is not perfect , but I believe it strikes a sound balance , " he said .
The FISA Amendments
Act expires in 2012 , which is two years earlier that Republicans had originally hoped .
A number of Democratic lawmakers along with civil liberties groups have opposed the measure , saying courts should first determine what the phone companies did before dismissing any suits .
Members of the two congressional judiciary committees , who have been most skeptical of the administration 's national security claims with regards to its extra-legal wiretapping program , appear to have been excluded from the primary negotiations .
Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) , the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee who last year introduced his own update that would not grant phone companies immunity , said he could not support the new measure , although he allowed that it was an improvement over a bill the Senate passed earlier this year .
" I have said since the beginning of this debate that I would oppose a bill that did not provide accountability for this administrations six years of illegal , warrantless wiretapping , " he said in an e-mailed statement .
" This bill would dismiss ongoing cases against the telecommunications carriers that participated in that program without allowing a judicial review of the legality of the program .
Therefore , it lacks accountability measures that I believe are crucial . "
But Bush and others have argued that these companies should be thanked , not punished , for agreeing to help protect the United States .
Chief congressional negotiators released a copy of the bill , which would amend the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , which requires the government receive secret - court approval to conduct surveillance on foreign targets in the United States .

With wire reports
Two weeks ago we reported on Greens EFA launching the pro-filesharing campaign " I Would n't Steal " .
With new editorials in Swedish newspapers coinciding with The Pirate Bay 's charges , it seems the Green Party is looking to push the issue forward , thereby supporting The Pirate Bay .
In recent years , the Swedish Green Party , which holds 19 seats in parliament , has taken a clear stance on filesharing .
Following the raid on The Pirate Bay in 2006 , the party board released a memo entitled “ Free the files ! ” in which they suggested to fully legalize non-commercial filesharing .
When asked about the purpose of the memo in 2006 , party spokesperson Peter Eriksson said : “ Our aim is to make laws in line with the new technologies .
The other option is to pretend that you can go on like you always have , although it ’s practically impossible .
Reality has changed . ”
One of the driving forces behind the recent “ I Would n’t Steal ” campaign from the European Green parties was the Swedish politician Carl Schlyter , and his initiative seems to have spurred others in the party to join the debate .
Earlier this week , an editorial was published in two local Swedish newspapers .
It was titled “ Filesharing is not theft ” and was written by Akko Karlsson , member of the Swedish Green Party ’s executive board .
In the editorial , Akko argued that filesharing ca n’t be compared to theft , as theft is when someone takes away the possibility for another person to use something , whereas filesharing only creates a new copy without erasing the original .
“ For me , this is a generation issue , ” said Akko Karlsson when Torrent Freak asked her why she decided to write the editorial .
“ You should always endorse the new technologies ’ possibilities . ”
In her editorial , Akko criticizes the entertainment industry ’s failing to enter the information age with working business models :
“ You could argue that filesharing hinders some people from earning as much money as they would have if filesharing was not possible .
But now it is possible , the technology is there , and then the industry needs to find new ways of handling it .
They ’ve had the chance to work on new ways for 10 years but have n’t come up with much else than silly trailers that say filesharing is theft . [… ]
When new technology emerges , it ’s not necessarily it that must be adapted to the old ways .
Sometimes , the industry itself must adapt . ”
Akko further told TorrentFreak that she ’s convinced that filesharing , copyright and integrity will be important issues for Green Party in the 2009 elections for the European Parliament and the 2010 elections in Sweden .
“ Because there is also the democratic aspect of this , ” she says , “ There are so many people under repressive regimes for whom filesharing and the Internet is the link to the rest of the world that inspires , gives hope and makes it endurable to fight for human rights and democracy .
The state ’s control system is expanding .
We used to heavily criticize the intrusions of privacy and control systems in place behind the Iron Curtain , but now we are building this ourselves . ”
In Swedish old media , there ’s currently a heated argument against filesharing , with novelists like Liza Marklund and Jan Guillou using every inch of their weekly columns in Swedish newspapers to lobby for tougher measures .
With the trial against The Pirate Bay coming up , the debate has sunk even deeper in the trenches .
In this climate , for politicians to step up to the plate with sound arguments why filesharing should be legalized seems like a bold move .
But Akko Karlsson is not alone .
On January 31 , an editorial was published in Gothenburg ’s daily newspaper .
It was written by Green Party ’s Lage Rahm , member of Parliament , party spokesperson on IT issues and substitute member on The Committee on Industry and Trade .
On the subject of the ongoing case against The Pirate Bay , he called for reason when it comes to impose tougher measures on filesharing :
“ Not only is the struggle [ to end illegal filesharing ] doomed to fail , it also creates a risk that filesharing on the Internet becomes anonymized and encrypted .
An increased availability of untraceable networks will make it harder to fight organized crime . ”
As an example , Lage Rahm put forward the bust of a pedophile ring with more than 700 suspects in 33 countries last year .
This was done by tracking chatrooms , downloaded photos and e-mail .
“ Most people realize that the police and copyright interest groups are fighting against windmills . [… ]
Convicting sentences against The Pirate Bay would have merely marginal effects on the scope of illegal filesharing .
More severe is that the hunt will lead to an increased interest for absolute anonymity among Sweden ’s approximately 1 million filesharers .
Their activity will move to untraceable darknets . ”
He focused on the dangers of Internet communities going underground and concluded :
“ New technologies mean we as legislators are faced with an entirely new reality .
Tougher measures against filesharing means risking the police ’s possibilities of fighting child pornography and organized crime .
It is worrying that the Minister of Justice does n’t seem to realize this .
For The Green Party , this is one of the main arguments of legalizing non-commercial downloading . [ … ]
The Minister of Justice should leave to the industry to clear up the mess they have made for themselves .
Judicial resources should be diverted to fight severe online criminality instead of hunting filesharing sixteen - year - olds . ”
So , what does this all mean for the European filesharer ?
Well , one thing is sure , political parties that actually have power are taking a pro-filesharing stance .
A sign that things are moving forward , slowly , but in the right direction .
KAMPALA , Uganda , Dec. 3 ( AP ) 
Three more people have died from a new strain of the Ebola virus in Uganda , bringing the death toll to 19 , health officials said Monday .
Officials said health workers in the area were fleeing their jobs .
The disease has been detected in five districts in western Uganda , said Dr. Sam Zaramba , director general of Uganda ’s health service .
Tests showed the virus belongs to a different subtype than the four already known , the World Health Organization said .
Hardly anyone knows what that kind of money really looks like .
By Rob Cockerham | June 10 , 2011
How much is inside a million dollars ?
It is a nice , round number that gets thrown around all the time in movies , commercials , annual reports and blackmail notes , but hardly anyone knows what that kind of money really looks like .
Would it all fit in a paper bag ?
A backpack ?
A shipping container ?
The first step in showing " how much is inside " was withdraw one million dollars from my bank account .
I quickly realized that the exiled Nigerians had not yet deposited my payoff , so I had to settle for a bit less .
One hundred dollars came in a tidy packet , with a cute blue paper band .
If you ever meet someone with a bunch of these paper bands in their glove compartment , please show them my website .
The largest U.S. bill in circulation is the hundred dollar bill , and it takes 10,000 of those to make one million dollars .
Ten thousand bills .
That is the smallest size you can get a million dollars in cash .
The first step in simulating a million dollars is to take a close look at genuine money .
All bills from the US Federal Reserve are the same size , so I carefully measured and weighed my $ 100 bankroll .
This would serve as a guide for my MASSIVE COUNTERFEIT OPERATION .
Intent on getting 10,000 bills of paper , I visited Office Circus and bought six 500 - sheet reams of paper .
Real bills are 6.125 " wide , 2.625 " tall and one packet of them is exactly one centimeter thick .
Each sheet of paper , when cut , would yield four bills .
Next I visited Kinko's copies , where they have an industrial paper - cutting machine .
I asked them to cut the 8½x11 sheets of paper into bill - sized mini-sheets .
They asked about my intentions , and when they found out about my counterfeiting plans , they reminded me that I would not be able to pay for the cutting service with fake bills .
Disappointed , but understanding , I paid with a fake check .
I came away from Kinko's with 10,000 paper bills in a cardboard box .
I made a hundred one - centimeter paper piles on my couch .
Each centimeter represented $ 10,000 .
After separating the paper , I designed and printed some paper bands for my counterfeit cash .
The bank teller had told me that hundreds are wrapped with purple bands .
She asked me about my intentions , and when she found out about my counterfeiting plans , she reminded me that I would not be able to deposit fake bills .
Soon my pile of fake bills were done and wrapped .
A hundred packets of a hundred hundreds .
The pile filled 643 cubic inches ( ~8 " x 6 " x 13 " ) and was about the size of an old 15 " television .
It weighed almost 20 pounds ( 9 kilos ) .
Immediately I began living the life of a millionaire !
There was Champagne !
Cigars !
Caviar ! Cocaine ! Rio! Tivo !
Ritz crackers !
Limousines !
Ink cartridges !
Lobster !
Yacht races !
Gold cards !
Glamour !
Diamond watches !
Diamond pendants !
Diamond Tennis bracelets !
Baseball Diamonds !
Pyramid Schemes !
Chewing tobacco !
Helicopters !
Tuxedos !
Penthouse Suites !
Real estate !
Gated communities !
Gilded communities !
Art auctions !
Marble statues !
Bribes !
Baccarat !
Intrigue !
Lasers !
Polo ! Fashion Shows !
Awards Shows !
Broadway
Shows !
Oh , wait , there was n't any Chewing tobacco ... ok , maybe just a little , but it was DAMN FINE chewing tobacco .
My reign of magnificence was cut short by a disturbing phone call .
Some Tibetan rebels had taken Mark hostage , and were demanding a million dollars ransom !
They warned me not to call the FBI .
Luckily I had charged all my recent purchases on my black American Express card , and could use the pile of fake cash to pay Mark 's ransom .
I just had to warn them not to call the U.S. Secret Service .
Stacy was the first to point out how cumbersome all that money was to carry .
I needed some kind of case to carry it in ... it would n't all fit in my neon green " life 's a beach " fanny pack .
I assumed I would need to buy a chic looking briefcase , but they were pretty pricey .
I considered asking the kidnappers to leave a small deposit for the case , but I did n't want to deal with the paperwork .
Steve suggested a 5 - gallon paint bucket .
" This is perfect ! , keep it in the back of your truck " , he said .
I liked this idea , but kidnap negotiations can require a certain level of confidence .
I needed to find some good luggage that would fit all this money .
Brooke and I made our way to Arden Fair Mall in Sacramento .
Luggage stores are always devoid of customers , so I figured I would get help immediately .
Sure enough , they had a nice doctor 's bag that could hold about $ 1.2 million in hundreds .
I did n't want to look like a doctor , so I kept searching .
I wanted a briefcase , but a " regular " briefcase can only hold about $ 780,000 .
At Malm 's Luggage in Downtown Plaza , we encountered the silvery cases I had been imagining .
Debbie and Donald , the two salespeople , were happy to assist us .
One , the Zero Halliburton Premiere Silver Attaché Case ( US$ 545 ) held all the money ... exactly one million dollars !
Debbie , Donald , Brooke and I took turns lugging it around the store .
Being burdened with a million dollars in cash is a nice sensation .
It was pretty heavy , illustrating the need for sturdy briefcase handcuffs .
Returning home , we were pleased to have an answering machine message from Mark !
He had been safely located in Xixabangma after out - drinking his Buddhist captors .
Before blowing the money on supplies for the " welcome home " party we took one more measurement :
The stack of bills was 40 inches ( one meter ) tall .
The party was great , but it ended up being BYOB .
The fake money had been refused at almost every liquor store .
Sheesh !
I wish people would learn to use their imagination !

The movie Iron Man is resurrecting the actual superhero .
This PC modification proves that while many sit on the fence about whether to go watch the movie , some true fans are expressing their loyalty in other ways .
Besides the lights and bulbs that the Iron Man computer sports , the casing , fan , and design is truly inspired by the superhero : the actual face mask is hand crafted to resemble the hero and is UV reactive , it is colored with industrial paint , the front panel is designed based on the Iron Man ’s chest , and more cool features and looks .
This PC mod is not as “ clean ” as the Pink Floyd the Wall modification , but you do not have to be a fan to enjoy the different look and design .
In addition , the video below displays all the different parts including a great sampling soundtrack of Black Sabbath ’s famous Iron Man .

This writeup does not impart my views on abortion .
I learned this from my girlfriend 's mother .
In Israel , as in most countries in which religion plays a large part in the government , abortion is illegal .
Of course , as in just about any country I know , there are circumstances which make abortion legal .
For instance , if the pregnancy carries serious danger to the mother 's life .
Well , my girlfriend 's mother wanted an abortion .
She keeps prescription medicine forever .
She never throws it away , because she never knows when she 'll need it .
I think this is really stupid - she plays at being her own doctor , prescribing herself prescription drugs .
Please do n't think this is a clever idea and do it yourself .
It 's really not .
Anyway , this gave her the idea .
There are certain drugs that you are absolutely NOT allowed to take during a pregnancy , as they cause a large amount of mutations or other pregnancy hazards .
This is especially true of medication for back aches .
She told her doctor she took one of these drugs .
I 'm not sure which specific medicine she told him she took , but it was really bad for the baby .
( Note : she did n't actually take the drug .
She just told the doctor she took it . )
Basically , you should ask your doctor which medicine you should absolutely never , under any circumstances take if you 're pregnant , and then go to obstetrics and tell them you took it .
Then they will rapidly yell and scream at you and explain to you how stupid you are , and how the hell could you do that to the baby , and that it 's a prescription drug and you are NOT allowed to take it without a prescription that 's why it 's called a PRESCRIPTION drug and you should go to the doctor when you have back aches and who the hell takes that when they are pregnant ...
And then they 'll let you have an abortion .
( Mental Floss ) --
In the words of Vice President John Nance Garner , the vice presidency " is n't worth a pitcher of warm piss . "
Vice President Aaron Burr is best known for shooting and killing Alexander Hamilton in a duel in 1804 .
That may be true , but the characters who 've held the job are definitely worth a few good pages of trivia .
Join mental_floss in toasting seven backup plans that made this country great .
1. Chester Arthur : James Garfield 's V.P .
Chester Arthur took office under the thickest cloud of suspicion .
As a lieutenant in Senator Roscoe Conkling 's political machine , Arthur held one of the most lucrative positions in government : collector for the port of New York .
For seven years , Arthur raked in approximately $ 40,000 annually ( about $ 700,000 today ) , running a corrupt spoils system for thousands of payroll employees .
With so much money and power , Arthur developed an affinity for fancy clothes and earned the nickname " the Gentleman Boss . "
But his luck did n't last .
President Rutherford
Hayes eventually stepped in and fired him from the post .
Even with the kickback scandal and claims that he'd been born in Canada ( which should 've disqualified him for the vice presidency ) , Arthur still managed to get elected on James Garfield 's 1880 ticket .
After Garfield passed away 199 days into his presidency , Arthur did n't hesitate to sign the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act .
Much to the chagrin of Conkling , the Act revamped civil service by effectively killing the same patronage system that made Arthur very , very rich .
In cleaning up civil service , Arthur also cleaned up his reputation , and he exited the White House a hero .
2. Henry Wallace : Franklin Roosevelt 's second V.P .
Henry Wallace was a dedicated devotee of Eastern mysticism .
While serving as U.S. Secretary of Agriculture in the 1930s , he allegedly sent his guru to Mongolia under the pretense of collecting grasses that could withstand drought .
In reality , Wallace was diverting funds to help his guru hunt for evidence that Christ had visited Asia .
But it was n't Wallace 's spiritual beliefs that landed him America 's No. 2 job .
Wallace was a big Franklin Roosevelt fan and supported his entire platform , which is why Roosevelt handpicked him as his third - term running mate in 1940 .
Wallace was n't popular with the Democratic Party , but when Roosevelt made it clear he would n't run without him , the party acquiesced .
As vice president , Wallace made many international goodwill trips .
Most famously , he traveled to the Soviet Union , where he experienced a political transformation that resulted in him becoming an avowed Soviet apologist .
His communist leanings did nothing for his image , especially once he became secretary of commerce under President Truman .
In 1948 , Wallace unsuccessfully ran for president on the Progressive Party ticket , espousing views that sounded shockingly Marxist .
He even described corporations as " midget Hitlers " attempting to crush the labor class .
But nobody can say Wallace did n't know how to own up to his mistakes .
In 1952 , he recanted his support of the Soviet Union in a magazine article called " Where I was Wrong . "
By then , however , his political career was over .
Wallace spent the rest of his life conducting agricultural experiments on his farm in New York .
3. William Rufus de Vane King : Franklin Pierce's V.P .
William R. King was sworn into office in Cuba , becoming the only executive officer to take the oath on foreign soil .
King had gone to Cuba to recuperate from tuberculosis and severe alcoholism , but it did n't work .
He died in 1853 after being vice president for just 25 days .
That might not be the most memorable thing about King , though .
It 's widely rumored that the former V.P. was homosexual .
Further still , he 's suspected of being James Buchanan 's lover .
Neither King nor Buchanan ever married , and they lived together in Washington for 15 years before Buchanan became president .
Of course , King 's predilection for wearing scarves and wigs only fanned the rumors .
President Andrew Jackson used to call him " Miss Nancy , " and Aaron Brown , a fellow Southern Democrat , dubbed him " Aunt Fancy . "
4. Richard M. Johnson : Martin Van Buren's V.P .
Despite his credentials as a war hero and a Kentucky senator , Vice President Richard M. Johnson was never accepted in Washington .
Perhaps that 's because he dressed like a farmhand , cursed like a sailor , and made no secret of his three black mistresses , who were also his slaves .
The first mistress bore him two daughters before she passed away ; the second tried to run off with a Native American chief , but Johnson captured and resold her ; and the third was the second one 's sister .
Johnson attempted to introduce this third mistress into polite society , but the couple was n't well - received .
With the support of Andrew Jackson , Johnson landed the vice presidency under Martin Van Buren in 1836 .
After four years of public relations disasters , Jackson withdrew his support .
Nonetheless , Van Buren kept Johnson on his ticket , and the two lost their re-election bid in 1840 .
5. Aaron Burr : Thomas Jefferson's V.P .
No story on vice presidents would be complete without Aaron Burr -- best known for shooting and killing Alexander Hamilton in a duel in 1804 .
After the incident , Burr went back to presiding over the Senate .
From there , he plotted a treasonous conspiracy to become emperor of the western United States and Mexico .
The plan could have worked , but one of Burr 's co-conspirators ratted him out .
He was tried in 1807 before the Supreme Court , which found him not guilty , mainly because he had n't actually committed the treason yet .
A free man , Burr turned his sights on Florida .
He went to France and tried to convince Napoleon Bonaparte to help him conquer the swampland , but that plan foundered , too .
Although his political high jinks often failed , Burr consistently found success with the ladies .
After his wife died in 1794 , Burr remained a bachelor for 40 years , making the acquaintance of several eligible socialites .
He enjoyed flirtations with Philadelphia debutantes , as well as a widow named Dolley Payne Todd -- later known as Dolley Madison , wife of James Madison .
At age 76 , Burr married a wealthy widow of ill - repute and plundered her fortune .
Citing numerous infidelities on his part , she filed for divorce and was actually granted it .
Unfortunately for her , it came through on the day Burr died .
6. Andrew Johnson : Abraham Lincoln 's 4th V.P .
Andrew Johnson took his 1865 vice - presidential oath drunk as a skunk and belligerent as hell .
Having grown up dirt poor , Johnson felt the aristocracy in Washington had abused his kinfolk .
Glassy - eyed and smelling of whiskey , he reminded Congress , the Supreme Court , the Cabinet , and pretty much everyone within hearing distance that they owed their positions to " plebeians " such as himself , then kissed the Bible and staggered away .
Needless to say , his address was poorly received .
The New York World opined , " To think that one frail life stands between this insolent , clownish creature and the presidency !
May God bless and spare Abraham Lincoln ! "
Unfortunately , God did n't .
The South surrendered six days before Lincoln 's assassination , leaving Johnson to handle Reconstruction -- a job he bungled so completely that Congress moved to impeach him .
Incredibly , Johnson avoided being booted out of office by just one vote .
7. John Cabell Breckenridge : James Buchanan's V.P .
By all accounts , John C. Breckenridge was a Kentucky gentleman in the grandest sense .
He had an impressive career as a lawyer and a representative in the Kentucky House .
More notably , at age 36 , he became the youngest vice president in history .
But , like Aaron Burr , things took a turn for Breckenridge when he was charged with treason .
In September 1861 , only a few months after his vice presidential term had ended , Union and Confederate forces invaded his home state of Kentucky .
Breckenridge cast his lot with the Confederates , and the federal government promptly indicted him .
Breckenridge headed south and became Jefferson Davis ' secretary of war .
But when the Confederacy surrendered in 1865 , Breckenridge was forced to go on the lam .
He hid for the next two months in Georgia and Florida before escaping to Cuba .
Breckinridge , his wife , and their children spent the next four years in exile , wandering through Canada , England , Europe , and the Middle East , until President Andrew Johnson issued a General Amnesty Proclamation on Christmas in 1868 .
The following March , Breckenridge returned to the country with his family , but his name was n't officially cleared until 1958 , when a Kentucky circuit court judge dismissed his indictment .

A blonde - haired girl with her hands strapped into boxing gloves sobs at the side of the ring .
In another image her twin brother takes a direct hit to the face from a sparring partner .
Miah and Kian Flanagan are just five years old .
But already they are seasoned fighters , taking part in an alarmingly fast - growing ' sport ' that pits children against other children in the terrifying public arena of the boxing ring .
Scroll down for more ...
Five - year - old Miah 's face crumples in tears as she fights in the ring
The opponents - some of them barely old enough to be at school - kick and punch in chilling scenes , while parents shout impassioned advice from the sidelines .
Incredibly parental ' advice ' includes encouragement to " come on Princess , go forward , kick 'em , kick 'em . "
Welcome to the world of child
Thai boxing , one of the fastest growing martial arts in the UK with now over 500 registered clubs teaching this sport .
Children as young as four or five are becoming the latest recruits to organised fighting , where some people 's attitude is : " If you 're good enough to fight , you 're old enough " .
The chilling snapshot into a pastime that is legal is laid bare on a Cutting Edge documentary to be shown on Channel 4 later this week .
Scroll down for more ...
' Just enjoy yourself , baby ' shouts her father as little Miah sobs
In the strictly governed world of conventional boxing youngsters must be at least 11 to compete .
But in MuayThai boxing there is no such limit .
There is also no requirement for protective headgear , despite regular blows to the skull .
Parents have to sign a disclaimer before a fight , relieving promoters of any blame should their children be injured as they compete - sometimes in front of paying adult audiences .
Miah and Kian Flanagan live with their father Darren , a quantity surveyor , and mother Lisa , a nail technician , in Wigan .
The twins were enrolled in boxing lessons at their local gym seven months ago .
Mr Flanagan is so passionate about the sport that he has converted the spare room into a gym so he can give the twins extra tuition .
Mr Flanagan believes that the training will help his daughter take care of herself .
" If someone grabs Miah when she 's 15 what do you think is going to happen ?
She knows all the defence moves , " he said .
" If I 'd never taught my kids Thai boxing how guilty would I feel .
Anyway Miah loves it - she 's like a ballet dancer with boxing gloves at the moment , " he told the the News of the World .
But footage from the programme shows that Miah often cries before going into the ring and her Dad instructing " Come on baby just enjoy yourself " before later ordering her " stop this now " .
" Every time she goes in that ring , there is always a worry she will start crying , " said Mr Flanagan , who says he has told his daughter she can give up if she does not enjoy it .

Children as young as five are forced to fight each other in the ring as their parents look on
Such is his determination for his children to succeed that he even alters her diet to ' bulk ' her up if she faces an older opponent .
Meanwhile his wife coats her daughter with glittery make - up and hairspray before she enters the rings .
Another child featured is Thai Barlow , already a veteran fighter at 10 and named after his parents burning passion for Thai boxing .
His dad Mark is his trainer who runs his own gym and mother Maxine was herself a successful fighter .
Both Thai and his 14 - year - old sister , a double world champion , have followed their parents ' love of the sport .
On top of school and homework , a normal week for Thai consists of running over 15 km , doing 400 sit ups , and at least 10 hours on the bags and sparring .
Mr Barlow will travel anywhere in the world , forking out thousands of pounds to get his son fight experience .
" My dream and his mum 's dream is for him to win a stadium title , " he said .
" I do n't know what his dream is … probably to play with his soldiers . "
On March 28
Thai took part in his first cage brawl , fighting inside a 23ft metal cage in front of a huge crowd paying 335 a ticket .
His opponent was nine - year - old Connor Butler , from East London .
Both were shouted on by their parents , but Thai eventually lost for only the third time in 59 fights .
Despite his youth , his victories apparently include two knockouts .
Today Conservative shadow minister for Sport and the Olympics Hugh Robertson , said he was alarmed by the fight scenes described .
" If children are so upset by the prospect of doing any sport that they burst into tears before they do it then I do n't think they should be forced to take part .
" While I support martial arts and boxing as sport I do n't think they are sports for children below the age of seven . "
Cutting Edge : Strictly Baby Fight Club is on Channel 4 on Thursday at 9pm
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) -- The U.S. State Department 's renewal of Blackwater 's contract to provide security in Iraq " is bad news , " an adviser to Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki said .
A woman passes a burned car in Baghdad where Blackwater guards killed 17 in September .
Blackwater guards shot and killed 17 people , including women and children , last September , prompting an outcry and protest from Iraqi officials .
" This is bad news , " al - Maliki adviser Sami al - Askari said .
" I personally am not happy with this , especially because they have committed acts of aggression , killed Iraqis , and this has not been resolved yet positively for families of victims . "
About 25,000 private contractors from three companies protect diplomats , reconstruction workers and government officials in Iraq .
Under a provision put into place in the early days of the U.S. - led occupation of Iraq , security contractors have immunity from Iraqi prosecution .
Watch Iraqis express anger over the announcement »
Al - Askari said he would push for the Iraqi government to contest the contract renewal .
" The U.S. government has the right to choose what contractors it chooses , but Iraq should also have the right to allow or ban certain contractors from operating on its territory , " he said .
Al - Askari said there is a general mood of displeasure within the Iraqi government because of the contract renewal .
Iraqi government spokesman Ali al - Dabbagh said a joint Iraqi- U.S. commission was set up after the shootings , and Iraqis told U.S. officials that the rules of engagement and use of force must be changed .
As a result , a State Department security officer accompanies every convoy manned by contractors , Al - Dabbagh said , and every vehicle is outfitted with a security camera .
Recordings from the camera are sent to a command center .
Al - Dabbagh said the Iraqi government still wants Blackwater to come under the jurisdiction of Iraqi law and its courts .
" Most importantly , the Iraqi investigation concluded that Blackwater committed a crime at Nusour Square , " he said .
" The U.S. informed us that the FBI investigation is still not done , and if Blackwater [ personnel are ] ... convicted , then the contract will be reviewed . "
Another al - Maliki adviser , Sadeq al - Rikabi , said the contract would be temporary since the U.N. mandate under which the United States operates in Iraq will expire at the end of the year , to be replaced by a bilateral agreement under negotiation .
" No doubt , the role of the U.S. military and contractors will be agreed on " in the new arrangement , al - Rikabi said .
Blackwater is one of three contractors working under a " task order " to provide security services in Iraq .
The other two are Triple Canopy and DynCorp .
The State Department contract must be renewed every year and is up for renewal next month .
In effect , Blackwater 's contract will roll over for another year , said Greg Starr , who heads the State Department 's Diplomatic Security Service .
Starr said new rules and an agreement between the State Department and U.S. military have improved coordination and the supervision of contractors .
Blackwater must work under the rules of the Iraqi government , he said .
The FBI is in charge of the U.S. investigation of the September incident , in which survivors and victims ' family members contend Blackwater guards started shooting without provocation .
Blackwater says its employees were returning fire after coming under attack from armed insurgents , but an Iraqi investigation called the killings " premeditated murder . "
Starr said the U.S. government , in particular U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker , will take a close look at the FBI 's investigation report , " and then we decide whether it is consistent with U.S. goals and policies to continue the contract . "
It will be important to see whether the FBI finds Blackwater itself criminally responsible , or merely a few of its employees , Starr said .
" We can terminate contracts for the convenience of the government if we have to , " he said .
" I am not going to prejudge what the FBI is going find in its investigation .
It 's complex .
I think the U.S. government needs protective services . "
" I am up to this point very satisfied with the changes we have seen , " Starr said .
" Essentially , I think they do a very good job .
The September 16 incident was a tragedy ; it needs to be investigated carefully .
The results of that will come out eventually and we will decide how we will proceed . "
Blackwater spokeswoman Anne Tyrrell declined to comment , referring all questions to the State Department .

The launch of the third and final satellite in the UK's next - generation military space communications network has been delayed by a few days .
The Skynet 5C platform was due to fly from French Guiana on Friday but technicians called a halt to the countdown just hours before lift - off .
Software on the launch vehicle did not behave normally during a test sequence .
Skynet 5 is intended to provide British forces with a secure , high - bandwidth capability through to 2020 .
A successful launch will complete the in - orbit part of the £ 3.6 bn project .
Additional work has included upgrades to ground stations and the installation of new antennas and terminals on military ships , planes and land vehicles .
Taken together , the three Skynet spacecraft - known as 5A , 5B and 5C - will provide coverage from the Americas to Asia .
See how the Skynet 5 system is being deployed A new launch date for 5C would be fixed early next week , explained Jean - Yves Le Gall , the CEO of launcher company Arianespace .
" There is an anomaly on software .
The launch will be delayed a few days " , a period of the order of a week , he told the AFP news agency .
The Skynet satellites match the sophistication of the very latest civilian platforms used to pass TV , phone and internet traffic - but also are " hardened " for military use and will resist attempts to " jam " them , for example .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" These satellites have technology that allows them to pinpoint communications on to particular regions of the world with absolute precision , and without interference , " explained Malcolm Peto from Paradigm Secure Communications , the company set up to run Skynet .
" You know the areas where British forces operate , and you can imagine the type of interference attempted .
We can avoid that very simply , very clinically , " he said .
The new Skynet constellation will allow the British Army , Royal Navy and Royal Air Force to pass much more data , faster between command centres .
The bandwidth capacity of Skynet 5 is two - and - a - half times that of the old satellite constellation , Skynet 4 .
The new system will enable British forces to make use of next - generation weapons systems , such as the recently introduced Reaper drones .
These unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAV ) are deployed over Afghanistan but are remotely piloted by RAF personnel in the US .
Skynet 5C was built in response to high satellite insurance costs
This is made possible only by Skynet 's ability to handle the drones ' real - time video feeds .
Other battlefield applications would include surgeons , unsure how best to treat badly injured soldiers , being able to send scan information back to the UK for a second assessment ; and then using video conferencing to discuss cases .
Skynet 5 is the largest PFI ( Private Finance Initiative ) so far delivered to the UK's Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) .
Under the PFI , the British military buys guaranteed capacity from its commercial supplier ( Paradigm ) , which is free then to sell any spare capacity to friendly governments .
These third - party sales earn money for Paradigm and the MoD in what is a " shared gain " arrangement .
The launch of the Skynet 5C satellite should provide substantial extra revenue potential .
When the PFI deal was originally set up , the MoD was expecting to receive two satellites ; but the high cost of spacecraft insurance in the early 2000s prompted project chiefs to put that money into building an extra platform instead .
" In effect we 've self - insured , " said Mr Peto .
" We 've used the money we would have spent on insurance to build a third satellite .
" When we launch [ Skynet 5C ] , we will have three very capable satellites to provide communications , not only for British forces but for our third - party market which makes this whole project viable . "
Skynet will support reconnaissance video gathered by unmanned drones

Paradigm hopes the money it earns over the course of its contract ( which runs to 2020 ) will be sufficient for it to reinvest in further spacecraft with enhanced payloads .
If this is achievable , Mr Peto says , it will provide UK forces with better equipment , much faster than traditional procurement routes .
As is normal for Ariane flights , Skynet 5C will ride into space with a co-passenger - on this occasion , a Turkish TV satellite .
" We 'll be first out ; the separation of 5C from the rocket occurs about 30 minutes after launch , " explained the Skynet project manager , Patrick Wood , from manufacturer EADS Astrium .
" We 'll pick it up via a ground station we 're using in South Africa .
The first thing we 'll do is send a command that should be sent straight back to us , telling us the receive electronics are working .
We can then send a sequence of commands to start waking up the satellite 's systems . "
It will take about a week to move 5C to its initial operational position 36,000 km over the Atlantic Ocean , at 17.8 degrees West .
Friday 's launch window in Kourou opens at 2152 GMT .

What are these ?
PALO ALTO , Calif . 
In the computer world ’s equivalent of “ The Amazing Race , ” three rival teams of computer researchers are working on new types of software needed to better use computer chips that can process many tasks at the same time .
Stanford University and six computer and chip makers plan to announce Friday the creation of the Pervasive Parallelism Lab .
Besides Stanford , the backers are Sun Microsystems , Advanced Micro Devices , Nvidia , I.B.M. , Hewlett - Packard and Intel .
Last month , Intel and Microsoft announced they were jointly financing new labs at the University of California , Berkeley and the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign to tackle the same problem .
All three efforts are in response to a growing awareness that the software industry is not ready for the coming availability of microprocessors with 8 or 16 or more cores , or processing units , on a single chip .
Computer and chip makers are concerned that if software cannot use the new hardware efficiently , customers will have little reason to upgrade .

BERLIN ( Reuters ) - Four developing countries have appealed against the adoption of Microsoft's MSFT .O Office Open XML document format as an international standard , the International Organisation for Standardisation said on Monday .
ISO said in a statement the national standards bodies of Brazil , India , South Africa and Venezuela had appealed against the positive outcome of a vote it held in March after a controversial fast - track ratification process .
It gave no details of the substance of the appeals .
At the time of the vote , several parties complained that the discussion and subsequent voting process was muddled and rushed .
Gaining the final ISO stamp of approval would help Microsoft win more public - sector contracts , as some government bodies are nervous about storing archives in a proprietary format .
The adoption of OOXML as an ISO standard will remain on hold until the appeals are resolved , which could take several months , ISO said .
Critics say OOXML is not fully translatable into other document formats , notably the open - source Open Document Format that is already recognized as an international standard .
ISO ’s secretary - general and the general secretary of the International Electrotechnical Commission are considering the appeals and will submit them to their respective management boards for consideration by the end of the month .
The boards will then decide whether to proceed with the appeals process .
Delegates attending a conference and exhibition on green building this week had the chance to see what manufacturers are calling the UK 's first commercially viable , affordable and ready to purchase zero - carbon home .
A half - hour queue snaked around the outside of the life - sized exhibition house .
It was one of the main attractions at the EcoBuild exhibition , which took place in Earl 's Court , London over three days this week .
The house , built by a ZEDfactory , consortium of architects and specialist green manufacturers , has been awarded Code 6 status – the highest level in the government 's code for sustainable buildings which all new housing will have to meet from 2016 .
Built with energy - saving fabric and renewable energy systems , manufacturers say the " RuralZED " house can go for a whole year without drawing on National Grid power .
It is capable of coping with almost any weather without needing more energy than it generates by itself .
It uses environmentally sound materials , gains heat from renewable sources , and offers green solutions for water use and waste generation .
The house uses a flat - pack timber - frame kit based on the concept of the timber - framed houses that were built in Britain about 1,000 years ago .
The timber frame is then laminated and built in a box shape formed by posts and beams on a low - carbon concrete foundation .
Heavyweight eco concrete panels manufactured using a high level of recycled aggregate content rest on the solid timber beams .
These are an energy - efficient alternative to domestic plasterboard and give the house its " thermal mass " that absorbs and releases heat slowly .
This " super insulation " is three times as effective as that of a normal house and will keep residents cool in summer and warm in winter .
By using a frame and traditional material for insulation – instead of the plastic foam currently used in modern construction – manufacturers say that the home is more durable and avoids problems - such as poor air quality and the release of gases through decomposition of material - that are associated with plastic foam building .
The super insulation and energy - efficient appliances reduce the energy requirements to such an extent that all the building 's needs can be met through renewable technologies .
Microgeneration technology is easy to install in the form of solar panels on the roof and wind turbines .
Water heating will come from solar roof panels , and in the winter , from a biomass boiler fuelled by wood chips .
Start - of - the - art modern materials that have been used in the house include worktops and tables made from 85 % recycled glass bottles collected from the capital 's pubs and clubs .
Water is conserved with a grey - water recycling system , low - flow showers and thermostatic bath and shower mixers .
Light , fresh air , natural materials and finishes are at the heart of the house - there is even room to grow your own vegetables and options for vegetable oil powered cars .
The flexible design and construction of the kit means that detached houses , semi- detached houses , or terraces of up to six homes can be built , with different internal layouts and external appearances .
The frame can be adapted to two or three storeys .
Six properties are already under construction at Upton , Northampton , and 24 are in the planning stage , ZEDfactory says .
The homes are ideal for self - builders or housing providers who want to stop climate change and to build a sustainable , healthy future , they say .
It costs from £ 1,150 per square metre based on the purchase of six units , and take three weeks to erect ( ZEDfactory can erect it for you ) .
So a three - bedroom home would cost about £ 150,000 .
The architectural brains behind the project is Bill Dunster , the same architect who was responsible for BedZED , the low - carbon complex of 80 eco-friendly apartments in south London .
" The main goal with carbon neutral housing is to reduce carbon emissions and the risk of climate change .
Until now , proposals and prototypes of other house designs have lacked the commercial and financial viability to make them serious alternatives to traditional housing and building techniques , " Dunster said .
" The RuralZED house has overcome financial constraints due to the strength of the RuralZED consortium , which has created a house that is , in addition to being the most ecologically sound housing option to date , affordable to build and desirable to live in , making it the most serious contender in the race to beat the effects of residential carbon emissions . "
75 Frugal Hacks for Your Home
Decorating and maintaining a home is expensive , but there are things you can do to cut the cost .
Lately it seems that every time I turn on the news , there ’s a story about the mortgage crisis or an impending recession .
The cost of living is going up , and oftentimes salaries are n’t going up to meet those costs .
In response to the money crunch , ordinary people like you and me need to cut costs to make ends meet .
I have a lot of experience living on a shoestring , and I ’ve put together a list of tips I ’ve either heard of or used myself to maintain and decorate my home on a budget .
Hopefully these tips are as useful to you as they ’ve been to me .
Saving Money on Electricity
1 . Set the thermostat at 68 degrees in the winter and 78 degrees in the summer .
Use a programmable thermostat to set the temperatures at less comfortable levels when you ’re not home or sleeping .
2 . Use heavy drapes over your windows .
In the winter , it will keep the warm air in , and in the summer it will keep the hot air out .
3. Caulk and weatherstrip the cracks in your house .
Our landlord added some weatherstripping around our back door , and it ’s made a world of difference !
4 . Use ceiling fans .
If you get the reversible kind , you can use them to push the warm air down to people level in the winter .
5 . Line dry your laundry .
6. Unplug appliances you ’re not using .
Even if an appliance is turned off , it still uses a small amount of energy , if it ’s plugged in .
This is especially effective if you ’re going out of town .
7 . Close the heater vents in rooms you are n’t using .
8. Insulate , insulate , insulate !
Our landlord says he went overboard on the insulation in our house , but with heating bills under $ 80 during the winter , I ’m not complaining .
You can even make sure your garage door is insulated to save more money .
9 . Do n’t use the air conditioner in the summer .
It ’s not real comfortable , but people survived for years without a / c , before it became standard in homes .
10 . Switch to CFL bulbs .
If you look hard enough , you can find good sales on them .
I picked up most of our CFL bulbs on sale for 99 cents a bulb .
11 . Wash your clothes less often .
I ’m not talking about being disgusting here , but many people throw clothing in the laundry after each use , whether it ’s dirty or not .
If you wear a dress for a couple of hours on a Sunday morning , you can probably forgo washing until after the next time you wear it .
12 . Along the same lines , reuse your bath towels before washing them .
13 .
Have an energy audit performed on your home .
Many electric companies offer energy audits free .
You can call and have someone come out to your house and tell you about changes you could make to make your home more energy efficient .
14 . Install energy saving appliances .
I ’m not advising that you run out and buy new appliances , but if your refrigerator stops working , look for an energy efficient model to replace it .
15 .
If you have older windows , make sure you put up the storm windows in the winter .
16 . Weather proof your windows with that plastic stuff .
Not pretty , but it saves energy .
17 .
Use small appliances like your crockpot and toaster oven for cooking , rather than heating the entire oven .
18 . Keep your freezer full .
It uses less electricity that way .
If you have extra space , fill it with plastic water bottles .
19 .
If you do use the oven , cook multiple things at once .
Make use of every inch of space in there .
Saving Money on Water
20 . Shorten your showers .
21 . Put a half gallon water jug in your toilet tank .
22 . Let your lawn brown out during the summer .
Do n’t worry .
It will come back during the winter .
23 .
If you ca n’t stand the thought of letting your lawn brown out , get a timer for your sprinkler to make sure you never forget to turn it off .
24 . Reuse rinse water from hand washing dishes to water plants .
25 .
Turn off the water while you brush your teeth .
Saving Money on Cleaning and Maintenance
26 . Make your own cleaning products .
It ’s a lot cheaper , and better for the environment , too .
27 . Reuse dryer sheets to dust electronics like the TV and computer screen .
The anti-static in the dryer sheets will repel dust from your appliances .
28 . Do your own house repairs .
If you have a good reference book , you ’d be surprised at what you can fix yourself .
29 .
If you ca n’t learn from a book , consider taking a class at your local community college .
It ’s still cheaper than hiring a professional , and the knowledge you gain will be useful for the rest of your life .
30 .
To unclog a drain , pour a cup of baking soda in the drain and follow with a cup of vinegar .
Wait an hour and follow with boiling water .
I even unclogged a garbage disposal with this method once .
Or you could do what my friend ’s plumber husband says .
Pour bleach down your drains every week .
That will keep them unclogged , too .
31 . Let your faucets drip just a little bit if you expect the weather to be cold enough to freeze the pipes .
Paying for the minute amount of extra water is cheaper than paying for a burst water pipe .
32 . Check your local Habitat for Humanity ReStore for home improvement / repair materials .
33 .
To clean mini-blinds , put an old sock on your hand , dip it in rubbing alcohol , and run your sock - covered hand over the blinds .
Works like a charm !
34 .
To remove lime deposits from a showerhead , pour vinegar into a plastic bag and tie the bag to the showerhead , so it is submerged .
Wait an hour , and you should be good to go .
35 . Before attacking a remodeling project , talk to people who are knowledgeable about remodeling .
Never attempt a project without the knowledge you need to do it right .
36 .
If your locks are sticking , consider trying cooking oil to fix them .
Rubbing pencil lead across your key and inserting it works well too .
37 .
Turn an unused coat closet into a pantry by adding cheap shelves .
I ’ve done this twice , and I ’m not real handy .
If I can do it , anyone can !
Saving Money on the Telephone , Internet , and Cable
38 . Drop your land line and use your cell phone .
39 .
Cut out unnecessary services like call waiting and caller ID .
40 .
Use email or instant messaging instead of calling long distance .
41 . Try a digital phone service like Vonage .
42 . Use a dial around number for long distance .
I used to use One Suite , and I never had any problems .
And at 2.5 cents a minute , the rate is hard to beat .
43 .
Use a free 411 service instead of paying .
One to try is 1-800 - GOOG - 411 .
44 .
See if you can get bundled savings for your phone , internet , cell phone , and satellite services .
Our phone company offers a few different bundles , and it ’s a lot cheaper than paying for each service separately .
45 . Threaten to drop your cable service .
It ’s amazing what companies will do to keep you as a customer .
Of course you should only try doing this if you are actually willing to drop your service .
This works well with cell phone companies and XM radio , too .
46 . Actually drop your cable service , and any other services that are n’t absolutely necessary .
47 .
If you do n’t have cable or satellite , and you have an older TV , request a coupon for the converter box you will need to keep receiving a signal after February 17 , 2009 .
The $ 40 coupon will bring the cost of the converter box down to $ 10 .
Saving Money on Decorating
48 . Buy cheap furniture from eBay , Craigslist , thrift stores , or other places that sell inexpensive items .
49 .
Use sheets to make window coverings .
Emily even made a valance out of a $ 2 tablecloth from the thrift store !
50 .
You can also use sheets or cloth napkins to make throw pillows .
51 . Sheets also make nice cloth napkins .
52 . Use family photos for decorating .
It ’s cheap , and it adds a homey feel to your house .
I enlarged a bunch of our wedding photos for our bedroom .
It adds a romantic touch .
53 .
Use your children ’s artwork for decorating .
One family I know frames a piece of each child ’s art , and rotates the art throughout the year .
It ’s good for your child ’s self - esteem as well as your budget .
54 .
To change the look of a room , paint .
There are lots of different paint effects that you can use .
Check out a how - to book from the library .
55 .
For painting small areas , check paint stores for returned custom color paints .
They ’ll often sell them at a steep discount .
56 .
If your sofa is in good structural condition , but the look just needs updating , use slipcovers to add a new look .
57 .
To update the look of a wood dresser , paint and add new hardware .
Add a little decorative stamping , if you ’re brave .
58 . Check carpet stores for remnants if you need an area rug .
My mom did this when I was little , and you never would have guessed that our area rug was just a remnant .
59 .
Use bedsheets in the next size up to make a pretty duvet , if you want to change the look in your bedroom .
60 .
Use decorative boxes , baskets , or pots to organize things .
61 . Only use white sheets , towels , and washcloths .
They look better longer , because you can bleach them when they get dingy .
62 . Use fresh cut flowers from your garden to add a touch of spring or summer to your house .
63 .
For cheap , but attractive office organization , cover boxes and bulletin boards with fabric you buy on clearance .
64 . Embrace minimalism .
Less stuff =
Less maintenance = Less money .
Saving Money on Landscaping
65 .
If your county offers free or low cost mulch , use it !
The county where we used to live offered free mulch from the landfill , and we could get as many truckloads as we needed without paying a penny !
You ca n’t beat that !
66 . Decorate old containers and use them for planters .
You can pick up all kinds of cool containers at garage sales !
67 .
Use a weedpopper for weeding .
It ’s cheaper and more environmentally friendly than chemicals .
68 . Check freecycle for free plants .
I find them all the time .
I have a whole row of strawberry plants that I picked up free last year .
69 .
Ask good friends for cuttings from their plants .
Most good friends wo n’t mind .
70 .
Grow plants from seed , rather than spending the extra money for starts .
Saving Money in Other Areas
71 . Recycle .
Most cities have free recycling programs .
And throwing less stuff in the trash will cut down on your garbage bill .
If you ’re really interested in going green , there are a lot of other frugal things you can do , too .
72 . Compost .
It saves money on both your garbage bill and fertilizing your plants .
It ’s good for the environment , too .
73 .
Do n’t upgrade your appliances and furniture unless they wear out .
The cost per use is negligible if you use something until it dies .
74 .
If your water heater is old , consider replacing it before it completely dies and something bursts and causes damage to your house .
Of course , if you are going to replace your hot water heater , replace it with an energy efficient model .
75 .
If you feel that your property value was assessed at higher than the actual value of your home , have it reassessed , so your property taxes are lowered .
Do you have any additional frugal home tips ?

The popular BitTorrent site mininova has been down for a few hours due to hardware issues .
It is expected that the downtime will continue for several hours , which puts other BitTorrent sites under pressure .
Mininova ’s Erik told TorrentFreak that there are problems with the network card of the loadbalancer , one of the parts they do n’t have a backup for .
The mininova team is working hard to get the site up and running again .
The good news is that no data will be lost , the bad news is that it may take a while – possibly 12 hours – because it is a holiday in The Netherlands .
Mininova ’s forums are not connected to the loadbalancer , and are still up and running .
The same is true for the seeds of their featured content section .
Mininova currently has well over 3 million unique visitors per day , and more than 15 million pageviews , which makes them the BitTorrent site with the most traffic .
Consequently , the downtime at Mininova has resulted in quite a few extra visitors for several other BitTorrent sites .
Flippy , the admin of Torrentz.com told TorrentFreak that he ’s seeing a 50 % traffic increase , which works out at tens of thousands of visitors an hour .
As a result , Flippy has had a tough time keeping his site running smoothly , and other BitTorrent site admins are reporting similar traffic boosts .
For now Torrentz is doing fine , except for a few server connection issues every now and then .
It ’s a pretty scary thought that server issues at mininova can almost bring down the fourth largest BitTorrent site .
A whole ring of BitTorrent sites could potentially collapse like a house of cards .
update : SumoTorrent went down for 6 hours as well because the site was overloaded
Are ex-telco lobbyists behind McCain 's wiretap flip - flop ?
Nick Juliano

The evolution of John McCain 's position on warrantless wiretapping and executive power gives critics a potential one - two punch against the presumptive Republican nominee : the ability to paint him as " McSame " as President Bush and as a flip - flopper .
A McCain adviser this week affirmed the Arizona senator 's support for President Bush 's ability to authorize the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on Americans ' international communications without first receiving a warrant , which critics say violated the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
This , after McCain himself said explicitly that the President cannot " disobey any law " to conduct warrantless surveillance .
In a letter to the conservative National Review Online , McCain adviser Doug Holtz - Eakin underscored McCain 's support for a Senate bill granting immunity to the telecommunications companies that facilitated the NSA 's warrantless surveillance and declared that neither President Bush nor those companies should " apologize for actions that most people , except for the ACLU and trial lawyers , understand were Constitutional and appropriate in the wake of the attacks on September 11 , 2001 . "
Holtz - Eakin 's letter was an attempt to dial back earlier reports that McCain might be shifting on the immunity issue .
A campaign legal adviser told a conference last month that a McCain administration would subject the telecommunications companies to " real hearings to find out what actually happened , what harms actually occured . "
The letter emphasized that such hearings would not be necessary and insisted that McCain " do everything he can " to protect against terror threats , including invoking his constitutional authority to request surveillance assistance from the telephone and Internet companies .
While McCain 's position on wiretaps and telcos is zigging this way and that , a new report also details the extent to which lobbyists who earned a living representing the very phone companies accused of breaking the law are now working for his campaign .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation , which is leading the charge against telco immunity and representing plaintiffs in several pending lawsuits , lays out the connections : Last fall Newsweek reported on the telecom 's " secretive lobbying campaign to get Congress to quickly approve a measure wiping out all private lawsuits against them for assisting the U.S. intelligence community 's warrantless surveillance programs . "
The magazine named some of the chief telecom immunity lobbyists :
Among the players , these sources said : powerhouse Republican lobbyists Charlie Black and Wayne Berman ( who represent AT&T and Verizon , respectively ) , former GOP senator and U.S. ambassador to Germany Dan Coats ( a lawyer at King & Spaulding who is representing Sprint ) ...
All three are now working with McCain ....
USA Today reports
" Of the 66 current or former lobbyists working for the Arizona senator or raising money for his presidential campaign , 23 have lobbied for telecommunications companies in the past decade . "
The New York Times noted Holtz - Eakin 's letter Friday and spoke to several legal experts suggesting that McCain has shifted his position on wiretapping , compared to an earlier interview with the Boston Globe in which he seemed to distance himself from Bush 's sweeping view of executive power .
David Golove , a New York University law professor who specializes in executive power issues , said that while the language used by Mr. McCain in his answers six months ago was imprecise , the recent statement by Mr. Holtz - Eakin seems to contradict precisely what he said earlier . 
Mr. McCains position , as outlined by Mr. Holtz - Eakin , was criticized by the campaign of his presumptive Democratic opponent in the presidential election , Senator Barack Obama of Illinois .
Greg Craig , an Obama campaign adviser , said Wednesday that anyone reading Mr. McCains answers to The Globe and the more recent statement would be totally confused  about what Senator McCain thinks about what the Constitution means and what President Bush did . 
 American voters deserve to know which side of this flip - flop hes on today , and what he would do as president ,  Mr. Craig said in a phone interview .
Tucker Bounds , a McCain campaign spokesman , said Mr. McCains position on surveillance laws and executive power has not changed .
Sen. Bob Graham , who was chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee when Bush instituted the warrantless wiretapping program after 9/11 , called the justification of the program a " smokescreen " for a wider data - mining effort .
" All of this is really a smokescreen and what the administration is hiding under that smoke screen .
...
Really they 're doing data mining which is where you 're collecting milions of pieces of information , " Graham said in response to a question from RAW STORY during an Obama campaign conference call Friday .
Graham , an Obama supporter , said current FISA law , which McCain believes is inadequate , provides more than enough leeway for the NSA and other agencies to gather the intelligence they need .
He said the warrantless wiretapping was an effort to resurrect the Total Information Awareness data - mining program that had been abandoned by the administration .
" The administration instead of walking away from it 's collapsed tent , tried to find a new way to erect it , " he said .
Friday 's Times ' article on McCain 's shifting position was written by Charlie Savage , the former Boston Globe reporter who won a Pulitzer for his reporting on Bush 's efforts to expand the scope of executive power .
Savage also was perhaps the only reporter to comprehensively quiz the presidential candidates on their views of the president 's power .
EFF 's Kurt Opsahl asks whether the telco lobbyists in McCain 's inner circle have helped push him away from his previous views .
The strong connections between the telecom immunity lobbyists and the McCain campaign raise serious questions about McCain 's about - face on warrantless wiretapping .
As recently as November 2007 , McCain told CNET News ( emphasis added ) :
When companies provide private records of Americans to the government without proper legal subpoena , warrants , or other legal orders , their heart may be in the right place , but their actions undermine our respect for the law .
...
If retroactive immunity passes , it should be done with explicit statements that this is not a blessing , there should be oversight hearings to understand what happened , and Congress should include provisions that ensure that Americans ' private records will not be dealt with like that again .
McCain 's delicate dance on telecom immunity and warrantless wiretapping demonstrates the precarious position he finds himself in headed toward the presidential election in November .
He needs to distance himself from Bush 's most unpopular policies and wrong - headed decisions without alienating a conservative base that still is largely supportive of many of these policies .
In addition to standing with the White House on wiretapping and immunity , McCain also voted against a Bush - opposed bill that would formally ban torture among CIA interrogators by forcing their compliance with the Army 's Field Manual on Interrogation .
The vote struck many as a political calculation from McCain , who was tortured for five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam , and he was widely criticized for it .
McCain 's latest wiretapping gambit also has earned him much condemnation on the left .
Salon 's Glenn Greenwald , who has often criticized the media 's lax examination of McCain said Friday 's story emphasizes the extent to which questions about his views , and how much they parallel Bush 's , need to be asked .
" McCain is simply incapable of forming a coherent position on what he thinks about any of this , dramatically changing his answers almost from one day to the next depending on who is asking , " Greenwald writes .
" This behavior , culminating in his embrace this week of the Bush / Cheney / Yoo theories , severely undermines the two attributes the media relentlessly uses to depict him -- his ' moderate ' ideology and his straight - talking , principled independence . "
The easy way to neutralise cholesterol ?
Coffee may cut the risk of dementia by blocking the damage cholesterol can inflict on the body , research suggests .
The drink has already been linked to a lower risk of Alzheimer 's Disease , and a study by a US team for the Journal of Neuroinflammation may explain why .
A vital barrier between the brain and the main blood supply of rabbits fed a fat - rich diet was protected in those given a caffeine supplement .
UK experts said it was the " best evidence yet " of coffee 's benefits .
Caffeine is a safe and readily available drug and its ability to stabilise the blood brain barrier means it could have an important part to play in therapies against neurological disorders
Dr Jonathan Geiger
University of North Dakota
The " blood brain barrier " is a filter which protects the central nervous system from potentially harmful chemicals carried around in the rest of the bloodstream .
Other studies have shown that high levels of cholesterol in the blood can make this barrier " leaky " .
Alzheimer 's researchers suggest this makes the brain vulnerable to damage which can trigger or contribute to the condition .
The University of North Dakota study used the equivalent to just one daily cup of coffee in their experiments on rabbits .
After 12 weeks of a high - cholesterol diet , the blood brain barrier in those given caffeine was far more intact than in those given no caffeine .
' Safe drug ' " Caffeine appears to block several of the disruptive effects of cholesterol that make the blood - brain barrier leaky , " said Dr Jonathan Geiger , who led the study .
" High levels of cholesterol are a risk factor for Alzheimer 's disease , perhaps by compromising the protective nature of the blood brain barrier .
" Caffeine is a safe and readily available drug and its ability to stabilise the blood brain barrier means it could have an important part to play in therapies against neurological disorders . "
A spokesman for the Alzheimer 's Society said that the barrier seemed to work less efficiently in people who went on to develop Alzheimer 's or suffer strokes , and the cholesterol link might explain this .
" This is the best evidence yet that caffeine equivalent to one cup of coffee a day can help protect the brain against cholesterol .
" In addition to its effect on the vascular system , elevated cholesterol levels also cause problems with the blood brain barrier . "
She called for more research into whether the same effect could be seen in humans .

But Mr. Chávez is wagering that he can fill the gap , particularly in foreign investment , through new ventures with allies like Cuba and Iran .
For instance , after a three - day visit here last month by a high - level Iranian delegation , Venezuela and Iran agreed to build a manufacturing plant for tractor parts and a cement factory .
Similarly , Venezuela announced the creation this month of two companies with Cuban partners in the fishing and pork industries .
Potentially of greater impact , China and Venezuela inaugurated the headquarters here of a $ 6 billion fund this month to carry out infrastructure projects .
Beijing is putting $ 4 billion into the fund , part of an effort by Mr. Chávez to export more oil to China in exchange for more Chinese investment in Venezuela .
Meanwhile , Mr. Chávez is testing new policies to curb a slide in the currency , the bolívar , and restiveness over food shortages .
Protests broke out this year in parts of Venezuela over food shortages and climbing food costs , including one disturbance in Sabaneta , Mr. Chávez ’s impoverished home city , in Barinas State .
Some of the new economic policies , aided by ample oil income , are working relatively well .
The black market rate of the bolívar climbed more than 20 percent in the past two months , to 3.4 to the dollar , after the government soaked up demand for foreign exchange by selling dollar - denominated bonds to investors here .
The move brought some stability to a currency that had been shaken by accelerating capital flight in the past year .
A recent surge in oil prices has also helped Mr. Chávez ’s government mask declining production at the national oil company , Petróleos de Venezuela .
His supporters in the National Assembly recently approved a windfall tax on oil producers , potentially giving the government more than $ 2 billion in extra revenue this year .
Anxiety here has also eased with the reappearance of some foods on supermarket shelves , notably milk .
Stung by criticism over milk scarcity , the government eased price controls for milk and recently took over a large dairy concern , Lácteos Los Andes , directing it to reduce yogurt production and raise milk output .
Experts are divided over whether you can change your fat fate
No amount of dieting will alter the number of fat - hoarding cells in our bodies , research has suggested .
Scientists at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden say that the number is set during adolescence and stays the same , regardless of obesity later in life .
The journal Nature reports how they tested patients who lost huge amounts of weight , and found little change in fat cell numbers .
A UK expert said eating and exercising remained key for keeping healthy .
It explains why it 's so difficult to lose weight and to keep it off - those fat cells are n't going anywhere , and they 're crying out for more
Dr Kirsty Spalding
Karolinska Institute
The rising rate of obesity means that a lot of scientific attention is focused on the " adipocyte " , the cell type which makes up the bulk of our bellies and waistlines .
When we are getting fatter , these cells are actually expanding in size , but experts did not know for certain whether this was the only thing happening , or whether the numbers of adipocytes could go up and down as well .
If the latter was happening , then in theory , losing weight could actually reduce the number of fat cells in the body .
The Swedish researcher first tested several hundred children , adolescents and adults of various ages and found that while fat cell numbers increased through childhood , by the time adulthood was reached , the number of cells stayed the same .
They then tested the possibility that fat cell numbers could change in extreme circumstances by taking samples of fat from patients about to undergo radical weight loss .
Some of the patients were about to undergo " gastric banding " , a last resort operation designed to help very obese patients lose weight by reducing the size of the stomach .
Once the weight loss was complete , another sample of fat was taken to assess if the overall number of fat cells had decreased .
Tough to lose
The researchers found that the level of fat cells had stayed the same , and lead researcher Dr Kirsty Spalding said this finding confirmed the bad news for dieters .
" It explains why it 's so difficult to lose weight and to keep it off - those fat cells are n't going anywhere , and they 're crying out for more . "
I think it is premature to conclude that , by the time we are adolescents , the ' game is up ' in terms of the number of fat cells we can posses
Professor Stephen O'Rahilly
Cambridge University Dr Paul Trayhurn , from the University of Liverpool , said the research represented a " firm foundation " for further studies into obesity .
" It would be nice if we could find a way to lose fat by manipulating the numbers of fat cells , but there a lot of other options higher up the queue than that - such as diet and exercise .
" The real benefit of this is that it gives us solid evidence that we can use in future research into obesity and its causes . "
However , another scientist , Professor Stephen O'Rahilly , from Cambridge University , said he was unconvinced by the idea that fat cell numbers were set from adolescence .
He said : " We know that , sitting in adult fat tissue , are lots of cells that do n't contain fat , but are capable of doing so if the nutritional conditions are right .
" They can almost certainly do so without dividing and therefore would not be ' counted ' using this technique .
" I think it is premature to conclude that , by the time we are adolescents , the ' game is up ' in terms of the number of fat cells we can possess . "

What are these ?
The 2,000 - year old cocktail : it tastes as bad as it looks … but it works .
My back hurts .
So does my throat , and I feel like a sumo wrestler is sitting on my head trying to pop my eyes out .
Alas , the common cold has got me .
Fortunately , I expect to be rid of it in 48 - 72 hours .
Like millions this time of year , I have the bug .
But , thanks to Chinese and German friends and several helpful doctors , I ’ve found a few effective treatments — the closest to cures I ’ve experimented with — that can get you back on your feet faster .
I suggest you test them in stages , from oldest to newest , as the side - effects tend to increase as we include modern drugs .
The Chinese Cure for the Common Cold–Simple and Direct
Despite some craziness like shark - fin soup and bear gallbladders , the Chinese have had a long time to experiment with the common cold .
In Beijing , I ’d doubted the traditional Chinese approach to reducing fevers ( bundle you up in winter clothing and force you to drink near - boiling tea or water until you sweat profusely ) , which ended up working like a charm , so I ’ve been willing to test ideas that could have some clinical basis .
The ladies–my five surrogate mothers–at my neighborhood Chinese restaurant suggested the following fast - acting cold remedy ( end product pictured in the first photo from this post ) , which — for me — cuts symptoms like sore throat and sinus pain by at least 50 % over 24 hours .
Step 1 : Get fresh ginger and the orange rind ( peel ) from one orange , preferably organic or otherwise not treated with pesticides .
Trader Joe ’s or Whole Foods will do .
The Epsom salts will be explained and is not part of the recipe .
Step 2 : Cut the ginger into small pieces and mash them down with the side of a large kitchen knife .
Step 3 : Bring water to a low boil ( medium setting on my electric stovetop ) in a small pot and insert ginger pieces .
Wait 20 minutes .
Note : to help relieve the muscular pains that often come with a cold or flu , I ’ll run a hot bath during this 20 minutes , put in the entire box of Epsom salts ( magnesium sulfate ) , then soak for 10 minutes before coming back to the kitchen for step 4 .
Step 4 : Add the orange peel sections to the boiling water and wait an additional 10 minutes .
Step 5 : Strain and serve .
Be forewarned that it has a strong taste and a few dabs of organic honey will help those with girly - man stomachs ( I ’ll plead girly - man on this one ) .
The liquid / tea / soup stores well in the refrigerator but tastes 10 x worse cold .
The German Solution–Alcohol , Of Course !
The German solution I ’ve been offered is easier to describe :
1 . Get a deep - tissue massage
2. Chamomile Tea
3. Spiced Rum
4. Bed
I suspect the spiced rum could have an effect less from the alcohol and more from the cinnamon typically used to make it spicy .
Though generally thought of as being viral , the common cold is often misdiagnosed or accompanied by other types of bacteria and infection .
Cinnamon has been shown to inhibit E. Coli and increase insulin sensitivity , among other things , which is why I take it supplementally prior to meals if I ’m cycling off of alpha-lipoic acid ( ALA ) as an insulin mimicker .
I ’ll discuss ALA at greater length another time , but here is a preview from wikipedia : “ Lipoic acid has been shown in cell culture experiments to increase cellular uptake of glucose by recruiting the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the cell membrane , suggesting its use in diabetes . ”
Modern Non-Prescription Options
Though it ’s true that “ supplement , ” “ drug , ” and “ food ” are largely legal distinctions and not biochemical ones , getting prescriptions is both time - consuming and expensive .
For shortening the duration of the common cold , I use Zicam oral mist ( nasal delivery can damage your sense of smell ) every 3 - 4 hours , along with the following :
Garlic extract ( 2 capsules , 3x / daily ) , probiotic acidophilus cultures ( one capsule per meal ) , 3 mg melatonin prior to bed , 8 - 10 grams of vitamin C in 1g divided doses .
I do n’t use echinacea because I ’ve found the supporting research inconsistent and it upsets my stomach .
I ’m aware that some researchers dispute Linus Pauling ’s conclusions about vitamin C , but I believe it ’s because of insufficient dosing and spacing , as it is water soluble and can have a half - life of just 30 - 60 minutes .
From the non-ingestible standpoint , having suffered from sinus infections since childhood , I ’m a proponent of sinus irrigation , which entails driving distilled water mixed with salt and baking soda in one nostril and out the other .
I ’ll do this each morning and evening as soon as symptoms appear , and it all but eliminates the intra-cranial pressure and black - eye look so typical of sinus inflammation :
The NeilMed sinus rinse kit .
The Last Resort–Heavy Prescription Artillery
The common cold , as mentioned earlier , is generally thought of as a viral infection and attributed to any number of rhinoviruses and friends : “ Common colds are most often caused by infection by one of the more than 100 serotypes of rhinovirus , a type of picornavirus .
Other viruses causing colds are coronavirus , human parainfluenza viruses , human respiratory syncytial virus , adenoviruses , enteroviruses , or metapneumovirus .
Due to the many different types of viruses , it is not possible to gain complete immunity to the common cold . ”
Diverse as the causes might be , there is one combination of drugs–my personal holy trinity –that seems to kill off most variations of cold - related upper - respiratory issues if all else fails :
From left to right : the “ Zmax ” or azithromycin , an antibiotic ( do n’t use this and acidophilus at the same time ) ;
Flonase or generic fluticasone propionate , an anti-inflammatory nasal stray with little systemic absorption of the glucocorticoids ; and Pseudovent , a decongestant and expectorant not unlike Primatene tablets .
These drugs all have side - effects and should not be used without medical supervision .
If your HMO or doctor seems clueless , however , feel free to make suggestions .
Please note also that I use antibiotics only when warranted , as in the case of severe and recurring sinusitis with related causes .
Uninformed overuse of antibiotics can do more damage than anabolic steroids , so caveat emptor .
###
The common cold has been with us for millenia and will likely be with us for millenia to come .
Is does n’t mean you have to lay down and take it .
Test some of these options , with the guidance of a doctor when needed , and perhaps we can save one more casualty from flu and cold season .

This weekend , you 'll be hearing a lot about a tiny , out - of - the - way place that normally has to get hit by a natural disaster to get our attention .
Such is the wonder and magic of primary season .
I 'm not talking about some quiet town in the middle of Tornado Alley , though .
On June 1 , all eyes are on Puerto Rico , the small Caribbean island that will send 63 delegates to the Democratic National Convention , even though its residents do n't get to vote in the general election .
What gives ?
In November 's general election , only residents of the 50 states ( and , since the 23rd amendment , the District of Columbia ) get to vote .
The primaries , however , are run by state and local governments , and caucuses are run privately by political parties .
Since Puerto Rico has a local government and political parties , both events are fair game , and residents of Puerto Rico participate in the nominating process of both major parties and send delegates to each party 's national convention .
Other organized territories like Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands do the same .
What else do Puerto Ricans get to do ?
Here 's a quick history lesson .
All the land that is part of the U.S. but is n't part of a state , the District of Columbia or assigned to a Native Nation has historically been designated as a territory .
The modern generic term for these regions is insular area ( which is also applied to freely associated states ) , since territory is now more narrowly defined by the federal government as an insular area under the jurisdiction of the United States .
These territories can be " ¦
" ¢ incorporated ( under the jurisdiction of the United States , over which Congress has determined that the United States Constitution is to be applied to the local governments and residents in the same way it is applied to those of the states ) ...
...or...
" ¢ unincorporated ( under U.S. jurisdiction , over which Congress has determined that only select parts of the U.S. Constitution apply ) ...
... and may also be ...
" ¢ organized ( where Congress has explicitly granted self - government through an Organic Act , which normally includes provisions for the establishment of a Bill of Rights for the territory and the framework of a three - branched government ) ...
...or...
" ¢ unorganized ( without direct authorization of self - government ) ...
" ¦and all of them can put " Made in the U.S.A. " on their products .
Today , the U.S. has only one incorporated territory — the Palmyra Atoll , which is owned by The Nature Conservancy and managed by the Department of the Interior .
Among our numerous unincorporated territories , Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands hold the status of " commonwealth . " *
This means " a self - governing , autonomous political unit voluntarily associated with the United States "  ) .
This term does n't seem to have any significance beyond labeling them as one type of unincorporated , organized territory and is mainly a matter of politics .
It comes from the English translation of Puerto Rico 's official name ( Commonwealth of Puerto Rico ) .
A literal translation of its name in Spanish , " Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico "  would have been " Associated Free State of Puerto Rico , "  and since it actually is n't in a Compact of Free Association with the U.S. , " Commonwealth "  was substituted .
So what does all that mean for Puerto Rico ?
Well , among other things " ¦
" ¢ Puerto Ricans are statutory U.S. citizens .
They 're eligible for Social Security benefits , can receive federal welfare and serve in the armed forces .
" ¢ Most sections of the Internal Revenue Code do n't apply there .
Residents do n't pay federal income taxes unless they do business with the federal government or run a business that sends funds to the U.S. .
All residents do , however , pay other federal taxes like payroll taxes ( social security and Medicare ) and import / export taxes .
" ¢ United States federal law is applicable to Puerto Rico .
" ¢ They are not represented by a U.S. Representative or Senator , but by a Resident Commissioner in the U.S. House of Representatives who has the right of voice and can vote in the Committee of the Whole , but does not have a full House Vote .
" ¢ Puerto Ricans residing in the United States have all the rights and privileges associated with residing in a state .
* To anyone living in the Commonwealths of Virginia , Kentucky , Massachusetts or Pennsylvania who might be concerned about territorial status and voting eligibility : Do n't worry .
You live in a regular State that simply decided to refer to itself as a commonwealth a long time ago as a matter of political theory .
The Kentucky state government 's website , for example , says that at the time Kentucky was petitioning for statehood , the term meant that " all power was vested in and derived from an equally free and independent people rather than a hierarchical and / or feudal system under a king . "
It was a way of saying that the people were running the government , and not the other way around .
Today , Uncle Sam begins to deposit money directly into the checking accounts of some 130 million American households .
Probably $ 600 for a single person , maybe $ 1,200 for a couple – maybe less , or maybe more , depending on family circumstances .
Washington hopes recipients will spend much of it , and revive the flagging economy .
Most economists expect the $ 152 billion stimulus package will boost economic activity for several months .
They debate the degree of stimulation .
" There is going to be an impact , " says Brian Bethune , an economist with Global Insight , an economic consulting firm in Waltham , Mass .
But it will be " muted … not strong or explosive . "
High oil prices will hurt the economy , and by 2009 , Global Insight predicts the economy will slip perilously close to zero growth .
Lacy Hunt , an economist with Hoisington Investment Management Co. in Austin , Texas , is even less cheery .
" It 's a one - shot deal , " he says .
" At best , it will lift the economy for a little while . "
Budget expert Stan Collender does n't even like the " tax rebate " terminology used by Washington , since many of the poorer recipients will have paid no 2007 federal income tax or amounts less than their government check .
The stimulus package , he says , is really " pure borrowing … just increasing the [ federal ] deficit . "
For lawmakers , passage of the stimulus package in February offered Democrats and Republicans alike the merits of showing voters they are taking action on the economy .
For the White House and Congress , it was the equivalent of the Monopoly " Get Out of Jail Free " card , maintains Mr. Collender , managing director of Qorvis Communications in Washington .
[ Editor 's note :
The name of the company Collender works for was misspelled . ]
The stimulus package is equivalent to 1.1 percent of fiscal 2008 gross domestic product ( GDP ) , the nation 's total output of goods and services .
Some $ 107 billion goes to households , $ 45 billion to businesses – mostly by giving them a bonus depreciation to deduct from their tax burden .
Global Insight assumes 20 percent of the rebate amounts will be spent within three months , 40 percent within six months , and 50 percent within a year .
Looking at academic research on the impact of the 2001 tax rebates , Mr. Hunt predicts only about 25 percent of the new stimulus package will be spent .
The remainder will be used to reduce debt or increase savings .
Moreover , since lower - income families spend half their budgets on lower - priced imports , the actual stimulus to US economy will be a mere one - eighth of 1 percent of GDP .
" There is no evidence historically that [ rebates ] did anything , " Hunt says .
" I do n't think rebates were a good idea . "
In addition , since the federal government must borrow the stimulus money from a limited pool of US capital , there will be less money available for business , states , and municipalities to borrow .
And they will have to pay a higher interest rate .
Neither Mr. Bethune nor Hunt sound chipper on the economy .
Global Insight sees recession in the first half of this year , then a small bounce , followed by more weakness in early 2009 , without a " sustainable recovery " until mid-2009 .
Hunt talks of " at least another two years of minimal growth . "
If either forecast proves accurate , the next president and Congress will not only face the question of what to do in Iraq but what to do further about a lagging economy .
It wo n't be easy .
The Federal Reserve has moved dramatically to keep the economy going with interest - rate cuts and financial support activities to ease the liquidity squeeze .
As a result , the economy 's money supply has grown at a 13 percent annual rate over the past three months .
If that growth rate lasts much longer , economists ' fears of inflation will escalate .
Too much money boosts prices .
But even this growth has been " more than entirely neutralized " by a dramatic decline in the velocity of money , that is , how often the money is spent , says Hunt .
It sits unused in financial accounts as banks and other financial institutions try to rebuild capital after suffering severe losses from subprime mortgages , collateralized debt obligations , and other fancy financial instruments .
In the current massive credit crunch , velocity has declined at a 2.3 percent per annum rate , calculates Hunt .
So the Fed 's " best efforts are likely to be thwarted , " Hunt says .
Adding to the problem , consumers are in poor shape .
Assuming house prices drop " only " 30 percent from their peak and stock prices rise just 10 percent from the first quarter level , Americans ' loss in real wealth will amount to about $ 7 trillion , says Hunt .
When wealth declines , research shows , consumers spend less .
It could be " a drag " on the economy for the next three years .
If that holds true , President Obama , President Clinton , or President McCain will face larger economic challenges than they may have bargained for .
Bill Clinton is being an asshole again .
Yes , a man who got a blowjob from a 21 year old intern in the Oval Office while talking on the phone to world leaders , and whose subsequent lies turned it into a two - year scandal that destroyed our party ’s ability to get anything done , tells us that “ we ” mock the voters .
He took our votes as license to turn the White House into his own personal Animal House , and he feels mocked ?
Now that ’s chutzpah .
Bill Clinton is dead set on destroying Democratic nominee Barack Obama .
It ’s high time the DNC and the Superdelegates told the Clintons to take their sorry , scandal - ridden asses and get the hell out .
We are going to have another month of these vindictive racist losers destroying Obama ’s credibility with the very voters he is going to need in the fall to beat McCain .
What possible benefit to the party is there in having Bill and Hillary keeping us all talking about what idiots they are , rather than focusing on John McCain ?
I thought Harry Reid and Nancy Peolosi told us that the Clintons were going to stop going negative on Obama ?
I guess not .
More from ABC :
Per ABC News ’ Sarah Amos , this is what the 42nd president of the United States said Friday in Ripley , W.Va . : “ Hillary is in this race because of people like you and places like this and no matter what they say , ” Clinton said .
“ And no matter how much fun they make of your support of her and the fact that working people all over America have stuck with her , she thinks you ’re as smart as they are .
She thinks you ’ve got as much right to have your say as anybody else .
And , you know , they make a lot of fun of me because I like to campaign in places like this , they say I have been exiled to rural America , as if that was a problem .
I do n’t know about you , but I ’d rather be here than listening to that stuff I have to hear on television , I ’d rather be with you .
There is a simple reason :
You need a president a lot more than those people telling you not to vote for her . ”
In Madison , W.Va . :
“ It is very interesting , from the very beginning of this race there has been a sharp divide in the vote — the people who need a president , who need to turn the economy around , who need to restore the middle class , who need to give poor people a chance to work their way into the middle class , who need to give our children a better future , who need to restore our standing in the world and the war in Iraq , but do it in a way that rebuilds our military and stands up for America ’s security and standing around the world — they have been for her from the get - go . ”
And on and on … Ginning up the resentments and the class divide ( and maybe other divisions ) . …
His message to these voters : Obama and the media are laughing at you and think you ’re stupid !!!
And per Joe ’s earlier post , that ’s $ 2 million Bill , keep it up .

Savage Love Roger That
JOE NEWTON
I 'm a thirty - something gay man married to a thirty - something gay man .
For almost two years , we 've been seeing another pair of married gay men around our age .
They were our first experience with any sexual or romantic interaction outside of our relationship .
The first six months were hot and heavy .
We were together constantly and having sex almost every night .
After the “ honeymoon phase ” ended , one member of the other couple ( “ Roger ” ) wanted to slow things down .
Roger and I had some conflict over this , and I have to admit that I showed a pretty bad side of myself while grappling with insecurity .
Eventually , Roger pulled me aside to talk one - on - one .
He wanted us to be “ friends who have sex sometimes . ”
Then , right after the COVID - 19 lockdown started , Roger and I had another heart - to - heart on my birthday .
After many drinks some a lot of making out we both said we loved each other .
Roger walked it back the next day .
“ I do n't know what you thought you heard last night , ” he basically said , “ but I 'm not in love with you . ” I was devastated .
This is n't what I want .
I am in love with Roger and his husband .
I do n't want to be “ friends who have sex sometimes . ”
My husband is OK with just being friends with Roger and his husband , especially since their large friend group has adopted us and he worries we ’ll lose all these new friends if I end our friendship with Roger and his husband .
I would really like to talk this out with Roger , but I 'm not sure I can get through that conversation without DTMFAing him .
I mean , which was it ?
Were we a fun sexy fling and nothing about the last two years mattered ?
Or was he in love with me but decided the conflict and complication of this relationship was n't worth it ?
Which was it ?
Trouble In The Quad
Roger does n’t want what you want .
That sucks and I ’m sorry .
But we ’ve all been there .
Falling for someone who does n’t feel as strongly for us as we do for them , whether we ’re dating as couples or singles , is always painful .
But that pain is an unavoidable risk .
And while it may seem unfair that you can only have Roger in your life on his terms , that ’s the reality .
That ’s everyone ’s reality , TITQ , because loving someone does n’t obligate that person to love us back or love us in the same way that we love them or want the same things we want .
But Roger ca n’t impose his terms on you .
If being “ just friends ” feels like an insulting consolation prize after what the last two years has meant to you , if that ’s not good enough , then Roger does n’t get to be in your life .
You can have terms too .
Backing up for a second :
You seem to believe that if the relationship mattered — if Roger and his husband loved you and your husband and vice - versa — then it would n’t have ended .
That ’s false .
Something can matter and still end .
Something can also matter more to one person than it did to another person .
( Or couple . )
You do n’t have to dismiss or minimize what the four of you had because Roger has decided , for whatever reason , that being in a quad with you is n’t what he wants .
And if you ’re hoping to get this quad back together … and it ’s entirely up to Roger … you ’re going about it wrong .
If Roger got cold feet due to the “ conflict and complication ” of being in a poly relationship , TITQ , then your best move is to avoid conflict and complication .
If you think Roger told the truth on your birthday and lied to you the next day , then you need to demonstrate the kind of emotional maturity that makes you a more attractive partner to a person like Roger .
And provoking a confrontation with Roger — staging a scene where you ’re likely to dump up a guy who has already dumped you — will have the opposite effect .
It will only confirm for Roger the decision he has already made .
Your best bet — your best strategy — is to accept Roger ’s offer of friendship and refrain from blowing up at him .
You should also tell him , just once and very calmly , that you and your husband would be open to getting back together with him and his husband .
Best case scenario , the quad gets back together .
Worst case scenario , you have some great memories , a whole bunch of great new friends , and maybe once in a while a hot foursome with Roger and his husband .
Two last things …
I would love to see video of you showing the “ bad side ” of yourself to Roger .
Given the way people tend to minimize their own shitty behavior — all people do it , myself included — I ’m guessing it was / you were ugly .
If you ’re prone to blowing up when you do n’t get what you want , well , it ’s understandable that someone who dislikes conflict and complication would start getting cold feet once the honeymoon phase ended .
I ’m not suggesting you ’re toxic or unbearable ‚
TITQ , only that different people have different tolerance levels for romantic conflict .
But if what you want is for Roger to reconsider the decision he ’s made , well , you might also wanna let him know you ’re working on your approach to conflict .
If you do n’t want Roger to regret getting the quad back together and then quickly end things again , TITQ , or for the next Roger or Rogers who come into your life to head for the hills after their honeymoon phases end , you ’ll talk with someone who can give you the tools to better handle conflict .
And finally , TITQ , the other two men in this quad feel strangely inert — more like houseplants than husbands .
I mean , you have nothing to say about how Roger ’s husband feels and very little to say about how yours does .
Is Roger ’s husband interested in keeping the quad together ?
Besides not wanting to lose some new friends , does your husband give two shits ?
Because even if Roger decides he wants back in , TITQ , and that ’s a big if , your revived quad wo n’t last for long for if your houseplants — sorry : your husbands — are n’t just as invested as you are .
The man I ’m seeing is the first person I ever opened up to about my bisexuality .
Over our first year together , we had several threesomes , but we both became uncomfortable with them and one day he told me he could not have that kind of sex with a woman cares about .
We quarantined together and he felt COVID - 19 had forced us to rush things .
We decided to spend less time together to focus on our careers , which had both taken a hit .
Now we only see each every two weeks or so .
I thought it could be fun to reconnect and do some more threesomes .
He agreed but asked me to handle things .
I found us some amazing girls .
But as in the past , our threesomes led to problems .
I feel threatened , he feels jealous .
We fight , I cry , he gets angry and acts like an asshole .
I ’m very insecure , depressed , and have spent years in therapy .
The threesomes feel like too much but we have great sex when we talk about other women .
Is there any way we can make this work ?
Lost Into My Emotions
I feel really sorry for the women you two are having threesomes with — even if you ’re doing your very special guest stars the courtesy of waiting until they leave to break down in tears , LIME , and even if your boyfriend is polite enough to wait until they ’re gone before acting like an asshole , these women are most likely picking up on the tension and may feel conflicted about the sex after they go .
If you ’re having these meltdowns and blowups in front of these women , LIME , they definitely leave feeling terrible and may worry they did something wrong when it ’s you two who are doing something wrong : continuing to have threesomes despite knowing they never end well .
While I do n’t think a woman should waste her time ( or pussy ) on a man who tells her he can’t have “ that kind of sex , ” i.e. sex she enjoys , with a woman he cares about , I can understand why you might want to keep seeing this guy .
( COVID - 19 is making it hard to find new partners . )
But you should stop doing the thing that does n’t work — having threesomes — and do the thing that does work instead : talking dirty to each other about other women .
And if you still want to get with women , LIME , do it solo .
He does n’t need to be there for you to enjoy an amazing girl .

O2 has confirmed reports that the iPhone is not currently available anywhere in the UK , and customers may have to wait for the putative 3G Apple iPhone .
Last month the price of the 8GB Apple iPhone was slashed to £ 169 in preparation for the release of a 3G iPhone , which Apple is expected to launch in the US at Apple 's Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco on June 9 .
Stock of both the 8GB and the 16GB Apple iPhone models , have flown off UK shelves , forcing service provider O2 to admit that no stock remains and the original iPhone will not re-appear .
However , with no definite UK release date for the 3G iPhone , Brits could be waiting some time before they can get their hands on any model of Apple 's hybrid mobile phone , media player and web browser .
The Carphone Warehouse has not yet officially confirmed it has no iPhones available , but its website highlights that they have no stock .
Both O2 and The Carphone Warehouse have said that the 16GB iPhone may yet appear later this month , but the word is not to expect a lot of stock to arrive .
This story , " IPhone Is No Longer Available in UK " was originally published by PC Advisor ( UK ) .

A credit card is a way of borrowing money .
You use credit cards just like you ’d use your normal debit card to buying the things you want .
But , when you ’re spending with a credit card , you ’re actually borrowing the money from a credit card provider .
Typically , credit cards are meant for borrowing small amounts of money , usually £ 1,000 to £ 5,000 .
If you ’re looking to borrow more , it ’s generally considered to be cheaper to get a loan .
With credit cards , you have more flexibility because instead of getting lump sum of cash , you ’re given a set amount of credit , and you can borrow as much as you need to within that amount .
You can then choose to pay off the balance of your credit card straight away , or in monthly instalments .
If you do take the instalment route , you ’ll likely have to pay interest on what you owe .
How to find the best credit cards
When you ’re looking for the best credit cards , UK wide , it can be tempting to look for cheap credit cards .
But it ’s better to think about how you intend to use your credit card , because each type of credit card comes with different benefits depending on how you use it .
Some credit cards are good for making a big purchase .
Others can help you reduce your debts and interest payments .
And some credit cards give you cashback or reward points on your spending .
Here ’s some more information about credit cards .
To help you find the best credit cards for your needs which have the lowest credit card rates , look at the comparison table above .
The table shows you all the different types of credit cards , from different providers .
It also shows you their interest rates , so you can compare cards to make an informed decision .
Try our free credit card eligibility checker
Before you start to compare credit card deals , it ’s important to find out which ones you ’re actually likely to be accepted for .
Our free credit card eligibility checker helps you find out which credit card offers you ’re eligible for , and it wo n’t affect your credit score .
It ’s a risk - free way of finding the best credit card deal for you .
Here ’s everything you need to know about our eligibility checker so you can find the best credit card deals for you .
Our credit card eligibility checker wo n’t leave a mark on your credit record , because it uses a ‘ soft search ’ credit check .
What types of credit cards are there ?
There are lots of different types of credit cards to choose from in our credit card comparison table .
But which type is right for you ?
Purchase cards
A 0 % Purchase credit card is one that gives you an interest - free period for a set amount of time when you first take it out .
That means you wo n’t be charged interest on your credit card spending for that period .
The period can be from a month up to more than two years , depending on the provider and what credit card offers you can find .
By getting a new credit card with a 0 % purchase offer on it , you ’ll be able to use it for a big purchase like a holiday or furniture .
But do n’t forget you ’ll need to pay it off before the interest - free period ends , or you ’ll be charged interest on the remaining balance .
Balance transfer credit cards
A 0 % balance transfer credit card lets you move your debt from an older credit card , or even several credit cards , to a new credit card .
It ’s a useful way to avoid paying interest on your debt .
But you should be aware that some providers often charge a fee to transfer your balance , so finding the best credit card deals is vital .
Some balance transfer credit cards offer both balance transfers and purchases .
This can be helpful for tracking how much you owe , so you can make sure you repay it in time .
Just remember that the best credit card for you will give you a long enough 0 % period for both balance transfers and purchases .
Money transfer credit cards
Money transfer credit cards are a way of moving cash from a credit card to your current or savings account .
When you ’re searching for the best credit cards , UK wide , see if you can find one with a 0 % introductory period .
0 % money transfer cards are ideal for clearing an overdraft .
They ’re also a good way to get a cash loan on which you do n’t pay interest for a set period .
Do n’t forget to keep track of when the interest - free period on your new credit card ends .
When it does you ’ll start paying the lender ’s standard variable rate and that tends to be high .
Cashback and rewards credit cards
When you ’re looking for the top credit cards you could benefit from , you might like to think about a cashback credit card .
These let you earn money back on your credit card spending .
Or , you could look at reward credit cards .
With these you earn points when you spend , and these can be used for things like air miles , shopping vouchers or hotel vouchers .
When you compare credit card offers , remember that these are one of the best credit cards for people who have a good credit history .
They ’re also good for people who pay off their credit card balance monthly .
That ’s because you do n’t pay interest , plus you can take advantage of the cashback offers or rewards points .
Credit - building credit cards
If you ’ve got bad credit , or no credit history at all , you ’re more likely to get accepted for a credit - building credit card than any other type of credit card .
You ’ll find that credit card rates are often a bit higher with these , and you ’ll usually get a lower credit limit .
But , if you ’re careful with how you use your credit - building credit card and make repayments on time , you ’ll improve your credit score .
What are the benefits of choosing a credit card ?
There are lots of reasons why you might want to get a credit card , aside from the obvious one which is that they let you spend more money than you have .
Improving your credit score
Having a credit card is one of the best ways to increase your credit score .
It can help if you do n’t have much credit history at all or if you want to improve a poor credit score .
As long as you use your credit card responsibly ( paying it off on time and not missing payments ) , your good behaviour will be recorded on your credit file .
This ’ll improve your credit score and help you when it ’s time to get a car or mortgage .
Protecting yourself against fraud
Credit card offers are great , but actually all credit cards act as a useful firewall , protecting you from fraudulent charges .
If you do notice any unauthorised charges on your credit card , you ’ll just need to report them to your lender and usually you wo n’t have to pay them .
That ’s not always the case with debit cards , or if someone gets hold of your bank account details .
Rewards
If you use your credit card responsibly , you ’ll be able to rack up air miles , cash back or loyalty points to spend with retailers or hotel groups .
Extras
Some of the best credit cards come with extra benefits , like travel insurance or airport lounge access .
When you do a credit cards comparison , bear these in mind .
Although they do n’t sound like much , they can add up to a big saving over time .
What are the disadvantages of choosing a credit card ?
Borrowing money short - term on a credit card is great if you can do it responsibly , helping you to spread the costs of a larger purchase .
But , if you do n’t borrow responsibly and make your repayments on time , you could end up with serious debt .
What you should think about when you compare credit cards ?
There ’s lots to take into account when you do your credit cards comparison .
This includes :
Fees :
These are the cost of having the credit card .
They ’re important to look at if you ’re trying to find the cheapest credit card .
There might be an annual fee ( which could cost hundreds of pounds ) , late payment fees , or over limit fees .
So read the small print !
Interest rates :
Your credit card rates are how much interest you pay for borrowing through your credit card .
Credit cards are n’t secured against any property .
So , even with the best credit card offers , interest rates are usually higher than with other forms of borrowing .
Interest - free period :
Lots of the best credit cards have an interest - free period at the beginning .
During that time you ’re not charged interest on your spending .
As long as you pay the minimum balance on time every month , you wo n’t pay interest .
The interest - free period can be from a month to around two years , depending on what credit card deals you can find .
Rewards :
Some of the top credit cards offer extra rewards .
This could be cash back , air miles , or loyalty points .
The more you spend on your credit card , the more you get .
The best credit cards have low interest rates , long interest - free periods and low fees .
But it ’s important that you do n’t just find cheap credit cards without thinking about anything else .
Finding the best credit card for you means looking at why you ’re borrowing money and how you plan to use it .
How to get the most out of your credit card
Credit cards are useful tool when used responsibly and strategically .
Here are somethings to keep in mind when using your credit card
Do n't miss monthly payments :
Missing payments is one of the worst offenses when using a credit card .
You 're often charged a penalty , and it hurts your credit score .
Avoid withdrawing cash : Withdrawing money from your credit card often comes with fees .
You 'll also be charged interest on top of that .
It 's best to avoid cash advances unless it 's urgent .
Payoff your balance in full : Unless you 've got interest free credit card , it 's usually best to to pay off your balance in in full every month .
It saves you from being charged interest , and you do n't accumulate debt .
It also goes a long way in improving your credit score .
Avoid too many applications : Applying for credit too often can hurt your credit score .
That 's because each time you apply , it leaves a mark on your credit file .
It 'll make lenders think you 're desperate for credit and thus they 'll be less likely accept you .
Be careful when overseas :
Many credit cards charge foreign transaction fees when you use your credit card abroad .
Make sure you have a credit card that does n't charge you these fees when you travel .
Be smart about rewards cards : Rewards cards can be tempting at first glance , but can prove expensive .
Pick rewards that you actually use regularly and that they outweigh the annual fees that rewards cards usually charge .
Since reading Lynn 's article on saving gas by driving slower I have been trying to apply the tip to my daily commute .
The problem is that these crazy Northern California highways are not very friendly to slow drivers .
What I have been doing is driving behind big trucks in the slow lane so that I do not get honked at or pulled over by the highway patrol .
Apparently driving behind big trucks also saves you gas due to something called drafting , and you can safely take advantage of this to save an additional 5 to 10 % of your gas .
The science behind drafting is closely related to why driving slower saves energy .
Basically , you have less air resistance in front of your car if a big truck has already passed through the air and your car is in the tunnel or " slipstream " behind it .
A truck also blocks some of the air rushing at you .
On the popular Discovery Channel show Mythbusters it was shown that if you follow a big rig by 100 feet you can decrease your fuel consumption by 11 % .
The daredevils went a bit further with the experiment and followed a truck at only 10 feet and managed to decrease fuel consumption by 40 % .
As the MythBusters crew said , it is extremely dangerous to drive too close to a giant truck because the truck driver might not see you , and you may also be pulled over for tailgating .
A safe follow distance at 55 miles per hour is about 160 feet to 240 feet since your car is travelling at approximately 80 feet per second and you want two to three seconds of reaction time to hit the brakes .
If you are travelling faster you need to give yourself even more space .
I definitely do not recommend dangerous driving behavior just for the sake of saving a bit of gas , but if you are driving slowly on a highway full of speed demons , safely following after a truck could save you gas and harassment .

Disclaimer :
The views expressed here are my own and not those of CBC / Radio - Canada .
Last week , CBC released an official DRM - free BitTorrent of a prime time show– a first for a major north American broadcaster ( see last100 coverage ) .
Since then we ’ve been getting hundreds of emails of support and one clear resounding message : give us more .
This begs the question , why are n’t broadcasters doing more ?
Why in the year 2008 , seven years after BitTorrent ’s birth and a lifetime in Internet years is this a groundbreaking thing ?
Let ’s break down what it takes to get a legal torrent going and maybe we ’ll get some answers .
The idea
First , the seed has to get planted .
How it happened for us was when two weeks ago , Tessa Sproule ( the head of digital strategy of CBC’s Factual Entertainment department ) read this post on BoingBoing about how Norway ’s public broadcaster had tested the BitTorrent waters and declared them warm & refreshing .
Tessa decided she wanted to spearhead the effort for CBC to follow NRK ’s lightly treaded path .
Unfortunately , not every company has a Tessa .
Companies need to have people championing new ideas , or watch their product slowly become irrelevant in favour of products from companies who are willing to innovate .
Still , how do you make it happen ?
When the average person wants to share a show torrent , they simply record it off TV , strip out the commercials and upload it .
But when a media company decides to do it and wants to do it in a completely legal way , there ’s a lot more that has to be considered .
Let ’s start with ownership .
Ownership
In big business , it can be challenging to start something completely new to an organization .
Usually it involves convincing lots of people that your idea is brilliant and simply must be tried .
Now try convincing people who you do n’t even work with , at several different companies , maybe in different countries , all with different mandates .
Impossible ?
Well , no… it ’s technically possible in the same way that it ’s technically possible that I ’m going to win the lottery six times in a row .
But , we can certainly hedge our bets a bit better by starting with something we own , or own with very few partners .
Demographics
CBC owns a several shows , so how do you choose what show to experiment with ?
Canada ’s Next Great Prime Minister was chosen for several reasons , one of which was demographics .
Because we used YouTube and Facebook to cast this year ’s show , we had a youthful tech - savvy audience on our hands who understand and embrace new media .
Sharing this show was a way of giving back to these people without whom we would not have a show .
We also wanted to experiment with a big show .
Readers outside of Canada are saying , “ Canada ’s Next whadda wha ? ” but the show within our borders is a hit , with as many viewers tuning in as an episode of House .
If we were going to do this , we did n’t wanna wuss out with some show nobody had heard of– it was going to be prime time .
Finally , the show ’s Senior and Executive producers really support and embrace new media .
They were less likely to laugh at us if we asked , “ Um … hey , can we give away your show for free to everyone with no restrictions after it airs ? ”
Tessa guessed right .
They both loved the idea and were instrumental in helping gain additional approvals .
Okay so good demographic , big show and forward thinking producers .
Check .
Next issue… rights .
* shudder *
Rights and approvals
Rights are hands down the number one challenge to getting traditional TV online .
It ’s also not an unreasonable request for content producers to demand rights to work they made , it can just be a very difficult process to get them all … think dribbling a football type difficult .
If the idea of a legal TV torrent was going to die , it would likely be in the chain of approvals we had to get including : union agreements , music licenses , lawyer approval , co-owner ( Magna International Inc. ) approval , marketing and sales okay , business development reps , communication strategy , and finally approval from the network programming office .
Yep , that ’s a mouthful .
Tessa later said that the approval process was like playing a game of whack - a- mole .
As soon as one approval had been given the nod , the next obstacle would pop up .
Still , there was broad acceptance to the idea and in the end the approvals were easier than anticipated .
It may sound like a difficult process to an uploader , but on the other hand , the list is much shorter than one a private broadcaster would have to check off .
As a public broadcaster , our mandate to “ be made available throughout Canada by the most appropriate and efficient means ” really helped the cause .
Tracking
Businesses always want to measure the success or failure of their project and legitimately so .
BitTorrents present particular analytical challenges as seeders come and go and the file is copied to places where you never published it .
Still , that does n’t mean there are n’t any metrics with torrents , and besides , are Nielsen ratings an exact science ?
No .
I ’ve written before about how broadcasters need to consider other indicators of success , including torrent downloads .
The overwhelmingly positive global response by consumers directly to CBC is an extremely valuable measure of success , I ’d argue as valuable as the number of leechers .
Monetizing
CBC released this show completely for free and without ads .
That ’s fine for an experiment , but it ’s no sustainable business model .
The surprising thing is the amount of feedback we got from people telling us to do this again and put in a few ads .
People realize that if businesses were to embrace BitTorrent distribution long term , they ’d need to monetize it and they ’re telling us how to do it .
It demonstrates that people are particularly interested in the on - demand nature of BitTorrents and they ’re downloading because of convenience , not because they ’re commercial - free .
The key is ensuring that broadcasters find the right balance between monetization and consumer ’s tolerance .
Why not Show X ?
So why is n’t your favourite show on BitTorrent already ?
Officially I mean 🙂
Take your pick : licensing , rights , approvals , sponsorships , business partnerships , control , business model , statistics , or simple resistance to change .
I expect it would take a pretty big fight to get shows shared that are co-owned by multiple companies or which have extensive licensing contracts , like NHL games .
There needs to be a fundamental shift in thinking about digital distribution before all of these stakeholders realize it ’s a good idea and that ’s one of the reasons that our experiment is so important .
There will be no precedent , no metrics and no business model will ever develop if broadcasters do n’t start somewhere .
What we ’re learning from this could help form the basis of a broader understanding and acceptance of BitTorrent among rights holders .
What do we want out of this ?
This is , for now , a one show experiment .
Our little digital group has hopes that maybe we can form a long term torrent strategy out of what we ’re doing with this , but that ’s blue sky right now .
We ’ve been actively asking people to give us feedback and the response in the blogosphere has been astounding .
We ’re taking note of every suggestion and sharing this information with other departments laterally and vertically in the hopes that CBC ( and all broadcasters ) will do more .
Thanks for your thanks , but …
All the positive comments we ’ve been getting about this project is ammo for us who would like to do it again , but really , it ’s us who should be thanking you .
Thank you for watching our show , blogging about it and downloading it .
Broadcasters owe it to their viewers to meet their demands , not the other way around .

Welcome !
After a long hiatus , I ’ve decided to give the comic another go .
Check out the list on the sidebar for some of the better work from last summer ’s series .
I ’m working off the rust , so bear with me .
Thanks !
At least kids could pretend to code like they see done in the movies .
The Paris based fashion house Louis Vuitton has filed charges against a 26 year old student artist for selling posters and t- shirts of a Darfur victim , holding a designer bag inspired by a Louis Vuitton design .
All of the profits had been going to charity but Louis Vuitton is still demanding massive damages .
The artist , Nadia Plesner , started a campaign to raise awareness of genocide in Darfur , and raise money for the victims .
All the profits she makes from selling the t- shirts and posters go directly to the “ Divest for Darfur ” organization to help the victims .
Nadia told TorrentFreak : “ I started this campaign because of the distorted way the media prioritizes between big and small world news .
How can Paris Hilton make more front covers than the genocide in Darfur ?
So , I “ pimped ” a victim , to see if it worked .
And it did ! ”
Her campaign indeed generated a lot of attention , but not for the right reasons .
For her “ Simple Living ” campaign , Nadia decided to dress - up a Darfur victim with a Louis Vuitton - inspired bag , and a Paris Hilton - style accessory dog .
Louis Vuitton , however , was not amused by Nadia ’s creative expression , and filed a lawsuit where they are claiming over $ 20,000 a day , if she continues with the project .
Nadia received her first letter from the Paris based retailer on February 22th .
Vuitton kindly urged her to quit raising money for the good cause , arguing that it infringes their intellectual property rights .
Nadia was surprised by the letter , and decided to send a reply in which she explained that she did n’t use the exact pattern of a Louis Vuitton bag , and that the drawing simply refers to designer bags in general .
“ Sometimes recognizable objects are needed to express deeper meanings , and in their new form they become more than the objects themselves , they become art , ” Nadia writes in her reply .
“ I therefore stand by my freedom of expression – artistic and / or otherwise – and will continue my Simple Living campaign in order to raise money for the victims of Darfur . ”
Louis Vuitton did not warm to her “ free speech ” argument , and filed a lawsuit on April 15th .
Nadia told us that Louis Vuitton now demands $ 7,500 ( 5,000 Euro ) for each day she continues to sell Simple Life products , $ 7,500 for each day their letter is published on the website and $ 7,500 a day for using the name “ Louis Vuitton ” on her website .
In addition they want her to pay their lawyer costs and $ 15,000 to cover other expenses they have incurred in protecting their ‘ intellectual property ’ .
Initially , the whole issue seemed to be a misunderstanding , as it looked like Nadia was trying to make money from selling the tees and posters .
“ In January I wrote on my website regarding the campaign , that 30 % of the profits are donated to Divest for Darfur .
This is not correct .
It is 30 % of the PRICE which is 100 % of the profits , ” she explained to us .
However , even when the information was corrected , Vuitton did n’t back off .
Intellectual Property expert and lawyer Hans Bousie , who offered to represent Nadia without charge , told TorrentFreak that Nadia could exercise her right to freedom of expression , and her right to artistic freedom in particular .
That is , if the design clearly resembles the original design , otherwise Louis Vuitton wont have a strong case to begin with .
In our opinion , Vuitton is abusing the intellectual property argument .
They simply do not want to be associated with genocide and the darker sides of the world .
This strategy obviously backfired .
We encourage everyone to buy a poster or tee , or at least spread the word about this campaign and Vuitton ’s shocking response .

In his bestselling book , " 1421 : The Year China Discovered America , " British amateur historian Gavin Menzies turns the story of the Europeans ' discovery of America on its ear with a startling idea : Chinese sailors beat Christopher Columbus to the Americas by more than 70 years .
The book has generated controversy within the halls of scholarship .
Anthropologists , archaeologists , historians and linguists alike have debunked much of the evidence that Menzies used to support his notion , which has come to be called the 1421 theory .
But where did Menzies come up with the idea that it was Asians , not Europeans , who first arrived in America from other countries ?
It 's been long held by scholars that it was people from Asia who first set foot in North America , but not in the way that Menzies describes .
Sometime 10,000 years ago or more , people of Asian origination are believed to have crossed over the Bering land bridge from Siberia to what is now Alaska .
From there , they are believed to have spread out over the course of millennia , diverging genetically and populating North and South America .

But Menzies ' 1421 theory supposes much more direct influence from China .
Rather than civilization evolving separately in the Americas and Asia , under the 1421 theory , China was directly involved in governance and trade with the peoples of the Americas with whom they shared their ancestry .
So what evidence does he have to support this notion ?
It 's Menzie 's belief that one merely has to refer to certain maps to see the light .
A full 30 years before Gavin Menzies published his book , Baptist missionary Dr. Hendon M. Harris perused the curiosities in a shop in Taiwan .
It was there he made an amazing discovery : a map that looked to be ancient , written in classical Chinese and depicting what to Harris was clearly North America .
It was a map of Fu Sang , the legendary land of Chinese fable .
Fu Sang is to the Chinese what Atlantis is to the West -- a mythical land that most do n't believe existed , but for which enough tantalizing ( yet vague ) evidence exists to maintain popularity for the idea .
The map the missionary discovered -- which has come to be known as the Harris map -- showed that Fu Sang was located exactly where North America is .
Even more amazingly , some of the features shown on the map of Fu Sang look a lot like geographical anomalies unique to North America , such as the Grand Canyon .
As if the Harris map were n't suggestive enough , other maps have also surfaced .
It 's a specific map that Menzies points to as definitive proof that the Chinese had already explored the world long before the Europeans ever set sail in the age of exploration .
This map , known as the 1418 map -- so called for the date it was supposedly published -- clearly shows all of the world 's oceans , as well as all seven continents , correct in shape and situation .
Even more startling is the map 's accurate depiction of features of North America , including the Potomac River in the Northeast of the present - day United States .
Menzies believes that not only had the Chinese already explored the world before Columbus and other European explorers , but that it was with Chinese maps that the Europeans were able to circumnavigate the globe .
Armed with the map as his flagship evidence , Menzies points out plenty of other artifacts that point to Chinese pre-Columbian occupation in the Americas .

Odysseus and the Siren Call of Reason : The Frankfurt School Critique of Enlightenment
The revised text of a lecture delivered at the Writers House , University of Pennsylvania , October 30th , 1996 as part of the series Theorizing in Particular : Approaches to Cultural Interpretation Curtis Bowman [ OV Editor 's Note : Located at the above address is another lecture by Dr. Bowman .
The lecture , " Kant and the Project of Enlightenment , " is dedicated to Kant and Rousseau and may also be of interest to our readers . ]
Other Voices , v.1 , n.1 ( March 1997 ) Copyright ( c ) 1997 , 2005 by Curtis Bowman , all rights reserved
My intention tonight is to talk about the Frankfurt School  that loose collection of 20th century German thinkers whose philosophical interests center around an interpretation and synthesis of the views of Kant , Hegel , Marx , Nietzsche , and Freud .
And I especially wish to address the topic of enlightenment , since I take this to be the fundamental concern of the Frankfurt School .
( I 'll go on to say why I speak of enlightenment , rather than the Enlightenment .
So do n't be distressed  at least not yet  by this odd - sounding locution . )
To this end I shall focus my attention on a work by Max Horkheimer ( 1895 - 1973 ) and Theodor Adorno ( 1903 - 1969 ) entitled Dialectic of Enlightenment ( originally written in 1944 ; first published in 1947 ) .
Dialectic of Enlightenment is one of the most famous productions of the Frankfurt School , but one can hardly say that its fame is a result of the ease with which its many admirers have read it .
Its terminology is obscure , despite the fact that much of it is drawn from German thinkers whom we might otherwise find comprehensible ; its arguments are convoluted to the point of impenetrability ; its intent is more than a little mysterious , since Horkheimer and Adorno never really bother to tell us what they hope to achieve by means of their book ; and , finally , its structure is simply peculiar .
The book consists of six parts : ( 1 ) an introductory chapter on the concept of enlightenment ; ( 2 ) & ( 3 ) two lengthy digressions on literary works , the first on Homer 's Odyssey and the second on the Marquis de Sade 's Juliette ; ( 4 ) an analysis of what Horkheimer and Adorno famously label the " culture industry , " i.e. , the various mass media of the 20th century , and its effect on contemporary Western society ; ( 5 ) a chapter on anti-Semitism ; and ( 6 ) various notes and drafts about topics related to the ones just mentioned .
Whether these parts are interrelated , that is , whether they are somehow unified and build on one another , or whether they are simply individual essays that form no coherent whole  well , unfortunately , Horkheimer and Adorno say very little about these issues .
This much is obvious , however : the topic of enlightenment is at the heart of the book .
Here we can find the unifying theme of the work , even if we find ourselves unable to bring each part of the work into a coherent and comprehensible whole .
What I want to do tonight is to concentrate on the first two parts of Dialectic of Enlightenment , that is , the introductory chapter on the concept of enlightenment and the material on Homer 's Odyssey .
These seem to me to be the most integrated parts of the book .
Once we get a handle on how they are to be read , the book as a whole becomes clearer , as does the overarching intent of the Frankfurt School .
I will argue that the point of the book is to explore what is sometimes called " the project of enlightenment " as well as to diagnose its failure , as the members of the Frankfurt School see it , to achieve its goal of human liberation .
Yet the unity of the first two parts of Dialectic of Enlightenment is not obvious , despite my maintaining that they make up the most unified sections of the book .
The mystery to be unraveled as we progress is as follows : why does a book about a modern concept like enlightenment ( which means that the book is also to some extent about the epoch known as the age of Enlightenment ) discuss the work of a blind Greek poet from the 8th century B.C. ?
In short : how can Homer 's Odyssey shed light on the project of enlightenment ?
Before beginning to answer these questions , we must digress a bit and examine the philosophical background of the Frankfurt School .
A term like " enlightenment " carries with it a great deal of baggage which must be unpacked if we are to orient ourselves properly .
Most of the members of the Frankfurt School were practitioners of a form of Marxism that came to be known as Western Marxism .
The geographical qualification was intended to separate their views from those of Marxists on the other side of the now dismantled Iron Curtain .
Western Marxism , to summarize it in a single slogan , is Marxism without the proletariat .
While this might sound like an obvious contradiction , there is something plausible about the phrase .
This form of Marxism is more of a moral and political philosophy , understood in a fairly broad sense to include topics like aesthetics and art history , than a political program specifying what is to be done to change the world so as to usher in the hoped - for paradise of a classless society .
The Frankfurt School is usually more interested in understanding the world , using various analytical techniques like Marxism , than in changing the world , although , of course , they would like to change it for the better .
The fundamental value of the Frankfurt School , i.e. , that which they wish to promote by means of their theorizing ( to whatever extent it is possible to promote a change in the real world by means of intellectual efforts ) , is freedom  but freedom understood in a specific way , namely , freedom as autonomy .
It is here that the philosophical background of the Frankfurt School becomes relevant to our discussion .
To understand what the Frankfurt School means by " freedom as autonomy " we must turn to the writings of Immanuel Kant ( 1724-1804 ) .
Kant was , we may say , the philosopher of autonomy of the 18th century .
( Which is not to say that he was the first to be concerned with this topic .
Rousseau exercised a great deal of influence on Kant and helped to turn Kant 's attention to this issue . )
Kant 's ideas transformed our thinking about what it is to be a human being and inaugurated a new era in Western philosophy , influencing everyone who came after him .
Broadly speaking , Kant advocates the idea that we should become autonomous individuals who freely investigate the world in and around us without appeal to external authorities ( whether they be human or divine ) and who live freely by subjecting ourselves to laws of our own creation , and that we are beings whose immeasurable value and dignity lie in our innate capacity for freedom of thought and action .
Autonomy , however , is not something that we possess from birth .
Autonomy is thus for Kant an achievement , but it presupposes that we are already free .
That is , we can be free but not autonomous .
Kant maintains that we are always free in the sense that our actions are not causally determined by the world around us : that is , we have free will .
But to be autonomous is more than to possess free will : it is to be able to choose and set ends for ourselves and to develop the appropriate means to those ends .
Thus it is possible to be free yet not autonomous , a condition which Kant calls heteronomy .
To illustrate this point Kant says that children are free in that they possess a free will that is not necessitated by the events in nature , yet they are not autonomous because they must rely on others , usually their parents , for direction and assistance .
Children are , in a word , immature .
They remain undeveloped and thus have not yet achieved autonomy , i.e. , maturity .
Kant generalizes this condition of childish dependence to humanity as a whole .
To be in this state is to be unenlightened .
This leads Kant  in a famous essay from 1784 entitled " An Answer to the Question : What is Enlightenment ? "  to define enlightenment as follows : Enlightenment is man 's emergence from his self - imposed immaturity .
Immaturity is the inability to use one 's understanding without guidance from another .
This immaturity is self - imposed when its cause lies not in lack of understanding , but in lack of resolve and courage to use it without further guidance from another .
Sapere Aude !
[ Dare to know ! ]
" Have courage to use your own understanding ! "  that is the motto of enlightenment .
( Translation from p. 41 of Perpetual Peace and Other Essays , trans .
and ed. by Ted Humphrey .
Indianapolis : Hackett Publishing Co. , 1983 . )
Note that Kant calls this condition " self - imposed , " which implies that we are responsible for it .
We could always end our immaturity , our dependence on others , if we would only summon up the will to do so .
So , given that we are free , we are responsible , i.e. , morally responsible , for our immaturity .
If we are not autonomous , if we are merely heteronomous , then it is our fault , not someone else 's .
No one else is to blame .
Kant 's definition of enlightenment helps us to formulate the notion of the project of enlightenment more clearly .
Our task is to become enlightened individuals who are truly autonomous , who choose and set ends for themselves and develop the appropriate means to those ends .
Furthermore , we are to do this in a way which respects the freedom of others , and so we are to act in ways that others can rationally consent to , thereby maximizing the amount of freedom in the world .
As Kant sometimes puts it , we are always to treat others as ends and never merely as means .
If fully carried out , this project would transform the world so as to make it unrecognizable to those of us living in the unenlightened era of today .
A world of free individuals who respect and promote not only their own freedom but that of others as well would be a radically different world .
This is the goal of the project of enlightenment .
Kant recognizes that it is an ideal that we should approach without necessarily being able to attain it in full .
Yet it is the highest moral demand made on us , and thus it is to guide all of our actions .
This concern for autonomy is inherited by Marx but is transformed by him into an analysis and critique of social structures which impede our efforts to become autonomous .
As we know , of course , the institution that most occupies his attention is capitalism .
This is no place to go into his critique of capitalism except to say why he criticizes it in the first place .
Marx is sometimes represented , incorrectly I believe , as arguing that capitalism , which he characterizes as a mode of production in which the means of production are privately owned and in which there are two main social classes , i.e. , capitalists and proletarians , is open to criticism because it unfairly distributes the goods which it produces .
Thus communism , on this interpretation , is advocated because it will more fairly distribute these goods .
Marx is certainly concerned about the distribution of goods in capitalist economies , but this is not really the source of his critique .
If it were , then he would simply call for reforming capitalism rather than overthrowing it .
Marx would then really be a social democrat , not a communist .
Instead , his contention is that capitalism and other modes of production based on private property place us in a condition known as alienation , one in which the results of our labors face us as hostile powers and control us and impose their ends on us rather than serve us as means to our ends .
Alienation is always contrasted with autonomy , for the two are understood as being mutually exclusive .
And the Marxist concept of alienation should be understood as Kant 's notion of immaturity writ large at the social level .
A simple example should clarify this abstract discussion .
For Kant and Marx , organized religion  Christianity , for example  is the paradigmatic form of alienation .
Both considered Christianity the product of the human imagination , but not a benign one .
For them , Christianity often functioned as a means of manipulating people in an irrational fashion , sometimes for the benefit of others , sometimes simply to no benefit at all .
The Christian doctrine of original sin , for example , tells us that we are all born sinners and thus may be justly damned to spend eternity in hell unless God bestows
His unmerited grace on us .
Such a doctrine , they thought , has been the source of incalculable misery .
Why many millions of people ever came to believe such a proposition puzzles them .
Furthermore , in some real sense this misery is self - inflicted , making it all the more puzzling .
Since neither Kant nor Marx was a Christian , both believed that Christianity is merely our own creation , but a creation that has turned against its creator so as to oppress him .
It is a form of alienation , the condition in which free beings find themselves when they fail to recognize one of their creations as one of their creations and thus fail to see that they can change the situation in which they find themselves .
This failure to recognize the instrument of our oppression as our own creation is called false consciousness .
The first step in overcoming alienation is to recognize that the source of alienation  in our simple example , Christianity  is our creation .
That is , we are to overcome our false consciousness .
Once we see it as our creation , we can give it up for some other belief , some other circumstance , some other arrangement .
Marx 's critique of capitalism is designed to show us , among other things , that capitalism is not something that we must simply endure because it is somehow perpetual or unavoidable .
Instead , he wants to suggest that it can be replaced by something else  communism , of course  which will better serve us in the pursuit of our ends .
Whether or not this claim is true is a question that I do n't intend to discuss tonight .
Marx was certainly wrong in thinking that communism would inevitably supplant capitalism in accordance with laws of historical inevitability .
Whether or not we should , or even can , replace it with communism is an open question .
So let 's leave it for some other discussion .
( The members of the Frankfurt School do much the same themselves .
They rarely discuss whether or not capitalism will give way to something else . )
What I want to do now is to turn my attention to Dialectic of Enlightenment so that we can see how the Marxist categories of autonomy and alienation ( which are ultimately Kantian , according to my interpretation ) are used in that work .
Doing so will give us greater insight into that work and will help to elucidate the connection between the opening chapter on the concept of enlightenment and the interpretation of Homer 's Odyssey .
One thing to keep in mind when reading Dialectic of Enlightenment is the time period in which it was written , namely , during the height of WW II .
Horkheimer and Adorno had fled Nazi Germany and settled first in New York and then in California .
Since both were not only Marxists but also of Jewish descent , it behooved them to emigrate .
Dialectic of Enlightenment is thus suffused with an atmosphere of gloom and pessimism which reflects the circumstances of its composition .
This fact , however , should not tempt us to regard the book as nothing but a mere reflection of its time .
Instead , we should see the Zeitgeist as motivating its contents , leaving unanswered the question as to their continuing validity .
The book 's opening observation expresses the idea that something has gone horribly wrong with the project of enlightenment .
Horkheimer and Adorno note that enlightenment " has always aimed at liberating men from fear and establishing their sovereignty , " but , they continue , surveying the state of the world in 1944 , that " the fully enlightened earth radiates disaster triumphant " ( 3 ) .
Horkheimer and Adorno had only to look around to see that this was the case .
How did this happen ?
How did we allow ourselves , despite our long dedication to the proposition that freedom is the fundamental value , to degenerate into a state of barbarity , totalitarianism , and warfare ?
What went wrong ?
Dialectic of Enlightenment sets out to answer these questions , though not in ways that we would expect .
There is no historical analysis of , say , Hitler 's or Stalin 's rise to power .
Instead , we are treated to a discussion of two conceptions of reason and the ways in which they have influenced our attitudes towards ourselves and our circumstances .
This method of analysis is extremely abstract , but I think that we can make sense of it .
What they have in mind is something like the following .
The dominant form of reason in an alienated world , according to Horkheimer and Adorno , is what they routinely call instrumental reason .
This is the capacity for selecting the appropriate means to our ends , whatever they happen to be .
That is , we use reason as an instrument to guide us in attaining our ends .
To this type of reason Horkheimer and Adorno contrast another , one which they claim is increasingly rare .
It goes by several names , mostly frequently that of objective reason .
This type of reason is not instrumental , not concerned with the means to our ends , but instead concerns itself with the ends themselves .
It asks whether our ends our rational , whether they express our deepest needs and desires , whether they express our longing for freedom .
Horkheimer and Adorno contend that objective reason has been undermined by the Enlightenment , although it should in fact be used to advance the cause of enlightenment .
Instrumental reason simply conforms to the ends that we have acquired , telling us how to pursue them in the most effective fashion .
Objective reason tells us what our ends should be , and thus it tells us how the world should be , because we are to transform the world in accordance with our rational ends , and thus from how it is into how it should be .
Rather than employing objective reason to discover what our ends should be , Horkheimer and Adorno maintain that our ends are usually imposed on us from without .
( This is what Kant called heteronomy . )
We acquiesce in what others tell us to think and to do , thereby giving up our independence and failing to achieve autonomy .
The first chapter of Dialectic of Enlightenment tells the story of the relationship between instrumental and objective reason as they concern enlightenment ( and by implication , the age of Enlightenment and its aftermath ) .
The goal of enlightenment has always been to free us from fear of nature and to give us power over it .
If nature beats us down , we cannot meaningfully call ourselves free .
Nature opposes us : it subjects us to disease , drought , deluge , cataclysm , and catastrophe .
In other words , it is not sensitive to our needs and demands , for it is independent of and indifferent to us .
We employ reason to control it , to bend it to our ends .
We often succeed in these efforts , but , of course , not always .
Much of nature remains beyond the sphere of our best efforts to dominate it .
What are we to do in this circumstance ?
It is here that the topic of myth enters the story , and it is here that we can begin to look at Horkheimer and Adorno 's reading of the Odyssey .
Myth , according to Horkheimer and Adorno , is an expression of our desire to dominate nature .
The " basic principle of myth " ( 6 ) is anthropomorphism : the inanimate forces of nature are falsely interpreted as superhuman beings much like ourselves .
These beings  the gods , spirits , and demons of ancient mythologies  are open to our influence , however .
We can bargain with them , sacrifice to them , pray to them  all in the effort to enlist them , if only briefly , in helping us to realize our ends .
Nature is seen as hostile to us ( because the superhuman figures of myth are angry with us ) , when it actually has no regard for us whatsoever .
These mythologies are clearly not forms of enlightenment ; rather , they are forms of alienation .
We create these mythologies and are then controlled by them .
Nor do they really help us to control nature : they only give us the illusion of control .
They are hostile powers of our own creation which we fail to recognize as our own creations .
Seeing them as hostile , however , makes us suffer .
Enlightenment , according to Horkheimer and Adorno , has always opposed myth , and the age of Enlightenment , because of its hostility to organized religion , attempted to exchange science for superstition :
" The program of the Enlightenment was the disenchantment of the world ; the dissolution of myths and the substitution of knowledge for fancy " ( 3 ) .
Religion retreats under the pressure of science and the patient investigation of the forces of nature ; imaginary control is replaced by real control .
Enlightenment genuinely makes the world a better place .
Horkheimer and Adorno never deny that it does .
Yet they find themselves in 1944 in an allegedly enlightened world in which disaster is triumphant .
How is this reversal of the initial successes of the age of Enlightenment  somehow perpetrated , they maintain , in the name of enlightenment  to be understood ?
Once again , the answer is abstract .
Any social system , capitalist or otherwise , tends , they argue , to reproduce the conditions necessary for its existence .
This is fairly obvious , for if a form of social organization cannot reproduce itself across time , it will die out .
So any social system will tend to produce subjects who identify with the values which the system embodies .
Thus there is a strong tendency towards conformity in any set of social arrangements .
We can reflect on the values which we accept , and sometimes as a result we exchange them for others .
But this is relatively rare .
Normally , we accept the ends and goals sanctioned by society , and thus simply calculate the means required to attain these ends .
( This says nothing about whether or not these values and ends are somehow the rational or proper ones .
It is simply a claim about how most of us come to adopt them . )
Therefore , we tend to reason instrumentally rather than objectively .
The Enlightenment successfully battled the mythological world in which it found itself , but , say Horkheimer and Adorno , it reverted to myth .
A new mythological world arose : that is , a new form of alienation took the place of the old one .
This follows from the pre-eminence of instrumental reason .
The Enlightenment created new social arrangements , but in time they became as ossified as the old ones because of the conformist tendencies of instrumental reason .
These new arrangements take on an alienated form in that , like the old ones , they are our creations but are not recognized as such , not seen as capable of being changed .
Given that Horkheimer and Adorno are Marxists , these new arrangements are taken to be those of the capitalist mode of production .
The enlightened world becomes a new form of myth because we are just as alienated in it as in the pre-enlightened world , though in a different way this time .
( How , exactly , this sets the stage for the triumphant disaster of 1944 is never entirely clarified in Dialectic of Enlightenment .
More detailed history than that provided in the book would be required to answer this question .
At this time the Frankfurt School tended to see fascism as the logical outcome of capitalism , but later they abandoned this view . )
This is one aspect of the dialectic of enlightenment ( by which I mean a historical process , not the title of the book ) .
Myth changes into enlightenment which reverts to myth .
Some advances are made but certain features of the past are preserved , the chief one in this case being the alienation discussed earlier .
Having come this far in our investigation , we can now return to the question which I posed at the beginning of this lecture : that is , what light does Homer 's Odyssey shed on the project of enlightenment ?
Why do Horkheimer and Adorno discuss it ?
Recall the story of the Odyssey , which , in brief , is as follows .
After ten years of warfare the Greeks defeat the Trojans and return home .
Odysseus and his men set sail for Ithaca , where Odysseus rules as king .
They encounter various perils on the return voyage , many of them in mythological form .
For example , the Cyclops Polyphemus traps and eats several of Odysseus 's men .
Employing the cunning for which he is renowned , Odysseus , the man of many devices , manages to blind Polyphemus and escape with most of his crew .
Polyphemus prays to his father , the god Poseidon , asking that Odysseus return home alone , only after a long delay and many troubles , to find sorrows in his home .
Poseidon grants his prayer , thereby becoming Odysseus 's enemy and the cause of his long journey home .
After further adventures , including the passage by the Sirens and sailing between Scylla and Charybdis , adventures in which his entire crew is killed , Odysseus is shipwrecked on the island of the goddess Calypso , who keeps him as her lover for eight years .
All the while his wife Penelope , who is under intense romantic siege from the suitors who have taken over her home , faithfully waits for Odysseus to return .
Eventually , Calypso releases Odysseus , who sets sail for Ithaca .
Six weeks later he returns in disguise , reunites with his son Telemachus , and the two of them slaughter the suitors .
So , after going off to war twenty years earlier , Odysseus has finally returned home to resume his rightful role as king of Ithaca .
Horkheimer and Adorno claim that Odysseus is " a prototype of the bourgeois individual " ( 43 ) .
Ancient Greek kings are certainly not members of the bourgeoisie as Marx conceived of them , so how can Odysseus be a prototype for them ?
What does he have in common with them ?
What unites the two is Odysseus 's cunning , his most famous trait .
Like the bourgeoisie of the capitalist world , Odysseus employs instrumental reason to advance his self - interest .
This enables him to survive the mythological terrors of the ancient world .
He sacrifices all else that he might desire and value , even his crew , all of whom die on the way back to Ithaca .
And so he escapes the mythological world of his voyage .
Yet what does he return to ?
An enlightened world of freedom and autonomy ?
No , he returns to his kingdom , resuming his place as ruler of his people .
His odyssey is thus a voyage in which  to express a complicated matter in a simple formula 
Odysseus oppressed resumes his place as Odysseus the oppressor .
So instrumental reason can successfully combat myth , but only at the cost of re-establishing a new myth .
One form of alienation is exchanged for another .
This is the dialectic of enlightenment .
Homer 's Odyssey is thus an allegory of the failure of the project of enlightenment , one in which reason in the form of instrumental reason is at sea in the world of myth .
Once it strikes land , by defeating the forces of myth , it takes up again the alienation to which it still conforms ( for it always intended to return to it ) .
Odysseus possesses cunning , but not insight : that which ought not to exist is not seen as illegitimate , and so it is never questioned , much less changed for the better .
Let me conclude with the following observation .
Rationality is one of our chief virtues .
To say that someone 's thoughts or actions are irrational is one of the most damning things that we can say about that person .
Furthermore , no one wants to be irrational ; everyone wants to overcome irrationality , not to fall prey to it .
Enlightenment recognizes this , and admonishes us to be rational , for rationality can set us free ; but if we become complacent and use our reason uncritically , then we are in peril .
This is the Siren call of reason .
For Horkheimer and Adorno the triumphant disaster of 1944 had all the earmarks of rationality in its instrumental form ; but , objectively speaking , it was thoroughly irrational .
More often than not we employ reason uncritically , i.e. , instrumentally , and thus simply reproduce the irrationality around us .
We are tempted by instrumental reason and usually succumb willingly , and thus we collaborate in our own domination .
Odysseus heard the Sirens ' song but withstood it .
The Siren call of reason , however , numbed him into complacency , and simply guided him into returning to an irrational world .
If we are not to be shipwrecked on the shores of irrationality , then , according to Horkheimer and Adorno , we must withstand the Siren call of reason and make the hard journey towards autonomy by thinking for ourselves .
Postscript - February 2005
Because the Internet was new to me eight years ago , I did not expect that much would come of having my lecture published on - line .
To my surprise , though , I received , and continue to receive , emails from readers expressing their gratitude at finding something to help them come to terms with at least a portion of Horkheimer and Adorno 's Dialectic of Enlightenment .
As I continued teaching classes about the Frankfurt School , I developed my ideas about Dialectic of Enlightenment in greater detail .
If I were giving the lecture today , I would have to change some of what I said eight years ago .
In many respects , however , this lecture still represents my thinking about Dialectic of Enlightenment in particular and the Frankfurt School in general .
Nonetheless , a couple of new observations would not be amiss .
First , my discussion of Homer 's Odyssey might mislead readers into thinking that Horkheimer and Adorno dismiss the poem on ideological grounds .
This is not the case .
Clearly , the poem is a supreme work of art .
Were it not , Horkheimer and Adorno would not bother to discuss it .
We might quarrel with the manner in which they connect it to the subject matter of Dialectic of Enlightenment  or at least with my interpretation of how they relate it to their mid-20th century concerns  but their discussion presupposes that the poem captures something of great importance , and thus that the poem merits the lengthy analysis to which they subject it .
Second , the final paragraph of my lecture identifies instrumental reasoning with reasoning uncritically .
This was an unfortunate way of expressing what I wanted to say .
Even within the realm of instrumental reason , we can think critically or uncritically .
Since instrumental reason involves the harnessing of means to our ends , we can choose appropriate or inappropriate means .
If we choose the latter unreflectively , then we are employing instrumental reason in an uncritical fashion .
If we reflect on the most appropriate ways to pursue our ends , then we are reasoning in a critical fashion .
In either case , however , we have yet to reason about our ends .
Only once we reason about the ends that we are pursuing do we employ what my lecture calls objective reason .
This , of course , is what most concerns Horkheimer and Adorno .
For several years I have been toying with the idea of writing a commentary on Dialectic of Enlightenment designed for students who are grappling with this important but obscure work .
The positive response to my lecture helped to convince me that such a book would find an eager audience .
Now that I am working full - time as an independent scholar , and thus am no longer teaching , I have the time to pursue this project .
Interested readers of this lecture can follow my progress by checking my blog from time to time .

10年間泥のように働いて花が咲きましたのぶくまのコメントにこういうのがありました。
経営層がプログラムの品質を度が越えたほどに軽視する理由の
一つが説明されてます。目から鱗です。
年間運用コストが500億円超に上る巨大システムの刷新を進める社会保険庁は8月21日、新システムの基本設計を請け負うベンダーを競争入札により決定した。アクセンチュア、NTTデータ、日立製作所の3社が請け負う。
意外とみんな知らないようなので、「 SI業界の経営層の考えが古い理由」をきちんと説明したいと思います。汎用機あるいは
オフコン の時代は、 COBOL RPG など( 他にもありますが私が経験したものをあげています)の言語が使われていました。昔の言語は、誰が書いても同じようなコードになると思われていました。もっというと、コピペしてちょっと書き換えるという開発スタイルが多かったのです。もちろん現場によって開発スタイルは違うと思いますが、コピペが横行してたんじゃないかなぁ。コピペでの開発なら、そりゃ誰が書いても同じようなコードになるよね。再利用性、保守性より「最初にとりあえず動かすこと」が重要視された。コピペでちょろっと変えて動かすから、とりあえず動くようになるのです。でも、後から仕様変更が入るといろんなコードを直さなければいけないから、コストがかかる。仕様変更が、すっげー悪だとみなされるのは、この辺の事情もあると思います。だから保守の費用が馬鹿高くなってしまうのです。
年間運用コストが500億円超って、今の常識から言うとありえないって気がするでしょう。でも、この数字が、汎用機の世界の保守性の悪さをあらわしているのです。
汎用機の開発現場ですと，プログラミングに付加価値はありません．
それこそ誰でも書ける，と信じて疑われません．
というか，書く人によって生産性に差が出るほど自由度があったりいろんな事ができるわけではないんです．
やれることが固定長のファイルの中身をいじくってDBに突っ込むだけなんです．
という意見も汎用機やオフコンのプログラミングは差別化が難しく価値が低く見られたということを良くあらわしていると思います。
汎用機の後には、クライアントサーバ(C/S)時代が来るわけですが、今の経営層の人たちは、C/S時代を現場で経験していない。多少技術は変わっても汎用機時代の経験がそのまま生かせると信じ込んでいるのです。
実際にC/S以降何が起こったかというと、RAD、オブジェクト指向、Webアプリケーションなどの技術がプログラミングの世界を大きく変えることになりました。プログラミングは高度になり、プログラマの実力によって、生産性は大きく左右されるようになりました。
一方、プログラミングが高度になったことにより、プログラミングを知らずに上流工程はできなくなってしまったのです。
プログラムでできることが増えるということは、より使いやすい機能を提供できる可能性があるということですが、仕様を決める人が何ができるかを正確に知っていないと使いやすいものにはなりません。また、昔の汎用機時代の常識を持ち込んでもらっても困ります。ベースとなる技術が違うのだから。
悲劇はここから始まります。経営層は、時代が大きく変わったことを認識できていないので、「上流工程は自分たちが行い」「下流工程は下請けに任せよう」とします。
ここで、老害による悲劇が起こります。プログラミングを軽視し、若手にプログラミングを教えないのです。
どうも会社では、僕に上流工程を任せようとしているようです。しかしながら僕は、上流工程にはまったく興味がありません。上流工程のほうが付加価値が高いし儲かるということは一応知っているつもりですが、設計をしたり人の調整をしたり、なんていうことは好きでもないし、得意でもないのです。まだ入社して2年目にもなっていないわけですし、もっと実際のコードに触れていたいと強く思うのです。
それにしても、上司は根本的な勘違いをしているような気がしてなりません。上流工程が儲かるのは、それだけ付加価値が高いからです。付加価値が高いということは、それだけ難しい仕事だということです。僕にそんな仕事ができるだなんて、何を間違ったらそんなことを思えるのでしょう。僕は何一つ実績など挙げていないのに、です。
なんてひどい老害でしょうか。プログラミングは大事だと思っている正しい若者を間違った道へと導いているのです。そしてこの間違いが、次の世代へ伝わってしまったら悲惨です。なんて負のスパイラル。
元請けの若手より、下請けのほうがもっと悲惨です。元請けの書いた「どうやって実装するんだこらばか」とおもうような仕様書を実装しなければいけないのだから。
さらに最悪なのが、元請けが「誰が書いても同じようなコードになるべきだ」といって、生産性の低いやり方を押し付けてくることです。詳しくは
「
「誰が書いても同じコード」は大事なことなのかを参照してください。
IT業界の人気がないのは、こうした元請けの老害が下請けにもたらした悲劇が広く知られるようになったためでしょう。
昔はこんなことはなかったと思います。仕様書どおりに実装するのは、あまり難しいことではなかったからです。
こうした構造は、そのままにしておくと何も変わりません。元請けは、下請けに一括請負(最終成果物に対して金を支払うやり方。途中いくらコストがかかろうと元請けには関係ない。)で発注しているので、いいかげんな仕様書に下請けが苦労しても、予想以上にコストがかかったとしても自分たちの収支には関係ありません。だから、仕事のやり方を変えないのです。
元請けの老害を追放できればいいのですが、立場的にそんなことはできないでしょう。追放なんてそんな過激なことではなくて、プログラミングの重要さを経営層が理解できるように、何度も繰り返し伝えることも重要でしょう。
うちの会社もかつては、プログラミングをあまり重要視していませんでしたが、今はその逆です。特に若手にはプログラミングをきっちり身に着けて欲しいと思っています。今年から、研修期間も半年とるようにしました。これは、現場でのOJTを除く期間です。上流工程だけやればいいと考えている新人が毎年いるので、そういう人たちにプログラミングの大切さを伝えることも心がけています。
経営層の考えを変えられないなら、せめて、老害のウィルスが若手に感染しないように、中堅の人は、若手をしっかりガードして欲しい。
根本的な解決策は、ユーザ企業がこういう老害のいるSIerとは契約しないようにすることです。老害のいるSIerは、生産性が悪く高コスト体質なはずなので、ユーザ企業にとってもデメリットが多いはず。ただし、現状の日本は、ちゃんとしたSIerが少ないのも事実。
プログラミングファースト開発のように上流から下流まで自分たちでやるような会社がもっと現れて欲しい。そして、うちの会社もそうなりたいと思う。
追記 :
紙パンチカードのころから、この業界にいた小林さんに聞いてみたら、コピペ文化は、PL/Iを使った汎用機では、なかったそうです。最初、PAD(フローチャートみたいなもの)を紙で書いて、みんなでレビューしてOKになったら、コーディングシートに記述して、パンチしてくれる人に渡すと、パンチする人がマシンに打ち込んで、コンパイルしていたそうです。
その時代の生産性は、紙に文字を書くスピードで決まっていたらしい。
「 これはすごい 」
実際はレビューの時間などがあったので、開発者によって生産性の違いはなかったそうです。
後、社会保険庁のやつは、汎用機はレンタル料が高いので、その値段が大きいのではということです。
Channel 4 is to bring mass public masturbation to the small screen .
The broadcaster - once led by Michael Grade , dubbed " pornographer in chief " by the Daily Mail - has commissioned a documentary about the UK 's first " masturbate - a - thon " as part of a series of programmes dubbed " Wank week " , MediaGuardian.co.uk can reveal .
In what must surely be one of the summer 's more bizarre events , hundreds of people are expected to gather in a hall in central London on August 5 to pleasure themselves in aid of charity .
The organiser of the event , the San Francisco - based Centre for Sex and Culture , has run mass masturbation events in the US for the past five years to raise money for safe sex groups and plans to replicate the formula in the UK .
Cameras from independent production company Zig Zag , which made Essex Boys for ITV1 , will follow the organisers and participants for a 60 - minute film , which has the working title of Wank - a - thon .
It is expected to air on Channel 4 towards the end of the year .
The event will encourage Londoners - both male and female - to sign up sponsors and head to Clerkenwell in order to masturbate in front of hundreds of others .
Zig Zag said in its blurb for the show : " This year it 's time to bring the event across the pond to see if the great British public can embrace mass public masturbation .
It 's time to find out if the only things allowed to be stiff in Britain are upper lips . "
Prizes will be on offer for those who clock up the most orgasms and those who can masturbate the longest - the current record , according to the organisers , is a chafing eight - and - a - half hours .
To qualify for the record , the organisers say " at least 55 minutes of every hour shall be spent self - pleasuring by manual or sex toy stimulation " with participants getting just five minutes to " replenish and renew " .
Two other programmes will also air as part of the week , which has been commissioned by the Channel 4 factual entertainment commissioning editor , Andrew MacKenzie .
" Following on from the success of ' Penis week ' , we feel this is exactly the type of provocative and mischievous programming that Channel 4 should be covering in the 11 pm slot .
Masturbation is something many people do but not many people talk about , " Mr MacKenzie told MediaGuardian.co.uk .
